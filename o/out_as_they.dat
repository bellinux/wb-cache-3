5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most dramatically in the extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E
5|$|The text {{is written}} in gold in Carolingian {{minuscule}} calligraphy, and the gold ink was obtained from an alloy of silver and gold leaf. A few lines or words stand <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are written in rustic capitals. Over time, the parchment has slightly warped, {{and there is a}} fold {{in the middle of the}} document. It is presented in a permanent exhibition of the State Archives of Lower Saxony in a dimly lit room.|$|E
5|$|Limusaurus was {{described}} in a 2009 paper authored by Xu et al. in the journal Nature. The description incorporated data from two subadult specimens found in close association: the holotype, IVPP V 15923, is an almost complete articulated (i.e. with the bones laid <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were in life) skeleton; and the other, IVPP V 15304, is a likewise almost complete articulated specimen, only missing the skull. The second specimen is 15% larger than the holotype. These specimens have also respectively been referred to by the erroneous specimen numbers IVPP V 15924 and IVPP V 16134.|$|E

5|$|The {{offspring}} may {{stay with}} the mother for 13 to 20 months, associating {{with one another and}} feeding on kills together. After weaning, juveniles may form mixed-sex herds; young females may stay back with their mother, but there is hardly any interaction between the mother and daughters. The females in the mixed-sex herd gradually move <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> near sexual maturity. In the Serengeti, average age of independence of 70 observed litters was 17.1 months. Young females had their first litters at the age of about 2.4 years and subsequent litters about 20 months later. The lifespan of wild cheetahs is 14 to 15 years for females; their reproductive cycle typically ends by 12 years of age. Males generally live as long as 10 years.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, X Corps, with the 7th Infantry Division and 1st Marine Division, {{attacked}} Incheon, striking the North Korean army from the rear. The attack routed the surprised North Koreans, and by 19 September, the Eighth Army {{pushed out of}} the Pusan Perimeter and advanced north. The 24th Infantry Division advanced to Songju, then to Seoul. The Army advanced north along {{the west coast of}} Korea through October. By mid-October, the North Korean Army had been almost completely destroyed, and US President Harry S. Truman ordered General MacArthur to advance all units into North Korea as quickly as possible to end the war. The 24th Infantry Division, with the South Korean 1st Infantry Division, moved to the left flank of the advancing Eighth Army, and moved north along Korea's west coast. The 24th Division then moved north to Chongju. On 1 November, the division's 21st Infantry captured Chonggodo, 18 miles from the Yalu River and Korea's border with China. Units of the Eighth Army and X Corps spread <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> attempted to reach the Yalu and complete the conquest of North Korea as quickly as possible.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} he left Maracaibo, Morgan returned. He was told that a Spanish defence squadron, the Armada de Barlovento, {{was waiting for him}} at the narrow passage between the Caribbean and Lake Maracaibo, where the San Carlos de la Barra Fortress was sited. The forces, under the command of Don Alonso del Campo y Espinosa, had 126 cannon with which to attack Morgan, and had re-armed San Carlos de la Barra Fortress. The Spaniards had orders to end piracy in the Caribbean, and {{negotiations}} between Morgan and Espinosa continued for a week. The final offer put by the Spanish commander was for Morgan to leave all their spoils and slave and to return to Jamaica unmolested, but no agreement was reached that would allow Morgan and his men to pass the fleet with their spoils but without attack. Morgan put the Spaniards' offers to his men, who voted instead to fight their way <b>out.</b> <b>As</b> <b>they</b> were heavily outgunned, one privateer suggested that a fire ship aimed at Espinosa's flagship, Magdalen would work.|$|E

In 2006, another fire broke out at the Osbourne's mansion; however, none of the family was at home.|$|E
25|$|The post-1925 new {{quantum theory}} came in two {{different}} formulations. In matrix mechanics, the correspondence principle was built in and was used to construct the theory. In the Schrödinger approach classical behavior is not clear because the waves spread <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> move. Once the Schrödinger equation was given a probabilistic interpretation, Ehrenfest showed that Newton's laws hold on average: the quantum statistical expectation value of the position and momentum obey Newton's laws.|$|E

Larry and Jennifer buy a large Victorian house, then discover that they cannot afford it without additional roommates: Balki and Mary Anne. At midseason, Balki receives a promotion at the Chronicle, drawing a weekly comic strip based on his stuffed sheep, Dimitri. Gorpley and Lydia make occasional appearances throughout the season, but are gradually phased <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> have little relevance to Larry and Balki's new career paths.|$|E

The daily food ration during the trip was 300 grams of bread per person. Criminal groups among the deportees beat the other deportees and stole their food and clothing. The authorities in Tomsk were unfamiliar with urban deportees, and expected trouble from them, so decided {{to send them to}} the most isolated work sites. Two nights after their arrival in Tomsk a disturbance broke <b>out,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> demanded drinking water, which was put down by mounted troops.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that step}} (ii) to (v) is a {{calculation}} of the remainder found after division of (i) by 11. Most programming languages have a modulo operator for this. Attention should be paid on how it is working in the language chosen; i. e. if it is giving back the decimal rest or the integer rest {{in order to get}} proper results. 11 is used as divisor because a container number has 11 letters and digits in total. In step 1 the numbers 11, 22 and 33 are left <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are multiples of the divisor.|$|E

25|$|Ed Joyce's second fifty {{in as many}} matches helped England {{qualify for}} the Super Eights in what was {{essentially}} a play-off match, eliminating 2003 semi-finalists Kenya. Steve Tikolo came in at four after James Anderson had removed both openers, and though he made his 20th half-century, none of his team-mates passed 20. Extras were the second-highest contributor, with six wides and eight no-balls, most of the latter coming from Sajid Mahmood and Andrew Flintoff, who bowled three no-balls each. Flintoff did get Tikolo out with a yorker, while three of Kenya's players were run <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were bowled out on the last ball of the rain-reduced innings.|$|E
25|$|Transport for London {{has made}} a {{significant}} surplus from excess fares deducted for those travelling using PAYG and failing to touch <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> exit stations. According to information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act TfL made £32m from pay as you go cards of which £18m was maximum fares for failing to touch out. Only £803,000 was paid in refunds, showing that whilst customers can apply for a refund, most do not. The oyster online site does not list all penalty fares eligible for refunds on the front page, and users must search for fares charged on a particular day to discover all penalty fares that have been charged. The maximum fares for failing to touch out were introduced late 2006.|$|E
25|$|Extras top-scored with 29 in Argentina's poor {{total of}} 122 against Bangladesh; the Asians {{had no problem}} {{knocking}} off the runs, Raqibul Hasan hitting 47 not <b>out</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> glided to an eight-wicket victory with more than 20 overs in hand. An exciting second match saw Denmark overcome Kenya by one wicket: some tight bowling from Mortensen (3-23) had restricted the Kenyans to 121, and although Denmark fell to 96/9, an unbroken last-wicket stand of 26 saw them through. For East Africa, GR Shariff made 72 and BR Bouri 31, but no-one else passed 7 as Brandes (5-37) wreaked havoc to dismiss them for 140. In reply, Zimbabwe reached 143/0 with 33 overs to spare, with David Houghton scoring 87 not out and Paterson 55 not out.|$|E
