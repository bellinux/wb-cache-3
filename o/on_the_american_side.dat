5|$|Andrzej Tadeusz Bonawentura Kościuszko (Andrew Thaddeus Bonaventure Kosciuszko; February 4 or 12, 1746 – October 15, 1817) was a Polish-Lithuanian {{military}} {{engineer and}} a military leader who became a national hero in Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, and the United States. He fought in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's struggles against Russia and Prussia, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side</b> in the American Revolutionary War.

5|$|From January 12, 1880 to May 12, 1880, Carpenter {{directed}} scouting missions {{into the}} isolated Chinati Mountains bordering the United States with Mexico. The surrounding area <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side</b> {{was the high}} desert of far West Texas. This is where Victorio and other Apaches had been making raids. These scouts helped provide the first reliable maps drawn {{in the areas of}} operation. Finding waterholes and mapping the area was a critical step in Victorio campaign.|$|E

5|$|A French-aligned Haitian general, André Rigaud, had {{instructed}} his forces to attack all foreign shipping within their range of operations. Accordingly, once Experiment and her convoy of merchant ships neared Gonâve, the picaroons attacked them, capturing {{two of the}} American merchant ships before withdrawing. Experiment managed to save the other two ships in her convoy, and escorted them to a friendly port. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side,</b> only {{the captain of the}} schooner Mary was killed. Though the picaroons took heavy losses during this engagement, they remained strong enough to continue wreaking havoc among American shipping in the region. Only after Rigaud was forced out of power by the forces of Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the 1791 Haitian Revolution, did the picaroon attacks cease.|$|E
5|$|I-87 takes a northerly track from US11, {{crossing}} the Great Chazy River and briefly entering the village limits, where it runs past {{a series of}} homes and businesses built up along nearby US9. As both roads head north out of the village, US9 connects to the Northway one last time at exit43, the last interchange on I-87 before the Canadian border. Past the exit, the highway doubles in width, becoming eight lanes wide as it begins to run past the customs facilities <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side</b> of the border. The Northway and I-87 end shortly thereafter at the Canadian border, where the highway continues past the Champlain-St. Bernard de Lacolle Border Crossing into Quebec as A-15.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} caused {{damage to}} the Californian cities of El Centro and Brawley, and in the Mexican city of Mexicali Mexico. There were injuries from the quake {{on both sides of}} the border. The state Office of Emergency Preparedness declared 61 injuries <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side</b> and police claimed that 30 were injured in Mexico. The Red Cross stated that cuts from broken glass, bruises from falling objects, and a few broken bones were reported. California's Interstate 8 developed cracks in it, but vehicles were still able to traverse the highway. The CaliforniaHighwayPatrol warned drivers that use of the road would be at their own risk.|$|E

Both of them led their troops parallel to the US border so that neither their shots, nor those of the town's garrison were likely to cross <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side.</b> In fact, several thousand American civilians had gathered in El Paso in order to watch the struggle as spectators.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, {{and the results}} may have been worse than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself {{to be the best}} bowler <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side</b> and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more {{than anyone else in the}} team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20.|$|E
5|$|King won the Child's Bowling Cup, {{the premier}} award for bowling in American cricket, {{for the first}} time in 1896, and joined the Philadelphian cricket team's tour of England in 1897. The tour was very ambitious, and was {{arranged}} mainly for educational purposes: few of those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side</b> expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897, the tour started on June 7 at Oxford, ending in late July at The Oval almost 2 months later. The schedule included fifteen matches against all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field.|$|E
5|$|Otaku often {{participate}} in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku {{are the subject}} of numerous self-critical works, such as Otaku no Video, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and includes Gainax's own staff as the interviewees. Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as Genshiken and Comic Party. A well-known novel-cum-manga-cum-anime is Welcome to the N.H.K., which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an otaku character include WataMote, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status. Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, Otaku Unite!, focuses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side</b> of the otaku culture.|$|E

5|$|The land {{offensive}} {{began on}} July 25, when 1,300 infantry soldiers led by Major General Nelson A. Miles disembarked {{off the coast}} of Guánica. After controlling the first skirmish, the Americans advanced to Coamo, where they engaged Puerto Rican and Spanish troops in battle. The battle concluded when the allied soldiers retreated after the battle left two dead on their side, and four <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>side.</b> The United States was able to seize control of Fajardo on August 1, but was forced to withdraw on August 5 after a group of 200 Puerto Rican–Spanish soldiers led by Pedro del Pino gained control of the city, while most civilian inhabitants fled to a nearby lighthouse. The Americans encountered larger opposition as they advanced towards the main island's interior. They engaged in two crossfires in Guamani River and Coamo, both of which were inconclusive as the allied soldiers retreated. A battle in San Germán concluded in a similar fashion with the Spanish retreating to Lares.|$|E

40|$|Concentrations of {{dissolved}} (10 nM) in {{the bottom}} waters of the Laptev Sea shelf {{may be attributed to}} either sediment resuspension, sinking of brine or regeneration of DFe in the lower layers. A significant correlation (R 2 = 0. 60) between salinity and DFe is observed. Using d 18 O, salinity, nutrients and total alkalinity data, the main source for the high (> 2 nM) DFe concentrations in the Amundsen and Makarov Basins is identified as (Eurasian) river water, transported with the Transpolar Drift (TPD). <b>On</b> <b>the</b> North <b>American</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> TPD, the DFe concentrations are low (4) above the shelf and low (< 4) off the shelf) ...|$|R
