When households take on credit based on this assumption, life events can easily change indebtedness into over-indebtedness. Such life events include unexpected unemployment, relationship break-up, leaving the parental home, business failure, illness, or home repairs. Over-indebtedness has severe social consequences, such as financial hardship, poor physical and mental health, family stress, stigma, difficulty obtaining employment, exclusion from basic financial services (European Commission, 2009), work accidents and industrial disease, a strain on social relations (Carpentier and Van den Bosch, 2008), absenteeism at work and lack of <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment</b> (Kim et al., 2003), feeling of insecurity, and relational tensions.|$|E

In relation to age and <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment,</b> research shown in the literature found contrasting results when the influence of age on <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment</b> was tested.

40|$|Familiness {{has emerged}} as a central theory in the family {{business}} field yet little research has addressed how familiness impacts non-family employees and organisational performance in large private family firms. This study investigates non-family employee <b>organisational</b> identification and <b>commitment,</b> how these constructs are influenced by familiness and how they contribute to organisation performance in terms of customer service. A questionnaire based survey yielding 354 responses was conducted in a large fourth generation private family business. The multi-level latent variable constructs and their relationships were analysed simultaneously using partial least squares structural equation modelling to determine the relationship significance and scale of influence. Familiness was found to have a significant relationship with non-family employee <b>organisational</b> identification, <b>commitment</b> and customer service. The structural model explained {{a large percentage of the}} latent construct's variance and had strong statistical power, relevance and predictability. Organisational identification emerged as the most important factor in the proposed model as it was most influenced by familiness and displayed the largest effect on customer service. The findings indicate that the higher organisational performance outcomes often attributed to family firms may predominantly be the result of the familiness resources developing stronger emotional attachments and organisational identification in employees.

Additionally, this study attempts to identify significant influences on <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment</b> in the public sector in Saudi Arabia. The selected variables are: personal factors (gender, age, level of education, income, marital status, experience); job characteristics (autonomy, skill variety, task identity, feedback and friendship opportunities); work environment (supervision, co-workers, company identification, physical work conditions and financial rewards). The questionnaire in this study was designed to obtain respondents' views in relation to commitment. It was distributed to 900 employees in the public sector in Saudi Arabia (male and female) at all Saudi ministries. The results of this study have indicated that: 1) The five personal variables (gender, age, nationality, marital status and income) have a negative relationship with <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment,</b> while education has a positive and significant relationship with <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment.</b> Experience has a poor relationship with <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment.</b> 2) Variables related to job characteristics (skill, task identity, friendship opportunity, feedback and autonomy) have a positive relationship with <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment.</b> 3) Work environment variables (company identification, co-workers, physical work conditions and financial rewards) have a positive and significant relationship with <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment</b> but supervision has a negative relationship with <b>organisational</b> <b>commitment.</b> The possible contributing factors to these findings were analysed.
