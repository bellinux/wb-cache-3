50|$|The {{chemical}} {{analysis revealed that}} the rice had retained its vitamins and after the Rice Growers Association did further official analysis for the next nine months, {{it was up to}} the public to accept the Malekized Rice which had been converted to a dry processed rice. The rice retained up to 65 percent of the thiamine (Vitamin B1) of raw brown rice and 80 percent of pantothenic acid and more than double the vitamin content of <b>ordinary</b> polished <b>rice.</b> Malek-Yonan's process of steam pressure-cooking rice in its husks forced the vitamins out of the bran and into the kernel itself. Most importantly, the germs in the end of the kernel that forced the rice to germinate were sterilized. Additionally, the bran oil disintegrated, hardening the kernel surface thus making it virtually disease proof since the weevils could no longer penetrate it.|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} {{effects of}} instant cooked rice made from giant embryo mutant or <b>ordinary</b> normal <b>rice</b> on body weight and lipid profile in high fat-fed mice were investigated. The animals were given experimental diets for seven weeks: normal control (NC), high fat (HF), and HF supplemented with instant normal white (HF-NW), normal brown (HF-NB), giant embryonic white (HF-GW), or giant embryonic brown (HF-GB) rice. The HF group showed markedly higher body weight, body fat, plasma and hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, and atherogenic index relative to NC group. However, instant rice supplementation counteracted this high fat-induced hyperlipidemia through regulation of lipogenesis and adipokine production. The GB rice exhibited greater hypolipidemic and body fat-lowering effects than the GW or NB rice. These findings illustrate that the giant embryo mutant {{may be useful}} as functional biomaterial {{for the development of}} instant rice with strong preventive action against high fat diet-induced hyperlipidemia and obesity...|$|R
40|$|High {{production}} and export subsidies {{in developed countries}} and high protection in both developed and developing countries have distorted rice trade. This study estimates the impact of rice policy distortions on developing countries' rice {{production and}} trade potential. Because rice markets are highly segmented, major rice types are differentiated to estimate the impact of current and likely policy reforms. Analysis in long-grain, high-quality rice focuses on rice import and export markets in Latin America and shows that reduction of direct and implicit export subsidies in the US will benefit regional suppliers such as Argentina and Uruguay. Analysis of Indonesia's import market of <b>ordinary</b> long-grain <b>rice,</b> where protection is high, reveals that tariff hikes in this large importing country are in part a response to increased support from the exporting side. Level of domestic stocks also determines tariff movements. In the short/medium grain rice market, this study focuses on the highly supported and protected rice market in Japan and find that only aggressive rates of increase in import tariff-rate quota and reduction in production subsidies would have significant impact on import volume and price. Prices and trade would also be affected by a reduction of the high over-quota tariff. " from Authors' Abstractexports, subsidies, Rice trade, Rice markets, tariffs, Imports,...|$|R

Modeled by {{the hand of the}} craftsmen, the forms of tò he figurine are drawn from animals, flowers and characters in folk stories such as Tôn Ngộ Không, the Monkey King in Journey to the West. There are seven basic colours of tò he figurines which are green, sea blue, red, purple, yellow, white and black, those colours come from rice powder mixed with food dyes which are used to replace colours from trees or ashes in order to ensure the edibleness of tò he. In the past, tò he was steamed after being kneaded but today the figurines are made directly from preboiled paste so that the craftsman can reduce the time for making one tò he figurine.

30|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, Koshihikari was also {{cultivated}} outside of Japan. In California, USA, Koshihikari was cultivated on about 400  ha in 1991 (Iwata 1992). In New South Wales, Australia, Koshihikari has been cultivated since 1991, and the paddy yield was very high, at about 13.7  t/ha (Ohnishi et al. 1993). Koshihikari is also accepted by Chinese consumers; for example, Koshihikari rice produced in Japan was sold for about 50 times the price of <b>ordinary</b> Chinese <b>rice</b> at a Chinese supermarket in 2007 (Lee et al. 2010, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Website- 2). It has also been produced by organic farming methods in Yu Tai Xian, Shandong Province, China, since 2016. Though people expect high eating quality from Koshihikari in these areas, environmental conditions such as high temperature and low humidity tend to prevent it from achieving the same quality as in Japan (Iwata 1992, Kawamura et al. 1996). Despite these drawbacks, breeding, research, and selection to improve the eating quality of Koshihikari (again, used as the standard of comparison) have been done energetically in China (Lee et al. 2010, Liang et al. 2013, Sun et al. 2006). The high seedling establishment of Koshihikari under both low temperature and deep-sowing conditions prompted the proposal to improve the direct-seeding suitability of Cambodian rice by using Koshihikari (Tong et al. 2007), in spite of its long culm and low resistance to lodging.|$|R

40|$|As food {{insecurity}} persists in developing countries, entomophagy (the consumption of insects) {{can offer a}} nutritious and economical solution. With limited industrial-scale processing technologies available, only whole insects are consumed or used for production of animal feeds. Building upon an extrusion-based fortification technology, we developed an insect flour-fortified rice product, Rizquet (riz-kit), aiming to alleviate {{food insecurity}} and malnutrition issues for developing countries. Specifically, a single-screw, cold-forming extrusion process was adopted due to its low cost and scalability for commercial production. This research utilized both cricket and locust flours due to their high nutritious qualities. Brown/white rice flour {{was used as a}} base binding material alongside tapioca starch due to its gelling and thickening properties. Water was used as a plasticizer to form an extrudable dough mass. Sodium alginate was added as a structural agent that reacts with available calcium ions in the matrix to form a crosslinking network, so to help the extruded rice kernel keep its shape and integrity. The extruded sample was dried and sieved to collect the final product with desirable shape and size. The measurements of water activity and moisture content indicated the fortified rice product had a stable shelf life. Tests on organoleptic and sensory properties suggested the product had acceptable color, appearance, texture, and mouthfeel that are comparable to those of <b>ordinary</b> brown <b>rice.</b> This fortified rice can be also expanded as an effective tool to utilize other natural food resources and to deliver adequate nutrients {{to a wide range of}} consumers...|$|R

Different water pH (3, 4, 6 and 8), temperatures (25 C, 35 C and 45 C), and soaking times (12 and 24 h) were tested. Using the response surface methodology (RSM), the best condition for producing GBR of both varieties was soaking in water with pH 6 and temperature of 35 C for 24 h. It caused a 4 - to 5 -fold increase in gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) content which, together with protein and lipid contents, were highest among treatments. Intermediate levels of thiamine (vitamin B 1) and phytic acid (IP 6) were obtained. In GBR of KDML 105 variety, GABA, vitamin B 1 and IP 6 contents were 16. 48, 0. 526 and 501. 06 mg/ 100 g, respectively, while protein and lipid contents were 10. 50 % and 4. 00 %, respectively. For Chainat 1 variety, GABA, vitamin B 1 and IP 6 contents were 14. 50, 0. 436 and 486. 03 mg/ 100 g, respec-tively, while protein and lipid contents were 9. 80 % and 3. 99 %, respectively. Carbohydrate and amylose contents differed by only less than 12 % among treatments.

40|$|Background: In {{the recent}} years, cases of elderly women {{suffering}} from metabolic {{diseases such as}} dyslipidemias brought about by hormonal imbalance after menopause are continuously increasing. In this regard, a continuous and escalating demand to develop a more functional and highly nutritional food product as an adjunct supplement that can help alleviate these diseases is still being sought. Objective: This study investigated the effects of germinated blackish-purple rice cultivars Keunnunjami, Superjami, and reddish-brown cultivar Superhongmi in the lipid metabolism of ovariectomized Sprague–Dawley rats. Method: The animals were randomly divided into nine groups (n= 5) and were supplemented with either non-germinated or germinated rice for 9 weeks. Then the plasma, liver, and fat samples were collected for the lipid metabolism effects analyses. Results: Animals fed with germinated rice cultivars had improved lipid profile levels relative to the groups supplemented with non-germinated rice cultivars. The germinated rice groups, Keununjami and Superjami in particular, showed a low total cholesterol levels, high levels of high-density lipoproteins-cholesterol, high fecal lipid output, low hepatic lipid values, and low hepatic adipocyte accumulation. There was also {{an increase in the}} rate of lipolysis and decrease in lipogenesis based on the lipid-regulating enzyme activity profiles obtained for the groups that fed on germinated rice. Also, results revealed that pigmented rice cultivars had superior effects in improving the lipid metabolism relative to the non-pigmented normal brown rice variety. Conclusion: Based on the results, this study suggests that germinated pigmented rice consumption can confer better lipid metabolism than <b>ordinary</b> white <b>rice</b> and constitutes as an effective functional food in alleviating the risk of having dyslipidemias like those suffering from menopausal co-morbidities...|$|R
