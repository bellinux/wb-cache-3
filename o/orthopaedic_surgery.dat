40|$|Purpose: This paper {{reviews the}} {{apparatus}} used for deformation of bone fracture fixation plates during <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeries</b> including surgical irons, pliers and bending press tools. This paper extends the review to various machineries in non-medical industries and adopts their suitability to clinics-related applications and also covers {{the evolution of}} orthopaedic bone plates. This review confirms {{that none of the}} studied machineries can be implemented for the deformation of bone fracture fixation plates during <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> In addition, this paper also presents the novel apparatus that are designed from scratch for this specific purpose. Several conceptual designs have been proposed and evaluated recently. It has been found that Computer Numerical Control (CNC) systems are not the golden solution to this problem and one needs to attempt to design the robotic arm system. A new design of robotic arm {{that can be used for}} facilitating <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeries</b> is being completed...|$|R
30|$|The {{publication}} {{and success of}} this consensus document [2] led to the demand for a similar document regarding VTE prophylaxis in the remaining major <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeries,</b> the so-called minor <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeries</b> and <b>orthopaedic</b> trauma. A scarce and low level of evidence is available in literature for those orthopaedic daily life topics. Furthermore, they are only partially and superficially approached in guidelines. This new consensus statement was, therefore, drawn up to provide a comprehensive series of practical and easily applicable advices to further widespread good clinical practice in the field.|$|R
50|$|Shah {{developed}} the ‘OS Needle’ (Orthopaedic Surgeons’ Needle) which can pass through both bone and soft tissue easily so that an orthopaedic surgeon can finish repairing bone and soft tissues quickly. It is claimed that this invention has greatly reduced the surgical time in <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeries.</b>|$|R
25|$|He {{was elected}} surgeon to the King Edward VII Hospital, and later, as an {{acknowledged}} expert in <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgery,</b> he {{was instrumental in}} establishing the Queen Mary Convalescent Auxiliary Hospital for the Limbless at Roehampton, where he oversaw the development of effective artificial limbs {{for the thousands of}} men who had become amputees because of injuries sustained during the war. In 1917 he was awarded the Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath (CB) for this important work.|$|E

25|$|On 22 October 1948, Dr G. V. Allen, the {{principal}} of the Medical College then, unveiled a War Memorial Plaque, In Memoriam, {{in the presence of the}} governor of Singapore, Sir Franklin Gimson. The plaque, inscribed with the names of ten men and a woman, is dedicated to the eleven slain students and was hung in Harrower Hall. Built in 1931, Harrower Hall (now the <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>Surgery</b> Department) was first home to the students' lounge of the Medical School. Over the years, the memorial plaque moved twice before finally resting in the foyer of the College of Medicine Building, close to the burial grounds of the slain students.|$|E

25|$|A {{rotator cuff}} tear {{can be caused}} by the {{weakening}} of the rotator cuff tendons. This weakening {{can be caused by}} age or how often the rotator cuff is used. Adults over the age of 60 are more susceptible to a rotator cuff tear. According to a study in the Journal of <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>Surgery</b> and Traumatology the frequency of rotator cuff tears can increase with age. The study shows the participants that were the ages of 70–90 years old had a rate of rotator cuff tears that were 1 to 5. The participants who were 90+ years old the frequency of a rotator cuff tear jumped to 1 to 3. This study shows that with an increase in age there is also an increase in the probability of a rotator cuff tear.|$|E
25|$|Andrew K. Burroughs (26 May 1953 Beckenham, Kent - 15 March 2014) was a British physician, {{researcher}} and teacher. He is renowned for his wide {{contribution to the}} field of Hepatology; he has been termed one of the greatest hepatologists of our times and the true representative of Dame Sheila Sherlock's legacy. He was awarded the Lyon Jones Senior Scholarship, the Bromley Undergraduate Scholarship, the Robert Grieve Memorial Prize in Anatomy, the Augusta Lipkin Prize in Biochemistry, the George Holt Bronze Medal in Physiology, the J Hill Abram Prize in Medicine, the Henry Briggs Memorial Prize in Obstetrics and Gynaecology and the William James Eastwood Prize in <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>Surgery.</b> After working as a House Surgeon and House Physician at the Walton Hospital in Liverpool, he became a Senior House Office in Medicine at the Broadgreen Hospital of the same city, finally becoming a locum Senior Registrar in Gastroenterology at the Broadgreen Hospital for the last months of 1978.|$|E
500|$|Runcorn's {{hospital}} is Halton General Hospital, which {{is administered by}} the Warrington and Halton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Originally planned as a District General Hospital, it was never large enough to provide a full range of services. Acute medical services have been transferred to Warrington Hospital and Halton General has become a centre for non-emergency surgery and rehabilitation. Although it never had its own accident and emergency department the hospital has a minor injuries unit for basic emergency care. On the same site is the Cheshire and Merseyside NHS Treatment Centre, a purpose-built hospital for <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgery.</b> [...] Halton Haven Hospice is in the Murdishaw area of the town. The body responsible for planning health services in Runcorn, including primary care, is the Halton Clinical Commissioning Group.|$|E

40|$|Health Care Centres are {{institutions}} which, {{because of}} their specificity and character, are particularly exposed to various kinds of risk. One {{of the most important}} and most frequently used methods of risk management is the black spots method. The research material collected for the study comes from one of the hospitals in Wrocław. All hospital stays of the C 22 (Face and Jaw Surgery Ward) and H 05 (Injury and <b>Orthopaedics</b> <b>Surgery</b> Ward) settlement groups (DRG) were analysed - a total of 178 hospitalisations. The black spots method was used in the study, which consisted of risk identification, the ordering of threats and proposals for remedial actions. Using the black spots method, it was possible to identify adverse events that occurred during the hospitalisation of patients with H 05 and C 22 DRGs in the Injury and <b>Orthopaedics</b> <b>Surgery</b> Ward and Facial and Jaw Surgery Ward. In both cases, the treatment costs for patients with complications were higher than for the stays without complications...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} degree of acute pain after major <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 87 patients treated from November 2013 to January 2014. The patients were divided into four groups; Spinal fusion (20 patients), arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (20 patients), hip arthoplasty (20 patients) and total knee arthroplasty (27 patients). Visual analogue scale {{was used to measure}} the degree of acute pain, satisfaction with pain control, and sleep quality. Results: The mean pain VAS score of the first day was highest in spinal fusion group. Spinal fusion showed statistically significantly lower satisfaction with pain control during whole period of evaluation. Sleep quality was significantly lower in spinal fusion group on second, third, sixth postoperative day compared to shoulder arthroscopy group and first to third postoperative day compared to total knee arthroplasty group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Spinal fusion was the most painful surgery in acute postoperative period than other major orthpaedic surgeries. The degree of satisfaction with pain control and sleep quality showed similar pattern. Multimodal pain management strategies should be adopted for different major <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> ? ?: ?? ???? ?? ? ???? ??? ?? ??? ????? ?? ?????. ?? ? ??: 2013 ? 11 ??? 2014 ? 1 ??? ???? ??? ?? ???(20 ?), ???? ???? ???(20 ?), ??? ???(20 ?), ??? ????(27 ?) ??? ???? ???. ?? ? 6 ??? ???? ?? ?? ? ??? ?? ?? ??? ? ??? ?? ??????? ??? ???? ?? ?? ???. ? ?: ? ? 1 ??? ??? ??? ?? ???, ???? ???, ??? ???, ??? ????? ??? ???. ?? ??? ???? ?? ???? ?? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ???? ?????? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?? ???? ???? ???? ????? ? ? ? 2, 3, 6 ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ??????, ??? ????? ????? ? ? ? 1 ??? 3 ???? ? ?? ??? ?? ?????(P< 0. 05). ? ?: ? ? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ????? ?? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ???? ????. ???? ??? ??? ?? ? ? ??? ?? ??? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? ?? ???? ?? ?? ??? ??? ???...|$|R
