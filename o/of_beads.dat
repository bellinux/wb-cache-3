5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered in the store rooms of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use <b>of</b> <b>beads</b> as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a decline in the number <b>of</b> <b>beads</b> recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} classifications <b>of</b> <b>beads</b> {{common to the}} Swahili coastal {{settlements}} {{that have been found}} at Gedi. In his examination <b>of</b> <b>beads</b> found at Gedi and the Limpopo Valley (Mapungubwe), Schofield placed beads into three categories: red, blue, green, and yellow cylinders made from cane glass; smaller black, red, green, yellow, and blue biconical and lenticular beads made from wound glass; and spheres of red, black, and yellow pressed glass. Kirkman similarly created eight classifications <b>of</b> <b>beads.</b> All but 25 of the 558 beads categorized as class 1–3 were made from opaque glass. During his excavations at Gedi, Kirkman recovered 631 beads in six stratigraphic layers. Monochrome yellow, green, and black wound and pressed glass beads formed in melon, biconical, globular, barrel, and cylindrical shapes were the most common styles represented in strata from the fourteenth century and sporadically appeared in later levels. Small drawn cane glass beads are also commonly represented in fourteenth and fifteenth century levels with the colors green, opaque red, yellow, and black occurring more frequently than blue, brown, and red. It is believed that Islamic traders brought the majority of glass beads to East Africa, which were traded across the continent, since there is no evidence for local production or trade south or west of Egypt and Nubia {{with the exception of a}} site in Igbo Olokun Grove at Ile-Ife in southern Nigeria.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The purpose <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> & boxing <b>of</b> an {{impression}} is {{to obtain an}} accurate cast with proper border & base thickness for fabrication <b>of</b> restorations. <b>Beading</b> is {{the protection of the}} formed border thickness of the final impressions & Boxing of {{an impression}} is building up vertical walls around it. Aim: The purpose of this hybrid technique <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> and boxing is to produce a smooth & aesthetically acceptable cast with accurate border thickness using a simple procedure. Materials & Methods: In this hybrid technique <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> and boxing an impression, a uniform layer of modeling wax was applied over the <b>beading</b> <b>of</b> a plaster-pumice mixture around an impression; after that, boxing & pouring of an impression was done to retrieve a cast. Results: Casts obtained by hybrid technique was more accurate in border thickness & more aesthetic in comparison to the cast obtained by wax technique <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> & boxing. Conclusion: <b>Beading</b> and boxing <b>of</b> an impression is done to protect the formed border thickness of an impression, regulate the height & size of the cast, avoid undue trimming of the cast and to eliminate distortion associated with slumping of the gypsum material when an impression is inverted. This hybrid technique <b>of</b> <b>beading</b> and boxing eliminates the need for applying separating media over the <b>beading</b> <b>of</b> a plaster-pumice mixture and by this technique retrieval of the cast from the impression is very easy and quick. The resulted cast will be very neat and clean with accurate thickness of the borders and base of the cast. This technique is suitable for impressions made from almost any type of impression material...|$|R

5|$|Glass beads for {{jewellery}} {{have traditionally}} been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (owayneh) were made for use as amulets since they were considered particularly effective against the evil-eye. In the Museum of Mankind collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the Mandate period or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples <b>of</b> <b>beads</b> of small hands, also called a Hamsa, representing the hand of Fatimah, {{the daughter of the}} prophet Muhammad. Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in Bayt Dajan, a glass bracelet (ghwayshat) made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's trousseau.|$|E

Shiva is depicted with four arms, holding his attributes: the damaru (drum), the aksamala (chain <b>of</b> <b>beads)</b> and the trishul (trident) in three arms. His lower left arm rests on Uma, who is seated on Shiva's lap, embracing him with her right arm while gazing into his face.

5|$|A {{variety of}} jewellery, beads, and charms was also found. 100 beads in total were {{recovered}} from 16 graves, though only two {{had more than}} 10 beads. The small number <b>of</b> <b>beads</b> found in the remaining 14 graves is indicative of how styles had changed; in the 6th century it was customary for women to wear up to 100 relatively plain beads {{at a time in}} the form of necklaces, but by the mid-7th century, the fashion was for a small number of high-quality beads which may have been attached with wire or carried in a bag. A very unusual discovery was made in grave 21– the remnants of a necklace comprising eight beads and two Iron Age gold coins minted by the Corieltauvi tribe of modern Lincolnshire some time between 15–45AD, before the Roman conquest of Britain. Holes had been drilled in the coins, which were more than 600years old {{by the time they were}} buried, to convert them into items of jewellery. Their excellent condition suggests that they had not been used for long, or at all, as currency; it is possible that they had been part of a hoard buried shortly after they were minted and were rediscovered during Saxon times. The discovery of Roman coins in a Saxon grave of this period is unique to the Street House cemetery. It is likely that they were valued because of the cross-shaped designs on the coins' reverse.|$|E
5|$|Burial 48 {{was carved}} from the bedrock under the terrace, upon the central north-south {{axis of the}} North Acopolis {{directly}} under Temple 33; it {{has been identified as}} the tomb of king Siyaj Chan K'awiil II. The remains of the king were flanked those of two juvenile human sacrifices; one of these was a child and one was an adolescent. The walls of the tomb were coated in stucco, onto which were painted hieroglyphs indicating that the tomb was sealed in March 457, a year after the king had died. The king was interred bundled in a seated position and his remains lacked the skull, hands, and femurs. Grave goods included 27 ceramic vessels of mixed of local and imported origin, stone and shell artefacts including a well-used stone metate and accompanying handstone, a large quantity of jade artefacts, including jade discs and hundreds <b>of</b> <b>beads</b> that once formed a semicircular collar, two pairs of earspools and a great many more beads in small groups that did not form a part of the collar. Two obsidian blades also accompanied the burial.|$|E
5|$|Early {{examples}} of Anglo-Saxon art are largely metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional {{items such as}} the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, {{thought to have been}} produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. There is only one known pagan burial in Scotland, at Dalmeny Midlothian, which contains a necklace <b>of</b> <b>beads</b> similar to those found in mid-seventh-century southern England. Other isolated finds include a gold object from Dalmeny, shaped like a truncated pyramid, with filigree and garnet, similar to sword harness mounts found at Sutton Hoo. There is also a bun-shaped loom from Yetholm, Roxburghshire and a ring with an Anglian runic inscription. From eastern Scotland there is a seventh-century sword pommel from Culbin Sands, Moray and the Burghead drinking horn mount. After Christianisation in the seventh century artistic styles in Northumbria, which then reached to the Firth of Forth, interacted with those in Ireland and what is now Scotland {{to become part of the}} common style historians have identified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E
