40|$|Fluid {{flow through}} {{acoustic}} mufflers {{is a complex}} phenomenon that has been investigated for many years due to its importance in compressor efficiency. The intake system of a compressor {{plays an important role}} on the performance of reed type valves of small hermetic refrigeration compressors, especially suction valves designed without an <b>opening</b> <b>limiter.</b> The valve affects directly volumetric and energy losses and may have some influence on the compressor noise level as well. A number of methods have been proposed to analyze gas pulsations in intake and discharge systems. If pulsations are small compared to the mean pressure...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a model of a valve system {{applicable}} for strain and stress prediction. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical and numerical approaches are presented to provide an overview for available methods and prediction accuracy. Findings: An equivalent numerical model of a disc valve system of different complexity was developed and discussed. Research limitations/implications: It is important to provide a model functionality allowing for calculation of disc stacks supported by a coil spring and stack settings having the <b>opening</b> <b>limiter.</b> Disc stack stress and opening characteristics vs. applied pressure may be determined with simplified analytically derived model and full 2 D model including almost all significant forces and moments in a stack of circular plates. An advantage of a simplified disc stack model is possibility of its implementation in an environment supporting matrix operations, e. g. Matlab. Practical implications: A valve system has to withstand the cyclic pressure load across the piston. The number of discs, their diameters and thicknesses directly affect durability of a valve system. Damper force and valve durability expressed in life-cycles are the optimization criteria considering during selection and tuning of a valve system. Originality/value: A new valve system was developed in two versions, i. e. simplified and advanced. The model allows durability prediction at the design stage reducing the testing costs of low-performance valve systems...|$|E
