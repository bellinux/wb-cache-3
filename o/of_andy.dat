According to Scottish transfer regulations the loan deal was invalid, so instead he was swiftly transferred on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee, later revealed by Gunn to have been £25,000.|$|E

5|$|To {{accommodate}} Amy Poehler's pregnancy, {{the first}} six episodes of the third season were filmed immediately after season two wrapped {{so they could be}} saved for a projected September 2010 air date. However, after the episodes were finished, NBC postponed the season premiere until January to accommodate their new series, Outsourced. The third season consisted of several major story arcs, including a complete shutdown of the Pawnee government for budgetary reasons, inspired by the real-life global financial crisis. Other storylines included the parks department's organization of a harvest festival, a romance between Leslie and Ben, and the dating and eventual marriage <b>of</b> <b>Andy</b> Dwyer (Chris Pratt) and April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza).|$|E
5|$|Until 1954, the Scotland {{team was}} managed by a SFA {{selection}} committee. The role of manager was first established in May 1954 with the appointment <b>of</b> <b>Andy</b> Beattie, who took charge on a part-time basis while continuing {{as manager of}} Huddersfield Town. Beattie took the team to the 1954 FIFA World Cup, but the SFA only allowed him to select a travelling party of 13 players. Beattie, who felt this restriction {{made it impossible for}} him to perform his duties well, resigned during the tournament. Scotland were eliminated from the tournament after a 7–0 defeat by Uruguay.|$|E
5|$|Darabont looked {{initially}} {{at some of}} {{his favorite}} actors like Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall for the role <b>of</b> <b>Andy</b> Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role —Hanks due to his starring role in Forrest Gump, and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but refused {{to work for the}} inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob's Ladder. When Robbins was cast he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.|$|E

Harvey’s colleague was Tony Crafter. Harvey also stood in four ODIs played during the inaugural World Series Cup that season, which involved England, Australia and the West Indies. He presided {{in three of the}} round-robin matches, the third of which was between the two visiting teams at the Gabba. It was the only time that Harvey umpired a match at his adopted home ground. He later presided over the first match of the finals series, between the West Indies and England at the MCG. This was his sixth and final appointment at ODI level. Harvey also officiated three Shield matches, Queensland’s tour match against England and one of their domestic one-dayers during the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the visual}} arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century {{movement}} {{in the tradition of}} European naturalism. The realist paintings of Thomas Eakins are now widely celebrated. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene. Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art <b>of</b> <b>Andy</b> Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry. Americans have long been important in the modern artistic medium of photography, with major photographers including Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, and Ansel Adams.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game.

April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to be supportive <b>of</b> <b>Andy</b> no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy by singing one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E

5|$|Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated buddy comedy {{adventure}} film {{produced by}} Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures. The directorial debut of John Lasseter, Toy Story {{was the first}} feature-length computer-animated film and the first feature film produced by Pixar. Taking place {{in a world where}} anthropomorphic toys pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present, the film's plot focuses on the relationship between Woody, an old-fashioned pullstring cowboy doll (voiced by Tom Hanks), and Buzz Lightyear, an astronaut action figure (voiced by Tim Allen), as they evolve from rivals competing for the affections <b>of</b> <b>Andy,</b> their owner, to friends who work together to be reunited with Andy as his family prepares to move to a new home. The screenplay was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow, based on a story by Lasseter, Pete Docter, Stanton and Joe Ranft. The film features music by Randy Newman, and was executive-produced by Steve Jobs and Edwin Catmull.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{returned}} with The Hawk Is Dying (2007), also starring Michael Pitt. It {{tells the story}} of George (played by Paul Giamatti), trying to find meaning in his life by training a wild red-tailed hawk. Williams portrayed Pitt's girlfriend, the only person who understands George's growing obsession. The film earned $7,000 domestically playing at one theater. Five months after giving birth, Williams was back, appearing in The Hottest State, a film by Ethan Hawke, adapted from his 1996 book. Critics panned it for being too pretentious and self-aware. Variety writer Leslie Felperin believed the film underused Williams as a former lover of one of the main characters. It did a limited theatrical run beginning August 24, ultimately grossing $137,340. Williams played Edie Sedgwick, muse <b>of</b> <b>Andy</b> Warhol, {{as a part of the}} biographical ensemble piece I'm Not There, inspired by the musician Bob Dylan.|$|E
5|$|Under the new {{management}} <b>of</b> <b>Andy</b> Hessenthaler, Julian started the 2010–11 season as first choice goalkeeper, {{starting in the}} club's {{first game of the}} season, a 1–1 draw with Cheltenham Town on 7 August 2010. However, similarly to the 2009–10 season, Julian lost his first-team place after a winless run {{at the start of the}} campaign. New signing Lance Cronin impressed in an away draw against Morecambe, and kept Julian out of the first-team for five weeks. After Gillingham's 7–4 away loss at Accrington Stanley, Julian regained his first-team place, playing in a 2–1 home win against Stockport County on 9 October 2010. Julian was part of the side that ended Gillingham's 35 game winless away streak when they won 1–0 against Oxford United at the Kassam Stadium on 20 November 2010, making a number of key saves during the game. He remained as first choice goalkeeper throughout the season as Gillingham finished in eighth position in League Two, narrowly missing out on a play-off place after losing three out of their last four games. Julian made 41 appearances for Gillingham in all competitions during the 2010–11 season, keeping 12 clean sheets. Despite being the club's first choice goalkeeper during the campaign, Julian was told that he no longer featured in the club's plans, and was subsequently released on 11 May 2011. He made 80 appearances in all competitions for Gillingham during the three years he spent at the club.|$|E
