5000|$|Kant {{divides the}} duties imposed by this {{formulation}} into {{two sets of}} two subsets. The first division is between duties we have to ourselves versus duties we have to others. For example, we have an <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> kill ourselves {{as well as an}} <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> kill others. Kant also, however, introduces a distinction between [...] "perfect" [...] and [...] "imperfect" [...] duties, which requires more explanation: ...|$|R
50|$|Thus a thief {{may have}} a {{negative}} <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> steal, and a police officer {{may have a}} negative <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> tackle people - but a police officer tackling the thief easily meets {{the burden of proof}} that he acted justifiably, since his was a breach of a lesser obligation and negated the breach of a greater obligation. Likewise a shopkeeper or other passerby may also meet this burden of proof when tackling the thief. But if any of those individuals pulled a gun and shot the thief for stealing, most modern societies would not accept that the burden of proof had been met. The <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> kill - being universally {{regarded as one of the}} highest, if <b>not</b> the highest <b>obligation</b> - is so much greater than the <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> steal that a breach of the latter does not justify a breach of the former. Most modern societies insist that other, very serious ethical questions need come into play before stealing could justify killing.|$|R

40|$|The {{emergence}} of HIV infection and AIDS has refocused concern on the obligations surrounding the carrying and transmission of communicable diseases. This article asks three related questions: Is there a general duty <b>not</b> <b>to</b> spread contagion? Are there special <b>obligations</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> communicate {{disease in the}} workplace? And does the mode of transmission of the disease affect the ethics of transmission and, if so, how and to what extent? There {{seems to be a}} strong prima facie <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> harm others by making them ill where this is avoidable, and this <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> communicate disease applies as much to relatively trivial diseases like the common cold as it does to HIV disease. The reasonableness of expecting people to live up to this obligation, however, depends on society reciprocating the obligation in the form of providing protection and compensation...|$|R

5000|$|We {{have a moral}} <b>{{obligation}}</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> create unhappy people, and we have {{no moral}} obligation to create happy people. The reason why there is a moral <b>obligation</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> create unhappy people is that we believe the presence of pain is bad for those who are hurt, and the absence of pain is good also when there is no someone who is experiencing this good. By contrast, the reason {{for which there is no}} moral obligation to create happy people is that although the feeling of pleasure would be good for them, the absence of pleasure when they do not come into existence will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.|$|R
