50|$|The {{following}} description {{applies to}} a loam soil and agricultural crops. When a field is flooded, {{it is said}} to be saturated and all available air space is occupied by water. The suction required to draw water into a plant root is zero. As the field drains under the influence of gravity (drained water is called gravitational water or drain-able water), the suction a plant must produce to use such water increases to 1/3 bar. At that point, the soil is said to have reached field capacity, and plants that use the water must produce increasingly higher suction, finally up to 15 bar. At 15 bar suction, the soil water amount is called wilting percent. At that suction the plant cannot sustain its water needs as water is still being lost from the plant by transpiration; the plant's turgidity is lost, and it wilts. The next level, called air-dry, occurs at 1000 bar suction. Finally the <b>oven</b> <b>dry</b> condition is reached at 10,000 bar suction. All water below wilting percentage is called unavailable water.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a systematic analysis}} {{of the effect of}} common acid sulfate soil (ASS) sample pre-treatments (namely freezing, <b>oven</b> <b>drying,</b> and grinding) on chromium-reducible sulfur (SCR) and water-soluble sulfate determinations. The results show that <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> and hand grinding of the samples prior to analysis resulted in a decrease in SCR (i. e. up to 20 % compared to those of frozen samples). This lower SCR value was partly due to the oxidation of sulfides in the oven. For oven-dried ASS materials, more intensive grinding in a ring mill increased SCR values, most likely by abrading coatings from pyrite grains. For oven-dried mineral ASS materials the highest SCR values were obtained with 1 min of ring mill grinding, but for soils with appreciable organic matter (such as peat), 5 min of ring mill grinding gave the highest values. The results indicate that for some ASS materials, <b>oven</b> <b>drying,</b> regardless of the ensuing grinding procedure, results in underestimated SCR values.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{investigates the}} effect of nine physical treatment types comprising a serial combination of three drying (air, freeze and oven) and two comminution (milling and sieving) methods on the quantification of PAH in a soil sample from a former gasworks. Results show that treatment type has {{a significant effect on}} PAH concentration (p⩽ 0. 05). Naphthalene, 1 -methylnaphthalene and 2 -methylnaphthalene concentrations were significantly higher for air drying and freeze drying treatments than for <b>oven</b> <b>drying.</b> It is suggested that naphthalene and similarly volatile PAH losses were greater for <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> due to the application of fanned warm air which is thought to cause volatilisation. Analytical precision was significantly improved for milled samples compared with sieved samples. The reason milling results in greater precision is assigned to the improved solvent extraction efficiency when natural grain size is altered due to crushing. The analytical data were compared to residential generic assessment criteria (GAC) used for risk-based land management. It was shown that the naphthalene GAC was lower than all freeze drying and air drying concentrations but was within the <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> concentration range, illustrating that a false negative could be concluded during risk evaluation is <b>oven</b> <b>dried</b> data were used.

Boiling cottonseed kernels {{in the absence of}} ferrous sulfate greatly improved its nutritive value, however, boiling for 1 hr did not improve the cottonseed as much as mixing it with a cold (17 C) ferrous sulfate solution followed by <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> at 70 C. Sun drying of either cottonseed meats or whole cottonseed (pretreated in a ferrous sulfate solution) was equal to <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> in promoting rat growth. Similar results were obtained when these principles were applied to cottonseed meats used in pig diets; i. e., pigs fed diets containing cottonseed meats pretreated with ferrous sulfate solution followed by either sun or <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> performed as well as those fed the corn-soybean meal control diet.

40|$|The {{experiment}} was investigated {{the effect of}} drying method of spearmint oil content and physicochemical properties. Spearmint samples were dried under different conditions till the weight of herb in each reached 20 %. The treatments were: (i) shade drying under ambient conditions, (ii) sun <b>drying</b> (iii) forced-air <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> at 60 oC, (iv) forced-air drying at 70 oC and (v) forced-air <b>oven</b> <b>drying</b> at 80 oC. Oil was extracted by water distillation according to the technique of the British Pharmacopoeia. Physicochemical properties were determined according to British Standards Institute. Spearmint oil content was significantly higher in shade drying than in sun drying and in forced-air <b>oven</b> <b>drying.</b> Oil content decreased {{with an increase in}} oven temperature. Refractive index and acid value were significantly higher in shade drying, compared with sun drying and decreased with an increase in oven temperature in forced air drying. Ester value of spearmint oil followed a trend, but opposite to that of acid value...|$|R
