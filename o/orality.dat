5|$|Much of Havelock's {{work was}} devoted to {{addressing}} a single thesis: that all of Western thought is informed by a profound shift {{in the kinds of}} ideas available to the human mind at the point that Greek philosophy converted from an oral to a literate form. The idea has been very controversial in classical studies, and has been rejected outright both by many of Havelock's contemporaries and modern classicists. Havelock and his ideas have nonetheless had far-reaching influence, both in classical studies and other academic areas. He and Walter J. Ong (who was himself strongly influenced by Havelock) essentially founded the field that studies transitions from <b>orality</b> to literacy, and Havelock {{has been one of the}} most frequently cited theorists in that field; as an account of communication, his work profoundly affected the media theories of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan. Havelock's influence has spread beyond the study of the classical world to that of analogous transitions in other times and places.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that he was {{becoming}} increasingly vocal and visible in politics, Havelock's scholarly work was moving toward the concerns that would occupy him for the bulk of his career. The first questions he raised about the relationship between literacy and <b>orality</b> in Greece concerned the nature of the historical Socrates, which was a long-debated issue. Havelock's position, drawn from analyses of Xenophon and Aristophanes as well as Plato himself, was that Plato's presentation of his teacher was largely a fiction, and intended to be a transparent one, whose purpose was to represent indirectly Plato's own ideas. He argued vociferously against the idea associated with John Burnet, which still had currency at the time, that the basic model for the theory of forms originated with Socrates. Havelock's argument drew on evidence for a historical change in Greek philosophy; Plato, he argued, was fundamentally writing about the ideas of his present, not of the past. Most earlier work in the field had assumed that, since Plato uses Socrates as his mouthpiece, his own philosophical concerns must have been similar to those debated in the Athens of his youth, when Socrates was his teacher. Havelock's contention that Socrates and Plato belonged to different philosophical eras was the first instance of one that would become central to his work: that a basic shift in the kinds of ideas being discussed by intellectuals, and the methods of discussing them, happened at some point between the end of the fifth century BC and the middle of the fourth.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{examination of}} <b>orality</b> {{in human life}} is Walter J. Ong's <b>Orality</b> and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word (1982). Ong studies the distinguishing characteristics of oral traditions, how oral and written cultures interact and condition one another, and how they ultimately influence human epistemology.|$|E

25|$|The {{novel is}} written in vernacular Malay, a creole used {{throughout}} the Indies for trade. Pangemanann writes fluently, {{but not in a}} literary manner. Wahab Ali suggests that terminology in the novel, including various appeals to the reader and author, indicate a transition from <b>orality</b> to written literature. He notes several techniques, including the aforementioned flashbacks, which are new to the contemporary written Indies literature.|$|E
25|$|Lynne Kelly (born 1951) is an Australian writer, {{researcher}} and science educator. Her academic work focuses {{mainly on the}} study of primary <b>orality,</b> as well as the mnemonic devices used by ancient and modern oral cultures from around the world. She is known for her theory on the purpose of the Stonehenge megalithic, which she believes served as a centre for the transmission of knowledge among Neolithic Britons.|$|E
25|$|Tjerita Si Tjonat, Sato Kepala Penjamoen di Djaman Dahoeloe Kala (also {{known as}} Tjerita Si Tjonat; Perfected Spelling Cerita Si Tjonat) is a 1900 novel {{written by the}} {{journalist}} F.D.J. Pangemanann. One of numerous bandit stories from the contemporary Indies, it follows {{the rise and fall}} of Tjonat, from his first murder at the age of thirteen until his execution some twenty-five years later. The novel's style, according to Malaysian scholar Abdul Wahab Ali, is indicative of a transitional period between <b>orality</b> and written literature. Tjerita Si Tjonat has been adapted to the stage multiple times, and in 1929 a film version was made.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, the book's utility as textual {{scholarship}} {{is limited by}} Havelock's methods. His account of <b>orality</b> is based almost entirely on Homer, but {{the history of the}} Homeric text is not known, which forces Havelock to make claims based on assumptions that cannot fully be tested. Later classicists argue that the poetic nature of Homer's language works against the very arguments Havelock makes about the intellectual nature of oral poetry. What he asserts as a definitive use of language can never be conclusively demonstrated not to be an accident of [...] "metrical convenience." [...] Homerists, like Platonists, found the book to be less than useful for the precise work of their own discipline; many classicists rejected outright Havelock's essential thesis that oral culture predominated through the 5th century. At the same time, though, Havelock's influence, particularly in literary theory, was growing enormously. He is the most cited writer in Walter J. Ong's influential <b>Orality</b> and Literacy other than Ong himself. His work has been cited in studies of <b>orality</b> and literacy in African culture and the implications of modern literacy theory for library science. Preface to Plato has remained continuously in print since its initial publication.|$|E

500|$|While at Toronto, Havelock began formulating {{his theory}} of <b>orality</b> and literacy, {{establishing}} {{the context of a}} later movement at the University interested in the critical study of communication, which Donald F. Theall has called the [...] "Toronto School of Communications." [...] Havelock's work was complemented by that of Harold Innis, who was working on the history of media. The work Havelock and Innis began in the 1930s was the preliminary basis for the influential theories of communication developed by Marshall McLuhan and Edmund Snow Carpenter in the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} Allah jang Palsoe was written, stage {{performances}} were {{heavily influenced by}} <b>orality.</b> Contemporary theatres, such as bangsawan and stamboel, were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it [...] "better to say things as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth". After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories, Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre—inspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes—could be developed. Allah jang Palsoe {{was intended to be}} the first published stage play in this new tradition.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{have been}} tempted to compare Bogdan-Pitești with some {{controversial}} characters in world history, most often the prototype of self-seekers, Alcibiades. Others likened Bogdan-Pitești to the Renaissance writer and notorious blackmailer Pietro Aretino (Zambaccian stresses that, unlike Aretino, Bogdan-Pitești never duped his artists). Comarnescu proposed that Bogdan-Pitești and the equally controversial Arghezi were better understood through the logic of Hinduism ("the ancient Indian ethics"): [...] "good and evil are not opposed, but collocated, combined, {{in a state of}} confusion". Taking in view Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's preference for <b>orality,</b> his shady political connections, and his mostly informal channels of influence, Cernat concluded that, [...] "the necessary changes having been made", one could compare Bogdan-Pitești with Nae Ionescu, a philosopher and far right activist whose career spanned the interwar period, and who had also debuted as a Symbolist.|$|E
500|$|The General in His Labyrinth also {{confronts the}} methods of {{official}} historians by using an oral style of narration. The narration can be considered an oral account {{in that it is}} woven from the verbal interactions of everyday people. Alvarez Borland explains that the advantage of this technique, as discussed by Walter Ong, is that [...] "the <b>orality</b> of any given culture, residing in the unwritten tales of its peoples, possesses a spontaneity and liveliness which is lost once this culture commits its tales to writing." [...] The oral style of narration therefore provides a truthfulness which official history lacks. Alvarez Borland concludes that The General in His Labyrinth suggests new ways of writing the past; it takes account of voices that were never written down as part of official history.|$|E
500|$|Because {{communication}} in ancient society was predominantly oral, {{it can be}} difficult to determine the extent to which regional or local languages continued to be spoken or used for other purposes under Roman rule. Some evidence exists in inscriptions, or in references in Greek and Roman texts to other languages and the need for interpreters. For Punic, Coptic, and Aramaic or Syriac, a significant amount of epigraphy or literature survives. The Celtic languages were widespread throughout much of western Europe, and while the <b>orality</b> of Celtic education left scant written records, Celtic epigraphy is limited in quantity but not rare. The Germanic languages of the Empire have left next to no inscriptions or texts, with the exception of Gothic. Multilingualism contributed to the [...] "cultural triangulation" [...] by means of which an individual who was neither Greek nor Roman might construct an identity through the processes of Romanization and Hellenization.|$|E
500|$|Reading {{has been}} a source of {{entertainment}} for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of <b>orality</b> and oral traditions survive in the form of performance poetry for example. However, they have drastically declined. [...] "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative." [...] The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as fonts were standardised and texts became clearer, [...] "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure". By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.|$|E
2500|$|The term “orality” {{has been}} used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a {{generalised}} fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. Walter J. Ong’s work still serves as a touchstone for the study of <b>orality,</b> and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and [...] the basic <b>orality</b> of language is permanent. In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: [...] ‘primary orality’ and ‘secondary orality’. [...] In his earlier publications Ong uses the terms 'primarily oral culture' and 'secondarily oral culture'. He works with the contrast of primary <b>orality</b> and secondary <b>orality</b> as the way to establish what one thing is by indicating what it is not: Secondary <b>orality</b> is not primary <b>orality.</b> In addition, he refers to 'oral residue' and 'residually oral cultures'. Following his example in coining the terms primary <b>orality</b> and secondary <b>orality,</b> we can refer to residual <b>orality.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Orality</b> {{is thought}} and verbal {{expression}} in societies where the technologies of literacy (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar {{to most of}} the population. [...] The study of <b>orality</b> is closely allied to the study of oral tradition. [...] However, it has broader implications, implicitly touching every aspect of the economics, politics, institutional development, and human development of oral societies. [...] The study of <b>orality</b> has important implications for international development, especially {{as it relates to the}} goal of eradicating poverty, as well as to the process of globalization.|$|E

2500|$|As a result, they {{retained}} the traditional solution: gathering together [...] "mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony", and publicly discussing {{the age of}} the heir with them, until agreement was reached. This hallmark principle of <b>orality,</b> that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the jury system.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1982 book {{mentioned}} above (2nd ed. 2002), Ong sums {{up his own}} work over the previous three decades {{as well as the}} work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary <b>orality</b> he [...] draws on pioneering work by Milman Parry, Albert B. Lord, and Eric A. Havelock. Marshall McLuhan {{was among the first to}} fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the written and printed word as a technology. [...] In his work The Gutenberg Galaxy McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture on pages 104, 129, 146, 159–60, 162–63, 168, 174–76. But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the history of communication – from the invention of speech (primary <b>orality),</b> to pictograms, [...] to the phonetic alphabet, to typography, to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.|$|E
2500|$|Alongside the chivalric, French {{literary}} {{tastes of}} the period were drawn to the amorous and pathetic, especially as depicted in the novels of Spaniards Diego de San Pedro and Juan de Flores, themselves inspired by Boccaccio's Lady Fiammeta and its psychologically insightful portrayal of a woman spurned. [...] This sentimental vein would find admirable expression in parts of Hélisenne de Crenne’s Les Angoisses douloureuses qui procèdent d’amours which blends sentimental and chivalric elements, humanist scholarship, <b>orality</b> and eloquence.|$|E
2500|$|Pāṇini (6th to 4th century BCE) {{mentions}} lipi, the Indian {{word for}} writing scripts in his definitive work on Sanskrit grammar, the Ashtadhyayi. According to Scharfe, the words lipi and libi are {{borrowed from the}} Old Persian dipi, in turn derived from Sumerian dup. Scharfe adds that the best evidence, {{at the time of}} his review, is that no script was used or ever known in India, aside from the Persian-dominated Northwest, before around 300 BCE because Indian tradition [...] "at every occasion stresses the <b>orality</b> of the cultural and literary heritage." ...|$|E
2500|$|An irreligious evolutionist, {{and taking}} an {{interest}} in Buddhist studies, Pogor represented the Positivist cell at Junimea. He {{was also one of}} the first locals to study the work of Henry Thomas Buckle, integrating Bucklean concepts into Junimeas critique of nation building. He supported Romania's Westernization within a conservative framework, tempering nationalist presumptions and valuing a culturally pluralistic society. The notoriously indolent and improvident Pogor had a preference for <b>orality,</b> and was sought after for his Voltairian wit. He left few written works, and many unfulfilled projects, but influenced Romanian literature as a cultural promoter, sponsor, and the first local expert on Charles Baudelaire. He was known to his Junimea colleagues as a one-man [...] "contemporary library".|$|E
2500|$|Traditional Pentecostal worship {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "gestalt made up of prayer, singing, sermon, the operation of the gifts of the Spirit, altar intercession, offering, announcements, testimonies, musical specials, Scripture reading, and occasionally the Lord's supper". Russell P. Spittler identified five values that govern Pentecostal spirituality. The first was individual experience, which emphasizes the Holy Spirit's personal work in the life of the believer. Second was <b>orality,</b> a feature that might explain Pentecostalism's success in evangelizing nonliterate cultures. The third was spontaneity; members of Pentecostal congregations are expected to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, sometimes resulting in unpredictable services. The fourth value governing Pentecostal spirituality was [...] "otherworldliness" [...] or asceticism, which was partly informed by Pentecostal eschatology. The final and fifth value was a commitment to biblical authority, and many of the distinctive practices of Pentecostals are derived from a literal reading of scripture.|$|E

In 2000, YWAM developed a new role of Executive Chairman, which Jim Stier stepped into, and made the presidency a three-year rotating position. However, {{at a meeting in}} 2011 the organization's elders did away with the titles director, chairman, and president, in reference to all leadership roles except at the local level.

2500|$|Physician I. Spielmann {{describes}} Rainer admiringly as a [...] "polyhistor" [...] with [...] "a passionate {{image of}} what truth is". According to a student, the historian of medicine G. Brătescu, Rainer was an outstanding pedagogue and public speaker, whose anatomy lessons were highly inspirational, but whose neglect for his public appearance could alienate young people. As he writes: [...] "After showing us that medical science is one of observation, but that in practice it involves continuous experimentation, and why it {{is more of a}} craft that demands medical instinct, Rainer provided us with the one effective measure to sustain it: uninterrupted self-examination". Vitner also noted Rainer's preference for <b>orality,</b> attributing it to an [...] "extraordinary fear of the written word". Meanwhile, other specialists rejected Rainer's ideas and approach. According to anatomist Victor Papilian (whom Rainer had denounced as a plagiarist), Rainer's was [...] "a sterile and envious school" [...] of self-proclaimed [...] "geniuses". According to Papilian, Rainer moved freely between subjects outside of his competence, including the paleontology of Leonardo da Vinci and the latest discoveries in astronomy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{literature}} of the Renaissance is not monolithic: the royal court, the universities, the general public, the [...] "noblesse de robe", the provincial noble, and the humanist all encountered different influences and developed different tastes. [...] Humanist theater would come slowly to the general public; the old warrior class discovered court etiquette and polished manners only over time; and the extravagance of the Italian-inspired court was frequently criticized by detractors. [...] Literacy itself {{is an important issue}} in the dissemination of the texts of the Renaissance: the culture of the 16th century remains profoundly oral, and the short story, the chivalric novel and Rabelais's works make this <b>orality</b> a central part of their style. Finally, the Renaissance book was a physical and economic object of great scarcity and [...] depending on its size and illustrations [...] of great prestige. [...] A library such as Montaigne's was a rare occurrence for people other than lawyers and members of parliament who had had an elite education in the universities; for the public, the broadsheet or penny press (with woodcut illustrations) sold door to door by colporters would have been their only access to the written word.|$|E
2500|$|According to Walker, while {{feminism}} is incorporated into womanism, {{it is also}} instinctively pro-humankind. The focus of the theology is not on gender inequality, but race and class-based oppression. [...] She sees womanism as a theory/movement {{for the survival of}} the black race; a theory that takes into consideration the experiences of black women, black culture, black myths, spiritual life, and <b>orality.</b> Walker's much cited phrase, [...] "womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender", suggests that {{feminism is}} a component beneath the much larger ideological umbrella of womanism. Walker's definition also holds that womanists are universalists. This philosophy is further invoked by her metaphor of a garden where are all flowers bloom equally. A womanist is committed to the survival of both males and females and desires a world where men and women can coexist, while maintaining their cultural distinctiveness. This inclusion of men provides Black women with an opportunity to address gender oppression without directly attacking men. A third definition provided by Walker pertains to the sexuality of the women portrayed in her review of [...] "Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson". Here, she argues that the best term to describe Rebecca Jackson, a black Shaker who leaves her husband and goes on to live with her white Shaker companion, would be a womanist, because it is a word that affirms the connection to the world, regardless of sexuality. The seemingly contrasting interpretations of womanism given by Walker validates the experiences of African-American women, while promoting a visionary perspective for the world based on said experiences.|$|E
2500|$|Seen by {{literary}} critic Ioan Stanomir as marked by [...] "volubility", and thus contrasting with his famously taciturn and seemingly embittered nature, {{the form of}} Romanian used by Mihail Sadoveanu, particularly in his historical novels, was noted for both its use of archaisms and the inventive approach to the Romanian lexis. Often borrowing plot lines and means of expression from medieval and early modern Moldavian chroniclers such as Ion Neculce and Miron Costin, the author creatively intercalates several local dialects and registers of speech, moving away from a mere imitation of the historical language. Generally third-person narratives, his books often make little or no dialectal difference between the speech used by the story-teller and the character's voices. According to Călinescu, Sadoveanu displays [...] "an enormous capacity of authentic speech", {{similar to that of}} Caragiale and Ion Creangă. The writer himself recorded his fascination with the [...] "eloquence" [...] of rudimentary <b>orality,</b> and in particular with the speech of Rudari Roma he encountered during his travels. Building on observations made by several critics, who generally praised the poetic qualities of Sadoveanu's prose, Crohmălniceanu spoke in detail about the Moldavian novelist's role in reshaping the literary language. This particular contribution was first described early in the 20th century, when Sadoveanu was acclaimed by Titu Maiorescu for having adapted his writing style to the social environment and the circumstances of his narratives. Vianu however notes that Sadoveanu's late writings tend to leave more room for neologisms, mostly present in those parts where the narrator's voice takes distance from the plot.|$|E
2500|$|The tale's {{narrative}} setting has itself {{been subject}} to critical scrutiny. According to literary historian and critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, it is [...] "a projection into the fabulous of the peasant world, captured in its archaic stage, organized in Homeric fashion." [...] The definitive version, which localizes dialectical patterns and bases the interactions between characters on the hierarchies of a village, allows critics to identify the setting as being the writer's native region of Moldavia, and probably even the rural area around Târgu Neamţ. The effect is underlined by Ion Creangă's recourse to <b>orality</b> and its samples of Romanian humor: the narrative technique is enriched by descriptions, dialogue, the narrator's self-interrogation, interjections, jokes, fragments of folk poetry and various other picturesque elements. George Călinescu makes special note of {{the manner in which}} Creangă's narrative relies on peasant speech, and how its nuances serve to distinguish individual characters, all of which, he believes, exists within the framework of [...] "playful realism". George Bădărău sees the writer's [...] "pleasure of recounting , verve and optimism" [...] as instrumental contributions, likening Creangă's style to that of his predecessors François Rabelais and Anton Pann. Among the generic stylistic traits identified by Bădărău is the story's repeated and diverse use of [...] "Homeric" [...] hyperbole, from the presence of supernatural beings to the happy ending's transformation into an eternal feast. Another defining element of the account is the pause for effect, visually marked by the ellipsis and possibly originating from oral tradition, where it may also have allowed narrators to rest their voices. According to French academic Michel Moner, [...] "Harap Alb" [...] is one of the tales illustrating such techniques [...] "to perfection".|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{generation}} colleague, essayist Dan-Silviu Boerescu, Gârbea [...] "cannot {{part with the}} speculative charm of a brain given to bookish games", but closely follows a realistic tradition with his [...] "sarcastic analysis of [...] all everyday weakness." [...] For Boerescu, Gârbea's literature is supported by his sarcasm and his contribution to Romanian humor: [...] "Thin and edgy like a razor, Gârbea's style forgives no one no thing." [...] Soviany also argues that the [...] "rewriting" [...] of texts attempted by the Romanian author is carried by [...] "absurd humor" [...] and [...] "the most unusual (as well as the most hilarious) arrangements of famous characters and quotes". Poet and critic Paul Aretzu writes: [...] "The staple of [...] writing is inventive, farcical, the obvious attribute of intelligence and refinement, also displaying bookish support and being enhanced by zestful language. [...] The tendency of visualizing, of sketching portraits, of detailing/dissecting scenes, of verifying <b>orality,</b> the expressive value of the language, reveal the author's dominant structure as a playwright." [...] The alternation of such stylistic traits reflects in part the writer's own parting with the Optzecişti. The focus on everyday issues prompted Cătălin Ţârlea to view Gârbea's 1990s prose as a revival of neorealism after the Optzecişti experimentalism. Boerescu however believes this verdict to be [...] "only half right", since the writer continued to employ experimental devices long after 1989, while avoiding the [...] "referential ostentation" [...] of other writers. Appreciation of Gârbea's work was also expressed among older critics and Gârbea's own mentors. Nicolae Manolescu held Gârbea's contribution in high esteem, an, in his 2008 synthesis of Romanian literary history, spoke of him as having [...] "indisputably, the fabric of a dramatist".|$|E
