These feral geese reside in the Teifi estuary and valley up as far as Newcastle Emlyn. They also graze on Cardigan Island, and the pond at Gwbert's Cardigan Island Farm Park also attracts geese (the farm has 3 tame geese) where, <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>days,</b> {{there will be a}} flock of over 100 Canada geese.

25|$|An on-site warden at {{the park}} (http://www.chillinghamwildcattle.com) leads small groups on foot to find the Chillingham cattle herd; <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>days</b> they are evident {{in one of the}} easily {{accessible}} meadows, while on rare occasions they can be difficult to find without a fair bit of walking, given the tangled woodlands and the amount of space they have for roaming. Just to the east of the park is the summit of Ros Hill. The cattle are not visible from this viewpoint, which does however give an impressive view over much of north Northumberland. With support from Defra, a network of paths has been created around the periphery of Chillingham Park (http://countrywalks.defra.gov.uk).|$|E

25|$|Advancing {{technology}} {{since the}} mid-2000s led to chasers more commonly targeting less amenable areas (i.e. hilly or forested) {{that were previously}} eschewed when continuous wide visibility was critical. These advancements, particularly in-vehicle weather data such as radar, also led {{to an increase in}} chasing after nightfall. Most chasing remains during daylight hours with active storm intercepting peaking from mid-late afternoon through early-to-mid evening. This is dictated by a chaser's schedule (availability to chase) and by when storms form, which usually is around peak heating during the mid-to-late afternoon but <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>days</b> occurs in early afternoon or even in the morning. An additional advantage of later season storms is that days are considerably longer than in early spring. Morning or early afternoon storms tend to be associated with stronger wind shear and thus most often happen earlier in the spring season or later during the fall season.|$|E
25|$|Storm chasers {{are most}} {{active in the}} spring and early summer, {{particularly}} May and June, across the Great Plains of the United States (extending into Canada) in an area colloquially known as Tornado Alley, with many hundred individuals active <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>days</b> during this period. This coincides with the most consistent tornado days in the most desirable topography of the Great Plains. Not only are the most intense supercells common here, but due to the moisture profile of the atmosphere the storms tend to be more visible than locations farther east where there are also frequent severe thunderstorms. There is a tendency for chases earlier in the year to be farther south, shifting farther north with the jet stream as the season progresses. Storms occurring later in the year tend to be more isolated and slower moving, both of which are also desirable to chasers.|$|E
25|$|Lake Ontario's water {{temperature}} varies due to upwelling of colder water or warmer pools of surface water creating very localized thermal contrast; the deeper {{waters of the}} lake, far from the shore, remain at a near constant {{water temperature}} of , the effect of which is either cooling or warming (in winter). This creates generally warmer nights through the colder season. When offshore winds occur in summer, they warm as they blow toward the lakeshore in the evening; conversely, the cooling effect by the lake is most pronounced on spring afternoons, which affects Toronto even more than other cities on the Great Lakes as during spring onshore east to southeast winds are predominant, <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>days,</b> the temperatures can {{be as much as}} 10°C (18°F) cooler than areas located far enough away from the Lake Ontario, an effect that wanes by summer when the dominant windflow becomes more southwesterly.|$|E

500|$|Philadelphia {{continued}} to grow with immigrants coming from Eastern Europe and Italy, as well as African American migrants from the South. Foreign immigration was briefly interrupted by World War I. [...] The demand for labor for the city's factories, including the new U.S. Naval Yard at Hog Island, which constructed ships, trains, and other items needed in the war effort, helped attract blacks in the Great Migration. In September 1918, cases of the influenza pandemic were reported at the Naval Yard and began to spread.
