50|$|<b>Orthochromatic</b> <b>films</b> {{were first}} {{produced}} by Hermann Wilhelm Vogel in 1873 by adding {{small amounts of}} certain aniline-based dyes to photographic emulsions, which until that time had been sensitive to blue light only.

25|$|Prior to 1921 Weston used an <b>orthochromatic</b> sheet <b>film,</b> {{but when}} {{panchromatic}} film became {{widely available in}} 1921 he switched to it {{for all of his}} work. According to his son Cole, after Agfa Isopan film came out in the 1930s Weston used it for his black-and-white images {{for the rest of his}} life. This film was rated at about ISO 25, but the developing technique Weston used reduced the effective rating to about ISO 12.|$|R
5000|$|Howe's {{earliest}} {{discovery was}} the use of black velvet to make blue eyes show up better on the <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> stock in use until the early 1920s. <b>Orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> was [...] "blue blind"; it was sensitive to blue and green light, which showed as white on the developed film. Reds and yellows were darkened. Faced with the problem of actors' eyes appearing washed out or even stark white on film, Howe developed a technique of mounting a frame swathed with black velvet around his camera so that the reflections darkened the actors' eyes enough for them to appear more natural in the developed film.|$|E
50|$|In her street {{photography}} Blondeau {{would often}} use <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> to make prints. This film {{is clear and}} yields a high contrast. Subtle gray tones and details are lost. This effect provides the viewer with a stark, concentrated reality. Any information gained from the image must be read solely from the highlights and shadows.|$|E
50|$|The {{progression}} of lens design for later emulsions is of practical importance {{when considering the}} use of old lenses, still often used on large-format equipment; a lens designed for <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> may have visible defects with a color emulsion; a lens for panchromatic film will be better but {{not as good as}} later designs.|$|E
50|$|Measures of {{magnitude}} need cautious treatment {{and it is}} extremely important to measure like with like. On early 20th century and older <b>orthochromatic</b> (blue-sensitive) photographic <b>film,</b> the relative brightnesses of the blue supergiant Rigel and the red supergiant Betelgeuse irregular variable star (at maximum) are reversed compared to what human eyes perceive, because this archaic film is more sensitive to blue light {{than it is to}} red light. Magnitudes obtained from this method are known as photographic magnitudes, and are now considered obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of photometers which {{accurately}} measure the brightness of astronomical objects, the apparent magnitude of an object was obtained by taking {{a picture of it}} with a camera. These images, made on <b>orthochromatic</b> photoemulsive <b>film</b> or plates, were more sensitive to the blue end of the visual spectrum than the human eye or modern photometers. As a result, bluer stars have a lower (i.e. brighter) photographic magnitude than their modern visual magnitude, because they appear brighter on the photograph than they do to modern photometers. Conversely, redder stars have a higher (i.e. fainter) photographic magnitude than visual magnitude, because they appear dimmer. For example, the red supergiant star KW Sagittarii has a photographic magnitude of 11.0 to 13.2 but a visual magnitude of about 8.5 to 11. It is also common for star charts to list a blue magnitude (B) such as with S Doradus and WZ Sagittae.|$|R
50|$|Differently sensitised {{materials}} require different safelights. In traditional black-and-white photographic printing, photographic papers normally {{are handled}} under an amber or red safelight, as such papers typically are sensitive only to {{blue and green}} light. <b>Orthochromatic</b> papers and <b>films</b> are also sensitive to yellow light and must be used only with a deep red safelight, not with an amber one. Panchromatic films and papers, nominally sensitive to the entire spectrum, sometimes have a region of minimum in their range of sensitivity that allows the careful use of safelight confined {{to that part of}} the spectrum. For example, Kodak Panalure panchromatic paper is tolerant of limited exposure to light filtered through a Kodak 13 Safelight Filter. Other panchromatic materials must be handled only in total darkness.|$|R

Its name is seen on many colour films of the post-war period.

Smart and Charles Parkhouse.|$|E

50|$|As the {{quantity}} of film and filmmakers grew, the demand for standardization increased. Between 1900 and 1910, film formats gradually became standardized and film stocks improved. A number of film gauges were made. Eastman increased the length of rolls to 200 feet without major adjustments to the emulsion, retaining a large market share. Lumiere reformulated its stock to match the speed of Eastman film, naming it 'Etiquette Violette' (Violet Label). Blair sold his English company to Pathé in 1907 and retired to the US. Pathe began to supplement its operation in 1910 by purchasing film prints, stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it. 35mm film began to become the dominant gauge because of the popularity of Edison's and Lumière's cameras. Consumers usually purchased unperforated film and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise, causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format. In 1908, the perforators began {{to be made by}} Bell and Howell. Eastman Kodak used the Bell and Howell's machine to perforate its films. In 1909, Edison's organization of the Motion Picture Patents Trust agreed to what would become the standard: 35 mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.33 aspect ratio.Agfa began to produce motion picture film in 1913, but remained a largely local supplier until World War I boycotts of popular French, American and Italian film stocks allowed the UFA film studio to flourish, boosting Agfa's orders. All film stocks were manufactured on a nitrate film base, which is highly flammable. Nitrate film fires were difficult to extinguish. A significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths, where the heat of the projector lamp made ignition most likely. Amateur filmmaking (home movies) slowly developed during this period. Kodak developed a heat-resistant 'safety base' for home projection. In 1909, tests showed cellulose diacetate to be a viable replacement base, and Kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in 22 mm widths for Edison's work on the Home Kinetoscope, which was commercially released in 1912. Eastman Kodak introduced a non-inflammable 35 mm film stock in 1909. The plasticizers used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. In 1911 the major American film studios returned to using nitrate stock. More amateur formats began to use acetate based film, and several, including Kodak's own 16 mm format, were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base. Kodak released Cine Negative Film Type E in 1916 and Type F (later known as Negative Film Par Speed Type 1201) in 1917. As both of these <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>films</b> were no faster than previous offerings; the improvements were in granularity and sharpness.|$|R
50|$|Moana {{is thought}} to be the first feature film made with {{panchromatic}} black-and-white film rather than the <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> commonly used at the time in Hollywood feature films. Flaherty developed his film as he went along, in a cave on Savai'i. In the process, he inadvertently poisoned himself and required treatment after he drank water from the cave that contained silver nitrate, which washed off the film stock. The silver nitrate also caused spots to form on the negative.|$|E
50|$|Although Barbara Blondeau’s Photographic {{career was}} short, {{spanning}} {{less than ten}} years, it was productive. She experimented with color printing, multiple exposure, <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film,</b> and contact printing. She was interested in exploring the natural world and reassembling the information into an artificial reality. In her color work, the color is never natural. In many prints Magenta is a prominent color. The human figure is also a main character in her work and Blondeau strived to abstract it in many different ways.|$|E
50|$|The process {{began in}} the 1890s, {{originally}} as a copy-guard against film pirates. The film was tinted amber, {{the color of the}} safelight on film printers. The discovery of bleaching methods by pirates soon put an end to this. Both the Edison Studios and the Biograph Company began tinting their films for setting moods. Because <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> stock could not be used in low-light situations, blue became the most popular tint, applied to scenes shot during the day and when projected, signified night.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company had}} a {{reputation}} for producing excellent quality lenses and durable quality cameras including models such as the Wrayflex. Many Wray lenses remain in use, especially in photographic enlargers.Wray also made aerial reconnaissance lenses. Their 36" [...] f/6.3 is particularly good but has some residual spherical aberration at full aperture. They also made a highly distortion-free 36" [...] f/4 for mapping. This can only be used with an orange filter and <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> to avoid the residual secondary spectrum (chromatic aberration).|$|E
5000|$|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine was {{the second}} film on which cinematographer James Wong Howe earned his {{reputation}} leading him {{to become one of}} the most sought cinematographer of the era.

With the success evident in Howe's work, especially in lighting, [...] "every blue-eyed actor and actress wanted him as their photographer.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{emulsions}} {{and development}} processes exist {{for a variety}} of image recording possibilities: the two most common of which are black and white, and color. However, there are also variant types, such as infrared film (in black and white or false color); specialist technical films, such as those used for X-rays; and obsolete processes, such as <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film.</b> Generally, however, the vast majority of stock used today is [...] "normal" [...] (visible spectrum) color, although [...] "normal" [...] black and white also commands a significant minority percentage.|$|E
5000|$|The old <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> {{stock of}} the early days was less discriminating about a person's color, as were black and white stocks in general, {{permitting}} some African-American actors a break, as their [...] "color" [...] was washed out or less obvious when photographed in black and white. As late as the early 1960s, {{there were very few}} African-American members of the Screen Actors Guild. Since {{there was a lack of}} opportunity for them as black performers, they were confined mostly to race films until the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> {{remained}} dominant {{until the}} mid-1920s due to Kodak's lack {{of competition in}} the panchromatic market. In 1925, Gevaert introduced an orthochromatic stock with limited color sensitivity and a fully panchromatic stock, Pan-23. In 1926, Kodak lowered the price of panchromatic stock to parity with its orthochromatic offering and the panchromatic stock began to overtake the orthochromatic stock's market share within a few years. Similar panchromatic film stocks were manufactured by Agfa and Pathé, the shift to panchromatic stocks had largely been completed by 1928, and Kodak discontinued orthochromatic stock in 1930.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of sound-on-film {{led to the}} replacement of the old noisy carbon lights with tungsten lights, which were much hotter and created a softer light. At the same time the <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film,</b> which until that time had been used by the industry, was replaced by super-sensitive faster Panchromatic film which noticeably darkened skin colors. These developments required six months of intensive development to create make-up compatible with the new environment. Because they had been designed for black and white film the existing products were unsuitable for everyday use. This new Panchromatic make-up was trademarked in October 1929.|$|E
5000|$|In an 1884 article, Rau {{stated that}} he {{preferred}} cameras with Euryscope lenses and cherry or mahogany cases, oxalate-developed plates, and a Loring finder (for capturing moving subjects). His photographs were typically sold as stereo cards or lantern slides, the latter of which Rau described as the most [...] "pleasurable" [...] branch of photography. For his railroad company panoramics, he used a modified Moessard camera with a Ross 15 in portable symmetrical lens, 18 in <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film,</b> and a rail car equipped with a darkroom and developing facilities. [...] He printed many of his railroad company photographs on albumen paper to evoke an earlier era, as most photographers had abandoned albumen by the 1890s.|$|E
50|$|Adhesive {{was then}} {{applied to the}} back side of these strips, either by {{applying}} rubber cement with a brush or passing them through a machine that would apply a wax adhesive. The adhesives were intentionally made semi-permanent, allowing the strips to be removed and moved around the layout if it needed to be changed. The strips would be adhered to a board, usually a stiff white paper on which the artist would draw the publication's margins and columns, either lightly in pencil or in non-photographic blue ink, a light cyan color that would be ignored by the <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> used to make printing plates in offset lithography. For magazines, newspapers, and other recurring projects, often the boards would be pre-printed in this color.|$|E
50|$|The unlikable, stern {{schoolmaster}} Ichabod Crane, who at {{one point}} beats a student, was played by Rogers, a popular actor playing against his typical roles for which he received $19,583.20. For authenticity, filming {{took place in the}} Hudson River Valley around Tarrytown, New York, the setting of Washington Irving's story, with its Dutch farm houses and covered bridges. The Headless Horseman was the first black-and-white feature film photographed entirely on panchromatic stock, which, while two to three times more expensive, did not have the tendency to turn blue eyes and skies white and lipstick as black like the commonly used <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> did. One effective special effect was the use of a double exposure to give the headless horseman a phantom-like appearance.|$|E
50|$|In digital photography, {{monochrome}} is {{the capture}} of only shades of black by the sensor, or by post-processing a color image to present only the perceived brightness by combining the values of multiple channels (usually red, blue, and green). The weighting of individual channels may be selected to achieve a desired artistic effect; if only the red channel is selected by the weighting then the effect will be {{similar to that of}} using a red filter on panchromatic film. If the red channel is eliminated and the green and blue combined then the effect will be similar to that of <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> or the use of a cyan filter on panchromatic film. The selection of weighting thus allows a wide range of artistic expression in the final monochromatic image.|$|E
50|$|Colored {{filters are}} {{commonly}} used {{in black and white}} photography to alter the effect of different colors in the scene, changing contrast recorded in black and white of the different colours. For example, a yellow or, more dramatically, orange or red, filter will enhance the contrast between clouds and sky by darkening the blue sky. A deep green filter will also darken the sky, and additionally lighten green foliage, making it stand out against the sky. A blue filter mimics the effect of older <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film,</b> or even older film sensitive only to blue light, rendering blue as light and red and green as dark, showing blue skies as overcast with no contrast between sky and clouds, darkening blond hair, making blue eyes nearly white and red lips nearly black. Diffusion filters reduce contrast in addition to softening resolution.|$|E
50|$|The {{light was}} {{obtained}} from a carbon arc light, entering the darkroom through a slit. Then it was filtered through a prism, discarding most of the red side of the spectrum. An achromatic lens focused an 8mm-wide, slightly converging light beam. 220mm after the lens, the light hit a polished silver mirror perpendicularly. Monochromatic light {{would result in a}} uniform wavelength, hence a regular standing waves pattern, parallel to the mirror's surface. Wiener's <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> was transparently thin, about 20 nm, measured by interference, which is much less than the wavelength (the sodium doublet is at about 589 nm). It was laid on the mirror, over an equally thin slice of gel. That way, by applying pressure {{on one side of the}} film only, Wiener could slightly tilt it so as to make it traverse several standing waves. The standing waves were revealed by exposing the film for 20~35 minutes, after development and printing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> proved {{troublesome}} for motion pictures, rendering pink skies as perpetually overcast, {{blond hair}} as washed-out, blue eyes nearly white, and red lips nearly black. To some degree {{this could be}} corrected by makeup, lens filters, and lighting, but never completely satisfactorily. But even those solutions were unusable for additive color motion picture systems like Kinemacolor and Prizma color, which photographed on black-and-white stock behind alternating color filters. In those cases, negative film stock after it arrived from the manufacturer had to be passed through a color-sensitizing solution, a time-consuming process that increased the film's cost from 3 cents per foot to 7 cents. Eastman Kodak, the supplier of motion picture film, introduced a panchromatic film stock in September 1913, available on special order for photographing color motion pictures in additive systems. Cameramen began using it for black-and-white films too in 1918, primarily for outdoor scenes. The company introduced Kodak Panchromatic Cine Film as a regular stock in 1922. The first black-and-white feature film photographed entirely on panchromatic stock was The Headless Horseman (1922). But panchromatic stock was more expensive, and not until the prices were equalized by competition in 1926 did it become used more widely than orthochromatic stock. Kodak discontinued manufacturing general-purpose orthochromatic motion picture film in 1930.|$|E
50|$|A {{panchromatic}} emulsion produces a realistic reproduction {{of a scene}} as it appears to the human eye. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic, but some types are orthochromatic and are not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide emulsions are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic. However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Panchromatic stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906. The switch from <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film,</b> however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost {{two to three times}} as much, and had to be developed in darkness, unlike orthochromatic—which, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages #-#) As an artist, {{one of my}} interests {{has been}} the observation and documentation through photographs of textures and surfaces. This interest has often brought me to photograph walls because they are rich and varied in texture. In the course of photographing these walls, I became increasingly aware of the great variety of man-made marks on them, from elaborate murals to simple graffiti. Rather than making traditional silver prints, I decided to transfer the images to commercially prepared photo-sensitive zinc plates from which I could then achieve an intaglio print {{in an attempt to}} enrich and interpret, as well as record, the aesthetically interesting surfaces. I was content with this activity until the energy of the graffiti seemed to compel me to become more personally involved in a creative and participatory manner with these surfaces. All of the images were photographed with a 35 mm camera on black and white film (usually Kodak Plus X). The selected images were then transferred by use of an enlarger from the 35 mm negatives to 9 " x 12 " sheets of Kodak Autoscreen film (an <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film</b> with a 133 dot per line halftone built into the emulsion) producing a positive halftone image.

40|$|When {{preparing}} {{a revision of}} the genus Babylonia for "Indo-Pacific Mollusca", edited by Dr. R. Tucker Abbott, we tried ultraviolet light to see {{the outline of the}} colour-pattern of some fossil species. Later on we saw the same method described by Mrs. Katherine Krueger (1971). Dr. H. E. Coomans of the Institute for Taxonomic Zoology (Zoological Museum), Amsterdam, called our attention to this method. We used an ultraviolet lamp UVSL- 15 of Ultra-Violet Products Inc., San Gabriel, California. Mr. Chr. Hoorn, photographer of our museum, found a method to photograph the normally invisible pattern. He used an <b>orthochromatic</b> <b>film,</b> Copex Ortho, Agfa-Gevaert, 120 din, in combination with a yellow filter. After having found a suitable specimen by previous examination with the lamp in a dark room, that shell was exposed to short and long wave ultraviolet together from four sides, each time during five minutes. As this resulted in some good photographs, these will be published here. We first show a recent and a fossil specimen of Babylonia spirata (L.) (pl. 1 figs. 1, 2). The recent one is from the Bay of Djakarta; the other is from the Young Neogene at Benkulen, Sumatra. There is general conformity in the colour-pattern of these two specimens, but also some differences are apparent. The spots along the sutural canal are relatively large in the fossil specimen and the other spots are conspicuously rounded and rather constant in size. The recent B. spirata, however, shows a great variability in the colour-pattern. The figured shell is the one in our collection which comes nearest to the fossil specimen.
