40|$|The {{introductory}} {{management information}} systems (MIS) {{course is a}} core course for all business majors at almost every business school. It is common for <b>this</b> <b>course</b> to have multiple sections taught by a mixed group of instructors each semester. Hence, consistent pedagogy and assessment are needed for multiple sections <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>course.</b> <b>This</b> paper reports a pedagogical study <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>course</b> to address <b>this</b> concern. The study started with a literature review. Surprisingly, regardless of the commonality and importance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>course</b> in business education and the rich literature about information technology education for business majors, few articles in the literature have discussed integrated pedagogy and assessment design beyond teaching techniques for <b>this</b> <b>course.</b> Using the general content analysis methodology, the study analyzed IS 2002 Model Curriculum and Guidelines as well as 37 online <b>course</b> syllabi <b>of</b> introductory MIS <b>courses</b> offered in AACSB accredited business schools, and identified major components of the introductory MIS course. It revealed important facts {{with regards to the}} practices <b>of</b> teaching <b>this</b> <b>course</b> in the AACSB accredited business schools.

25|$|When {{topology}} {{is routinely}} {{described in terms}} of properties invariant under homeomorphism, one can see the underlying idea in operation. The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases – and not Lie groups – but the philosophy is the same. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>this</b> mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by H.S.M. Coxeter routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help 'place' geometries. In pedagogic terms, the program became transformation geometry, a mixed blessing {{in the sense that it}} builds on stronger intuitions than the style of Euclid, but is less easily converted into a logical system.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable.

With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E

25|$|In medieval England, {{the penalty}} for {{a vast number of}} serious crimes, {{including}} murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. If the jury has only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty is death, or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished somehow, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>this</b> meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} PID controllers were used and today are still {{used in the}} simpler DP systems. But modern controllers use a mathematical model of the ship {{that is based on}} a hydrodynamic and aerodynamic description concerning some of the ship's characteristics such as mass and drag. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>this</b> model is not entirely correct. The ship's position and heading are fed into the system and compared with the prediction made by the model. This difference is used to update the model by using Kalman filtering technique. For this reason, the model also has input from the wind sensors and feedback from the thrusters. This method even allows not having input from any PRS for some time, depending {{on the quality of the}} model and the weather. This process is known as dead reckoning.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} may be taken that we owe the sailors' working song as we now possess it to the Americans. How far do these songs date back?

It is {{noteworthy}} that the old voyagers do not hint at the sailors singing out or encouraging their efforts by choruses when at work. In the navy, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>this</b> sort of song was never permitted. Work proceeded to the strains of a fiddle, to the piping of the boatswain and his mates, or in earlier times yet, to the trumpet. The working song then is peculiar to the Merchant Service, but one may hunt through the old chronicles without encountering a suggestion of its existence prior to American independence and to the establishment of a Yankee marine.|$|E
