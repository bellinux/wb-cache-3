25|$|Obama's {{campaign}} organization {{responded with}} a letter from Christian leaders vouching for his Christian faith, {{as well as with}} appeals to supporters to help correct any misunderstanding. From November 2007 to January 2008, as part of a drive to promote awareness of his Christian faith, Obama gave interviews to Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, to Christianity Today and to the religious website Beliefnet.com. Nevertheless, the false belief that <b>Obama</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Muslim has persisted in some key demographics and is among the most frequently cited reasons for opposition to Obama in public polling.
