25|$|The {{earliest}} form of {{a company}} which issued public shares {{was the case of}} the publicani during the Roman Republic. Like modern joint-stock companies, the publicani were legal bodies independent of their members whose ownership was divided into shares, or partes. There is evidence that these shares were sold to public investors and traded in a type of <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>market</b> in the Forum, near the Temple of Castor and Pollux. The shares fluctuated in value, encouraging the activity of speculators, or quaestors. Mere evidence remains of the prices for which partes were sold, the nature of initial public offerings, or a description of stock market behavior. Publicani lost favor with the fall of the Republic {{and the rise of the}} Empire.|$|E

Due to London's dominance in the market, a particular currency's quoted price is usually the London market price.

2500|$|To hedge the {{counterparty}} risk of entering a CDS transaction, one practice {{is to buy}} CDS protection on one's counterparty. [...] The positions are marked-to-market daily and collateral pass from buyer to seller or vice versa to protect both parties against counterparty default, but money does not always change hands due to the offset of gains and losses by those who had both bought and sold protection.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of the nationwide telephone network following the expi-ration of the Bell patents in 1894, along with expansion of private wire telegraph networks, created the “nerve center ” necessary for rapid growth in the decentral-ized, dealer-intermediated, <b>over-the-counter</b> security <b>markets.</b> Using member-ship roles from the National Quotation Bureau—the predecessor of the NASDAQ—I link {{growth in the number}} of dealers to the expansion of these communication networks prior to World War I.

40|$|In this Article, I propose an {{implementation}} of the Volcker Rule that balances the statutory mandate to promote the safety and soundness of U.

S. banks and their affiliates subject to exemptions for traditional banking activities and certain “client-oriented” activities. This Article draws upon the academic literature regarding expressive law, the history of federal banking legislation, and {{the text of the}} Dodd-Frank Act to argue that federal financial regulators have the discretion to implement the Rule’s exemption for “market-making-related activities” to realize synergies with Dodd-Frank’s initiatives in the regulation of <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>markets.</b> Specifically, I envision that the market making exemption could be implemented with a view to encouraging the provision of liquidity to competitive trading facilities.
