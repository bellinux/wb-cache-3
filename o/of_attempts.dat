5|$|Around {{the year}} 2000, {{there was a}} wave <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> to dope {{synthetic}} CVD diamond films by sulfur aiming at n-type conductivity with low activation energy. Successful reports have been published, but then dismissed as the conductivity was rendered p-type instead of n-type and associated not with sulfur, but with residual boron, which is a highly efficient p-type dopant in diamond.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} a small number <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> to resurrect the Restoration {{spectacular}} as a background to modern cinema: Terry Gilliam's The Adventures of Baron Munchausen features at its start perhaps the most accurate reconstruction, with painted scenery, mechanisms and lighting effects typical of the period.|$|E
5|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> {{were made}} to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which were {{believed}} to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of Belhus. A remote sensing survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that Dreamtime spirits can reunite the remains.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males are}} less ready to pursue and less {{efficient}} at catching than adult females, especially against larger prey. Males are quite effective against small web spiders, and reluctant to tackle large ones although they catch them in about 50% <b>of</b> <b>attempts.</b> Against other jumping spiders, males do not pursue large ones and pursue about 48% of small ones, catching 84% of those they pursue. Males of Portia do not build large webs for catching prey ("capture webs").|$|E

5|$|Bouldering {{competitions}} {{occur in}} both {{indoor and outdoor}} settings. The International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) employs an indoor format that breaks the competition into three rounds: qualifications, semi-finals, and finals. The rounds feature different sets {{of four or five}} boulder problems, and each competitor has a fixed amount of time to attempt each problem. At the end of each round, competitors are ranked by the number of completed problems, with ties settled by the total number <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> taken to solve the problems.|$|E
5|$|Burr, sensing {{an attack}} on his honor, and {{recovering}} from his defeat, demanded an apology in letter form. Hamilton wrote a letter in response and ultimately refused {{because he could not}} recall the instance of insulting Burr.

After a series <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> to reconcile were to no avail, a duel was arranged through liaisons on June 27, 1804.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War {{there have}} been a number <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> to curb {{military}} activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether. A notable referendum on the subject, launched by an anti-militarist group, was held on 26 November 1989. It was defeated with about two thirds of the voters against the proposal. A similar referendum, called for before, but held shortly after the 11 September attacks in the US, was defeated by over 78% of voters.|$|E

5|$|Having {{been the}} franchise's {{starting}} quarterback for 13 seasons (longer {{than any other}} Vikings player), Fran Tarkenton holds {{the record for the}} most starts in a Vikings jersey, and those for the most wins and ties. He is also the franchise's leading passer in terms of numbers <b>of</b> <b>attempts,</b> completions, total yards gained and passing touchdowns, although Brett Favre has the best pass completion percentage. However, Tarkenton has also thrown the most interceptions. The record for the longest completed pass by a Vikings starting quarterback is held by Gus Frerotte, who threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian in a home game against the Chicago Bears in the 2008 season.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism may be {{prevented}} {{in a population}} by adding iodine to commonly used foods. This public health measure has eliminated endemic childhood hypothyroidism in countries where it was once common. In addition to promoting the consumption of iodine-rich foods such as dairy and fish, many countries with moderate iodine deficiency have implemented universal salt iodization (USI). Encouraged by the World Health Organization, 130 countries now have USI, and 70% of the world's population are receiving iodized salt. In some countries, iodized salt is added to bread. Despite this, iodine deficiency has reappeared in some Western countries as a result <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> to reduce salt intake.|$|E
5|$|In his will, {{written the}} day before he died, Baltimore beseeched his friends Wentworth and Cottington to act as guardians and {{supervisors}} to his first son Cecil, who inherited the title of Lord Baltimore and the imminent grant of Maryland. Baltimore's two colonies in the New World continued under the proprietorship of his family. Avalon, which remained a prime spot for the salting and export of fish, was expropriated by Sir David Kirke, with a new royal charter which Cecil Calvert vigorously challenged, and it was finally absorbed into Newfoundland in 1754. Although Baltimore's failed Avalon venture marked the end of an early era <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> at proprietary colonisation, it laid the foundation upon which permanent settlements developed in that region of Newfoundland.|$|E
40|$|Background It {{is unclear}} whether any {{particular}} {{time of the day}} is Vulnerable for suicide attempts. Suicide attempt is a known risk factor for future completed suicide. Aim To investigate the relationship between the time <b>of</b> suicide <b>attempt</b> and the sociodemograpic and illness characteristics of suicide attempters. Method Time <b>of</b> <b>attempt,</b> clinical and demographic data and illness variables of 74 patients presenting to hospital following suicide attempt were analyzed. Results Our results showed 8. a. m. to 11. 59 a. m. is the most preferred time <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> and it is statistically significant. Suicide attempt is significantly more in the day time (between 8 a. m. to 11. 59 a. m.). The above time period is significantly associated with place <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>of</b> the suicide attempters. This is the time period where more young males (20 – 29 years) from rural back ground, married, illiterates and unemployed (significant no. of house wives also) attempt suicide during this time. Depression is the common psychiatric illness and pesticide is the common mode <b>of</b> <b>attempt.</b> More number <b>of</b> cases <b>attempt</b> during the months of August, September and October. Majority of them have experienced more than 5 life events before the attempt. Therefore we conclude that forenoon (8 a. m. to 11. 59 a. m.) is the most vulnerable period for attempting suicide. Conclusion The assessment of patients with history <b>of</b> suicide <b>attempt</b> in relation to the time <b>of</b> <b>attempt</b> is beneficial in formulating suicide prevention strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{suicide rate}} in Greenland, {{especially}} among men, {{is among the}} highest in the world. Attempted suicide rates may be high also. However, the rates <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide are unknown. Objective. We aimed to estimate the age- and gender-specific incidence <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide using medicine in Nuuk in 2008 &#x 2013; 2009. Design. An observational retrospective study of consecutive medical records on patients admitted to Dronning Ingrids Hospital in Nuuk in 2008 &#x 2013; 2009 with possible medicine intoxication. Results. Seventy-four (60 females and 14 men) cases <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide using medicine were included. Of those, 43 used paracetamol alone or in combination with other medicine. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide using medicine was higher among females than males (p&# 60; 0. 001). The highest incidence <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide with paracetamol was found among women aged 20 &#x 2013; 24 years (0. 84 %). The highest incidence of suicide with medication (1. 31 per 100 inhabitants per year) was among women aged 15 &#x 2013; 19 years. Conclusions. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide using medicine was high in Nuuk, Greenland, especially among women. The highest incidence <b>of</b> suicide <b>attempts</b> with medication was observed among women in the age group 15 &#x 2013; 19 years (1. 31 %). This may reflect psychosocial vulnerability among young people in Greenland. Initiatives to improve living conditions for children and adolescents are highly recommended to be initiated immediately...|$|R

5|$|In the 1860s, {{the income}} from the {{navigation}} had dropped, as a result <b>of</b> <b>attempts</b> to compete against the railways, but economies were made, and capital works continued. The lock at Lea Bridge was removed, and replaced by Old Ford Lock further to the south, which was built to take 100-ton barges, rather than the 40-ton barges specified by an Act of 1805. Although the original Lee trustees, and after 1868 the Conservators of the River Lee, were officially responsible for the Bow Back Rivers, there was little incentive to maintain them, since they did not generate any revenue. Nor could they be closed, since they allowed surplus water from the upper river to reach the Thames, without causing flooding.|$|E
