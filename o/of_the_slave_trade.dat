5|$|The Zong killings {{offered a}} {{powerful}} {{example of the}} horrors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> stimulating {{the development of the}} abolitionist movement in Britain, which dramatically expanded in size and influence in the late 1780s. In 1787, the Society for the Abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> was founded.|$|E
5|$|Hull was {{an early}} theatre of battle in the English Civil Wars. Its 18th century Member of Parliament, William Wilberforce, took a {{prominent}} part in the abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a {{memorial}} stone was erected at Black River, Jamaica, near where Zong would have landed. A sailing ship representing Zong was sailed to Tower Bridge in London in March 2007 {{to commemorate the}} 200th anniversary of the Act for the Abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade,</b> {{at a cost of}} £300,000. The vessel housed depictions of the Zong massacre and the slave trade. It was accompanied by HMS Northumberland, with an exhibition on board commemorating the role of the Royal Navy after 1807 in the suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E

5|$|Edmund Burke {{was elected}} as Whig Member of Parliament for Bristol in 1774 and campaigned for free trade, Catholic {{emancipation}} {{and the rights}} of the American colonists, but he angered his merchant sponsors with his detestation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> and lost the seat in 1780.|$|E
5|$|Abolition {{continued}} to be associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with British radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support. In 1795, the Society for Effecting the Abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> ceased to meet, and Clarkson retired in ill-health to the Lake District. However, despite the decreased interest in abolition, Wilberforce {{continued to}} introduce abolition bills throughout the 1790s.|$|E
5|$|In 1787, he {{came into}} contact with Thomas Clarkson and a group of anti-slave-trade activists, {{including}} Granville Sharp, Hannah More and Charles Middleton. They persuaded Wilberforce to take on the cause of abolition, and he soon became one of the leading English abolitionists. He headed the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for twenty years until the passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> Act of 1807.|$|E

5|$|Despite these setbacks, Sharp's efforts {{did have}} some success. In April 1783, he sent {{an account of the}} {{massacre}} to William Dillwyn, a Quaker, who had asked to see evidence that was critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b> The London Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends decided shortly after to begin campaigning against slavery, and a petition signed by 273Quakers was submitted to parliament in July 1783. Sharp also sent letters to Anglican bishops and clergy and to those already sympathetic to the abolitionist cause.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} end of the roof, the church had a cupola which was topped with a large {{concrete}} pineapple. Pineapples were a feature of several buildings in Southampton as a symbol of welcome, an idea that originated in the Caribbean and which possibly reached the city as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in the 16th century. The pineapple survived the bombing and has been used as an exhibited on special occasions, such as Black History Month.|$|E
5|$|Sogdian and Chinese merchants {{regularly}} {{traded in}} slaves {{in and around}} Turpan during the Tang dynasty. In 639 a female Sogdian slave was sold to a Chinese man as recorded in an Astana cemetery legal document written in Sogdian. Khotan and Kucha were places where women were commonly sold, with ample evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in Turfan thanks to contemporary textual sources that have survived. In Tang poetry Sogdian girls also frequently appear as serving maids in the taverns and inns of the capital Chang'an.|$|E

5|$|The colonial {{administration}} {{wanted to}} expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, {{who was in charge}} of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships disregarding the legislation. Wilberforce worked {{with the members of}} the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis. It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities of opium, which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|With {{the economy}} {{so focused on}} one crop, Mobile's {{fortunes}} were always tied to those of cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises. Mobile slaveholders owned relatively few slaves compared to planters in the upland plantation areas, but many households had domestic slaves, and many other slaves worked on the waterfront and on riverboats. The last slaves to enter the United States from the African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship Clotilde. Among them was Cudjoe Lewis, who in the 1920s was the last survivor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{international}} {{problem was}} the slave trade, and the African squadron was formed in 1820 {{to deal with this}} threat. Politically, the suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade</b> was unpopular, and the squadron was withdrawn in 1823 ostensibly to deal with piracy in the Caribbean, and did not return to the African coast until the passage of the Webster–Ashburton treaty with Britain in 1842. After the treaty was passed, the United States used fewer ships than the treaty required, ordered the ships based far from the coast of Africa, and used ships that were too large to operate close to shore. Between 1845 and 1850, the United States Navy captured only 10 slave vessels, while the British captured 423 vessels carrying 27,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Briton was {{the first}} of the trio to be {{commissioned}} and was assigned to the East Indies Station in 1871. She remained there for four and a half years, mostly engaged on the suppression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b> The ship was refitted and rearmed upon her return home and Briton remained in reserve until recommissioned in 1881 for service on the Cape Station. She was transferred back to the East Indies after two years on the Cape. Her crew was relieved in 1884 by another sent out from Britain and the ship remained on station until she was sold, less her armament, in Bombay in 1887.|$|E

5|$|Nri's hegemony {{over much}} of Igboland lasted from the reigns of the fourth eze Nri {{to that of the}} ninth. After that, {{patterns}} of conflict emerged that existed from the tenth to the fourteenth reigns, which probably reflected the monetary importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade.</b> Outside-world influence {{was not going to be}} halted by native religious doctrine in the face of the slave trade's economic opportunities. Nri hegemony declined after the start of the 18th century. Still, it survived in a much-reduced, and weakened form until 1911. In 1911, British troops forced the reigning eze Nri to renounce the ritual power of the religion known as the ìkénga, ending the kingdom of Nri as a political power.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{separated}} by market gardens and fields, the two areas merged over the years, with the docks becoming {{an important part}} of the Elizabethan exploration. Queen Elizabeth I visited the royal dockyard on 4 April 1581 to knight the adventurer Francis Drake. As well as for exploration, Deptford was important for trade - the Honourable East India Company had a yard in Deptford from 1607 until late in the 17th century, later (1825) taken over by the General Steam Navigation Company. It was also connected with the slave trade, John Hawkins using it as a base for his operations, and Olaudah Equiano, the slave who became {{an important part of}} the abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>slave</b> <b>trade,</b> was sold from one ship's captain to another in Deptford around 1760.|$|E
5|$|The non-denominational Society for Effecting the Abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slave</b> <b>Trade</b> {{was founded}} in 1787. The next year Parliament passed the first law {{regulating}} the slave trade, {{to limit the number}} of slaves per ship. Then in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners in cases in which slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was commemorated in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished the African slave trade. A monument to the killed slaves on Zong was installed at Black River, Jamaica, their intended port.|$|E
