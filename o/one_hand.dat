5|$|The {{holding up}} of <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> with middle and index fingers crossed {{was the usual}} gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted traditional terms, often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E
5|$|Artefacts in the {{collection}} include stone sculptures, ceramics and artefacts sculpted from bone, shell, obsidian and flint.

5|$|But {{theories}} of either complete independence of or complete {{dependence on the}} synoptics are largely rejected in current scholarship: on the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> elements such as distinctive Johannine language, the lengthy discourses, and the prologue on the Logos, are clearly unique to John; on the other, John clearly shares a multitude of episodes with the other three.|$|E

50|$|Technically, {{according}} to Jewish law, whenever one partakes of fruits or vegetables dipped in liquid while remaining wet, one must wash <b>one's</b> <b>hands,</b> if the fruit or vegetable remains wet. However, other {{times of the}} year either one has already washed <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> before eating bread, or dry the fruit or vegetable, in which case, one need not wash <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> before eating the fruit or vegetable.|$|R

5|$|In the 20th century, Norwegian {{architecture}} {{has been}} characterized by its connection with Norwegian social policy on the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> and innovation on the other.

5000|$|In Hinduism, an [...] (Sanskrit: अस्त्र) was {{a supernatural}} weapon, {{presided over by}} a {{specific}} deity.

5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor.

5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Shooting a pistol with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasingly}} common strategy to preserve bone and reduce treatment times includes {{the placement of}} a dental implant into a recent extraction site. On the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> it shortens treatment time and can improve aesthetics because the soft tissue envelope is preserved. On the other hand, implants may have a slightly higher rate of initial failure. Conclusions on this topic are difficult to draw, however, because few studies have compared immediate and delayed implants in a scientifically rigorous manner.|$|E
5|$|By 878 the Vikings {{had seized}} eastern Mercia and nearly conquered Wessex, and Alfred {{was reduced to}} being a {{fugitive}} in the Somerset marshes, but he fought back and won the Battle of Edington. This {{was followed by a}} period of peace, and in the late 880s Alfred concluded a treaty with Guthrum, king of the East Anglian Vikings, setting the boundary between Wessex and English Mercia on the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> and the Danelaw on the other. A further Viking assault in the mid 890s was unsuccessful.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the gesture is also important. Rubbing <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> {{together}} and then saying to another person (for example) that one expects to make money conveys to that person {{that they should be}} excited as well. Whereas rubbing <b>one's</b> <b>hands</b> together while saying the same thing conveys racism, and possibly the intention to deceive.|$|R

As Lugaid has lost a hand, Conall fights him with <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> tucked into his belt, but he only beats him after his horse takes {{a bite out of}} Lugaid's side. He also kills Erc, and takes his head back to Tara, where Erc's sister Achall dies of grief for her brother.|$|E
5|$|During the 1870s the {{distinction}} grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' on the <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range {{work on the}} other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.|$|E

5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This also means that K3 is the core of any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the veneration of icons in March 843, the Byzantine Empire's government, headed by the Empress-regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos, embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main political and ideological foe, the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> facilitated by the internal stability {{that the end of the}} Iconoclasm controversy brought, and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims.|$|E
