5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in sight of the audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese {{had been}} unable to {{successfully}} pin-point the Canadian defensive positions, having failed to carry out a thorough reconnaissance prior to the attack. The severe terrain had also prevented the assaulting troops from adopting a low profile during their final assault, however in the darkness the Canadian rifle fire was ineffective, forcing them to resort to using grenades and rocket launchers. The Chinese mortars and artillery was particularly ineffective however, and very few rounds fell on the Canadian positions during the evening. Indeed, in their haste to follow up the collapse of the South Korean 6th Division, the Chinese 118th Division had left the bulk of its artillery and supplies well north <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> of the fighting. Meanwhile, what mortar ammunition they did have had been largely used up on the Australians during the previous evening. In contrast, the New Zealand gunners provided effective fire support and had been able to break up a number of Chinese assaults before they had even reached the Patricias. The Chinese now turned their attention to D Company holding the summit of Hill 677, on the battalion's left flank.|$|E

25|$|Two {{things should}} be noted about the second {{complete}} draft of Das Rheingold. Firstly, the full score of the Prelude (in ink) and the instrumentation draft of {{the remainder of the}} opera (in pencil) together constitute a single manuscript (WWV 86A Musik III). In WWV this is called a Partiturerstschrift, a term usually reserved for Wagner's full scores: strictly speaking only the section in ink is a Partiturerstschrift. Secondly, the manuscript is fragmentary: thirty-three measures are missing, which include the closing measures of the Prelude and the opening measures <b>of</b> <b>Scene</b> 1. As ink is used before this lacuna and pencil after it, it is generally assumed that Wagner switched from one medium to the other at the entrance of the voices (i.e. the first measure <b>of</b> <b>Scene</b> 1); but until and unless the missing sheets are recovered, this must remain an assumption.|$|E

25|$|The {{show has}} a {{distinctive}} cinematic style set by Wright and is {{shot with a}} single camera.

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, the vast {{majority}} of the BBC's television was performed live. Nonetheless, there was a certain degree of pre-shooting in the form of inserts on film, which could be played into the studio and broadcast as part of the play to cover changes <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> or show location material which would have been impossible to mount live in the studio. Initial filming for Nineteen Eighty-Four took place on 10 November 1954 in Studio B of Alexandra Palace (even by then all but abandoned as a venue for shooting drama, although it housed the news and later the Open University for the next thirty years), with footage of the Two Minutes' Hate and some of the canteen scenes being filmed there.|$|E

25|$|Another {{thematic}} source {{may have}} been William Baldwin's The Mirror for Magistrates (1559; 2nd edition, 1578), a well-known series of poems spoken by controversial historical figures who speak {{of their lives and}} deaths, and to warn contemporary society not to make the same mistakes they did. Three such figures are Margaret of Anjou, King Edward IV and Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York. York's final scene, and his last speech in particular (1.4.111–171), are often identified as being the 'type' <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> suitable to a traditional tragic hero who has been defeated by his own ambition, and this is very much how York presents himself in Mirror, a tragic hero whose dynastic ambitions caused him to reach too far and led to his ruin.|$|E
25|$|It came as {{a terrible}} blow to Mrs. Logan when the General became sick and died. She decided a change <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> would help her and so she {{traveled}} through Europe, chaperoning George Pullman's daughters. On her return, Mrs. Logan became the editor of The Home Magazine, of Washington, which ran from 1888 to 1908, writing reminiscences of historic events. She served on the syndicate staff of Hearst news service, was a contributor to other magazine and newspapers, and wrote several books. President Benjamin Harrison appointed Mrs. Logan {{one of the women}} commissioners of the District of Columbia to the Columbian Exposition (Chicago, 1893). She also worked on plans for the Garfield Memorial Hospital, having been president of the board nine years. Logan died in 1923.|$|E
25|$|He {{tended to}} dramatize where {{traditional}} novelists narrated; {{he is more}} concerned with the interplay of ideas and opinions than of feelings and emotions; his dramatis personae is more likely to consist of a cast of more or less equal characters than of one outstanding hero or heroine and a host of minor auxiliaries; his novels have a tendency to approximate the Classical unities, with few changes <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> and few if any subplots; his novels are novels of conversation rather than novels of action; in fact, Peacock is so much more interested in what his characters say to one another than in what they do to one another that he often sets out entire chapters of his novels in dialogue form. Plato's Symposium is the literary ancestor of these works, by way of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus, in which (as in much of Peacock) the conversation relates less to exalted philosophical themes than to the points of a good fish dinner.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Michael Taylor {{believes}} that Shakespeare almost certainly wrote the entire play, as does J. J. M. Tobin, who, {{in his essay}} in Henry VI: Critical Essays (2001), argues the similarities to Nashe do not reveal the hand of Nashe {{at work in the}} composition of the play, but instead reveal Shakespeare imitating Nashe. More recently, in 2005, Paul J. Vincent has re-examined the question in light of recent research into the Elizabethan theatre, concluding that 1 Henry VI is Shakespeare's partial revision of a play by Nashe (Act 1) and an unknown playwright (Acts 2–5) and that it was the original, non-Shakespearean, play that was first performed on 3 March 1592. Shakespeare's work in the play, which was most likely composed in 1594, can be found in Act 2 (scene 4) and Act 4 (scenes 2–5 and the first 32 lines <b>of</b> <b>scene</b> 7). In 2007, Vincent's authorship findings, especially with regard to Nashe's authorship of Act 1, were supported overall by Brian Vickers, who agrees with the theory of co-authorship and differs only slightly over the extent of Shakespeare's contribution to the play.|$|E
25|$|Yet, on the whole, {{it was an}} {{agricultural}} society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. Grass seed was not sown for hay {{and as a result}} the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; {{only a small part of}} the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes <b>of</b> <b>scene.</b> He could succeed only with virgin soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>Scene</b> III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E

After EBI, the children also increased their speech accuracy in tacting pictures <b>of</b> <b>scenes</b> (BD relations) for trained sentences and were able to recombine sentence components and accurately tact pictures with untrained sentences.|$|R
