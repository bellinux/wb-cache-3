5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> in contests.|$|E

Its port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> was Stokmarknes. In January 1988 Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab (OVDS) and Ofotens Dampskibsselskab (ODS) was merged and it created Ofotens og Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab and port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> was Narvik. On 30 September 1988 the ship was sold to Finnmark Fylkesrederi og Ruteselskap (FFR) for 20 million Norwegian Kroner (nok), and its port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> was changed to Hammerfest, Norway. In 1996 the ship was sold back to Ofotens and Vesteraalens Dampskibsselskab (OVDS) and the port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> was changed back to Narvik.|$|R

5|$|As {{the species}} has no fixed nest sites that {{individuals}} {{can use to}} locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal calls alone for identification. They use a complex set <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> that are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins. Vocalizing emperor penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.|$|E

40|$|The Cruise Itinerary Schedule Design (CISD) problem {{determines the}} optimal {{sequence}} {{of a given}} set <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> (a port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is an intermediate stop in a cruise itinerary) and the arrival and departure times at each port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{in order to maximize}} the monetary value of the utility at ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> minus the fuel cost. To solve this problem, in view of the practical observations that most cruise itineraries do not have many ports <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> we first enumerate all sequences <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> and then optimize the arrival and departure times at each port <b>of</b> <b>call</b> by developing a dynamic programming approach. To improve the computational efficiency, we propose effective bounds on the monetary value of each sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> eliminating non-optimal sequences without invoking the dynamic programming algorithm. Extensive computational experiments are conducted and the results showthat, first, using the bounds on the profit of each sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> considerably improves the computational efficiency; second, the total profit of the cruise itinerary is sensitive to the fuel price and hence an accurate estimation of the fuel price is highly desirable; third, the optimal sequence <b>of</b> ports <b>of</b> <b>call</b> is not necessarily the sequencewith the shortest voyage distance, especially when the ports do not have a natural geographic sequence.

5|$|The Andean cock-of-the-rock {{exhibits}} marked sexual dimorphism; {{the male}} {{has a large}} disk-like crest and scarlet or brilliant orange plumage, while the female is significantly darker and browner. Gatherings of males compete for breeding females with each male displaying its colourful plumage, bobbing and hopping, and making a variety <b>of</b> <b>calls.</b> After mating, the female makes a nest under a rocky overhang, incubates the eggs, and rears the young, all by herself.|$|E
5|$|The blue-faced honeyeater {{produces}} a variety <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> including a piping call around {{half an hour}} before dawn, variously described as ki-owt, woik, queet, peet, or weet. Through the day, it makes squeaking noises while flying, and harsh squawks when mobbing. Its calls have been likened to those of the yellow-throated miner (Manorina flavigula), but are deeper. Blue-faced honeyeaters make a soft chirping around nestlings and family members.|$|E
5|$|The robin also sings when storms {{approach}} and again when storms have passed.

5|$|This flycatcher has a loud, high-pitched song.

5|$|Unlike {{many of its}} fellow mimids, {{the black}} catbird is not known to imitate any other species. Its song {{consists}} of repeated phrases of notes ranging from harsh and scratchy to warbled and flute-like, often interspersed with metallic clicking buzzes. It often sings from exposed perches. It has a variety <b>of</b> <b>calls,</b> including some which are quite {{similar to those of}} the gray catbird; these are variously described as a harsh rriah, a nasal chrrh and a grating tcheeu.|$|E
40|$|The choice <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>call</b> {{attempts}} {{in a telephone}} survey is an important decision.

In this paper we study the effects <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts on the nonresponse rate and the nonresponse bias in two surveys conducted by Statistics Sweden: The Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Household Finances (HF). By use of paradata we calculate the response rate as a function of the number <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts. To estimate the nonresponse bias we use estimates of some register variables, where observations are available for both respondents and nonrespondents. We also calculate estimates of some real survey parameters as functions of varying number <b>of</b> <b>call</b> attempts.

5|$|Wildebeest {{can also}} {{listen in on}} the alarm calls of other species, and by doing so can reduce their risk of predation. One study showed, along with other ungulates, wildebeests responded more {{strongly}} to the baboon alarm calls compared to the baboon contest calls, though both types <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> had similar patterns, amplitudes, and durations. The alarm calls were a response of the baboons to lions, and the contest calls were recorded when a dispute between two males occurred.|$|E
5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most {{of these animals}} are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony <b>of</b> <b>calls</b> and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E
