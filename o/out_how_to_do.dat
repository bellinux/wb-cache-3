25|$|Whatever is good, bad or {{indifferent}} about Streets of Fire, {{it had a}} {{huge impact}} on other filmmakers. The two movies that came out in the years after that are completely saturated in the iconography of Streets of Fire are RoboCop and Se7en. Se7en’s taking place in another world. It’s not New York. It’s not Chicago. A world where it’s raining all the time. Always dark. Always night, just about. Those are two very successful movies that figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the stylization with the appropriate amount of gore that they hooked the audience. And I think that if we’d done more gore, our chances of hooking the audience would be greater.|$|E
500|$|Producer/director Lisa Simon stated, {{regarding}} the difficulty the producers and writers had with crafting the episode, [...] "We {{hope to get}} to it {{by the end of the}} season. It always takes us a while to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an issue appropriately, from a child's point of view". Puppeteer Jerry Nelson, who was one of the original performers of Snuffy, noted, [...] "Now we delve into things like divorce that are likely to affect small children very heavily. We didn't touch those things before".|$|E

I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Bad Blood" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, who had already written a number of episodes for the series; this was his fifth writing credit of the season. Aware {{that he had an}} episode to be filmed soon after the Christmas period of 1997, he had been working on a script that would involve a story being {{presented}} by Robert Stack of Unsolved Mysteries, with unknown actors playing Mulder and Scully. Under pressure to complete the script, Gilligan decided his idea would not work. He said, [...] "I just couldn't figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it". The series would later explore the idea of an X-Files crossover in the guise of non-fiction with the seventh season episode [...] "X-Cops", also penned by Gilligan.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} June 1990 and took eight weeks (a third {{less time than}} {{required}} by Miller's Crossing), and the estimated final budget for the movie was US$9 million. The Coens worked well with Deakins, and they easily translated their ideas for each scene onto film. [...] "There was only one moment we surprised him," [...] Joel Coen recalled later. An extended scene called for a tracking {{shot out of the}} bedroom and into a sink drain [...] "plug hole" [...] in the adjacent bathroom as a symbol of sexual intercourse. [...] "The shot {{was a lot of fun}} and we had a great time working <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it," [...] Joel said. [...] "After that, every time we asked Roger to do something difficult, he would raise an eyebrow and say, 'Don't be having me track down any plug-holes now.'" ...|$|E
500|$|After filming ended, {{they put}} {{together}} a 24minute presentation {{and took it to}} every studio in June 2003. There was a lot of interest and Avnet selected the studio that gave Conran the most creative control. They needed studio backing to finish the film's ambitious visuals. At one point, the producer remembers that Conran was [...] "working 18 to 20 hours a day {{for a long period of}} time. It's 2,000 some odd CG shots done in one year, and we literally had to write code to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this stuff!" [...] Most of the post-production work was done on Mac workstations using After Effects for compositing and Final Cut Pro for editing (seven workstations were dedicated to visual effects and production editing). The distinctive look of the film was achieved by running footage through a diffusion filter and then tinting it in black and white before color was blended, balanced and added back in.|$|E

2500|$|From a musician’s {{perspective}} or piano player’s perspective, he matters {{because he}} figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> things {{no one had}} ever done before, at least in a rhythm-and-blues context.... Basically he figured out ways {{to do a lot of}} stuff at the same time and make the piano sound like an entire band. It’s Ray Charles on the level of Chopin. It’s all the soul, all the groove, and all the technique in the universe packed into one unbelievable player ... I can now say with certainty that it’s a pianistic experience unlike any other. He invented an entirely new way of playing blues and roots-based music on the piano, and it was mind-blowingly brilliant and beautiful.|$|E
2500|$|The {{camouflage}} {{effect was}} designed by R/Greenberg Associates, {{under the direction of}} Joel Hynek. The idea for the effect came in a dream one of the Thomas brothers (who wrote the film) had, in which there was a chrome man who was inside a reflective sphere. The man blended in, perfectly camouflaged, reflecting from all directions and only visible when in motion. It took quite a while before they figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, which was basically an image repeated in a pattern of ripples {{in the shape of the}} Predator's body. It proved very effective and was a new way of presenting an [...] "invisible man." [...] Before there was digital rendering technology all of the camouflage was done optically using photo-chemical means, so that one would never get the same result twice from combining the same pieces of film.|$|E
2500|$|Dad {{then joined}} {{the team and}} played {{right up until the}} out-break of war in the autumn of 1939. During the war, he was a {{merchant}} seaman and suffered from post-traumatic stress that required hospitalisation. He was withdrawn from active service and played in the Empire Eleven, playing cricket to boost the nation's morale. According to the press cuttings that I am currently looking at, he was the Captain of the Empire XI in 1941 and C.B. Clarke, the West Indies Test bowler was also in the team, along with H.P. Crabtree and F. Appleyard, formerly of Herts County Cricket Club. [...] The photographs are a real snapshot of time. I shall endeavour to upload some photographs and press cuttings if I can figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. My father's archive of photographs from the 1940s is uplifting and insightful, telling the story of a bygone era when the primary motivation of public sporting events was to feed the spirit and the soul, irrespective of financial reward.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Power 106, Gomez spoke in-depth about the inspiration behind [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", saying: [...] "Everybody has had a say in my life [...] meaning the world, the perception, the media. It was really frustrating. There is a song on my record called ‘Kill Em with Kindness.’ So I’ve always done that. I ignore, I ignore, I ignore. And then {{it just kind of}} got out of hand. So I went to the new label [...] and I was like, I have to say something. I need to say what I want to say, and you guys have to help me figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that." [...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the world}} wars, the Marine Corps was headed by Major General John A. Lejeune, another popular commandant. The Marine Corps {{was searching for}} an {{expanded}} mission after World War I. [...] It was used in France as a junior version of the army infantry, and Marines realized that was a dead end. In the early 20th century they had acquired the new mission of police control of Central American countries partly occupied by the US. That mission became another dead end when the nation adopted a [...] "Good Neighbor Policy" [...] toward Latin America, and renounced further invasions. [...] The corps needed a new mission, one distinct from the army. It found one: {{it would be a}} fast-reacting, light infantry fighting force carried rapidly to far off locations by the navy. [...] Its special role was amphibious landings on enemy-held islands, but it took years to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that. [...] The Mahanian notion of a decisive fleet battle required forward bases for the navy close to the enemy. [...] After the Spanish-American War the Marines gained the mission of occupying and defending those forward bases, and they began a training program on Culebro Island, Puerto Rico. [...] The emphasis at first was on defending the forward base against enemy attack; they would be like the Turks who in 1915 inflicted 250,000 casualties on the British, Australian and New Zealand invaders of Gallipoli, forcing their withdrawal.|$|E
