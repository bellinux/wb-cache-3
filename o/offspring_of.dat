5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and very light chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares.

White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E

40|$|The aim was {{to study}} {{patterns}} of the nNOS, iNOS and eNOS expression in pancreatic islets in prepubescent male <b>offsprings</b> <b>of</b> female rats with experimental gestational diabetes mellitus.

The expression of nNOS, iNOS and eNOS was evaluated in histological slices of pancreatic islets. Results. It was found that the largest area of enzyme expression of eNOS was detected in control animals. On the other hand the immunoreactive material enzyme was maximal for iNOS. Chronic fetal hyperglycaemia affects the allocation of NOS isoforms in pancreatic islets. Higher immunoreactive material enzyme and nNOS contain, increase of iNOS area and the most significant increase of contain and area of fluorescence of eNOS compared with other expression indexes were detected. We believe the affection of glucose homeostasis in fetus during the last trimester of the pregnancy changes the relation of patterns of the expression of NOS isoforms, and it can lead to the formation of metabolic violation in adults...|$|R

5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced by outside blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E
