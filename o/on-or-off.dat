2500|$|During {{his summer}} {{vacation}} at the Homestead in 1874, Alexander Graham continued to contemplate electrical sound reproduction while viewing the undulating {{surface of the}} Grand River from his [...] "dreaming place". He postulated that [...] "it {{would be possible to}} transmit sounds of any sort" [...] by the continuous variation of the intensity of the electric current. [...] This method of sound energy to electrical signal transduction was fundamentally different from the <b>on-or-off</b> transmission methods used by other telephone experimenters. [...] Alexander Graham held lengthy discussions with his father explaining what he thought he could achieve with a sound-driven transmitter producing an electrical signal which would instantaneously travel an electrical circuit to a receiver at another location where it would be converted back to sound. His record of a discussion with his father in their home's living room, wrote [...] "If I could vary the intensity of the electric current in exact proportion to the variation of the air density in the production of words, I would be able to transmit speech by telegraph" [...] (using the telephone's technical analog, the telegraph, as the former name had not yet been adapted). On 26 July 1874 in their living room the younger Bell realized the technical principles of telephony, inventing the telecommunications device he is now closely identified with. Returning again to the Homestead the next summer in 1875 Bell wrote his first draft specifications of the telephone patent—commonly considered to be the most valuable patent in history—that September. He later built his first fully functional unit at Boston on 10 March 1876. Later that year, in August, Bell made the first successful voice transmission of any notable distance, between Brantford and Paris Ontario.|$|E
50|$|In many games, {{powers are}} binary <b>on-or-off</b> qualities {{as opposed to}} {{attributes}} and skills which are usually numeric quantities. The main exception to this is superhero RPGs, where superpowers are often treated {{as a sort of}} skill. Superpowers may also use the same rating scale as the primary statistics.|$|E
50|$|Snap action {{control systems}} are often run with electricity, where a {{stand-alone}} thermostat {{acting as a}} switch is activated by the capillary bulb fluid. The thermostat switches an electrical signal <b>on-or-off</b> to an associated solenoid valve, controlling gas flow to the burner. This construction allows integration of other control mechanisms into the system, such as pilot flame failure, but {{requires the use of}} components known to be sensitive to high temperatures and water damage. Solenoids and associated wiring are known to degrade over time, even if operating within their design parameters, due to the cumulative effects of thermal cycling and ambient grease and oil coating their surfaces - environmental aspects known to attack the integrity of plastics.|$|E
40|$|The {{visual cues}} from {{multiple}} support regions {{of different sizes}} and resolutions are complementary in classifying a candidate box in object detection. Effective integration of local and contextual visual cues from these regions has become a fundamental problem in object detection. In this paper, we propose a gated bi-directional CNN (GBD-Net) to pass messages among features from different support regions during both feature learning and feature extraction. Such message passing can be implemented through convolution between neighboring support regions in two directions and can be conducted in various layers. Therefore, local and contextual visual patterns can validate the existence of each other by learning their nonlinear relationships and their close interactions are modeled in a more complex way. It is also shown that message passing is not always helpful but dependent on individual samples. Gated functions are therefore needed to control message transmission, whose <b>on-or-offs</b> are controlled by extra visual evidence from the input sample. The effectiveness of GBD-Net is shown through experiments on three object detection datasets, ImageNet, Pascal VOC 2007 and Microsoft COCO. This paper also shows the details of our approach in wining the ImageNet object detection challenge of 2016, with source code provided on >...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{preservation}} of some habitat area of an at-risk species were required by a project permitee during development. This {{could result in}} habitat that became isolated, small, with reduced connectivity or functionality, and was more costly to maintain. Comparatively, conservation banks are more cost effective as {{they are able to}} maintain larger blocks of land with greater functionality for a species, such as allowing habitat connectivity. For purchasers, this is also time-effective by allowing them to forgo their responsibility of handling <b>on-or-off</b> mitigation measures that can run into administrative delays due to the USFWS review and approval process. After the public or private party purchases credits, a bank transfer occurs between the project party and banker. The banker is then perpetually bound to conserve and manage the conservation bank.|$|E

30|$|The {{output of}} {{renewable}} generation {{varies with the}} energy source. For example, solar panels do not produce electricity when the sun does not shine, and wind turbines do not spin when the wind does not blow. However, {{it is not just}} an <b>on-or-off</b> proposition. The output from solar and wind can vary over relatively short periods depending on cloud cover and shifting wind speeds. This intermittency produces challenges to managing demand on specific parts of the grid and ensuring adequate capacity.|$|E
40|$|During brain development, neural {{stem cells}} (NSCs) receive <b>on-or-off</b> signals {{important}} for regulating their amplification and reaching adequate neuron density. However, how a coordinated regulation of intracellular pathways and genetic programs is achieved has remained elusive. Here, {{we found that}} the embryonic (e) CSF contains 10 ¹² nanoparticles/ml (77 nm diameter), some of which were identified as exosome nanovesicles that contain evolutionarily conserved molecules important for coordinating intracellular pathways. eCSF nanovesicles collected from rodent and human embryos encapsulate protein and microRNA components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway. Supplementation of eCSF nanovesicles to a mixed culture containing eNSCs activated the IGF-mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC 1) pathway in eNSCs and expanded the pool of proliferative eNSCs. These data show that the eCSF serves as a medium for the distribution of nanovesicles, including exosomes, and the coordinated transfer of evolutionary conserved molecules that regulate eNSC amplification during corticogenesis...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPatterning the Drosophila retina {{for color}} vision relies on postmitotic {{specification}} of photoreceptor subtypes. R 8 photoreceptors express {{one of two}} light-sensing Rhodopsins, Rh 5 or Rh 6. This fate decision involves a bistable feedback loop between Melted, a PH-domain protein, and Warts, a kinase in the Hippo growth pathway. Here, we show that {{a subset of the}} Hippo pathway—Merlin, Kibra, and Lethal(2) giant larvae (Lgl), but not Expanded or Fat—is required for Warts expression and activity in R 8 to specify Rh 6 fate. Melted represses warts transcription to disrupt Hippo pathway activity and specify Rh 5 fate. Therefore, R 8 Hippo signaling exhibits <b>ON-or-OFF</b> regulation, promoting mutually exclusive fates. Furthermore, Merlin and Lgl are continuously required to maintain R 8 neuronal subtypes. These results reveal roles for Merlin, Kibra, and Lgl in neuronal specification and maintenance and show that the Hippo pathway is reimplemented for sensory neuron fate by combining canonical and noncanonical regulatory steps...|$|E
40|$|A {{previously}} derived {{analytical model}} for the small-scale structure of turbulence is reformulated {{in such a way}} that the energy spectrum may be computed. The model is an ensemble of two-dimensional (2 D) vortices with internal spiral structure, each stretched by an axially symmetric strain flow. Stretching and differential rotation produce an energy cascade to smaller scales in which the stretching represents the effect of instabilities and the spiral structure is the source of dissipation at the end of the cascade. The energy spectrum of the resulting flow may be expressed as a time integration involving only the enstrophy spectrum of the time evolving 2 D cross section flow, which may be obtained numerically. Examples are given in which a k exp - 5 / 3 spectrum is obtained by this method. The k exp - 5 / 3 inertial range spectrum is shown to be related to the existence of a self-similar enstrophy preserving range in the 2 D enstrophy spectrum. The results are found to be insensitive to time dependence of the strain rate, including even intermittent <b>on-or-off</b> strains...|$|E
40|$|Subcortical {{circuits}} mediating sleep-wake functions {{have been}} well characterized in animal models, and corroborated by more recent human studies. Disruptions in these circuits {{have been identified in}} hypersomnia disorders such as narcolepsy and Klein-Levin Syndrome, as well as in neurodegenerative disorders expressing excessive daytime sleepiness. However, the behavioral expression of sleep-wake functions is not a simple <b>on-or-off</b> state determined by subcortical circuits, but encompasses a complex range of behaviors determined by the interaction between cortical networks and subcortical circuits. While conceived as disorders of sleep, hypersomnia disorders are equally disorders of wake, representing a fundamental instability in neural state characterized by lapses of alertness during wake. These episodic lapses in alertness and wakefulness are also frequently seen in neurodegenerative disorders where EEG demonstrates abnormal function in cortical regions associated with cognitive fluctuations. Moreover, functional connectivity MRI shows instability of cortical networks in individuals with cognitive fluctuations. We propose that the inability to stabilize neural state due to disruptions in the sleep-wake control networks is common to the sleep and cognitive dysfunctions seen in hypersomnia and neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E
