25|$|The reverse {{shows the}} winged mythological goddess Pheme, with a trumpet {{in her left}} hand and rising from her throne to crown a warrior with a laurel wreath. At left is the naked and cloaked warrior, with his left foot on the throne dais, a bow and a quiver of arrows {{in his right hand}} and {{supporting}} a target with three arrows through its centre on his left knee. The design was by Sir Edward John Poynter, 1st Baronet PRA, and the <b>original</b> <b>die</b> was engraved by L.C. Wyon.|$|E
25|$|The {{modus operandi}} of {{engraving}} is as follows. The mill {{is placed in}} contact with {{one end of the}} copper roller, and being mounted on a lever support as much pressure as required can be put upon it by adding weights. Roller and mill are now revolved together, during which operation the projection parts of the latter are forced into the softer substance of the roller, thus engraving it, in intaglio, with several replicas of what was cut on the <b>original</b> <b>die.</b> When the full circumference of the roller is engraved, the mill is moved sideways {{along the length of the}} roller to its next position, and the process is repeated until the whole roller is fully engraved.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} the {{distinctive}} fir tree atop Siwash Rock has also been memorialized with a replacement. The <b>original</b> <b>died</b> in the dry summer of 1965, and through the persistent efforts of park staff, a replacement finally took root in 1968.|$|R
50|$|The stamps {{have been}} admired at various expositions, {{including}} {{at what is}} now Sala Dalles in 1932 for their 75th anniversary, and at the Postal Palace in 1958 for their centenary. The <b>original</b> <b>dies</b> survive and are {{on display at the}} philatelic museum.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, Nikon {{introduced}} an updated, hand-assembled S3 model {{to celebrate the}} new millennium. It was quite a production to produce S3s again, as all the <b>original</b> <b>dies</b> were long gone. The new Nikkor 50mm 1.4 lens for the new S3 is noticeably larger than original 50mm 1.4 lenses.|$|R

2500|$|In 1894, Palemon Howard Dorsett (a lifelong Department of Agriculture employee) {{turned up}} with a metal die {{very similar to the}} <b>original</b> <b>die</b> of the Great Seal, except that the arrows and the olive branch were switched, {{indicating}} an intentional [...] "difference" [...] to distinguish it from the actual Great Seal. [...] The die had apparently been owned by George Washington, though there are no known uses of this die, and there even is no indication it could actually be used as a seal. [...] The origins and purpose of this die remain unknown, though the authors of a 1978 book on the Great Seal speculated it was a gift to Washington and possibly an early version (or forerunner) of a presidential seal.|$|E
2500|$|The reverse shows a {{representation}} of a naked and cloaked Neptune, grasping thunderbolts in both hands and with his right arm drawn back {{in the act of}} hurling the missiles. Behind him is the prow of a Roman trireme drawn by three sea horses. Above the horses a trident is depicted on the table of the medal. The inscription is [...] "AMAT VICTORIA CVRAM" [...] (Victory delights in care), as required by King Edward VII. The design dates back to 1904, when the Deputy Master of the Royal Mint invited students of the Modelling School of the Royal College of Art in South Kensington to submit designs for the reverse of the Naval Good Shooting Medal. The winning design was submitted by Miss Margaret Winser, while the <b>original</b> <b>die</b> was engraved by George de Saulles.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} annual banquet in 1913, a two-inch bronze {{portrait}} medal was presented to Dr. French, the retiring president. [...] This tradition has continued to this day. [...] During World War II, plastic impressions were made from the dies and {{presented at the annual}} banquet. [...] At the war's end, bronze pieces were struck from the <b>original</b> <b>dies.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Wilder {{offers to}} take Hathaway back to Earth, but he declines. [...] In the next moment, Hathaway {{has a heart}} attack and dies, begging Wilder not to call his family to his side because they [...] "would not understand". Wilder then {{confirms}} that Hathaway's wife and children are actually androids, created by Hathaway after the <b>originals</b> <b>died</b> years ago.|$|R
50|$|Intending {{to give a}} bold {{relief to}} the designs on the new bronze coins, Wyon {{engraved}} the <b>original</b> <b>dies</b> so deeply that they were liable to fracture after relatively few pieces had been struck from them. He therefore had to start again and, after he had produced dies of less bold relief, mass-production of the bronze coinage began.|$|R
2500|$|The {{reverse is}} {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Naval Good Shooting Medal and Queen's Medal for Champion Shots of the New Zealand Naval Forces. It bears a representation of a naked and cloaked Neptune, grasping thunderbolts in both hands and with his right arm drawn back in the act of hurling the missiles. Behind him is the prow of a Roman trireme, drawn by three sea horses. Above the horses, a trident is depicted on the table of the medal.

50|$|Chains can {{be formed}} by {{exploding}} a die, which then its flame hits a dice {{with an equal}} or exactly one pip lower than the <b>original</b> <b>die.</b> That way, the chained die starts glowing too; which starts the chain.

50|$|In the Age of Ultron storyline, {{the reality}} that formed from Wolverine and Invisible Woman killing Henry Pym to prevent Ultron from being created shows that Ares has become the new Doctor Doom after the <b>original</b> <b>died</b> and is engaged to Morgan le Fay where they have conquered half the planet. Hippolyta defeats Ares and takes back command of the Amazons (who were subdued by Ares).|$|R

50|$|The Canadian Numismatic Association’s {{official}} seal {{would eventually be}} used on many convention medals. The seal is an adaptation of Emmanuel Hahn’s famous “Voyageur” design, which was used on Canadian Silver Dollars since 1935. The first year that this seal was eventually used was 1963. The <b>original</b> <b>die</b> was engraved by H.F. Sarson of Pressed Metal Products in Vancouver.|$|E
50|$|Reproduction Packs - These packs are {{produced}} to commemorate special British stamps. The first was issued in 2000 {{to celebrate the}} Penny Black. Significant attention to detail foes into the production of these packs, causing admiration amongst collectors. For example, the Postal Union Congress London 1929 Reproduction Pack contains stamps produced using the <b>original</b> <b>die</b> but with a watermark effect on the reverse and the word 'facsimile', to clearly distinguish them from the originals.|$|E
50|$|Vendetta {{contains}} an original story {{which takes place}} five years after Die Hard with a Vengeance. John McClane's daughter Lucy has joined the police force. After a short time in the force she is kidnapped by Piet Gruber (the son of Hans Gruber, the villain in the <b>original</b> <b>Die</b> Hard film). The entire storyline has been considered non-canon since the release of Live Free or Die Hard which contradicts many plot elements.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010 {{the stamp}} was {{reproduced}} for the London 2010 International Stamp Exhibition by Enschede using the <b>original</b> <b>die.</b> The reproductions had a printed design {{on the back}} similar to a watermark to help distinguish them from the originals. They also had the word [...] printed diagonally across the back in a repeating pattern. The stamps were sold in blocks of four in presentation packs with an insert written by Douglas Muir.|$|E
50|$|For instance, the 1856 10 kopek stamp from Finland was {{reprinted in}} 1862 {{by the same}} method as the {{original}} (typography) and from the original steel die. In 1892 the Russian Director of Posts and Telegraphs ordered the stamp to be printed again, however, the <b>original</b> <b>die</b> was not available and the stamp was therefore reproduced using lithography, making it a new print. Had the later stamp not been officially authorised it would be classed as a forgery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{engraving}} {{was unusually}} minute and required very close and incessant labor for several weeks. I made the <b>original</b> <b>dies</b> and hubs {{for making the}} working dies twice over, to secure their perfect adaptation to the coining machinery. I had a wish to execute this work single handed, that I might thus silently reply {{to those who had}} questioned my ability for the work. The result, I believe, was satisfactory.|$|R
