5|$|Under the Congressional {{calendar}} of the 1860s, {{members of the}} 38th United States Congress, elected in November 1862, did not begin their work until December 1863; by the time Blaine finally took his seat that month, the Union had turned the tide in the war with victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. As a first-term congressman, he initially said little, mostly following the administration’s lead in supporting the continuing war effort. He did clash several times with {{the leader of the}} Republicans' radical faction, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, firstly <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> of states' debts incurred in supporting the war, and again over monetary policy concerning the new greenback currency. Blaine also spoke in support of the commutation provision of the military draft law passed in 1863 and proposed a constitutional amendment allowing the federal government to impose taxes on exports.|$|E

25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{efforts have}} also faced resistance in another form. The priority placed on vaccination by national authorities has {{turned it into}} a bargaining chip, with communities and interest groups resisting vaccination, not due to direct opposition, but to leverage other concessions from governmental authorities. In Nigeria this has taken the form of 'block rejection' of vaccination, which is only resolved when state officials agree to repair or improve schools and health-care facilities, pave roads or install electricity. There have been several instances of threatened boycotts by health workers in Pakistan <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> disputes.|$|E
25|$|CLF Research and Music Man {{were treated}} as {{separate}} companies, headed by Leo Fender and Tommy Walker, respectively. Fender made the guitars and basses, while Walker's company made the amplifiers and sold accessories. The instruments were made at CLF and shipped to Music Man's warehouse, where each instrument was inspected and tested. Problems with fibers in the finish caused Music Man's inspectors to reject {{a high percentage of}} the instruments, and return them to CLF for refinishing. Since Music Man didn't pay CLF Research until the instrument finishes were deemed acceptable, a rift developed between CLF and Music Man <b>over</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although Military Road did not close, Congress passed {{legislation}} allowing {{traffic on the}} highway to be stopped. On January 31, 1936, Representative John D. Dingell, Sr. warned Washington-Hoover Airport that Military Road posed a serious flying hazard. On February 14, airport officials (faced with legal action from Arlington County for obstructing traffic), stopped attempting to close the road using traffic guards, chains, or lights, leading the Department of Commerce to announce it would close the airport if traffic were not stopped. Two days later, the United States Post Office Department declared it would suspend airmail operations at Washington-Hoover unless the road were closed, leading both houses of Congress to introduce legislation demanding closure and realignment of the road. A fight {{broke out in the}} United States Senate <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> for the road: Some Senators wanted Washington-Hoover's owners to pay $50,000 in exchange for a quitclaim deed from the War Department. The airport refused, calling this blackmail. Eventually, after several failed compromises, Congress passed and Roosevelt signed federal legislation permitting traffic to be temporarily stopped whenever planes took off or landed, and paying for guards to do the traffic stops.|$|E

Ray Burke {{was forced to}} resign as Minister for Foreign Affairs due to payments made to him, and the late Liam Lawlor was also being investigated <b>over</b> <b>payments</b> he received. Both were eventually jailed. Also, the Moriarty Tribunal revealed details of former leader Charles Haughey's financial affairs. His trial on these charges was postponed indefinitely after the judge in the case found {{that he would not be}} able to get a fair trial following prejudicial comments by Tánaiste Mary Harney.|$|R

25|$|The Romanians {{signed a}} {{contract}} for 36 AH-IV-R, as they were designated by ČKD, on 14 August 1936, including one prototype to be delivered in two months and the entire order in seven months. These deadlines were unable to be met as the Romanians demanded many changes, which all {{had to be made}} on the production line because ČKD had initiated production of the entire order before the prototype was accepted. The first ten tankettes off the production line were sent to Romania in October 1937 to participate in the autumn maneuvers when they made a favorable impression before being returned to the factory. The production run was completed the next month, but the Romanians refused to accept them as they didn't conform to the specifications. The required modifications took until April 1938 to perform, but another evaluation was required under summer conditions and they weren't formally accepted until August 1938. Nicolae Malaxa bought a license to produce the R-1 as the AH-IV-R was known in Romanian service, in September 1938, but irregularities and disputes <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> delayed the transfer of the production drawings until October 1939. His factory built one prototype, mostly from R-1 spare parts, but never began production.|$|E
500|$|In 1495, {{ten years}} after the burial, Henry VII paid for a marble and {{alabaster}} monument to mark Richard's grave. Its cost is recorded in surviving legal papers relating to a dispute <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> showing that two men received payments of £50 and £10.1s, respectively, to make and transport the tomb from Nottingham to Leicester. No first-person descriptions of the tomb survive, but Raphael Holinshed wrote in 1577 (perhaps quoting someone who had seen it in person) that it incorporated [...] "a picture of alabaster representing [...] person". Sir George Buck 40 years later wrote that it was [...] "a fair tomb of mingled colour marble adorned with his image". Buck also recorded the epitaph inscribed on the tomb.|$|E
2500|$|As the 1989 {{holiday season}} approached, Bill Naito {{agreed to take}} <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> of the sign's upkeep, even though the sign {{continued}} to advertise White Stag Sportswear, which had no connection with any Norcrest or Naito property. [...] "I miss the sign – I really do," [...] he told The Oregonian, {{when asked about his}} decision. [...] "So even after Christmas, I'm going to keep it on." [...] Eight years later, in 1997, the sign's wording was changed from White Stag to the name of a Naito-owned brand, the Made in Oregon retail store chain. [...] Norcrest China moved out of the building in 2004, but the sign retained the [...] "Made in Oregon" [...] wording until November 2010, when it was changed to [...] "Portland Oregon", after Ramsay Signs donated it to the city.|$|E

2500|$|But a {{performance}} of Stabat Mater in Vienna, in February 1888, fell victim to more anti-Czech feeling and what Dvořák called [...] "destructive criticism." [...] He heartily thanked Richter for his [...] "courage and devoted sympathy." [...] In 1890, influenced by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Dvořák also visited Russia, and conducted orchestras in Moscow and St. Petersburg performing his music. In 1891, Dvořák received an honorary degree from the University of Cambridge, and was offered a position at the Prague Conservatory as professor of composition and instrumentation. [...] At first he refused the offer, but then later accepted; this change of mind was seemingly {{a result of a}} quarrel with his publisher, Simrock, <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> for his Eighth Symphony. His Requiem was premiered later that year in Birmingham at the Triennial Music Festival.|$|E
2500|$|After {{watching}} the continual news broadcasts at the hotel, {{between the two}} shows, Epstein resolved to record a message to explain the Beatles' nonappearance at Malacañang Palace. The message was filmed by the government-owned Channel 5, at the Manila Hotel. When the segment was broadcast later that evening, however, the sound was distorted – a seemingly deliberate act – and Epstein's explanation was rendered inaudible. Barrow recalls that a backlash against the Beatles was evident straight after the evening show at Rizal, when their convoy of cars was briefly trapped behind a closed gate and surrounded by a large crowd of [...] "organised troublemakers". As the NEMS representative who had dealt directly with the Filipino promoter, Lewis was taken away by police officers during the night and subjected to a three-hour interrogation {{for his role in}} [...] "snubbing" [...] the Philippines. Lewis contacted the British Embassy, where Minford, in a telegram to the Foreign Office, reported that [...] "a technical hitch <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> of Philippine income tax" [...] was likely to delay the Beatles' departure. Death threats against the Beatles were reported at the embassy and at their hotel.|$|E
2500|$|Eleven {{days before}} the {{scheduled}} walk date, Wallenda faced a new challenge. [...] Official permits {{had not yet been}} granted in New York and park officials were threatening to cancel the event <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> issues. [...] Wallenda's managers claimed to be on schedule with the US$225,000 the state was charging him. [...] The park commission claimed that Wallenda's failure to sign the necessary paperwork was holding things up. [...] To avoid negative publicity, Wallenda's manager, David Simone, withdrew $75,000 from his personal account to foot the bill. [...] Permits were issued the next day. [...] However, two {{days before the}} event, New York parks threatened to pull the permits as Wallenda's team still owed over $10,000. According to Wallenda, [...] "the U.S. side was just nasty to deal with toward the end. They were accusing us of lying and saying we weren't fulfilling the contract." [...] However, he said the local officials were great to work with, blaming higher-ups in Albany for the problems. Maziarz acknowledged there were [...] "some tense moments", but said there was never any chance of the event not happening. [...] Ultimately, a wire transfer by ABC resolved the issue. No similar issues arose on the Canadian side.|$|E

2500|$|The {{official}} account came {{to light}} only in 1925 when the scholar Leslie Hotson discovered the coroner's report of the inquest on Marlowe's death, held two days later on Friday 1 June 1593, by the Coroner of the Queen's Household, William Danby. Marlowe had spent all day {{in a house in}} Deptford, owned by the widow Eleanor Bull, and together with three men: Ingram Frizer, Nicholas Skeres and Robert Poley. All three had been employed by one or other of the Walsinghams. Skeres and Poley had helped snare the conspirators in the Babington plot and Frizer would later describe Thomas Walsingham as his [...] "master" [...] at that time although his role was probably more that of a financial or business agent as he was for Walsingham's wife Audrey a few years later. These witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had argued <b>over</b> <b>payment</b> of the bill (now famously known as the 'Reckoning') exchanging [...] "divers malicious words" [...] while Frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch. Marlowe snatched Frizer's dagger and wounded him on the head. In the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner's report, Marlowe was stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly. The jury concluded that Frizer acted in self-defence, and within a month he was pardoned. Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of [...] immediately after the inquest, on 1 June 1593.|$|E
