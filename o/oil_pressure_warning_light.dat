5000|$|The bike's {{instrument}} cluster includes a compact analog step-motor speedometer and tachometer (both with LED illumination) and a digital LCD unit with odometer, trip meter, coolant temperature gauge, fuel gauge, LED neutral, digital clock, turn signal and {{high beam lights}} and an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The BSA Lightning was {{designed}} as the all-round sports machine of the 1960s, planned largely for export to the US market [...] to complement the touring Thunderbolt and the later development, the supersports Spitfire. Development of the engine aimed {{to make it more}} reliable, quieter and less prone to oil leaks, with top speed sacrificed to improve mid-range and rideability. Nevertheless, with twin carburettors the A65L could still reach 108 mph. Improvements included an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>light,</b> but this had a tendency to malfunction, so riders learned to ignore it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} on the Fairlane/Torino was all new for 1968. A new dashboard featured four equally sized round pods centred {{around the}} steering wheel. However, the pods {{did not contain}} {{a full set of}} gauges; rather an assortment of <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> along with the speedometer and fuel gauge. The fuel gauge and temperature <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> were in the first pod, a [...] speedometer was located in the second pod from the left, alternator and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> were in the third pod from the left and the fourth pod was blank. An optional tachometer was available, which would be located in the third pod, and an optional clock occupied the fourth pod. Ford offered many upholstery options, including a knitted vinyl option, called [...] "comfortweave." [...] This unique option allowed the vinyl to [...] "breathe" [...] unlike conventional vinyl, offering more comfort in hot weather. [...] Conforming to U.S. safety standards, there was much padding inside the Torino's interior, which also featured shoulder belts for front outboard passengers on all cars built after December 31, 1967.|$|R
5000|$|Colour {{may also}} {{communicate}} {{information about the}} nature of the tell-tale, for example red may signify that the vehicle cannot continue driving (e.g. <b>oil</b> <b>pressure).)</b> Many older vehicles used schemes which were specific to the manufacturer, e.g. some British Fords of the 1960's used green for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>warning,</b> while many other makes of the same era used amber for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 13 {{seconds after}} the extension, the crew noticed the {{hydraulic}} system A low <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> illuminated, and also the hydraulic system A quantity indicator showed zero. Captain Basuki asked First Officer Eri to check their landing configuration. After the check, the crew decided to continue its landing attempt. Captain Basuki then decided to fly the aircraft slightly below the glide slope.|$|R
50|$|Along with {{condition-based}} maintenance, {{planned maintenance}} comprises preventive maintenance, {{in which the}} maintenance event is preplanned, and all future maintenance is preprogrammed. Planned maintenance is created for every item separately according to manufacturers recommendation or legislation. Plans can be date-based, based on equipment running hours, or on the distance travelled by the vehicle. A good example of a planned maintenance program is car maintenance, where time and distance determine fluid change requirements. A good example of condition-based maintenance is the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> that provides notification that you should stop the vehicle because engine lubrication has stopped and failure will occur.|$|E

50|$|On 10 June 2013 a Xian MA60 {{passenger}} plane, Myanma Airways Flight 309, registered XY-AIP, {{sustained damage}} in a runway excursion accident at Kawthaung Airport (KAW), Myanmar. There were 64 persons on board, {{no one was}} injured. The Myanma Airways airplane operated on a domestic flight from Yangon to Mawlamyine and Kawthaung. Departing Mawlamyine at 11:10 hours local time, the flight was uneventful until the approach for landing. The aircraft was configured with landing gear when the “hydraulic <b>pressure</b> low”(LEFPL) <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> illuminated. After landing, the pilot started using manual braking and selected the nose gear to taxi mode. The airplane veered left and went off the runway, running into fence pillars, turning the aircraft 90 degrees to the left. The aircraft came to rest upon striking a tree with the left hand wing, 150 feet {{from the side of}} the runway.|$|R
2500|$|Both F-4 crewmen {{had landed}} in trees. Their wingmen had {{remained}} in the area, making repeated low level passes without a gun or ordnance to try {{to slow down the}} hostile forces trying to kill or capture the airmen. Jolly Green 02 lowered its hoist to the Phantom's rear seat pilot, 1st Lt. Joseph C. Merrick, who was suspended 150 feet in the air and had lashed himself to a tree. During the eight minutes of hover needed for Merrick to transfer from his parachute harness to the jungle penetrator and be brought up, Jolly Green 02 was hit numerous times from directly ahead and Merrick was twice wounded. Youngblood rotated its tail towards the gunfire to keep the pilots from being hit. As soon as Youngblood applied power to climb, the helicopter's transmission <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> failed, <b>warning</b> of imminent seizure of both engines. Youngblood broadcast a [...] "Mayday" [...] and searched for a field to make an emergency landing, flying six miles before spotting one.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary {{dashboards}} {{may include}} the speedometer, tachometer, odometer and fuel gauge, turn indicators, gearshift position indicator, seat belt <b>warning</b> <b>light,</b> parking-brake <b>warning</b> <b>light,</b> and engine-malfunction lights. Other features may include indicators for low fuel, low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> low tire pressure and faults in the airbag (SRS) systems, glove compartment, ashtray and a cigarette lighter or power outlet [...] - [...] {{as well as}} heating and ventilation systems, lighting controls, safety systems, entertainment equipment and information systems, e.g., navigation systems.|$|R
50|$|The '55 {{model year}} marks the {{introduction}} of a new chassis and the debut of the Chevrolet's legendary small block V8. The center door frame was beefed up for more safety. Brakes were 11 in drums. The Two-Ten buyer was free to choose any powertrain option available. The ammeter and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> gauges were changed to <b>warning</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> 1) no <b>oil</b> or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may be that the <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|R
50|$|All XR models had the {{features}} of the Futura plus their own features, including Tickford reprogrammed gear changes for the electronically controlled four-speed auto, Tickford developed sports suspension which included lower springs and upgraded swaybars, rear spoiler with built-in brake light standard on both wagons and sedans (rear-window-mounted stop light still present but disabled), limited slip differential standard with a lower ratio for increased acceleration, adjustable see-through sports front and rear headrests, 'Sports' front bucket seats with side bolsters, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and battery voltage gauges, 'Charcoal' leather-wrapped steering wheel, low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and washer fluid low <b>warning</b> <b>lights,</b> dual horn note.|$|R
50|$|The {{dashboard}} instrumentation includes speedometer with odometer, {{revolution counter}} and gauges showing <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> fuel, cooling water temperature, air pressure of both circuits and ammeter. There are lamps for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> indicators, alternator charging, differential interlock engagement, air <b>pressure</b> system <b>warning,</b> parking brake engagement and engine overheating indicator, and switches for headlights, heater and ventilation, windscreen wipers, indicators, differential interlock, hand throttle and engine shutdown; the models with tandem axle are also equipped with tandem lifting and lowering switches.|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers such as BMW, Honda, Toyota and Mercedes-Benz have {{included}} fuel-economy gauges in some instrument clusters, showing fuel mileage in real time. The ammeter was the gauge {{of choice for}} monitoring {{the state of the}} charging system until the 1970s. Later it was replaced by the voltmeter. Today most family vehicles have <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> instead of voltmeters or <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> gauges in their dashboard instrument clusters, though sports cars often have proper gauges for performance purposes and driver appeasement.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{vehicles}} had {{a single}} indicator labeled [...] or {{this was not a}} Check Engine Light, but a catch-all <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> to indicate trouble that was serious enough to portend an imminent breakdown. Early 1980s Fords, such as the LTD Crown Victoria, without the instrument option, had only this light, which indicated low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> overheating and carburetion problems without distinguishing among them. This usage of the [...] "engine" [...] light was discontinued in the mid-1980s to prevent confusion with the MIL.|$|R
50|$|Overheating is {{a serious}} concern for the engine, since the engine block is of an open-deck design, severe {{overheating}} could cause the cylinder barrels to warp and {{pull away from the}} head gasket, causing coolant leaks into the cylinders and cylinder scuffing. Maintaining oil and coolant levels is crucial for the engine. The engine is equipped with an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> switch which grounds out the primary-ignition system should the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> fall below 6 psi during operation, thus stopping and preventing the engine from being restarted until the oil level was replenished or the mechanical cause of low-oil pressure was remedied. Chevrolet dealers installed a coolant-recovery tank, a low-coolant <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> and extended Vega's engine warranty to 50000 mi to all Vega owners. This proved costly for Chevrolet.|$|R
5000|$|On 4 April 1994, a Saab 340 {{operating}} KLM Cityhopper Flight 433 crashed at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, killing {{three and}} seriously injuring nine people. A faulty <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> caused {{the crew to}} mistakenly believe that the engine suffered from low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> On final approach at a height of 90 ft, the captain decided to go around and gave full throttle, however only on the number one engine leaving the other in flight idle. Because of this, the aircraft rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank.|$|R
50|$|On 4 April 1994, Flight KL433 to Cardiff, a Saab 340 {{operated}} by KLM Cityhopper, returned to Schiphol after setting {{the number two}} engine to flight idle because the crew mistakenly believed that the engine suffered from low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> because of a faulty <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b> On final approach at a height of 90 ft, the captain decided to go-around and gave full throttle on only the number one engine leaving the other in flight idle. The airplane rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank. Of the twenty-four people on board, three were killed including the captain. Nine others were seriously injured.|$|R

25|$|The North American cars {{also had}} {{different}} equipment levels (depending on the version: Milano Silver, Milano Gold or Milano Platinum). L/h and r/h electrically adjustable outside mirrors, electrically reclining seats and cruise control were usually optional in Europe. The car was also available with a 3-speed ZF automatic gearbox {{option for the}} 2.5 V6. Other, more common options such as electrically operated rear windows and an A/C system were standard in the USA. The USA-cars also had different upholstery styles and of course different dashboard panels also indicating speed in mph, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> in psi and coolant temperature in degrees F, and as a final touch the AR control was different, including a seat belt <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Amsterdam at 12:19 pm. 11 minutes after takeoff, at 12:30 pm, the crew mistakenly believed that the number 2 engine suffered from low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> because of a faulty <b>warning</b> <b>light.</b> The captain retarded the no. 2 engine power lever slowly to flight idle, and the crew requested to return to Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. On short final (the last stage of flight before landing), at a height of 90 feet, the captain decided to go-around (abort the landing and try again) and gave full throttle. However he only gave full throttle on the number one engine, leaving the other in flight idle. Because of this, the airplane rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and hit the ground at 80 degrees bank.|$|R
5000|$|The {{model changes}} in early 1972 {{included}} {{the introduction of}} a top-of-the-line 2300 Sport SL model (introduced at the Geneva Motor Show), using the 2279 cc engine. The 2300 Sport SL was the only version to feature the seven dial dash (speedometer, clock, rev counter, fuel, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> water temp, & battery charge). The engine was an inclined four-cylinder with single overhead camshaft and twin Stromberg carburettors, producing [...] The oversquare straight four engine was renowned for its big torque curve, making the car very flexible and easy to drive. The interior was equipped with bucket seats, front and back, to carry four persons. The centre console with heater controls and <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> was quite distinctive and luxurious for the time.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{monitored}} by an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit, usually mounted to the block of the engine. This {{can either be}} a spring-loaded pressure sensor or an electronic pressure sensor, {{depending on the type}} of sending unit. Problems with the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit or the connections between it and the driver's display can cause abnormal <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> readings when <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is perfectly acceptable.|$|R
30|$|The highest {{operational}} risk in Europe {{is attributed to}} automatic LXs fitted with <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> but without barriers. The second highest risk is attributed to automatic LXs with <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> and with barriers.|$|R
5000|$|A central tunnel for {{the chassis}} {{structure}} is prominent in both {{front and rear}} footwells, and is straddled by a large front centre console with a polished open-gated gear selector and electronic warning-light panel. Electric windows (the front panes only are opening) and air-conditioning are standard fitments, with their controls on the central console. The handbrake is located outside the driver's seat beside the inner sill, and is a [...] "drop-down" [...] design to assist ingress and egress. A three-spoked leather steering wheel is mounted to a steering column adjustable for reach and rake, behind which is a [...] "pod-style" [...] instrument binnacle holding six gauges: speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, water temperature, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and <b>oil</b> temperature. The Mondial instrumentation is completed with a comprehensive set of <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> and electronic check panels.|$|R
40|$|The high {{incidence}} of accidents associated with work zones suggests that current <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> and signals have been in need of improvement. In this project we have developed and tested an improved emergency <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> intended specifically for Caltrans work zone vehicles, and an enhanced rear <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> for shadow trucks, both intended to improve visibility and conspicuity, and to reduce reaction times for drivers approaching the work zone. ...|$|R
5000|$|The eggcrate grille {{featured}} on the 1955 cars was widened {{into a series of}} rectangles for 1956, but this subtle exterior change was nothing compared to Ford's adoption of a 12-volt electrical system across the line. The Crown Victoria Skyliner's sales were plummeting with just 603 made, and it would be replaced by a convertible the next year. A new addition at midyear was the [...] "Town Victoria" [...] 4-door hardtop model which, along with the new Customline Victoria 2-door hardtop, were meant to compete with the Chevrolet Bel Air and Plymouth Belvedere. The Parklane, a Fairlane trimmed Tudor station wagon, was added to compete with the Chevrolet Nomad. There were new convenience options, such as a new air-conditioner system, a new heater, and a nine-tube signal-seeking radio. [...] Instead of gauges, instrument cluster <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> and ammeter were standard.|$|R
50|$|The China Bar and Alexandra tunnels have <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> {{that are}} {{activated}} by cyclists before {{they enter the}} tunnels. This was required because the tunnels are curved. It is expected that the Ferrabee tunnel will get the same <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> as it too is curved.|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, the Fairlane {{line was}} {{supplemented}} {{by the new}} Torino, and the Ranchero followed suit, becoming the largest model since the full-sized 1959. Overall, the new Ranchero was not only bigger, but also more angular than before with its more horizontal grille and horizontal headlamps; Ford and other automakers were making a switch back to horizontal quad headlamps. The interior was all new, as well, sharing the Torino/Fairlane's distinctive four-pod instrument cluster. Though the four round pods gave the illusion of an engine-turned dash, viewed from left to right, they instead featured <b>warning</b> <b>lights</b> for coolant temperature (both cold and hot) and the left turn signal indicator in the left pod with the speedometer in the second pod {{directly in front of}} the driver. Warning lights for the charging system and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> as well as the right turn signal indicator, were located third from the left. In upscale models, this pod was supplanted by a tachometer. An optional clock filled the fourth pod; a decorative [...] "clock delete" [...] panel otherwise filled the space. A seat belt <b>warning</b> <b>light</b> was a new feature, too, lighting briefly in the far left pod whenever the engine was started. The model line also featured wraparound front side marker lamps which doubled as parking lights and rear side reflectors, newly mandated by US law for the 1968 model year.|$|R
40|$|The {{basis of}} {{the design of the}} oil system of a H. V. oil filled cable circuit is {{considered}} in particular the choice of oil feed locations along the cable route. Methods are established for determining the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tank requirements and the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> response on application of step or pulse loads for typical oil sections of a single core H. V. oil filled cable circuit. These methods are applied to an existing 132 KV installation and minimum <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tankage requirements and the maximum and minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> considering various loading conditions determined. To establish the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> occurring on switching off various continuous loads are compared to that occurring on switching off load shortly after having switched on. Recommendations are made for similar circuits based on the loading condition giving the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Possible ways of verifying the theoretical methods and en electrical analogue of the oil system are considered...|$|R
