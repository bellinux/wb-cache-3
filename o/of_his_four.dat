He {{subsequently}} went to Oxford University and appeared in the annual match against Cambridge in each <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>four</b> years. His total of 3,319 first-class runs is a record for the Oxford University team, and he is {{regarded as one of the}} best university cricketers ever.

5|$|After a {{recruiting}} battle between Louisiana State University and the University of Texas, Tittle chose to attend LSU in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and {{play for the}} LSU Tigers. He {{was part of a}} successful 1944 recruiting class under head coach Bernie Moore that included halfbacks Jim Cason, Dan Sandifer, and Ray Coates. Freshmen were eligible to play on the varsity during World War II, so Tittle saw playing time immediately. He later said the finest moment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>four</b> years at LSU was beating Tulane as a freshman, a game in which he set a school record with 238 passing yards. It was one of two games the Tigers won that season.|$|E

In 1908, he pitched a perfect game during a tight pennant race that saw Cleveland finish a half-game out of first place; it was the closest that Joss came to a World Series berth. The 1910 season was his last, and Joss missed most of the year due to injury.|$|E

5|$|Although Brock's {{achievements}} in Canada were overshadowed by larger-scale fighting in Europe, {{his death was}} still widely noted, particularly in Guernsey. In London, he is remembered at a memorial in St Paul's Cathedral.

He died at the Battle of Queenston Heights before learning of his knighthood.|$|E
5|$|Australia has {{competed in}} either the long track or short track forms of speed skating at every Olympics that it has attended, except 1964.

Colin Hickey finished seventh in 1956 in the 500 and 1,000m long track speed skating, and placed 13th and 14th four years later.

5|$|Confessions was commercially successful, selling 1.096 {{million copies}} in the United States in its first week of release. It became the highest-ever first week sales by an R artist, the second-highest first week sales for a male artist, and the seventh-highest first week sales of the {{recorded}} album charts history by SoundScan {{at the time of}} its release. It also equates the combined first-week sales <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>four</b> previous album releases, including his live album called Live. The feat also carved history in Arista records having the first in any of their released albums to reach such sales. The success of the thirty-year-old record label, however, was attributed to its merging with Zomba Records. As of March 2013 it has the tenth highest first week album sales in history.|$|E
5|$|England's {{most recent}} inductees into the IRB Hall are 19th-century internationals Alfred St. George Hamersley and Robert Seddon, both {{inducted}} in 2013. Hamersley played for England in the first-ever rugby union international against Scotland in 1871, and captained England {{in the last}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>four</b> appearances in 1874. He went on to play significant roles in the early development of the sport in both New Zealand and Canada. Seddon, capped three times for England in 1887, was most notable as {{the captain of the}} unofficial British side that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1888; he died in a boating accident during the tour. This venture proved to be the genesis of the modern British and Irish Lions. The touring team was also inducted alongside Seddon.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Augustus (5 June 1771– 18 November 1851) was King of Hanover from 20 June 1837 {{until his}} death. He {{was the fifth}} son and eighth child of King George III of the United Kingdom and Hanover. As a fifth son, Ernest seemed {{unlikely}} to become a monarch, but none <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>four</b> elder brothers had a legitimate son who survived infancy. The Salic Law, which barred succession to or through a female, prevailed in Hanover; therefore, when his elder brother King William IV died in 1837, Ernest succeeded him as King of Hanover. In the United Kingdom the succession to the monarchy was determined by primogeniture and his niece Victoria succeeded to the throne, thus ending the personal union between the British and Hanoverian crowns that had existed since 1714.|$|E
