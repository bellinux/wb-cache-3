5|$|Following the {{disbanding}} of the Iraqi Army, insurgent activity increased, {{especially in}} Fallujah. Initially, armed resistance groups could {{be characterized as}} either Sunni nationalists who wanted {{to bring back the}} Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency</b> in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the invasion, the pro-Saddam {{forces in}} Anbar–the Ba'ath Party, the Republican Guard, the Fedayeen Saddam, and the Iraqi Intelligence Service–remained intact. Saddam hid in Ramadi and Hīt in early April. Other pro-Saddam forces were able to {{relocate}} from Anbar to Syria with money and weapons, where they set up headquarters. The nucleus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency</b> in its first few months was formed from the pro-Saddam forces in Anbar and Syria. In contrast to the looting throughout Baghdad {{and other parts of the}} country, Ba'athist headquarters and homes of high-ranking Sunni leaders were relatively untouched. The head of Iraqi ground forces in the province, General Mohammed Jarawi, formally surrendered to elements of the 3rd Infantry Division at Ramadi on 15 April 2003.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency,</b> the MNLA had largely split into {{small groups of}} guerrillas, which existed by basing {{themselves}} in a chosen rural area, subverting local villagers and accumulating from them manpower and supplies. The lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{advances}} by <b>the</b> <b>insurgency,</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency</b> made {{a series}} of fatal strategic errors. The successes made by the revolutionary forces in Nicaragua against the Somoza regime combined with <b>the</b> <b>insurgency's</b> own successes against the Lucas government led rebel leaders to falsely conclude that a military equilibrium was being reached in Guatemala, thus <b>the</b> <b>insurgency</b> underestimated <b>the</b> military strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government. <b>The</b> <b>insurgency</b> subsequently found itself overwhelmed, and was unable to secure its advances and protect the indigenous civilian population from reprisals by the security forces.|$|R

5|$|On 16 May, Morgan {{was in a}} {{position}} to advance in force into Merthyr, pushing forward and taking advantage of the poor communications between the various elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency.</b> The uprising collapsed, and over the next few days the authorities regained control, making arrests and forcing the workers back to business. Government inquiries into the incident began and Bute, among others, provided analysis and reports to Whitehall. In the aftermath, Richard Lewis, one of the radical crowd, was hanged in Cardiff. The execution proved controversial and it is unknown whether Bute, who had by then left to attend Parliament in London, approved of the decision.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency</b> numbered {{no more than}} 4–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early {{as the end of}} the Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate his relationship with the communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.|$|E
5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, {{not all of them}} were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became increasingly concerned {{about the quality of the}} opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency.</b> Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E

5|$|While MacLachlan was in England {{finding his}} experts, feuding {{continued}} in Alberta. Aberhart fired William Chant, a known Douglasite, from his cabinet after {{he refused to}} resign. Both sides accused one another of subservience to the banking industry, the Social Credit League's sworn enemy. Baker, the board's sole Aberhart loyalist, travelled the province defending his premier; at one 4,000person meeting in Calgary, he was shouted down by angry supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency.</b> A petition calling for Aberhart's resignation circulated among backbenchers, and {{proved to be a}} plant by the cabinet to test MLAs' loyalty. Outwardly, however, the Social Crediters showed a united front as they awaited the promised experts; in the first recorded vote after the legislature reconvened June7, all insurgents present voted with the government, though 13 were absent.|$|E
5|$|Questions then arose {{among the}} U.S. {{administration}} and military leadership {{as to the}} best method by which Hanoi (the perceived locus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency)</b> could be dissuaded from its course of action. The answer seemed to lie {{in the application of}} air power. By 1964 most of the civilians surrounding President Lyndon B. Johnson shared the Joint Chiefs of Staff's collective faith in the efficacy of strategic bombing to one degree or another. They reasoned that a small nation like North Vietnam, with a tiny industrial base that was just emerging after the First Indochina War, would be reluctant to risk its new-found economic viability to support the insurgency in the south. Constantly affecting this decision-making process were fears of possible counter moves or outright intervention by the Soviet Union, the PRC, or both. The civilians and the military were divided, however, on the manner of affecting Hanoi's will to support the southern insurgency. The civilians thought in terms of changing the regime's behavior while the military men were more concerned with breaking its will.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{reacted to}} the {{political}} changes in Cambodia by sending Premier Phạm Văn Đồng to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol Pot and Sihanouk were actually in Beijing {{at the same time}} but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol Pot or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. In May 1970, Pol Pot finally returned to Cambodia and the pace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency</b> greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.|$|E

50|$|Despite those events, <b>the</b> {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{republic in}} 1910 was controversial {{to the local}} society. The hostilities between republicans and monarchists became more serious in 1917 and the Monarchy was declared as restored in Póvoa on January 20, 1919, a day after it was declared in Porto.

5|$|Thơ {{turned against}} Diệm {{and played a}} passive role in the coup. Upon the {{formation}} of the new government, he struggled to keep the nation under control as the MRC and civilian cabinet often gave contradictory orders. Media freedom and political debate were increased, but this backfired as Saigon became engulfed in infighting, and Thơ had a series of newspapers shut down after they used the new-found freedom to attack him. During that time, South Vietnam's military situation deteriorated as the consequences of Diệm's falsification of military statistics and the misguided policies that resulted were exposed. Minh and Thơ had a plan to try to end the war by winning over non-communist members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency,</b> believing that they constituted the majority of the opposition and could be coaxed away, weakening the communists. As part of this policy, which the U.S. opposed, the government chose to take a low-key military approach in an attempt to portray themselves to the Vietnamese public as peacemakers. However, they were deposed in Khánh's U.S.-backed coup before they could pursue their strategy.|$|E
5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought that military force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency</b> in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this research is}} to validate <b>the</b> systems model <b>of</b> <b>insurgency</b> and counterinsurgency by examining two case studies in counterinsurgency; the Emergency in Malaya from 1948 - 1960 and the ongoing war in El Salvador.

Nance cites the 2003 Iraq war by the Bush Administration for causing regional instability. He criticizes Coalition Provisional Authority leader Paul Bremer. The book emphasizes lessons the U.S. neglected {{to learn from the}} Vietnam War, the Iraqi revolt against the British, and the South Lebanon conflict. Nance writes in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iran nuclear deal framework by the Obama Administration, saying it is in <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> all parties involved.|$|R

25|$|At {{the height}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>insurgency,</b> 1.8 {{million people in}} the north were living in camps. Peace talks {{beginning}} in 2005 promised some relief to these people, and some camps were closed in 2007 as security in the north improved.

Around 2004 some Thai analysts believed that foreign Islamic terrorist groups were infiltrating the area, and that foreign funds and arms are being brought in, though again, such claims were balanced by an equally large body of opinion suggesting this remains a distinctly local conflict.|$|E
