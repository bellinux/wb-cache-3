5000|$|Japanese Society (1970) is an {{analysis}} of the structure of Japanese society, written by Nakane Chie.

5|$|Freya {{served in}} the German fleet for the initial years of her career, unlike her sister ships, all of which served abroad on foreign stations. As a result, she led a fairly uneventful career in the fleet. After a {{modernization}} in 1905–1907, Freya {{was used as a}} school ship for cadets, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>was</b> Günther Lütjens. While visiting Canada in 1908, she accidentally rammed and sank a Canadian schooner, killing nine sailors. At the outbreak of World War I, Freya was mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, but served in front-line duty only briefly. She was used as a barracks ship after 1915, and ultimately sold for scrapping in 1921.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January, a {{group of}} rebels {{attacked}} a Catholic mission at Nguludi belonging to Father Swelsen. The mission was defended by four African armed guards, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>was</b> killed, Father Swelsen was also wounded in the fighting and the church was burnt down. The military and militia forces assaulted Mbombwe again the same day but encountered no resistance. Many rebels, including Chilembwe, had fled the village disguised as civilians. Mbombwe's fall and the government troops' subsequent demolition of Chilembwe's church with dynamite ended the rebellion. Kaduya was captured and brought back to Magomero where he was publicly executed.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin had no {{legitimate}} descendants, {{though it}} is probable he had illegitimate issue. Four of his five sisters {{lived long enough to}} bear children, but only the daughters of his sister Marfa Elena (sometimes rendered as 'Helen') received Potemkin's special attention. The five unmarried Engelhardt sisters arrived in court in 1775 on the direction of their recently widowed father Vassily. Legend suggests Potemkin soon seduced many of the girls, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>was</b> twelve or thirteen at the time. An affair with the third eldest, Varvara, can be verified; after that had subsided, Potemkin formed close—and probably amorous—relationships successively with Alexandra, the second eldest, and Ekaterina, the fifth.|$|E

5|$|After {{treating}} the Thessalian families of Peisidice and Canace, the poet {{turned to the}} intermingled Aetolian-Elian lines of Calyce and Perimede. Perimede had earlier in the book borne two sons to the river Achelous, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>was</b> the grandfather of Oeneus, Hippodamas. To Aethlius Calyce bore Endymion, whose son Aetolus was the eponym of Aetolia and the great-grandfather of Demodice and Porthaon, through whom the later Aetolian and Elian genealogies were traced. Somewhere within these families, Eurytus and Cteatus were found in a form more fearsome {{than they were in}} the Iliad: in the Catalogue they were fierce conjoined twins with two heads, four arms and an equal number of legs. Most significant for the epic tradition, however, was the marriage of Demodice's son Thestius and Porthaon's daughter Eurythemiste which produced the daughters Leda, Althaea and Hypermestra, who are introduced in a group Ehoiai at fr. 23a.3–5.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1942, over 1,000 {{children}} {{that had been}} rounded up during the Kozara Offensive were being held at the Stara Gradiška concentration camp, itself a sub-camp of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex. Information {{about the plight of}} these children was passed to concerned citizens in the NDH capital, Zagreb, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>whom</b> <b>was</b> Diana Budisavljević, an Austrian. Budisavljević approached an Ustaše-appointed {{member of the board of}} the Croatian Red Cross, Kamilo Brosler, and told him about the children at Stara Gradiška. Brosler was horrified, and with the support of representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross began to place pressure on the NDH government to release the children. Budisavljević also used her contacts with the German Army to intervene with the Ustaše regime on behalf of the children.|$|E
