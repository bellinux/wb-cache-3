Effectively, this whole package called the Palestinian state, with all that it entails, has been removed indefinitely from <b>our</b> <b>agenda.</b> And all this with authority and permission.

The peace process is the evacuation of settlements, it's the return of refugees, it's the partition of Jerusalem. And all that has now been frozen.... what I effectively agreed to with the Americans was that part of the settlements would not be dealt with at all, and the rest will not be dealt with until the Palestinians turn into Finns.

As educators, the collective response of our field to these criticisms has largely taken place on a methodological level. For instance, the North American Association for Environmental Education prepared standards and guidelines to try to strengthen the credibility of environmental education (EE). There have also been calls for more rigorous reviews of existing EE materials and attempts to highlight "quality " environmental education materials as if to say to the world, "See we're not entirely bad. " In this article I argue that the response to criticisms leveled against the field of environmental education has been inadequate, largely because it fails to address the political context of the criticisms.

Erdoğan also argued that the AK Party government had embarked on this journey with the inspiration it received from messages given by artists. “We set off on the road after having seen the issues raised by artists, starting from their products, and taking inspiration and strength from them.

50|$|As Goldsmith’s {{presidency}} continued, {{the original}} support she had from Smeal appeared to slip away, as rumors and speculations surfaced that Smeal {{was going to}} run for the presidency again. When Smeal announced she was running in the 1985 election, she said that it was due to her belief that Goldsmith was too moderate and did not focus on the issues that were important to herself. Goldsmith often met with politicians, and felt that progress could only be made when women were elected into political positions. On the issues of abortion and equal rights, Goldsmith said, It is on <b>our</b> <b>agenda</b> {{but it is not the}} most propitious time to bring it up. We are not interested in exercises in futility. We must change the political landscape and get more women elected before we try again". Smeal, however, said that there “was a wish that NOW become more outspoken, assertive and publicly active on a number of issues,” and that she favored a national program for direct action now. This can't wait for another 10 years, she said. We can't decide that we want it and then do nothing". Goldsmith said, in defense of her methods, that Loud may be good, but it is not only the level of decibels that is heard". Their methods were seen as very different and is what led to the intense battle for the presidency. For example, the two leaders approached anti-abortion terrorism in different ways. Goldsmith sent a telegram to President Reagan, demanding an investigation, and then later called on President Reagan, when she received no response, by telling reporters how she felt during a White House pickett. Smeal, however, led the first March for Women’s Lives in 1986, which drew over 150,000 people to Washington and Los Angeles in support of women’s reproductive rights. Goldsmith believed in accomplishing NOW’s goals through politics while Smeal felt rallies, demonstrations, and protests were the better method, illustrated when Smeal said “It’s time to go back on the streets, go on the campuses and show we’re the majority” in 1985.|$|E
