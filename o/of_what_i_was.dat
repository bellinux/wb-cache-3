5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
500|$|From childhood, Woods {{was raised}} as a Buddhist, and he {{actively}} practiced this faith from childhood {{until well into}} his adult professional golf career. In a 2000 article, Woods {{was quoted as saying}} he [...] "believes in Buddhism... Not every aspect, but most of it." [...] He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said, [...] "Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously I lost track <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> taught." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the photo}} book Kylie / Fashion, Emmett {{commented on the}} [...] "Cowboy Style" [...] and Impossible Remixes photo shoot;: [...] "There are no fashion {{constraints}} with Kylie... Her natural poise and dynamism transcended all typical props and accessories. We've made great use here of our easy rapport." [...] Minogue commended the photo shoot at the time, saying [...] "So much <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing at this time had a tiny budget so I {{brought a lot of}} pieces, including the pink glitter stick roll, from home [...] It was a great, simple shoot with a lot of heart." ...|$|E

500|$|American singer Christina Aguilera rose to {{prominence}} {{with the success}} of her 1999 self-titled debut album. It topped the US Billboard 200 and was certified eight times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. It produced three Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles: [...] "Genie in a Bottle", [...] "What a Girl Wants", and [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)". Despite the success, Aguilera was displeased with being marketed as her then-manager Steve Kurtz desired, and felt unable to control her image. She told The Sydney Morning Herald her dissatisfaction with being a part of the late 1990s teen pop trend, [...] "The label [...] wanted to push the cookie-cutter, [...] almost virginal kind of imagery that wasn't me," [...] Aguilera said. [...] "I really wanted to squirm away from that, because I really thought it was really fake and superficial and untrue <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> about." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1966, {{he began}} a thirty-month stint in France as a Mormon missionary, a {{traditional}} rite of passage in his family. He arrived in Le Havre, where he shared cramped quarters under meager conditions. Rules against drinking, smoking, and dating were strictly enforced. Most individual Mormon missionaries do not gain many converts and Romney was no exception: he later estimated ten to twenty for his entire mission. He initially became demoralized and later recalled it as the only time when [...] "most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to do was}} rejected." [...] He soon gained recognition within the mission for the many homes he called on and the repeat visits he was granted. He was promoted to zone leader in Bordeaux in early 1968, and soon thereafter became assistant to the mission president in Paris. Residing at the Mission Home for several months, he enjoyed a mansion far more comfortable than the digs he had had elsewhere in the country. When the French expressed opposition to the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, Romney debated them. Those who yelled at him and slammed their doors in his face merely reinforced his resolve.|$|E
500|$|Simpson {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the album's twelve songs as being similar to keeping a diary, and before the album's US release she said that [...] "My inspiration came from what I have gone through in the past three years. Every single day I was thinking <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going through and would write songs about it." [...] The lyrics primarily deal with love and heartbreak; in particular, much of the album's lyrical content was inspired by Simpson's breakup with her boyfriend at the time, Josh Henderson. She has {{described the}} album as being [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "very true to my emotions"—"I wasn't afraid to say that I was hurting and how I got over it." [...] Simpson worked closely with a number of experienced songwriters on the album. The album's producer, John Shanks—who won a Grammy in February 2005, in part for his work as producer on Autobiography—receives songwriting credit alongside Simpson on all but two songs. Kara DioGuardi also receives songwriting credit, together with Simpson and Shanks, on seven of the songs, including the three singles. (See the track listing.) ...|$|E

6000|$|There was silence. Lydgate thought, [...] "If she has any {{trust in}} me--any notion <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> {{she ought to}} speak now and say {{that she does not}} believe I have {{deserved}} disgrace." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{reviewing}} the premiere release of Shojo Beat, IGN's Jessica Chobot sharply criticized the magazine. She felt it looked and read [...] "like a teenie-bopper magazine" [...] {{and referred to}} the issue's cover as a [...] "bright, hot-pink, migraine-inducing, bubble-lettered spectacle". She considered the contents boring, and disagreed with Viz's selection of series, noting, [...] "it's as if Viz had taken everything from their backed-up reject pile and tried to pull one over on the female populace. 90% <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> reading was either poorly drawn or poorly written (more often than not, it was both)." [...] Comic World News David Welsh disagreed, as {{he felt that the}} magazine had several good series, and he praised Nana, Absolute Boyfriend and Crimson Hero as the top three series of the initial issue. Greg McElhatton, co-founder of [...] and former reviewer for iComics.com, praised the magazine's mainstream appearance, calling it a [...] "smart" [...] decision, as it would draw in its target audience by visually showing them that it's a magazine for teenage girls. While he felt that two of the manga titles in the premiere issue had weak openings, he found that the magazine was [...] "off to a good, if not great start".|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the songs}} for The Beatles were written during a Transcendental Meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, India, between February and April 1968. The retreat {{involved}} long periods of meditation, conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly endeavours – a chance, in John Lennon's words, to [...] "get away from everything". Both Lennon and Paul McCartney quickly re-engaged themselves in songwriting, often meeting [...] "clandestinely in the afternoons in each other's rooms" [...] to review their new work. [...] "Regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> supposed to be doing," [...] Lennon later recalled, [...] "I did write {{some of my best}} songs there." [...] Author Ian MacDonald said Sgt Pepper was [...] "shaped by LSD", but the Beatles took no drugs with them to India aside from marijuana, and their clear minds helped the group with their songwriting. The stay in Rishikesh proved especially fruitful for George Harrison as a songwriter, coinciding with his re-engagement with the guitar after two years studying the sitar. The musicologist Walter Everett likens Harrison's development as a composer in 1968 to that of Lennon and McCartney five years before, although he notes that Harrison became [...] "privately prolific", given his customary junior status in the group.|$|E
500|$|Prop master Rob Smith {{joined the}} series during its second season, {{and had to}} quickly learn about all the gadgets {{featured}} in Fringes debut season. Smith was asked to create a [...] "neural stimulator" [...] in the script to [...] "Momentum Deferred", but [...] "didn’t really know the episodes well enough to say, ‘Oh, ok, that’s exactly what it is.’ So I talked to the director, {{who had been on}} season 1, and he goes, ‘Oh, I don’t know, it’s just something that goes on the guy’s head'." [...] Smith discovered that the headpiece in question had been rented during the first season, causing him to recreate the prop over one weekend. He called this process [...] "a little bit stressful." [...] The gadget, Smith explained, was important because it [...] "defined the way that Walter works. He’s this mad scientist who takes conventional science and then puts his own twist on it, as it were. And then the thing that struck me about that one was that it made me uncomfortable to look at it." [...] Smith added, [...] "It’s {{one of those things that}} people love and hate about Fringe, it puts your [...] out of your comfort zone. That’s sort <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to say about Walter… there’s kind of a bird’s nest of wires everywhere, and then they end up on the guy’s head, and from that he can tell what the guy’s thinking. It’s quite cool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, [...] "I {{can prove}} to you, if you will, that it <b>is</b> not bluff. <b>I</b> can prove {{to you that}} I really know {{something}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> talking about." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{recordings}} from Sea Change sessions include {{themes of}} heartbreak and desolation, solitude and loneliness. Although often compared to Mutations, Beck himself regarded the album, in a 2008 interview, as {{more representative of}} his 1994 album One Foot in the Grave and [...] "more representative <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Sandé's {{debut album}} was {{released}} on 13 February 2012. She {{said that it is}} very hard to imagine that she is releasing an album with Virgin Records. She said that she was always going to [...] "definitely" [...] release an album, if she was signed or not. However, she stated that she did not think there would be [...] "this much anticipation, or acknowledgement <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing". She said she loves to be in the limelight and that people are talking about her so much. She said she only loves the attention because she has experienced the other side, when no one cares.|$|E

2500|$|Evel Knievel {{took great}} pride in his core values. Throughout his career and later life he would {{repeatedly}} talk {{about the importance of}} [...] "keeping his word". He stated that although he knew he may not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would. Prior to the canyon jump, Knievel stated, [...] "If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' Do me a favor. Tell him that you saw me here and regardless <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> that you knew me, and that I kept my word." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} in 1915 when I was {{deeply involved in}} cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing, I had {{a visit from the}} writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, [...] "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." [...] And he answered in a slightly mocking way, [...] "What do you know about crystals?" [...] At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.|$|E
