5|$|In the 1880s Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T. Field of New Jersey {{started an}} {{enterprise}} {{to develop the}} Florida coast from Key Biscayne to Jupiter by clearing native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach dunes, and planting coconuts. Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked coconuts from the Caribbean, of which 76,000 were planted <b>on</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts <b>on</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris). As {{a result of their}} efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront land from the Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70cents an acre.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} debates, hustings {{and other events}} were {{arranged}} {{over the course of}} the campaign. The first major debate was hosted by the LSE on 28 January and attended by Berry, Goldsmith, Khan, Pidgeon and Whittle. Housing and transport were major topics of the debate, with Martin Hosick of MayorWatch impressed by the performances of Pidgeon and Whittle. Through February and early March a series of sponsored debates <b>on</b> <b>key</b> topics took place, including two on housing, one on technology, and one covering green issues.|$|E
5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} <b>on</b> <b>key</b> issues like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E

5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation <b>on</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit trees had been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{break for}} {{the first part of the}} VB Series of One Day Internationals, England moved to Melbourne for the fourth Test. Unfortunately for Key, he fell for a duck in the first innings, trapped leg before wicket (lbw) second ball by fast bowler Brett Lee.

He eventually fell just after the new ball was taken, caught at second slip for 52.|$|E

5|$|Key Biscayne {{was first}} {{developed}} for coconut cultivation. The earliest mention of coconuts <b>on</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne is a Spanish account from 1568, although the reference {{may be to}} cocoplums rather than coconuts. Mature coconut trees were on Cape Florida by the 1830s, likely grown from coconuts sent from Mexico by Henry Perrine to the first lighthouse keeper, John Dubose.|$|E

40|$|Pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} 5. 0 mg/kg pentobarbital from saline under a concurrent fixed-interval (FI) FI schedule of food presentation on which, after pentobarbital administration, responses <b>on</b> one <b>key</b> were reinforced with food under an FI 60 -s component and responses <b>on</b> the other <b>key</b> were reinforced under an FI 240 -s component. After saline administration, the schedule contingencies <b>on</b> the two <b>keys</b> were reversed. After both pentobarbital and saline, pigeons responded more frequently <b>on</b> the <b>key</b> <b>on</b> which responses had been programmed to produce the reinforcer under the FI 60 component of the concurrent schedule. The schedule was changed to concurrent FI 150 FI 150 s for drug-substitution tests. In each bird, increasing doses of pentobarbital, ethanol, and chlordiazepoxide produced increases {{in the proportion of}} responses <b>on</b> the <b>key</b> <b>on</b> which responses had been reinforced under the FI 60 component after pentobarbital administration during training sessions. The proportion of responses <b>on</b> that <b>key</b> was slightly lower for ethanol than for chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital. At a dose of pentobarbital higher than the training dose, responding decreased <b>on</b> the <b>key</b> that had been reinforced under the FI 60 component during training sessions. Phencyclidine produced less responding <b>on</b> the <b>key</b> programmed under the FI 60 -s component than did pentobarbital. Methamphetamine produced responding primarily <b>on</b> the <b>key</b> <b>on</b> which responses had been reinforced under the FI 60 -s component after saline administration...|$|R
5|$|October 15, 1999- Hurricane Irene makes {{landfall}} <b>on</b> <b>Key</b> West {{and later}} Cape Sable, producing heavy rainfall peaking at 17.45inches (443mm) in Boynton Beach.

5|$|The Florida Land Boom was over. There was no bridge {{built and}} no {{development}} <b>on</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne {{for the next}} two decades. William Matheson died in 1930, leaving the island to his children. In 1939, the U.S. Navy approved a proposal to develop Virginia Key as an air base and sea port.

5|$|Throughout {{this period}} Madagascar {{continued}} {{to engage the}} French in negotiations, but these were to prove unsuccessful with both sides unwilling to capitulate <b>on</b> <b>key</b> points of contention. After two years of stalemate, a column brought an ultimatum to Antananarivo in December 1885, asking for recognition of French rights in northeastern Madagascar, a French protectorate over the Sakalava, recognition of French property principles and an indemnity of 1,500,000 francs. This peace treaty was ratified by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony in January 1886 and French government representatives two months later.|$|E

5|$|A {{military}} post {{was established}} <b>on</b> <b>Key</b> Biscayne in March 1838. Its first commander was Lt. Col. James Bankhead.

He was killed when the Seminoles ambushed two boats on the Miami River in February 1839. In the summer of 1839, a total of 143 soldiers and sailors were stationed at Fort Russell. Some of the Seminoles captured during the war were held at Fort Russell until they could be placed on ships to be removed to Indian Territory.|$|E

5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus <b>on</b> <b>key</b> issues threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E
