5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter that acts as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted goat cheese or ground walnuts and cinnamon. It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
5|$|Princess Victoria of Kent is the heiress {{presumptive}} to {{the throne}} during {{the last years of}} the reign of her uncle King William IV and is subject to a political tug of war for influence over her. On the <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> her mother, the Duchess of Kent, along with the comptroller of the Duchess's household, Sir John Conroy, who tries to force Victoria to sign papers declaring a regency and giving him and her mother power.|$|E
5|$|She {{identifies}} the UN as the book's villain and criticizes the UN's practise of moral equivalency that treats both sides equally even though <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> clearly dominant and brutally oppressive. It {{results in the}} requirement of its personnel to remain neutral but Off questions how a peacekeeper can remain neutral while watching people being killed. The book treats this as a reality of international relations, which places precedence on state sovereignty over human rights, and a factor in making the UN slow, ineffectual, and inappropriately bureaucratic. She notes that some peacekeepers cope by demonizing all sides which helps diminish the sense of impotence in being unable to intervene.|$|E

5|$|The battle system {{takes place}} on a 3D {{battlefield}} in real-time, instead of the turn-based system of the campaign. Battles {{are similar to those}} in , where two armies from opposing factions engage in combat until <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> defeated or withdraws. Warfare in Medieval: Total War occurs when the player or the artificial intelligence moves their armies into a province held by a hostile faction. The player is then presented with the option of fighting the battle on the battle map, or allowing the computer to automatically resolve it. Alongside the campaign battles, players have the option of both historical and custom battles, where the player controls what climate, units and terrain will be present on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread of misinformation.|$|E
5|$|The {{motorcycle}} {{technology of}} the late 1970s featured engines with power in excess of what the frames and tires of the day could accommodate. Roberts' riding style, bred on the dirt tracks of America, revolutionized road racing. Prior to his arrival in Europe, riders focused on attaining high entry speeds into corners, leaving braking until the last possible moment then, carving graceful arcs through the corners with both wheels in line. Roberts did just the opposite, braking early then, quickly applying the throttle {{which resulted in the}} rear tire breaking traction and spinning. The resulting tire spin caused the motorcycle to buck and shake as it continually lost then regained traction, creating a brutal, violent riding style that no one had ever seen before on the racetracks of Europe. His riding style was reminiscent of dirt track riding, where sliding the rear tire to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> used as a method to steer the motorcycle around a corner. Because of his early application of the throttle, he was able to attain top speed faster than his competitors.|$|E

On <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> {{the image of}} the Emperor and Saint Demetrius upright and holding a scepter with a star. On the other side is depicted Christ Pantocrator. These coins were probably minted in the Thessalonica mint. Their weight is between 3.00 and 3.08grams.|$|E
25|$|The game ends when <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> {{completely}} dominant {{over the}} other, or when 20 minutes are up, in which case, whichever side is winning {{at the time}} is declared the winner.

25|$|The {{globalization}} movement isn't anti-Semitic, it just hasn't fully {{confronted the}} implications of diving into the Middle East conflict. Most {{people on the left}} are simply choosing sides. In the Middle East, where <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> under occupation and the other has the U.S. military behind it, the choice seems clear. But it is possible to criticize Israel while forcefully condemning the rise of anti-Semitism. And it is equally possible to be pro-Palestinian independence without adopting a simplistic pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel dichotomy, a mirror image of the good-versus-evil equations so beloved by President George W. Bush.|$|E

25|$|The {{look-ahead}} {{function is}} designed to overcome the problem of being forced to compromise between slow attack rates that produce smooth-sounding gain changes, and fast attack rates capable of catching transients. Look-ahead is a misnomer in that the future is not actually observed. Instead, the input signal is split, and <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> delayed. The non-delayed signal is used to drive the compression of the delayed signal, which then appears at the output. This way a smooth-sounding slower attack rate {{can be used to}} catch transients. The cost of this solution is that the signal is delayed.|$|E
25|$|On average, a {{civil war}} with interstate {{intervention}} was 300% longer than those without. When disaggregated, {{a civil war}} with intervention on only <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> 156% longer, while when intervention occurs on both sides the average civil war is longer by an additional 92%. If one of the intervening states was a superpower, a civil war is a further 72% longer; a conflict such as the Angolan Civil War, {{in which there is}} two-sided foreign intervention, including by a superpower (actually, two superpowers in the case of Angola), would be 538% longer on average than a civil war without any international intervention.|$|E
25|$|By 1843 {{the island}} was barren with few plants. However, due to the {{introduction}} of species by the British, Ascension Island's Green Mountain {{is now one of the}} few large-scale planned forests, and is gradually growing with each year. Its highest point is at 859m. Non-indigenous plants teem there, and the crown of Green Mountain is a lush halo of bamboo. Flanking <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> a large stand of tall Norfolk pine, trees planted by British mariners, which were to have been used as replacement masts for sailing ships. In June 2005 the first National Park on Ascension Island, the Green Mountain National Park, was opened.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese Chu Shogi Association {{plays by}} more complex {{repetition}} rules. Only a fourth repetition is forbidden, and the burden to deviate {{is not necessarily}} on the player that reaches this first. If <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> making attacks with his moves in the repeat cycle, {{and the other is}} not, the attacking side must deviate, while in case of checking the checker must deviate regardless of whether the checked side attacks other pieces. In the case of consecutive passes, the side passing first must deviate, making turn passing to avoid zugzwang pointless if the opponent is in a position where he can pass his turn too.|$|E
25|$|The Museo Arqueológico de Xochimilco (Archeological Museum of Xochimilco) {{began as}} a {{collection}} of pre-Hispanic artifacts such as ceramics, stone items, bones, and more that had been found in the area, often during construction projects. In 1965, the museum began to display these items to the public. In 1974, the collection moved permanently to a late 19th-century house, which was restored in the 1980s and inaugurated under its current name. This collection contains 2,441 pieces, mostly ceramic and stone objects, including figures, cooking utensils, arrowheads. It is located on Avenida Tenochtitlán in Santa Cruz Acalpixca. Located to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> one of the fresh water springs that feed the canals. On the other sides are gardens.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of reciprocity, if <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>is</b> allowed to {{cross-examine}} his legal opponent at a hearing, the other party must also be given the same opportunity. In addition, when a tribunal decides a case on a basis not raised or contemplated by the parties, or decides it without regarding the submissions and arguments made by the parties on the issues, this will amount to a breach of natural justice. However, a genuine bona fide mistake by an adjudicator in omitting to state reasons for not considering a submission {{is not enough to}} be a breach of natural justice. This may occur when the submissions were accidentally omitted, or were so unconvincing that it was not necessary to explicitly state the adjudicator's findings.|$|E
