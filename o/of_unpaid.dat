5|$|In {{more recent}} years {{there has been}} {{increasing}} attention to this issue, such as recognition <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> work within SNA reports and a commitment by the UN to the measurement and valuation <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> work, emphasizing care work done by women. This goal was restated at the 1995 UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Bjarni was {{sentence}}d to 6 months in prison by the District Court of Reykjavik for major tax noncompliance. His sentence was suspended and he was additionally ordered to repay nearly 36 million ISK <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> tax. The Supreme Court of Iceland increased his suspended sentence to 8 months.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> work.|$|E

5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> work is trillions of dollars per year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economists have}} also {{highlighted}} power and inequality issues within families and households. For example, Randy Albelda shows that responsibility for care work influences the time poverty experienced by single {{mothers in the}} United States. Similarly, Sarah Gammage examines the effects <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> care work performed by women in Guatemala. The work of the Equality Studies Department at University College Dublin {{such as that of}} Sara Cantillon has focused on inequalities of domestic arrangements within even affluent households.|$|E
5|$|In his Federalist No. 43, {{published}} January 23, 1788, James Madison {{argued that}} the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety. Five years earlier, a band <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> soldiers besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia. Known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized {{the need for the}} national government not to rely on any state for its own security.|$|E

5|$|Churches were {{primarily}} responsible for financing Civilian Public Service, providing for the men's food, clothes, and other material needs. The churches also provided and paid for the camp director. The men received an allowance of between $2.50 and $5.00 monthly for personal needs. When jobs were available in surrounding farms and communities, those willing to work beyond their regular CPS jobs could earn extra spending money. The federal government spent $1.3 million on the CPS program. The men performed $6 million <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> labor in return.|$|E

Mel and Bran and their small group of forces – mostly farmers and tradespeople – initially succeed at foiling Debegari with guerilla tactics, such as blockading a stream to flood the enemy's camp. However, the war changes for the worse when the capable Marquis of Shevraeth (25), {{the heir to the}} nearby principality of Renselaeus, takes command from Debegari. Shevraeth soon captures Mel and takes her to the capitol of Remalna-city, imprisoning her. Shevraeth tells her that the king orders her to surrender Tlanth's forces or face execution. Mel refuses, and soon escapes imprisonment with the help of their family spy, Azmus.|$|E
5|$|Ellen {{was born}} on 24 October 1856 in Walworth, London, at the Bricklayer's Arms public house run by her father, George Elliot. In adult life, {{she worked as a}} needlewoman and in a jute {{processing}} factory. In 1883, she had an illegitimate daughter, also called Ellen, who died in Poplar workhouse in December 1885. Within a year of the death of her daughter, she began working for Martin. In March 1888, Ellen and William left Martin's employ and moved to a furnished room at 3 Swaton Road, Bow, where they lived together until their marriage on Easter Monday, 2 April 1888, at Bromley Parish Church. Martin later said he had dismissed William because <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> debts.|$|E
5|$|Rajoelina faced {{significant}} {{challenges in}} {{his tenure as}} mayor. Upon taking office, he was confronted with redressing the city's treasury, which had accumulated 8.2 billion Malagasy Ariary (approximately 4.6 million U.S. dollars) in debts under previous mayors, including Ravalomanana himself. Beginning 4 January 2008, Ravalomanana ordered water cutoffs at public pumps and brownouts of Antananarivo's street lights run by the state utilities company Jirama, due to 3.3 million ariary <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> debts to Jirama by the City of Antananarivo. Rajoelina responded by condemning the move as political and proceeded to undertake an audit that identified and addressed long-standing procedural irregularities and issues of corruption within the city's administration. Following a series of crimes against members of Rajoelina's inner circle in 2008 that comprised the burgling of his cabinet director's car, the kidnapping and ransoming {{of one of his}} special advisers, and the death of an assistant under mysterious circumstances, rumors spread that the Rajoelina administration was being deliberately intimidated by supporters of the president.|$|E

Later that month, Hanjin Shipping, a major operator in Seattle, filed for bankruptcy and was barred from the Port of Seattle over fears <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> terminal fees. The bankruptcy sent the global shipping industry into a panic, with several Hanjin ships anchored off the Pacific coast awaiting approval to unload cargo. In December, Hanjin's Terminal 46 in Seattle was sold to an affiliate of Mediterranean Shipping Company for $78 million; the move was opposed by the Port of Seattle, who filed a request to block the sale over a lack of correspondence about the new lease and security deposit.|$|E
5|$|Ubico {{had made}} {{statements}} supporting {{the labor movement}} when campaigning for the presidency, but after his election his policy quickly became authoritarian. He abolished the system of debt peonage, {{and replaced it with}} a vagrancy law, which required all men of working age who did not own land to perform a minimum of 100 days of hard labor. In addition, the state made use <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> Indian labor to work on public infrastructure like roads and railroads. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property, an action described by historians as legalizing murder. He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it {{into one of the most}} efficient and ruthless in Latin America. The police were given greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. The result of these laws was to create tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers. Ubico was highly contemptuous of the country's indigenous people, once stating that they resembled donkeys.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{suggestion}} {{by his friend}} and mentor Pedro de Córdoba, Las Casas petitioned a land grant {{to be allowed to}} establish a settlement in northern Venezuela at Cumaná. Founded in 1515, there was already a small Franciscan monastery in Spain, Cumana Mexico, and a Dominican one at Chiribichi, but the monks there were being harassed by Spaniards operating slave raids from the nearby Island of Cubagua. In order to make the proposal palatable to the King, Las Casas had to incorporate the prospect of profits for the royal treasury. He suggested fortifying the northern coast of Venezuela, establishing ten royal forts to protect the Indians and starting up a system of trade in gold and pearls. All the Indian slaves of the New World should be brought to live in these towns and become tribute paying subjects to the King. In order to secure the grant Las Casas had to go through a long fight in court against Bishop Fonseca and his supporters Gonzalo de Oviedo and Bishop Quevedo of Tierra Firme. Las Casas's supporters were Diego Columbus and the new chancellor Gattinara. Las Casas's enemies slandered him to the King, accusing him of planning to escape with the money to Genoa or Rome. In 1520 Las Casas's concession was finally granted, but it was a much smaller grant than he had initially proposed; he was also denied the possibilities of extracting gold and pearls, which made it difficult for him to find investors for the venture. Las Casas committed himself to producing 15,000 ducats of annual revenue, increasing to 60,000 after ten years, and to erecting three Christian towns of at least 40 settlers each. Some privileges were also granted to the initial 50 shareholders in Las Casas's scheme. The King also promised not to give any encomienda grants in Las Casas's area. That said, finding fifty men willing to invest 200 ducats each and three years <b>of</b> <b>unpaid</b> work proved impossible for Las Casas. In the end, he ended up leaving in November 1520 with just a small group of peasants, paying for the venture with money borrowed from his brother in-law.|$|E
