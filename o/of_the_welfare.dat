5|$|The {{death of}} Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster in 1899 was a pivotal {{point in the}} {{development}} of Mayfair, following which all redevelopment schemes not already in operation were cancelled. In the following years, Government budget proposals such as David Lloyd George's establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> state in 1909, greatly reduced the power of the Lords. Land value fell around Mayfair, and some leases were not renewed.|$|E
5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight the Harris government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Justinian {{selected}} one of {{his most}} trusted and talented generals, Belisarius, who had recently distinguished himself against the Persians and in the suppression of the Nika riots, to lead the expedition. As Ian Hughes points out, Belisarius was also eminently suited for this appointment for two other reasons: he was a native Latin-speaker, and was solicitous <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> of the local population, keeping a tight leash on his troops. Both these qualities would be crucial in winning support from the Latin-speaking African population. Belisarius was accompanied by his wife, Antonina, and by Procopius, his secretary, who wrote the history of the war.|$|E

5|$|The {{institution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> {{state was}} by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised {{to expand the}} national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with}} the cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E

25|$|By the 1950s, it {{appeared}} that absolute poverty was a minor problem although pockets did remain, for example among the elderly, but {{it was believed that}} increased welfare benefits would soon eradicate this lingering poverty.
