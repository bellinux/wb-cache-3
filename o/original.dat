5|$|After much persuasion, he overcame {{his fear}} and {{eventually}} made three trips to Singapore to restore his murals in December 1963, July 1982 and May 1988. The 1982 restoration was more intensive and the invaluable assistance given to Warren by {{the officers and}} boys of the SAF Boys' School enabled {{the bulk of the}} work to be completed. Of the <b>original</b> five murals, only one was not fully restored; the mural of St Luke in Prison. Stanley's <b>original</b> tracing of the drawing was missing, and he could not remember the details of the missing portion. In 1985, Stanley's <b>original</b> drawing was discovered in the memorabilia of Wally Hammond who had been a fellow prisoner with Stanley. These <b>original</b> sketches were subsequently donated to the National Archives of Singapore. From the <b>original,</b> Stanley painted a small picture, which was placed below the remaining piece of the mural in 1988. He was, by then, not fit enough to restore the actual mural.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of the Pocket PC version, in 2006 Chahi created a new Windows version {{targeted}} at Windows XP. Emmanuel Rivoire increased the resolution to 1280×800 pixels and Chahi created more detailed backgrounds.

The game still supports the <b>original</b> 320×200 resolution, as well as the <b>original</b> background art (as an option), and it features twice as many checkpoints as the <b>original,</b> which makes it somewhat easier, as well as newly remixed sounds.|$|E
