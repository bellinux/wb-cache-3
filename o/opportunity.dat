5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the <b>opportunity</b> {{to walk on the}} Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight {{altogether}} for the <b>opportunity</b> to command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the <b>opportunity</b> to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between growth <b>opportunities</b> and debt of quoted Portuguese companies using various panel estimators. The results show a cubic relationship between growth <b>opportunities</b> and debt. When companies' growth <b>opportunities</b> are low and high, {{the relationship between}} growth <b>opportunities</b> and debt is positive. For intermediate levels of growth <b>opportunities,</b> the results show {{the existence of a}} negative relationship between growth <b>opportunities</b> and debt. These results suggest that the relationship between companies' growth <b>opportunities</b> and debt is influenced by complex aspects in companies' capital structure decisions. The empirical results suggest that creditors recognize high growth <b>opportunities</b> when such <b>opportunities</b> exist, and debt is a way to discipline managers' actions in the presence of low investment <b>opportunities.</b> For intermediate levels of growth <b>opportunities,</b> the subinvestment problems seem to be relevant in explaining the relationship between growth <b>opportunities</b> and debt.

40|$|Abstract. Kirzner’s (1973) {{theory of}} {{entrepreneurship}} emphasizes the equilibrating role of entrepreneurship. When {{the market is}} not in equilibrium, profit <b>opportunities</b> exist, and entrepreneurs discover and act on these profit <b>opportunities</b> to equilibrate the market. Because Kirzner focuses on entrepreneurial actions when profit <b>opportunities</b> exist, and does not describe where they come from, one could imagine a fixed stock of profit <b>opportunities</b> that get used up as entrepreneurs discover them. But new profit <b>opportunities</b> are being created constantly. A taxonomy {{of the origins of}} entrepreneurial <b>opportunities</b> includes factors that disequilibrate the market, factors that enhance production possibilities, and most notably, <b>opportunities</b> created from previous acts of entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial actions do not use up profit <b>opportunities,</b> but create them, and the critical role of entrepreneurship in the creation of new profit <b>opportunities</b> is emphasized. This line of reasoning leads directly to policy implications regarding the economic environment conducive to entrepreneurial discovery and the role of government in research and development. This paper enhances Kirzner’s theory of entrepreneurship by illustrating how entrepreneurship enlarges the stock of future entrepreneurial <b>opportunities,</b> and points to entrepreneurship as the engine of economic progress.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} study is (a) to define the concept of <b>opportunities</b> to learn (OTL) as a {{theoretical}} category, (b) to present selected research tools that are most commonly used for investigating <b>opportunities,</b> and (c) to compare differences in defining and using <b>opportunities</b> to learn as a theoretical category in the Czech Republic and in the U.

Initially, the <b>opportunities</b> to learn were viewed as a theoretical category comprising the coherence between content of teaching and content requirements of (standardized) tests or curricula. Later, the scope of <b>opportunities</b> to learn expanded towards examining school-dependent variables and school-independent variables related to school performance of students. In the second part of the study <b>opportunities</b> to learn are operationalised, including examples of methods and techniques used for their investigation. On an example of selected research, the study shows that the concept of <b>opportunities</b> to learn in the U.

This contrasts with the use of <b>opportunities</b> to learn as a theoretical concept in the Czech Republic, where <b>opportunities</b> to learn mainly represent a theoretical basis for conducting microanalyses of teaching...|$|R
