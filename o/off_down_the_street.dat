2500|$|In 1875, French married Isabella Soundy, the {{daughter}} of a tradesman. Subalterns of that era were not expected to marry and French's first marriage may well have been kept secret from his regiment: his regiment is recorded incorrectly on the marriage certificate as [...] "12th Hussars", a regiment that did not exist at the time. They divorced in 1878 with Isabella as a co-respondent and said to have been paid off by French's wealthy brother-in-law, John Lydall. [...] The divorce could have ruined his career if widely known. Lydall had already paid off French's debts on a previous occasion, and later broke off relations with him when he attempted to borrow money again. [...] Later still, when French's name was seen on newspaper headlines (most likely during the Curragh incident), he was observed to stomp <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> muttering [...] "sorry fellow, Jack French".|$|E
6000|$|... "Now git!" [...] said Andrew, {{coming down}} the steps. The crowd {{scattered}} with laughing taunts. He turned and entered the house. The rest drifted <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> through the soft flurries of snow, {{and in a few}} moments the street assumed its usual appearance.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Porter, {{who was on}} {{his knees}} at the time, rose slowly to his full height, and, with a superb gesture, emptied the bucket, which also {{contained}} a scrubbing-brush and lump of soap, into the back-yard. Then he set <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> in quest of a staff.|$|E
60|$|Chandos {{shook his}} clenched hand with annoyance, {{and then set}} <b>off</b> swiftly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|R
60|$|The guard {{took hold}} of the dead men by the head and by the feet, and one after another, in single file, they bore them <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>street.</b> We three moved on, the crowd {{gradually}} melted away, and everything again became dark and silent.|$|R
50|$|Mini bus: Buses {{that run}} from the Victory Monument to the Amphawa Floating Market are the best. There are several bus {{operators}} that travel to Amphawa. The price costs between 90-100 baht each way and will drop you <b>off</b> right <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from <b>the</b> market.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Spriggs {{regarded}} him sternly {{for a few}} seconds, and then, closing {{the door with a}} bang, went <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Left alone, Mr. Price strolled about the room investigating, and then, drawing an easy-chair up to the fire, put his feet on the fender and relapsed into thought.|$|E
6000|$|He shuffled down to {{meet the}} {{carriage}} at the gate, and Lucius helped him in before Bertha could reach him, and they drove <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> so exactly in their usual way that Bertha was moved to say: [...] "I don't believe it! I can't realize we're quitting this town to-morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and {{he misses}} me so if I leave him. Good-bye, and God {{help you in}} your undertaking." [...] She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we heard the wheels of her {{carriage}} rattle <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
60|$|And then Gabe Werner did catch it. Not {{only did}} Randy and Fred pounce upon him, but also Jack and Andy, {{and as a}} consequence, bruised and bleeding, the big bully {{staggered}} from the shooting gallery and set <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> muddy <b>street</b> at <b>the</b> best speed he could command.|$|R
60|$|It {{had a very}} {{practical}} sound; it was really like meeting the difficulties on their own ground, and it overcame the question of taste which was rising in Annie's mind. She demurred a little more upon the theory of her uselessness; but Mrs. Munger insisted, and carried her <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> village <b>street.</b>|$|R
60|$|Prince Shan rejoined Nigel, {{and the two}} men drove <b>off</b> to <b>Downing</b> <b>Street.</b> <b>The</b> former {{was silent}} for the first few minutes. Then he turned {{slightly}} towards his companion.|$|R
60|$|As Sir John spoke Archie darted {{across the}} street and placed himself by Wallace's side, holding his hand high above his head as he did so; and at the instant he saw Jock Farrell, who had been {{lounging}} at a corner a few yards away, dart <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> {{at the top of his}} speed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Sarah Cushing is {{extremely}} ill," [...] said he. [...] "She has been suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity. As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take {{the responsibility of}} allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call again in ten days." [...] He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and marched <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
60|$|The three set <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> to {{the brow}} of the hill, where they {{looked down upon}} Union Street, far below and almost under their feet. This they called the Pit, and it was well named. Themselves they called the Hill-dwellers, and a descent into the Pit by the Hill-dwellers was looked upon by them as a great adventure.|$|E
60|$|They set <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> one {{business}} <b>street</b> {{of which}} Columbina boasted. They {{had to pick}} their way carefully along the dilapidated boardwalk. At one point they came opposite O'Brian's Hotel. Downstairs was a saloon, and in this a noisy bunch were talking and singing.|$|R
60|$|There was a vein of {{philosophy}} in Wren's composition. He {{felt that he}} {{might just as well}} be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. In other words, having been caught down town without leave, he might as well stay there and enjoy himself a little while longer before going back to be executed. So he strolled <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> High <b>Street,</b> bought a few things at a stationer's, and wound up with an excellent tea at the confectioner's by the post-office.|$|R
5000|$|A {{surveillance}} {{video in}} the room is watched by the mother and the psychiatrist and it is revealed that Zoe is talking to herself. That night, Pinocchio convinces Zoe to set him free so that he can admit to David that he is to blame for his accident. Zoe makes him promise he will not do anything bad and cuts his strings, at which point Pinocchio hops up, declaring his freedom and takes <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> dark <b>streets</b> with Zoe in pursuit. Through a first-person perspective, we see an unknown person move through the hospital through crowds of people into David's room and unplug one of his machines, killing him.|$|R
6000|$|At {{last one}} desperate young fellow took the lead, {{and the rest}} marched after. He moved <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> {{shouting}} through his closed lips [...] "Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum!" [...] The rest took up the drum-like cry, and marched after him two and two. They made straight toward Judge Brown's office, where they knew Bradley was. They halted and raised a great shout.|$|E
60|$|We rattled <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and {{out into}} the open country again at a pace which precluded any conversation. The low hedges and stunted trees by the {{roadside}} seemed to fly past us, and a sudden turn, which almost jerked me from my seat, brought us in sight of a wide semi-circle of twinkling lights, which seemed to stretch right across the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|... "Damn!" [...] said Freddie softly, {{and hurried}} <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> He {{wondered}} {{whether he had}} made a frightful ass of himself, spraying bank-notes all over the place like that to comparative strangers. Then a vision came to him of Nelly's eyes as they had looked at him in the lamp-light, and he decided--no, absolutely not. Rummy as the gadget might appear, it had been the right thing to do. It was a binge of which he thoroughly approved. A good egg! ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{delivered}} {{this home}} thrust Hans bolted round {{a corner and}} disappeared, while I waited trembling {{to see what happened}} to his adversary. To my relief nearly a minute later he crept out of the sluit covered with mud and dripping with water and hobbled <b>off</b> slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> his head so near his feet that he looked as though he had been folded in two, and his hands pressed upon what I believe is medically known as the diaphragm. Then I also went upon my way roaring with laughter. Often I have heard Hottentots called the lowest of mankind, but, reflected I, they can at any rate be good friends to those who treat them well--a fact of which I was to have further proof ere long.|$|R
60|$|It {{was dark}} when the {{storekeeper}} wakened him, {{and after a}} hasty breakfast he went out with the surveyor. Dawn was breaking, {{and there was an}} ashy grayness in the east, but the sky was barred with clouds. The black pines were slowly growing into shape against the faint glimmer of the snow. The cold was piercing and Gerald shivered while the surveyor gave him a few last directions; then he slung his heavy pack upon his shoulders and set <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> unpaved <b>street.</b> There were lights in the log shacks and once or twice somebody greeted him, but after a few minutes the settlement faded behind and he and his companions were alone among the tangled firs. No sound but the crunch of snow beneath their big shoes broke the heavy silence; the small trees, slanting drunkenly, were dim and indistinct, and the solitude was impressive.|$|R
6000|$|It was market-day, and {{the usual}} number of rogues and fools were {{assembled}} at the Cross. I observed everybody looked strange on me, and I thought some laughed. I fancy I had been making queer faces enough, and perhaps talking to myself, When I saw myself used in this manner, I held out my clenched fists straight before me, stooped my head, and, like a ram when he makes his race, darted <b>off</b> right <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> scattering groups of weatherbeaten lairds and periwigged burgesses, and bearing down all before me. I heard the cry of [...] "Seize the madman!" [...] echoed, in Celtic sounds, from the City Guard, with [...] "Ceaze ta matman!"--but pursuit and opposition were in vain. I pursued my career; {{the smell of the}} sea, I suppose, led me to Leith, where, soon after, I found myself walking very quietly on the shore, admiring the tough round and sound cordage of the vessels, and thinking how a loop, with a man {{at the end of one}} of them, would look, by way of tassel.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{few moments}} of {{desultory}} conversation, of the kind that usually follows an introduction, and then Fillmore, by no means sorry to get the chance, took advantage of the coming of this new arrival to remove himself. He had not enjoyed his chat with Sally, and it seemed probable that he would enjoy a continuation of it even less. He was glad that Mr. Foster had happened along at this particular juncture. Excusing himself briefly, he hurried <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
60|$|At Davis' {{suggestion}} {{they went}} <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> joining the crowd on the sidewalk, which was streaming away towards the fair grounds. A roasted ox {{was to be}} served there, and speeches were to follow. The road kept on to the south, down over the gentle slope, and turned aside under the jack-oaks, and led through a wooden gate into an enclosure which {{was used for the}} county fair. Down under the great shed {{by the side of the}} race-track the people swarmed in thousands.|$|E
60|$|The big Colonel bowed decorously, {{held out}} a great, wide hand, and thereupon {{unscrewed}} the flask. Now Stephen had never learned to like straight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face. The exploit seemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor justice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with still greater ceremony, and they walked <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> together. Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple's cigars, to which his new friend gave unqualified praise.|$|E
60|$|The {{listener}} stiffened {{up suddenly}} and, holding his breath, went <b>off</b> on tiptoe <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>the</b> {{sounds of the}} foolish mirth in the bar ringing in his ears as he went. His brain was in a whirl, but two definite objects shaped themselves in his mind as he walked fiercely on—to smash first the syndicate, and then the cook. With these ideas firmly fixed he went aboard again, and going into the lonely foc’sle, climbed into his bunk and forgot his sorrows in sleep—in a sleep so sound that the others, upon their return an hour later, failed to wake him, until Henry, as a last expedient, threw a slice of bread at him. After which everybody had to keep awake all night to mount guard over their lives.|$|R
60|$|The prayer finished, we all {{rose with}} the {{exception}} of Saxon, who remained with his face buried in his hands {{for a minute or so}} before starting to his feet. I shrewdly suspect that he had been fast asleep, though he explained that he had paused to offer up an additional supplication. My father placed his hands upon my head and invoked the blessing of Heaven upon me. He then drew my companion aside, and I heard the jingling of coin, from which I judge that he was giving him something wherewith to start upon his travels. My mother clasped me to her heart, and slipped a small square of paper into my hand, saying that I was to look at it at my leisure, and that I should make her happy if I would but conform to the instructions contained in it. This I promised to do, and tearing myself away I set <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> darkened village <b>street,</b> with my long-limbed companion striding by my side.|$|R
60|$|That day Decimus Saxon left us, {{intending}} {{to make a}} round {{of the country and}} to deliver his letters, but promising to be back again ere long. We had a small mishap ere he went, for as we were talking of his journey my brother Hosea must needs start playing with my father's powder-flask, which in some way went off with a sudden fluff, spattering the walls with fragments of metal. So unexpected and loud was the explosion, that both my father and I sprang to our feet; but Saxon, whose back was turned to my brother, sat four-square in his chair without a glance behind him or a shade of change in his rugged face. As luck would have it, no one was injured, not even Hosea, but the incident made me think more highly of our new acquaintance. As he started <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> village <b>street,</b> his long stringy figure and strange gnarled visage, with my father's silver-braided hat cocked over his eye, attracted rather more attention than I cared to see, considering the importance of the missives which he bore, and the certainty of their discovery should he be arrested as a masterless man. Fortunately, however, the curiosity of the country folk did but lead them to cluster round their doors and windows, staring open-eyed, while he, pleased at the attention which he excited, strode along with his head in the air and a cudgel of mine twirling in his hand. He had left golden opinions behind him. My father's good wishes had been won by his piety and by the sacrifices which he claimed to have made for the faith. My mother he had taught how wimples are worn amongst the Serbs, and had also demonstrated to her a new method of curing marigolds in use in some parts of Lithuania. For myself, I confess that I retained a vague distrust of the man, and was determined to avoid putting faith in him more than was needful. At present, however, we had no choice hut to treat him as an ambassador from friends.|$|R
60|$|As {{they rushed}} {{out through the}} gateway, Philammon, dazzled by the sudden {{transition}} from the darkness within to the blaze of moon and starlight which flooded the street, and walls, and shining roofs, hung back a moment. That hesitation probably saved his life; for in an instant he saw a dark figure spring out of the shadow, a long knife flashed across his eyes, and a priest next to him sank upon the pavement with a groan, while the assassin dashed <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> hotly pursued by monks and parabolani.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Mr. March!" [...] cried Miss Dale. [...] "Well, it is {{a pathetic}} case, but it isn't the only one, if that's any comfort. Saratoga is reeking with just such forlornities the whole summer long; but I can quite {{understand}} {{how you feel about}} it, Mrs. March." [...] We came to a corner, and she said abruptly: [...] "Excuse my interrupting your quarrel! Not quite so LOUD, Mr. March!" [...] and she flashed back a mocking look at me as she skurried <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> with astonishing rapidity.|$|E
60|$|Fanny Elmer {{took down}} her cloak from the hook. Nick Bramham unpinned his drawing and rolled {{it under his}} arm. They turned out the lights and set <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> holding on their way through all the people, motor cars, omnibuses, carts, until they reached Leicester Square, five minutes before Jacob reached it, for his way was {{slightly}} longer, {{and he had been}} stopped by a block in Holborn waiting to see the King drive by, so that Nick and Fanny were already leaning over the barrier in the promenade at the Empire when Jacob pushed through the swing doors and took his place beside them.|$|E
60|$|Archie {{found himself}} alone. The {{last of the}} faithful--or was it only the boldest of the curious?--had fled. He watched the black huddle of his fellow-students draw <b>off</b> <b>down</b> and up <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> in {{whispering}} or boisterous gangs. And {{the isolation of the}} moment weighed upon him like an omen and an emblem of his destiny in life. Bred up in unbroken fear himself, among trembling servants, and in a house which (at the least ruffle in the master's voice) shuddered into silence, he saw himself on the brink of the red valley of war, and measured the danger and length of it with awe. He made a détour in the glimmer and shadow of <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> came into <b>the</b> back stable lane, and watched for a long while the light burn steady in the judge's room. The longer he gazed upon that illuminated window-blind, the more blank became the picture of the man who sat behind it, endlessly turning over sheets of process, pausing to sip a glass of port, or rising and passing heavily about his book-lined walls to verify some reference. He could not combine the brutal judge and the industrious, dispassionate student; the connecting link escaped him; from such a dual nature it was impossible he should predict behaviour; and he asked himself if he had done well to plunge into a business of which the end could not be foreseen? and presently after, with a sickening decline of confidence, if he had done loyally to strike his father? For he had struck him--defied him twice over and before a cloud of witnesses--struck him a public buffet before crowds. Who had called him to judge his father in these precarious and high questions? The office was usurped. It might have become a stranger; in a son--there was no blinking it--in a son, it was disloyal. And now, between these two natures so antipathetic, so hateful to each other, there was depending an unpardonable affront: and the providence of God alone might foresee {{the manner in which it}} would be resented by Lord Hermiston.|$|R
50|$|Bill drives <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> desert road.|$|R
60|$|In the {{distance}} I heard <b>the</b> automobile moving <b>off</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> drive. The sound roused me.|$|R
