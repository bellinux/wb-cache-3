25|$|At {{the dawn}} of the twenty-first century, labor union density (percentage of unionized American workers) was {{reaching}} a historic low point.

25|$|An {{additional}} {{reason for}} the Loyal Legion's hegemony during the war related to its leading role {{on the issue of}} the 8-hour day — a major goal <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> for decades. In February 1918 Col. Disque established a committee of 25 prominent lumbermen in Portland and charged them with devising an agreement to establishing the 8-hour day in the lumber industry. Pressure from Disque and the Wilson administration in Washington — the chief consumer of finished goods — was instrumental in ensuring a positive outcome, and the marathon session of lumbermen eventually yielded fruit. On the morning of March 1, 1918, Disque announced the adoption of the 8-hour day to the press.|$|E
25|$|The race {{to assume}} Cunningham's seat was highly contested, {{especially}} on the Republican side, with 14 Republicans (compared with only 2 Democrats) officially running for the position. Leading up to the initial all-candidate election that would determine the parties' candidates in a runoff election, Bilbray was in a virtual tie with Republican businessman Eric Roach, slightly ahead of former State Assemblyman Howard Kaloogian. Four days before the election, businessman Alan Uke, {{one of the major}} Republican candidates, ran an attack ad accusing Roach of outsourcing thousands of jobs at the expense <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>workers.</b> In the initial all-party special election on April 11, 2006, Bilbray was the Republican candidate with the most votes, receiving 15% of the total vote to Roach's 15%. He then faced the top vote getters of all the other parties in a runoff election on June 6, 2006: Democrat Francine Busby, Libertarian Paul King, and William Griffith, an independent.|$|E

50|$|Bernstein earned {{critical}} {{praise for}} the first two books of A History <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>Worker,</b> a trilogy about the American labor movement in the interwar period. The Lean Years: A History <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>Worker,</b> 1920-1933 focuses on the decline <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> labor movement following World War I. A decade later, he published The Turbulent Years: A History <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>Worker,</b> 1933-1941, in which he described American unions' growth under the New Deal. In both books, Bernstein argued that the New Deal and labor unions preserved democracy and capitalism {{at a time when the}} survival of both was unclear, and that New Deal labor policy dramatically reoriented public policy away from employers toward workers.|$|R
25|$|The post-1900 {{cause to}} renew the Chinese Exclusion Act became {{generalized}} protests against all Asian immigrants, including the Issei. Since many Chinese immigrants left the U.S., hostility fell on the Issei. American labor organizations took an initiative in spreading Anti-Japanese sentiment. White Americans wanted to exclude them since {{they did not want}} any Asians to take their jobs away. As a result, they formed the Asiatic Exclusion League that viewed Japanese and Chinese as a threat <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>workers.</b> The protest of the league involved picketing and beatings of the Issei. In October 1906, amid this anti-Japanese milieu, the San Francisco School Board, carrying out a campaign promise of the mayor, ordered all Japanese and Korean pupils to join the Chinese students at a segregated school. The Issei were displeased with the situation and some reported to Japanese newspapers. This caused the Japanese government to protest against the former President, Theodore Roosevelt, and as a result, they signed the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907. This agreement led the period of settling and family building to come.|$|E

500|$|In his pamphlets, Townsend {{speaks out}} against boycotting {{products}} from Japan, noting that America does considerably more trade with Japan than China and arguing that peaceful trade with Japan and Nazi Germany would {{serve the interests}} <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> and consumers. He blames [...] "red elements" [...] within China for starting the Second Sino-Japanese War, but praises Japan for the [...] "humane" [...] manner in which its armed forces have behaved in China, believing {{that it is only}} the Soviet Union and [...] "a powerful minority" [...] of pro-communist Americans who are conspiring to push America to war with Japan. Townsend predicts that if the Chinese won their war with Japan, the result would be a communist takeover of China, but he dismisses the idea that Japan might launch an attack on the United States as [...] "simply too idiotic to discuss." [...] On Europe he avers similarly that German conduct is largely a defensive reaction to British and French attempts to [...] "obliterate the Germans as an entity".|$|E

2500|$|One {{explanation}} for loss {{of public support}} is simply the lack of union power or critical mass.

2500|$|Historians {{argue that}} the case radicalized a {{significant}} portion of the American labor movement. [...] Moyer himself concluded that the state's use of military power to crush unions could only be countered by a syndicalist union linked to a potent political party. [...] Subsequently, Moyer and the WFM helped found the radical Industrial Workers of the World in 1905. [...] While Samuel Gompers and the American Federation of Labor sought an accommodation with capitalism and the status quo, a large minority <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>workers</b> did not—and another three decades of labor unrest was caused, in part, by desperate workers who felt the courts were closed to them.|$|E

Gabbard said, [...] "The TPP agreement will benefit Wall Street banks and multinational corporations {{on the backs of}} hard-working Americans, and it will increase existing threats to our environment...If it contains the same noxious provisions we suspected it would, I will do all I can to defeat the TPP when it comes before Congress for a final up-or-down vote." ...|$|E

Others profess to retain Marxism but exhibit no militancy in carrying on the class struggle. It pursues a policy of 'neutrality' toward the trade unions which in practice amounts to leaving them {{in the hands of the}} bureaucrats and corruptionists... It has lacked vigor and aggressiveness in supporting, inspiring, and leading efforts to organize the masses of unskilled and semi-skilled workers in the basic industries....

2500|$|In 1886, George {{campaigned for}} mayor of New York City as the {{candidate}} of the United Labor Party, the short-lived political society of the Central Labor Union. [...] He polled second, more than the Republican candidate Theodore Roosevelt. The election was won by Tammany Hall candidate Abram Stevens Hewitt by what many of George's supporters believed was fraud. In the 1887 New York state elections, George came in a distant third in the election for Secretary of State of New York. The United Labor Party was soon weakened by internal divisions: the management was essentially Georgist, but as a party of organized labor it also included some Marxist members {{who did not want}} to distinguish between land and capital, many Catholic members who were discouraged by the excommunication of Father Edward McGlynn, and many who disagreed with George's free trade policy. George had particular trouble with Terrence V. Powderly, president of the Knights of Labor, a key member of the United Labor coalition. While initially friendly with Powderly, George vigorously opposed the tariff policies which Powderly and many other labor leaders thought vital to the protection <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>workers.</b> George's strident criticism of the tariff set him against Powderly and others in the labor movement.|$|E
2500|$|Immigration from Poland was {{primarily}} conducted at Ellis Island, New York, although some people entered via Castle Garden {{and to a}} lesser extent, in Baltimore. Ellis Island developed an infamous reputation among Polish immigrants and their children. An American reporter in the 1920s found that Polish immigrants were treated as [...] "third class", and were subject to humiliation, profanity, and brutality at Ellis Island. The [...] Cleveland Polish language daily [...] (Polish Daily News) reported that officers at Ellis Island demanded women to strip from the waist up in public view. The immigration of paupers was forbidden by the U.S. Congress beginning with the Immigration Act of 1882. A newsman at Castle Garden found in a single ship of arriving passengers, 265 were [...] "Poles and Slavonians", and 60 were detained as [...] "destitute and likely to become public charges." [...] Polish Americans were disgusted by the Immigration Act of 1924 which restricted Polish immigration to 1890 levels, when there was no Polish nation. A Polish American newspaper stated, [...] "...If the Americans wish to have more Germans and fewer Slavs, why don't they admit that publicly!?" [...] It further went to examine the recent World War with Germany, which was America's enemy, whereas the Polish had been patriotic and loyal to the U.S. Armed Services.
