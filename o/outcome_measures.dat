Based on their examinations of patients, they compile scores on tests; some examples are those created by the University of California at Los Angeles and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons. Other <b>outcome</b> <b>measures</b> include the Constant score; the Simple Shoulder Test; and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score.

25|$|Because ALF often {{involves}} the rapid deterioration of mental {{status and the}} potential for multiorgan failure, patients should be managed in the intensive care unit. For patients not at a transplant center, the possibility of rapid progression of ALF makes early consultation with a transplant facility critical. Accordingly, plans for transfer to a transplant center should begin in patients with any abnormal mentation. Early institution of antidotes or specific therapy may prevent the need for liver transplantation and reduce the likelihood of poor <b>outcome.</b> <b>Measures</b> appropriate for specific causes of ALF are described in detail later in this chapter.|$|E

25|$|Assessment of {{psychological}} processes related to tinnitus involves measurement of tinnitus severity and distress (i.e. {{nature and extent}} of tinnitus-related problems), measured subjectively by validated self-report tinnitus questionnaires. These questionnaires measure the degree {{of psychological}} distress and handicap associated with tinnitus, including effects on hearing, lifestyle, health and emotional functioning. A broader assessment of general functioning, such as levels of anxiety, depression, stress, life stressors and sleep difficulties, is also important in the assessment of tinnitus due to higher risk of negative well-being across these areas, which may be affected by and/or exacerbate the tinnitus symptoms for the individual. Overall, current assessment measures are aimed to identify individual levels of distress and interference, coping responses and perceptions of tinnitus in order to inform treatment and monitor progress. However, wide variability, inconsistencies and lack of consensus regarding assessment methodology are evidenced in the literature, limiting comparison of treatment effectiveness. Developed to guide diagnosis or classify severity, most tinnitus questionnaires have also been shown to be treatment-sensitive <b>outcome</b> <b>measures.</b>|$|E
25|$|Studies of {{interventions}} have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that {{some form of}} treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Concerns about <b>outcome</b> <b>measures,</b> such as their inconsistent use, most greatly affect how the results of scientific studies are interpreted. A 2009 Minnesota study found that parents follow behavioral treatment recommendations significantly less often than they follow medical recommendations, and that they adhere more often to reinforcement than to punishment recommendations. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated.|$|E
25|$|One small 2009 {{double-blind}} study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. No {{differences were found between the}} HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the <b>outcome</b> <b>measures.</b> A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{types of}} balance {{disorders}} will require balance training, prescribed by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist. Physiotherapists often administer standardized <b>outcome</b> <b>measures</b> {{as part of}} their assessment in order to gain useful information and data about a patient’s current status. Some standardized balance assessments or <b>outcome</b> <b>measures</b> include {{but are not limited to}} the Functional Reach Test, Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance (CTSIB), Berg Balance Scale and/or Timed Up and Go [...] The data and information collected can further help the physiotherapist develop an intervention program that is specific to the individual assessed. Intervention programs may include training activities that can be used to improve static and dynamic postural control, body alignment, weight distribution, ambulation, fall prevention and sensory function. Although treatment programs exist which seek to aid the brain in adapting to vestibular injuries, it is important to note that it is simply that – an adaptation to the injury. Although the patient’s balance is restored, the balance system injury still exists.|$|E

This protocol also requires absence of evidence of harm, at least one randomized controlled study, descriptive publications, a reasonable amount of necessary training, and the possibility of being used in common settings. Missing from this protocol are the possibility of nonrandomized designs (in which clients or practitioners decide whether an individual will receive a certain treatment), the need to specify the type of comparison group used, the existence of confounding variables, the reliability or validity of <b>outcome</b> <b>measures,</b> the type of statistical analysis required, or a number of other factors required by some evaluation protocols.|$|E
2500|$|Whereas {{bioethics}} {{tends to}} deal with more broadly-based issues like the consecrated nature {{of the human body}} and the roles of science and technology in healthcare, medical ethics is specifically focused on applying ethical principles to the field of medicine. Medical ethics {{has its roots in the}} writings of Hippocrates, and the practice of medicine was often used as an example in ethical discussions by Plato and Aristotle. As a systematic field, however, it is a large and relatively new area of study in ethics. One of the major premises of medical ethics surrounds [...] "the development of valuational measures of outcomes of health care treatments and programs; these <b>outcome</b> <b>measures</b> are designed to guide health policy and so must be able to be applied to substantial numbers of people, including across or even between whole societies." [...] Terms like beneficence and non-maleficence are vital to the overall understanding of medical ethics.

40|$|It is the {{responsibility}} of professions to provide evidence of the demonstrable value and quality of service delivery. Occupational therapists in mental health care settings find it difficult to produce convincing evidence of the demonstrable value and their contribution to health care. Currently no effective <b>outcome</b> <b>measure</b> for occupational therapists in mental health practices exists for the South African context. The development of an <b>outcomes</b> <b>measuring</b> system is much needed in these crucial times of cost-cutting, rendering quality of care with the minimum resources and the quest for evidence of the effect of intervention. The {{purpose of this study was}} to fill the outcome measurement gap by developing a system that is clinically tested and user-friendly for occupational therapists in mental health care settings. Such a system had to represent the outcomes in the occupational therapy programmes, meet the needs of the therapist in terms of purpose of the tool, be easily administered and be standardised. It was also important that the <b>outcome</b> <b>measure</b> was grounded in the theoretical framework that guides intervention programmes, namely Vona du Toit’s Model of Creative Ability. This theoretical framework is widely used in South African mental health care settings and was found suitable to be transformed into a rating scale for the <b>outcome</b> <b>measure.</b> A participatory approach combined with a mixed method exploratory design, specifically the instrument development model, was selected to guide the study. The development of the <b>outcome</b> <b>measure</b> happened in three phases. Domains for the <b>outcome</b> <b>measure</b> emerged after participation from occupational therapy clinicians and mental health care users in Phase 1. The operationalisation of the domains and the development of the rating scale happened during Phase 2. The third phase was the piloting of the <b>outcome</b> <b>measure</b> to identify issues to be optimised for the final implementation of the <b>outcome</b> <b>measure.</b> Eight domains with 52 representative items emerged from Phase 1. The domains were Process skills, Communication and Interaction skills, Lifeskills, Role performance, Balanced lifestyle, Motivation, Self-esteem and Affect. Clinicians were satisfied that these domains represented the service that they deliver and compared well with the mental health care users’ need for occupational therapy. The involvement of mental health care users in confirming relevant domains for the <b>outcome</b> <b>measure</b> ensured a client-centred approach in the research process. The <b>outcome</b> <b>measure,</b> named as the Activity Participation <b>Outcome</b> <b>Measure</b> (APOM), has a unique feature of generating reports and spider graphs for every mental health care user. The APOM was piloted in three mental health care settings. In spite of good intentions from clinicians to apply the measure, it was clear that <b>measuring</b> <b>outcomes</b> is neither a priority, nor a routine task in clinical settings. The preliminary investigation into the psychometric properties yielded positive results. However, the sample sizes for the validity and reliability samples were not optimal and further data collection needs to continue for confirmation. It is recommended that investigations into the psychometric properties of the instrument continue to eventually market it as a valid and reliable <b>outcome</b> <b>measure</b> for occupational therapists in mental health care settings.

2500|$|Unusual {{responses}} to sensory stimuli {{are more common}} and prominent in children with autism, although there is not good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Several therapies {{have been developed to}} treat Sensory processing disorder. Some of these treatments (for example, sensorimotor handling) have a questionable rationale and have no empirical evidence. Other treatments have been studied, with small positive outcomes, but few conclusions can be drawn due to methodological problems with the studies. These treatments include prism lenses, physical exercise, auditory integration training, and sensory stimulation or inhibition techniques such as [...] "deep pressure"—firm touch pressure applied either manually or via an apparatus such as a hug machine or a pressure garment. Weighted vests, a popular deep-pressure therapy, have only a limited amount of scientific research available, which on balance indicates that the therapy is ineffective. Although replicable treatments have been described and valid <b>outcome</b> <b>measures</b> are known, gaps exist in knowledge related to Sensory processing disorder and therapy. In a 2011 Cochrane review, no evidence was found to support the use of auditory integration training as an ASD treatment method.
