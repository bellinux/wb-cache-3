40|$|Abstract: In {{the next}} {{generation}} near-field optical data storage systems, higher data transfer rate and higher data density require the optical pickup head to maintain a constant sub-micrometer flying height above the rotating disk surface without any collisions. However, suspension vibration and force disturbance, as well as disk vibration {{make it difficult to}} maintain the desired flying height during disk operation in the near-field <b>optical</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> (ODD). It is proposed in this paper to design a hybrid actuator system which combines both advantages of the flying slide used in hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> and the voice coil actuator used in <b>optical</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> Then based on the developed model of the hybrid actuator, an adaptive regulation approach is proposed to regulate the flying height at its desired value, despite the unknown vibrations and the unknown force disturbance. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed and simulation results are presented to illustrate the capability of the proposed adaptive regulation approach to achieve and maintain the desired flying height.

50|$|The {{diversity}} of hardware modchips operate on and varying methods they use mean that while modchips {{are often used}} for the same goal, they may work in vastly different ways, {{even if they are}} intended for use on the same console. Some of the first modchips for the Nintendo Wii known as drive chips, modify the behaviour and communication of the optical drive to bypass security. While on the Xbox 360, a common modchip took advantage of the fact short periods of instability in the CPU could be used to fairly reliably lead it to incorrectly compare security signatures. The precision required in this attack meant the modchip made use of a CPLD. Other modchips, such as the XenoGC and clones for the Nintendo GameCube, invoke a debug mode where security measures are reduced or absent, in this case a stock Atmel AVR microcontroller was used. A more recent innovation are <b>optical</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> emulators or ODDE, these replace the <b>optical</b> <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> and allow data to come from another source bypassing the need to circumvent any security.
