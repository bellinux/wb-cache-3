Mechanical resonators typically have a Q of 10,000 <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> 25,000 can be achieved in torsional resonators using a particular nickel-iron alloy.

5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals or join together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer <b>or</b> <b>so.</b> <b>And</b> for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what it thinks is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E

5|$|Emus {{begin to}} settle down at sunset and sleep during the night. They do not sleep {{continuously}} but rouse themselves {{several times during the}} night. When falling asleep, emus first squat on their tarsi and enter a drowsy state during which they are alert enough to react to stimuli and quickly return to a fully awakened state if disturbed. As they fall into deeper sleep, their neck droops closer to the body and the eyelids begin to close. If there are no disturbances, they fall into a deeper sleep after about twenty minutes. During this phase, the body is gradually lowered until it is touching the ground with the legs folded underneath. The beak is turned down so that the whole neck becomes S-shaped and folded onto itself. The feathers direct any rain downwards onto the ground. It has been suggested that the sleeping position is a type of camouflage, mimicking a small mound. Emus typically awake from deep sleep once every ninety minutes <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>and</b> stand upright to feed briefly or defecate. This period of wakefulness lasts for ten to twenty minutes, after which they return to slumber. Overall, an emu sleeps for around seven hours in each twenty-four-hour period. Young emus usually sleep with their neck flat and stretched forward along the ground surface.|$|E

25|$|Magnesium-rich olivine forms a large {{proportion}} of peridotite, and so magnesium content is high. Layered igneous complexes have much more varied compositions, depending on the fractions of pyroxenes, chromite, plagioclase, and amphibole. Minor minerals and mineral groups in peridotite include plagioclase, spinel (commonly the mineral chromite), garnet (especially the mineral pyrope), amphibole, and phlogopite. In peridotite, plagioclase is stable at relatively low pressures (crustal depths), aluminous spinel at higher pressures (to depths of 60km <b>or</b> <b>so),</b> <b>and</b> garnet at yet higher pressures.|$|E
25|$|The {{quadratic}} sieve algorithm (QS) is an integer factorization algorithm and, in practice, the second fastest method known (after the general number field sieve). It {{is still the}} fastest for integers under 100 decimal digits <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> is considerably simpler than the number field sieve. It is a general-purpose factorization algorithm, meaning that its running time depends solely {{on the size of}} the integer to be factored, and not on special structure or properties. It was invented by Carl Pomerance in 1981 as an improvement to Schroeppel's linear sieve.|$|E
25|$|Two seam bowlers {{are usually}} {{expected}} to bowl in tandem {{for the first}} 10 or so overs, after which time the ball may begin to swing and {{one or both of}} them is substituted for a swing bowler or a spin bowler. This is why most sides opt to include at least two seam bowlers who are known as opening bowlers. Seam bowling usually becomes very ineffective with older balls and is virtually useless after 60 overs <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>and</b> as a result the bowling places in the side are filled with swing or spin bowlers.|$|E

25|$|Transcriptomics {{has been}} characterised by the {{development}} of new techniques which have redefined what is possible every decade <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>and</b> render previous technologies obsolete. The first attempt at capturing a partial human transcriptome was published in 1991 and reported 609 mRNA sequences from the human brain. In 2008, two human transcriptomes, composed of millions of transcript-derived sequences covering 16,000 genes, were published and, by 2015, transcriptomes had been published for hundreds of individuals. Transcriptomes of different disease states, tissues or even single cells are now routinely generated. This explosion in transcriptomics has been driven by the rapid development of new technologies with improved sensitivity and economy.|$|E

25|$|During {{the female}} sex flush, pinkish spots develop under the breasts, then {{spread to the}} breasts, torso, face, hands, soles of the feet, and {{possibly}} over the entire body. Vasocongestion is also responsible for the darkening of the clitoris and {{the walls of the}} vagina during sexual arousal. During the male sex flush, the coloration of the skin develops less consistently than in the female, but typically starts with the epigastrium (upper abdomen), spreads across the chest, then continues to the neck, face, forehead, back, and sometimes, shoulders and forearms. The sex flush typically disappears soon after orgasm occurs, but this may take up to two hours <b>or</b> <b>so</b> <b>and,</b> sometimes, intense sweating will occur simultaneously.

Their reproduction process is seasonal and in Mongolia the season is towards the end of May, June or July. Mating stallions do not start looking for mating partners until the age of five. Instinctively, the stallion will look to create his own group of mares or else wander until he finds a group with its own leader. If the stallion finds a group of mares with its own leader, the stallion will usually fight the other leader stallion of the group. The mares will adjust and follow the victor. After birth, the foal can stand almost immediately (only taking about an hour <b>or</b> <b>so)</b> <b>and</b> can walk on its own. The foals drink milk from the mother mare.|$|E
25|$|Peru {{contains}} over {{two-thirds of}} all tropical glaciers which provide important water sources for the dry western half of the country. These glaciers are rapidly melting {{as a result of}} climate change, making the flow of rivers more irregular, leading to more droughts and floods. A report by a team from the World Bank published in June 2007 in the bulletin of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) predicts that many of the lower glaciers in the Andes will be gone in the next decade <b>or</b> <b>so,</b> <b>and</b> that glacial runoff may dry up altogether within 20 years. The last comprehensive satellite survey by Peru's National Environmental Council, carried out in 1997, found that the area covered by glaciers had shrunk by 22% since the early 1960s.
