5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden <b>orb</b> <b>weaver</b> (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
25|$|The golden silk <b>orb</b> <b>weaver</b> targets many {{different}} organisms as prey, ranging from small flies and beetles to larger cicadas and locusts. As {{a result of}} their strong web structure small birds and bats can also become trapped and fed upon. Whilst most of the captured prey is relatively small compared to Nephila sp the majority of biomass consumed comes from larger more rare prey. Prey larger than 66% of the captors size accounts for just 16.5% of prey captured but 85% of prey consumed, indicating the spider is selective in its feeding habits.|$|E
25|$|Nephila produce large {{asymmetric}} orb webs {{up to one}} and a half {{meters in}} diameter. The hub of the web is not positioned centrally but rather in the upper section; this means {{that the majority of the}} sticky capture strands are found in the lower section of the web.Nephila species remain in their webs permanently and therefore have a higher predation risk. There is a barrier web structure on either side of the main web to mitigate this risk. The golden silk <b>orb</b> <b>weaver</b> is named for the yellow color of the spider silk used to construct these webs.|$|E

500|$|The mimic {{may have}} a {{particular}} significance for duped prey. One such case is spiders, amongst which aggressive mimicry is quite common both in luring prey and disguising stealthily approaching predators. One case is the golden <b>orb</b> <b>weaver</b> (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colours were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow-pigmented webs with danger. Yellow is the colour of many nectar-bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worthwhile. Another form of mimicry is based not on colour but pattern.

Instead they rest in the centre of the web with their head downwards. Males are usually found on nearby vegetation.|$|E

40|$|SummarySpiders {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} successful clades of terrestrial predators [1]. Their extraordinary diversity, paralleled only by some insects and mites [2], is often attributed to the use of silk, and, in {{one of the}} largest lineages, to stereotyped behaviors for building foraging webs of remarkable biomechanical properties [1]. However, our understanding of higher-level spider relationships is poor and is largely based on morphology [2 – 4]. Prior molecular efforts have focused on a handful of genes [5, 6] but have provided little resolution to key questions such as the origin of the <b>orb</b> <b>weavers</b> [1]. We apply a next-generation sequencing approach to resolve spider phylogeny, examining the relationships among its major lineages. We further explore possible pitfalls in phylogenomic reconstruction, including missing data, unequal rates of evolution, and others. Analyses of multiple data sets all agree on the basic structure of the spider tree and all reject the long-accepted monophyly of Orbiculariae, by placing the cribellate <b>orb</b> <b>weavers</b> (Deinopoidea) with other groups and not with the ecribellate <b>orb</b> <b>weavers</b> (Araneoidea). These results imply independent origins for the two types of orb webs (cribellate and ecribellate) or a much more ancestral origin of the orb web with subsequent loss in the so-called RTA clade. Either alternative demands a major reevaluation of our current understanding of the spider evolutionary chronicle...|$|R

The results are compared with the metabolic data available for other spiders. A low metabolic rate is found both for these two species and other primitive hunters and weavers, such as spiders of the families Dysderidae and Plectreuridae. The metabolic rate of this group is lower than in nonprimitive spiders, such as the <b>orb</b> <b>weavers</b> (Araneae: Araneidae). The results reject the proposition of a general relationship for metabolic rate for all land arthropods (related to body mass) and agree with the hypothesis that metabolic rates are affected not only by sex, reproductive and developmental status, but also by ecology and life style, recognizing here, {{at least in the}} araneomorph spiders, a group having low metabolism, comprising the primitive hunters and weaver spiders, and another group comprising the higher metabolic rate web building spiders (e. g. <b>orb</b> <b>weavers).</b> FONDECYT 	 111005...|$|R
