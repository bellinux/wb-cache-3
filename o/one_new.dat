Arizona was authorized on 4 March 1913, but to avoid a lengthy delay between the two, the ship was ordered much more quickly, on 24 June, by giving the contract to a navy-owned shipyard.|$|E

5|$|By 1896, {{the company}} {{produced}} <b>one</b> <b>new</b> car {{every two to}} three weeks and built vehicles on order for $2,000. As the orders increased, the company formally incorporated as Haynes-Apperson on May 5, 1898, with $25,000 in capital from stock issued to Portland and Kokomo businessmen. At the end of that year the company relocated to a large factory it had built in Kokomo. Two new models were designed and the workforce expanded as production increased. Haynes-Apperson ran advertisements in area newspapers and demonstrated cars at county fairs and other exhibitions. Demand for the vehicles grew rapidly from five cars produced in 1898 to thirty in 1899, 192 in 1900, and 240 in 1901. The work kept the factory open 24 hours a day, and two shifts totaling more than 350 workers were needed to keep the factory running at capacity by 1902. Sales totaled over $400,000 that year.|$|E
5|$|During 2009, Ramsay had {{financial}} issues with tax payments. A liquidation petition was placed by HM Revenue and Customs against Plane Food, Maze, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay and The Narrow. He was given {{two weeks to}} pay the tax debts accumulated by Plane Food. It was announced on 10 December that he had achieved this and the restaurant remained open. His 2010 opening, Bread Street Kitchen, {{was based on the}} same concept as Plane Food, as its location within the <b>One</b> <b>New</b> Change office and retail development created a similar need to cater for quick dining and a high volume of single diners.|$|E

In 1932 he starred in Richard of Bordeaux by Elizabeth MacKintosh. This, a retelling in modern language {{of the events of}} Richard II, was greeted as the most successful historical play since Shaw's Saint Joan nine years earlier, more faithful to the events than Shakespeare had been. After an uncertain start in the West End it rapidly became a sell-out hit and played in London and on tour over the next three years.|$|E

The Float@Marina Bay, a floating stage, was the main stadium for the Games.

5|$|Five Nights at Freddy's 4 reintroduces removed tools, {{specifically}} {{the doors and}} flashlight, albeit with slightly altered usage. The doors can only be closed when the player is next to them, and will re-open if the player moves away. However, if the player shuts the doors too early, the animatronics will jump scare the player when the door is opened. The flashlight can no-longer run out, but only alerts player {{to the presence of}} animatronics as opposed to warding them away, excluding the miniature Freddies that appear on the bed. If the player flashes the flashlight while an animatronic is in the doorway, the player will be jumpscared. There is <b>one</b> <b>new</b> mechanic, where the player must listen for breathing audio. This can determine whether to use the flashlight or close the door.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only <b>one</b> <b>new</b> signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As a testament to Chapman's philosophy of relying on a strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning side had gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E
