500|$|Positive reviews {{praised the}} film's {{take on a}} classic Disney story, its comedy and musical numbers {{as well as the}} {{performance}} of its lead actress, Amy Adams. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality" [...] and one that [...] "has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life". Film critics of Variety and LA Weekly remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. LA Weekly described the film as [...] "the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with Hairspray) but hasn't managed to get right until now" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "More than Disney's strictly animated product, Enchanted, in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population – niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this <b>off</b> <b>today</b> is no small feat." [...] Enchanted was the Broadcast Film Critics Association's choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it the 4th best film of 2007.|$|E

The city has been frozen in time, with houses, department stores and hotels empty and looted, even to the tiles on bathroom walls.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times said of Landon, [...] "Though {{a serious}} and {{prolific}} scholar, Mr. Landon also {{had a knack for}} making musicology seem exciting to the general public." [...] Charles Rosen, in a review of Landon's five-volume Haydn compendium, expressed admiration and gratitude to the author for his energy in bringing all of Haydn's music, particularly the complete symphonies, to publication: [...] "Only a few decades ago there were still immense tracts of unexplored Haydn. ... That we are better <b>off</b> <b>today</b> is owing {{in large part to the}} work of Robbins Landon." [...] However, he faults Landon for haphazard scholarship and analysis, observing that [...] "much of what he writes is sensitive and penetrating, and it is all informed by a great love of Haydn and an enthusiasm which would be infectious if the book were not so disorganized and unsystematic. ... He writes like a man going quickly through the pages of Haydn's works and pointing out to a friend the passages he likes most." ...|$|E

The deal brought KYW-TV under common ownership with Philadelphia's UPN station, WPSG, which relocated to the KYW Building on Independence Mall.

On the Tacuba Causeway across Lake Texcoco connecting Tenochtitlan {{to the mainland}} along a street now known as Puente de Alvarado (Alvarado's Bridge) in Mexico City, Pedro de Alvarado made a mad cavalry charge across {{a gap in the}} Causeway. As Alvardo and his cavalry emerged {{on the other side of}} the gap with the infantry behind, Aztec canoes filled the gap. Pedro de Alvarado was wounded along with eight men in his camp. Alvarado escaped from the ambush, but five of his men were captured and taken off to the Great Temple to be sacrificed. Much to their horror, the Spanish from their positions could see their captured comrades being sacrificed on the Great Pyramid, which increased their hatred of the Aztecs. At the end of each day, the Spanish gave a prayer: [...] "Oh, thanks be to God that they did not carry me <b>off</b> <b>today</b> to be sacrificed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hackett criticized Schmidt as a [...] "rubber stamp" [...] for Governor Bob Taft's [...] "failed policies", {{and claimed}} she would {{continue}} {{in that role}} for George W. Bush if elected. At their debate at Chatfield College, Hackett said [...] "If you think America {{is on the right}} track and we need more of the same, I'm not your candidate" [...] and asked [...] "Are you better <b>off</b> <b>today</b> than you were five years ago?", echoing Ronald Reagan's question in his debate with Jimmy Carter in 1980. [...] "Rubber stamp" [...] was Hackett's catchphrase throughout the campaign. Hackett even appeared in front of the Hathaway Rubber Stamp store in downtown Cincinnati on July 27 to emphasize the point. [...] "If you think America needs another career politician steeped in a culture of corruption who does as she's told and toes the line on failed policies, then I'm not your candidate," [...] he wrote in a guest column for The Cincinnati Post. However, Schmidt said that she was proud to be associated with Bush, sending campaign mail with a photograph of them together in the Oval Office.|$|E
2500|$|However, the Fu Zi gave a {{completely}} different account of Guo's advice to Cao Cao {{on how to handle}} Liu Bei. Guo Jia told Cao Cao, [...] "Liu Bei has great ambitions and has won the hearts of many people. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are formidable fighters and they have pledged to serve him with their lives. From what I observe, Liu Bei will never truly submit to anyone, and his intentions are unclear. The people in the past once said, 'If you let the enemy <b>off</b> <b>today,</b> they will become a threat to you for a long time.' You should settle (Liu Bei) soon." [...] At the time, Cao Cao was using Emperor Xian as a figurehead to command respect and had attracted many heroes to serve under him so he did not heed Guo Jia's advice. When Cao Cao later sent Liu Bei with an army to attack Yuan Shu, Guo Jia and Cheng Yu warned Cao, [...] "Liu Bei will rebel if you let him go!" [...] By then, Liu Bei had already left and he really did rebel against Cao Cao as he later seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao regretted not following Guo Jia's advice.|$|E

Likely enough they had the {{mainsail}} already up and the chain short, and directly the boat was up at the davits they would have got up the anchor and been off. They may be twenty miles away by this time; though whether east or west one has no means of even guessing. The wind is nearly due north, {{and they may have}} gone either way, or have made for Cherbourg or Havre. It depends partly upon her size. If she is a small craft, they can't get far beyond that range. If she is a large one, she may have gone anywhere. The worst of it is that unless we can get some clue as to her size we can do absolutely nothing. A good many yachts went <b>off</b> <b>today</b> both east and west, {{and by the end of}} the week the whole fleet will be scattered, and even if we do get the size of the yacht, I don't see that we can do anything unless we can get her name too.|$|E

You see, this {{afternoon}} their guns have all been firing at a fresh place in the wall; and if they make another breach or two, and attack at them all together, it will be hopeless to try to defend them. You see, now that we have several sick and wounded, the notion of making our escape is almost knocked on the head. At the last moment each may try to save his life, but there must be no desertion of the sick and wounded {{as long as there is}} a cartridge to be fired. Our best hope is in getting assistance from somewhere, but we know nothing of what is going on outside. I think the best plan will be for one of our number to try to make his way out, and go either to Lucknow, Agra, or Allahabad, and try and get help. If they could spare a troop of cavalry it might be sufficient; the mutineers have suffered very heavily; there were over a hundred and fifty bodies carried out today, and if attacked suddenly I don't think they would make any great resistance. We may hold out for a week or ten days, but I think that is the outside; and if rescue does not arrive by that time we must either surrender or try to escape by that passage." ...|$|E

I am not at liberty to tell you the reason why I requested you to ride with me; but it is very probable that you may be asked the question, and I beg you all to remember that we have been on a little party of pleasure to St. Germain, and having dined there were on our way back when we overtook the carriage of the cardinal; and seeing that he had the Duke of Orleans with him, we reined back and followed him, deeming that it would not appear respectful were we to gallop past the carriage. Please bear this story in mind. Recall also that we dined at the Lion d'Or there, that our dinner was a good one and that it was a sort of celebration on my part of our two companies having the honour to be chosen for duty in Paris. This is a matter upon which much depends; it is, in fact, a matter of state; and you may well imagine that I should not be recalling these events to your mind were it not that a good deal depends upon it, and that I have received strict orders that this little comedy shall be carried out. I know that I can rely implicitly upon your discretion, and I have indeed answered for you all. The story will be true in every respect. Instead of the excursion having come <b>off</b> <b>today</b> it shall come off on the first day I can arrange that we can be all off duty." ...|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} of the {{establishment}} of the Town of Toronto, three large wharves existed for shipping, King's Wharf at Peter Street, Cooper's Wharf at Church Street and Merchant's Wharf at Caroline Street (today's Sherbourne Street). The new Queen's Wharf, at the foot of Bathurst Street, was constructed in two stages, eventually reaching 244 ft in length. Commissioned by the Province of Upper Canada, it cost £4,500. The first harbourmaster of Toronto, Hugh Richardson, was named in 1833. Richardson held the position until 1870. While the Queen's Wharf no longer exists, the Queen's Wharf Lighthouse still exists, eventually moved to a location <b>off</b> <b>today's</b> Lake Shore Boulevard in 1929.

50|$|The {{island in}} its current form has only existed for about 400 years. Like the {{mainland}} geestland, it was formed of moraines from the older ice ages, thus being made up of a till core, which is now apparent in the island's west and centre by the cliff, dunes and beach. This sandy core began to erode as it was exposed to a strong current along the island's steep basement when the sea level rose 8000 years ago. During the process, sediments were accumulated north and south of the island. The west coast, which was originally situated 10 km <b>off</b> <b>today's</b> shore, was thus gradually moved eastward, {{while at the same time}} the island began to extend to the north and south. After the ice ages, marshland began to form around this geestland core.|$|R

Fidalgo continued along the Alaskan coast, reaching today's Gravina Point, where the same ceremony re-asserting Spanish sovereignty was performed.
