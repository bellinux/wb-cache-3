40|$|AbstractReliable {{electricity}} and heat production as well as related issues {{are one of the}} components <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> security. Considerable part <b>of</b> general <b>energy</b> sector consists <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> sources, such as wind, photovoltaic (PV), biofuel and hydro. Thus, it is important to assess which renewable resources in the most efficient way should be used and which part <b>of</b> the subsequent <b>energy</b> sector should be covered by <b>energy</b> system <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> sources. In the context of renewable resources the key criteria assessing energy security are the amount <b>of</b> unsupplied <b>energy</b> and the price increase <b>of</b> supplied <b>energy</b> for all possible disturbance cases. Various scenarios <b>of</b> renewable <b>energy</b> sources usage are analyzed in the article that help to predict which one of the scenarios would be the “best” in terms <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> security and provides a possibility to forecast perspective development <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> sector...|$|R

5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is in terms <b>of</b> <b>energy.</b> A {{molecule}} {{in contact with}} a neighbor is in a lower state <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
