40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>combining</b> {{calculus}} [MSK 07] {{provides a}} framework for analyzing <b>the</b> information flow <b>of</b> multi-threaded programs. <b>The</b> calculus incorporates so called plug-in rules for integrating several previously existing analysis techniques. By applying a plug-in rule to a subprogram, one decides to analyze this subprogram with the given analysis technique, and not with <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>combining</b> calculus. <b>The</b> novelty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>combining</b> calculus was that one can analyze the information flow security of a given program by using multiple analysis techniques in combination. It was demonstrated that this flexibility leads to a more precise analysis, allowing one to successfully verify <b>the</b> security <b>of</b> some programs that cannot be verified with any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing analysis techniques in isolation. In [MSK 07], <b>the</b> soundness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>combining</b> calculus is proved for a possibilistic characterization of information flow security. This characterization assumes a purely nondeterministic scheduling of concurrent threads. In this report, we demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>combining</b> calculus is also sound for a probabilistic characterization of security that assumes a uniform scheduler. This result further increases the confidence in <b>the</b> <b>combining</b> calculus as a reliable and flexible tool for formally analyzing the information flow security of multi-threaded programs. ...|$|R
