5|$|Iridium was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum. Smithson Tennant, the primary discoverer, named iridium for the Greek goddess Iris, personification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rainbow,</b> because of the striking and diverse colors of its salts. Iridium {{is one of the}} rarest elements in Earth's crust, with annual production and consumption of only three tonnes. 191Ir and 193Ir are the only two naturally occurring isotopes of iridium, as well as the only stable isotopes; the latter is the more abundant of the two.|$|E

This group has also ensured the area remains free of litter; they also hold occasional performances and arts-related celebrations at the site.

5|$|It is the {{eleventh}} {{entry in the}} Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series and the successor to , a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative. However, Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, and the team decided to reboot the franchise. The team evaluated the core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow</b> Six franchise and believed that letting players impersonate the top counter-terrorist operatives around the world suited the game most. To create authentic siege situations, the team consulted actual counter-terrorism units, and looked at real-life examples of sieges. Powered by AnvilNext 2.0, the game also utilizes Ubisoft's RealBlast technology to create destructible environments.|$|E

5|$|To {{make the}} new game feel refreshing, only certain {{multiplayer}} elements were retained as the small team took {{the game in}} a different direction. They evaluated the core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow</b> Six series, which they thought was about {{being a member of}} a counter-terrorist team traveling around the globe to deal with dangerous terrorist attacks – operations which are usually intense confrontations between attackers and defenders. However, the team wanted to fit these ideas into a multiplayer format which would increase the game's sustainability. These became the basic concept ideas for the game. As the development team hoped that the game can be replayed frequently, the team decided to devote all the resources into developing the game's multiplayer and abandoned the single-player campaign.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{new type}} of large-displacement {{actuator}} called RAINBOW (Reduced And Internally Biased Oxide Wafer) was fabricated by a chemical reduction of PSZT antiferroelectric ceramic.

The AFE-FE phase transitions occur at lower field strength in RAINBOWs compared with normal PSZT. Larger axial displacement (about 190 μm) was obtained from <b>the</b> <b>RAINBOWs</b> by application <b>of</b> electric fields exceeding the phase switching level. <b>The</b> field-induced displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>RAINBOWs</b> is dependent on <b>the</b> manner <b>of</b> applying <b>the</b> load on the samples...|$|R

40|$|Part 2 : The 2014 Asian Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security, AsiaARES 2014 International audienceMultivariate Public Key Cryptosystems (MPKC) {{is one of}} {{candidates}} for post-quantum cryptography. Rainbow is an MPKC digital signature scheme, with relatively efficient encryption and decryption processes. However, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> MPKC key is substantially larger than that of an RSA cryptosystem for the same security level. In this paper, we propose a variant of Rainbow that has a smaller secret key. The smaller secret key is to <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a different description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadratic polynomials appearing in the secret key from that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>Rainbow.</b> In addition, our scheme improves <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rainbow’s</b> signature generation.
