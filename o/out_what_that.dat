I believe leadership is bottom up, not top down. I {{think you have to}} build policy and strategy and vision from the bottom up, and involve people in figuring <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> is.|$|E
500|$|In fact, {{according}} to the Duhem–Quine thesis, after Pierre Duhem and W. V. Quine, {{it is impossible to}} test a theory in isolation. [...] One must always add auxiliary hypotheses in order to make testable predictions. For example, to test Newton's Law of Gravitation in the solar system, one needs information about the masses and positions of the Sun and all the planets. [...] Famously, the failure to predict the orbit of Uranus in the 19th century led not to the rejection of Newton's Law but rather to the rejection of the hypothesis that the solar system comprises only seven planets. The investigations that followed led to the discovery of an eighth planet, Neptune. If a test fails, something is wrong. But there is a problem in figuring <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> something is: a missing planet, badly calibrated test equipment, an unsuspected curvature of space, or something else.|$|E
500|$|People {{are always}} {{using the word}} Illuminati but they're always {{referencing}} it in an incorrect way. People often accuse me of {{being a member of}} the Illuminati and I think in today's pop culture the Illuminati is perceived as a group of powerful, successful people who are working behind the scenes to control the universe. Not people with consciousness, not people who are enlightened. So people were accusing me of {{being a member of the}} Illuminati, and I kept going, wait—so first I had to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meant...I know who the real Illuminati are, and I know where that word comes from. The real Illuminati were a group of scientists, artists, philosophers, writers, who came about in what is referred to as the Age of Enlightenment, after the Dark Ages, when there was no writing and no art and no creativity and no spirituality, and life was really at a standstill. And right after that, everything flourished. So we had people like Shakespeare and Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Isaac Newton, and all these great minds and great thinkers, and they were called Illuminati...It had nothing to do with money and power. Of course they were powerful, because they influenced people. But their goal was to inspire and enlighten. So when people refer to me as a member of the Illuminati, I always want to say thank you. Thank you for putting me in that category.|$|E

60|$|For then: Prudence might {{demand of}} them, {{that they should}} find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> are <b>that</b> King's ways, {{thoughts}} and laws, and obey them--an enquiry so troublesome, that many very highly educated persons consider it, now-a- days, quite impossible; and tell us that, for practical purposes, God's laws can neither be discovered, nor obeyed.|$|R

60|$|Some {{people would}} have put this and that {{together}} and perceived that the weather never changed until one particular subject was introduced, and that then it always changed. And they would have looked further, and perceived that that subject was always introduced by the one party, never the other. They would have argued, then, that this was done for a purpose. If they could not find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> purpose was in any simpler or easier way, they would ask.|$|E
60|$|But I am {{not easily}} baffled. After all, this key {{must have been}} sent to us for a purpose. The lady could not bring us that of the door, because this murderous step-father of hers would most {{certainly}} have it in his pocket. Yet this other must have a meaning, or why should she risk her life to place it in our hands? It would say little for our wits if we could not find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> meaning might be.|$|E

60|$|So {{they sat}} {{perfectly}} still among the brown stalks {{of the wild}} rice {{along the edge of}} the Big River, and not for a second did they take their eyes from that strange thing moving towards them. They were ready to spring into the air and trust to their swift wings the instant they should detect danger. But they did not want to fly unless they had to. Besides, they were curious. They were very curious indeed. They wanted to find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> mysterious thing moving through the water towards them was.|$|E
60|$|It {{ended in}} his {{referring}} {{the decision to}} Laura, who, disliking London, fearful for his health, eager for his glory, and reluctant to keep back such a champion from the battle, was much perplexed, only desirous {{to say what he}} wished, yet not able to make <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> might be. She carried her doubts to Charles and Amabel, who both pronounced that the thought of going to Redclyffe seemed far worse for him than any degree of employment--that occupation of the mind was the best thing for his spirits; and ended by recommending that Dr. Mayerne should be consulted.|$|E

60|$|Now, I {{was going}} to make a speech--I {{supposed}} I was, but I am not. It is late, late; and so I am going to tell a story; and there is this advantage about a story, anyway, that whatever moral or valuable thing you put into a speech, why, it gets diffused among those involuted sentences and possibly your audience goes away without finding <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> valuable thing was that you were trying to confer upon it; but, dear me, you put the same jewel into a story and it becomes the keystone of that story, and you are bound to get it--it flashes, it flames, it is the jewel in the toad's head--you don't overlook that.|$|E

60|$|Another sailor {{was sitting}} astride of the spanker-boom, {{with his arms}} over his head, but I never could find <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>that</b> was for; a second was in the fore-top, with a coil of glass rigging over his shoulder; the cook, with a glass ax, was {{splitting}} wood near the fore-hatch; the steward, in a glass apron, was hurrying toward the cabin with a plate of glass pudding; and a glass dog, with a red mouth, was barking at him; while the captain in a glass cap was smoking a glass cigar on the quarterdeck.
