5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints.

5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals. In humans, they occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on {{all parts of the}} skin except the palms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and soles of the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E
5|$|The aerial {{game was}} also {{developed}} within the Sheffield game.

5|$|At first glance, all the Buddha statues appear similar, {{but there}} is a subtle {{difference}} between them in the mudras, or the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands.</b> There are five groups of mudra: North, East, South, West and Zenith, which represent the five cardinal compass points according to Mahayana. The first four balustrades have the first four mudras: North, East, South and West, of which the Buddha statues that face one compass direction have the corresponding mudra. Buddha statues at the fifth balustrades and inside the 72 stupas on the top platform have the same mudra: Zenith. Each mudra represents one of the Five Dhyani Buddhas; each has its own symbolism.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were blackening and hyperkeratosis of the skin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands,</b> conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and soles of the feet {{were involved in the}} majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> are <b>the</b> {{skeletal}} muscles {{responsible for}} <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> and fingers. <b>The</b> muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> can be subdivided into two groups: the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle groups. The extrinsic muscle groups are the long flexors and extensors. They are called extrinsic because the muscle belly {{is located on}} the forearm. The intrinsic group are the smaller muscles located within <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> itself. <b>The</b> muscles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> are innervated by the radial, median, and ulnar nerves from the brachial plexus.|$|R
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the hypopituitarism {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
5|$|The city {{reached its}} peak in the 12th century, with a {{population}} of approximately 200,000. It was the centre of administrative power in Egypt, until it was ordered burnt in 1168 by its own vizier, Shawar, to keep its wealth out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of the invading Crusaders. The remains of the city were eventually absorbed by nearby Cairo, which had been built to the north of Fustat in 969 when the Fatimids conquered the region and created a new city as a royal enclosure for the Caliph. The area fell into disrepair for hundreds of years and was used as a rubbish dump.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, {{including}} soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe {{down the back}} (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large eyes and a tapetum lucidum to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and feet are off-white.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> {{and feet}} in pterosaurs (by comparison with modern {{animals such as}} birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle pterosaurs led on the ground. Azhdarchid pterosaurs had relatively small feet compared to their body size and leg length, with foot length only about 25%–30% {{the length of the}} lower leg. This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted to walking on dry, relatively solid ground. Pteranodon had slightly larger feet (47% the length of the tibia), while filter-feeding pterosaurs like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial length in Pterodactylus, 84% in Pterodaustro), adapted to walking in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{towns of}} Gonzales and San Felipe de Austin were burned {{to keep them}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> of the Mexican army. Santa Anna was intent on {{executing}} members of the Republic's interim government, who fled from Washington-on-the-Brazos to Groce's Landing to Harrisburg and New Washington. The government officials eventually escaped to Galveston Island, and Santa Anna burned the towns of Harrisburg and New Washington when he failed to find them. Approximately 5,000 terrified residents of New Washington fled from the Mexican army. After a little over a month of training the troops, Houston reached a crossroads where he ordered some of them to escort the fleeing refugees farther east while he took the main army southeast to engage the Mexican army. The subsequent Battle of San Jacinto resulted in the surrender of Santa Anna and the signing of the Treaties of Velasco.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We propose {{algorithms}} {{and applications}} for using <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> as an interface device in virtual and physical spaces. In virtual drawing, by tracking <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> in 3 -D and estimating a virtual plane in space, <b>the</b> intended drawing <b>of</b> user is recognized. In a virtual marble game, <b>the</b> instantaneous orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> is simulated to render a graphical scene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game board. Real-time visual feedback allows {{the user to}} navigate a virtual ball in a maze. In 3 -D model construction, the system tracks <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> motion in space while the user is traversing edges of a physical object. The object is then rendered virtually by the computer. These applications involve estimating the 3 -D absolute position and/or orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> in space. We propose parametric modelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> to extract this information. A stereo camera is used to first build a preliminary disparity map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand.</b> Then, <b>the</b> best fitting plane to the disparity points is computed using robust estimation. <b>The</b> 3 -D <b>hand</b> plane {{is calculated based on}} the disparity plane and the position and orientation parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand.</b> Tracking <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> region over a sequence of frames and coping with noise using robust modelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> motion enables estimating <b>the</b> trajectory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> in space. <b>The</b> algorithms are real-time and experiments are presented to demonstrate <b>the</b> proposed applications <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> <b>hand</b> as an interface device...|$|R

5|$|During his {{campaign}} and presidency, President George W. Bush endorsed {{the idea of}} background checks at gun shows.

On January 8, 2008 he signed the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) into law. Goals and objectives that the NIAA sought to address included: The gap in information available to NICS about such prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments.

5|$|Oryzomys antillarum was a {{medium-sized}} rodent, about {{as large as}} O.couesi. According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow {{on the inner side}} and the upper surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris natator, for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.|$|E
