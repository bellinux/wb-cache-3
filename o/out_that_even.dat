5|$|Treadgold's {{claim that}} Diocletian {{increased}} the army's numbers by over 50% is considered implausible by Heather, who points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> 33% {{would have required}} a Herculean effort.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an advisory opinion {{calling for an}} end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest in Native American culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceiling of}} the Sistine Chapel {{was to have a}} {{profound}} effect upon other artists, even before it was completed. Vasari, in his Life of Raphael, tells us that Bramante, who had the keys to the chapel, let Raphael in to examine the paintings in Michelangelo's absence. On seeing Michelangelo's prophets, Raphael went back to the picture of the Prophet Isaiah that he was painting on a column in the Church of Sant'Agostino and, according to Vasari, although it was finished, he scraped it off the wall and repainted it in a much more powerful manner, in imitation of Michelangelo. John O'Malley points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> earlier than the Isaiah is Raphael's inclusion of the figure of Heraclitus in the School of Athens, a brooding figure similar to Michelangelo's Jeremiah, but with the countenace of Michelangelo himself, and leaning on a block of marble.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen uttered a curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E
25|$|Al-Biruni divides Hindus into {{an educated}} and an uneducated class. He {{describes}} the educated as monotheistic, believing that God is one, eternal, and omnipotent and eschewing {{all forms of}} idol worship. He recognizes that uneducated Hindus worshipped a multiplicity of idols yet points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> some Muslims (such as the Jabiriyya) have adopted anthropomorphic concepts of God.|$|E
25|$|Heterosis, or {{hybrid vigor}} {{associated}} with historical reductions of {{the levels of}} inbreeding, has been proposed by Michael Mingroni as an alternative explanation of the Flynn effect. However, James Flynn has pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if everyone mated with a sibling in 1900, subsequent increases in heterosis {{would not be a}} sufficient explanation of the observed IQ gains.|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{thought of}} going <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> and the boys put in the time {{studying}} and reading. The windows rattled, and occasionally a shutter banged, and a good night's rest seemed out of the question.|$|R
5|$|Police, rejecting Kinne's story, {{theorized that}} she had gone <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> {{intending}} robbery, and had chosen Ordoñez as her victim. When he resisted her orders to give her his money, police believed, Kinne had shot him.|$|R

25|$|The Spanish had {{maintained}} a fort on Jolo, but controlled {{very little of}} the island. Upon his arrival, Governor Bravo sent some reinforcements, but the Spanish there were so worn <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> with the reinforcements, they abandoned the island, retreating to the Pintados. This emboldened the people of Jolo and nearby Mindanao to make raids on the Spanish in the Pintados and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|After the retrial, New Zealand's Chief Coroner {{consulted}} {{with the local}} coroner and others {{to decide whether to}} conduct inquests into the deaths, as the verdict implied the death certificates may not be accurate. However no inquests were held; a Law Society spokesman pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if the coroner's findings disagreed with the retrial verdict, this could not lead to any further legal action against Bain.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Levine's paper Conceivability, Identity, and the Explanatory Gap {{takes up}} where the criticisms of conceivability arguments, such as the {{inverted}} spectrum argument and the zombie argument, leave off. Levine agrees that conceivability is flawed {{as a means of}} establishing metaphysical realities, but points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if we come to the metaphysical conclusion that qualia are physical, there is still an explanatory problem.|$|E
60|$|She {{was to have}} dined <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> {{with her}} aunt, but when the time to dress came, she pleaded a violent headache, and persuaded Lady Thurwell, who was a good-natured little woman, to take an excuse.|$|R

25|$|While most cryptozoologists {{recognize}} {{that at least}} some reports are simple misidentifications, they claim that many of the creatures described by those who have seen them look nothing like the known species put forward by skeptics and claim that certain reports stick out. For their part, the skeptics remain unconvinced, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> in the absence of outright hoaxes, imagination has a way of twisting and inflating the slightly out-of-the-ordinary until it becomes extraordinary.|$|E
25|$|Commentators {{also point}} <b>out</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> if the ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed {{due to the}} economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the Ichthyostraca {{hypothesis}} {{have pointed}} <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> parasitic crustaceans {{can still be}} recognised as crustaceans based on their larvae; but that tongue worms and their larvae do not express typical characters for Crustacea or even Euarthropoda. An alternative model notes the extremely ancient Cambrian origins of these animals and interprets tongue worms as stem-group arthropods. A recent morphological analysis recovered Pentastomida outside the arthropods, as sister group to a clade including nematodes, priapulids and similar ecdysozoan 'worm' groups. Adding fossils, they suggested an extinct animal called Facivermis could be closely related to tongue worms. However it should be stressed that these authors did not explicitly test pentastomid/crustacean relationships.|$|E
50|$|Back in {{the present}} day Nigel's parents are visited by a {{journalist}} who informs them that he has seen a recording of Nigel's participation in the documentary, {{which is due to}} go <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> and wants to gauge their reactions to some of his comments. Nigel's father throws him out, angry at the journalist's insinuation that Nigel is ashamed of his roots.|$|R
60|$|One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> the first-named young gentleman took it {{into his}} head to evince some anxiety {{regarding}} the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this {{was by no means}} an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet, straightway.|$|R
60|$|Bianca {{did not see}} {{her husband}} after their return {{together}} from the Round Pond. She dined <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> {{and in the morning}} avoided any interview.

He tapped. She did not answer.|$|R
25|$|In {{the same}} year, after {{defeating}} Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao, Cao Cao {{wanted to move}} on to attack another rival warlord, Lü Bu. Many of his subordinates thought that it was too dangerous. However, Xun You had a different opinion. He believed that Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao had yet to recover from their recent defeat and would not make any further moves. He also pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though Lü Bu was a formidable warrior and had support from the warlord Yuan Shu, relations between them had recently deteriorated, so it was an opportune moment for Cao Cao to attack Lü Bu. Lü Bu defeated Liu Bei and received help from Zang Ba.|$|E
25|$|The Xia Dynasty held {{suzerainty}} over {{a number}} of kingdoms, one of which was the Kingdom of Shang. During Jie's reign, Shang grew in power, initially at the expense of Xia's other vassals. A person by the name of Tang of Shang was able to win many supporters from as many as 40 smaller kingdoms. Tang of Shang recognized that Jie mistreated the people and used this as a way to convince other supporters. In one speech Tang of Shang said that creating chaos is not something he wanted, but given the terror of Jie, he has to follow the mandate of heaven and use this opportunity to overthrow Xia. He also pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Jie’s own military generals would not obey his orders.|$|E
25|$|There {{are those}} that insist that because the governments of China and Taiwan {{abandoned}} their claims for monetary compensation, then the moral or legal responsibility for compensation belongs with these governments. Such critics also point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though these governments abandoned their claims, they signed treaties that recognised the transfer of Japanese colonial assets to the respective governments. Therefore, to claim that these governments received no compensation from Japan is incorrect, and they could have compensated individual victims from the proceeds of such transfers. Others dispute that Japanese colonial assets in large proportion were built or stolen with extortion or force in occupied countries, as was clearly the case with artworks collected (or stolen) by Nazis during World War II throughout Europe.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Monson {{continued}} his retreat, and reached Kooshalpur {{on the night}} of the 25th. He found that the native officer in command there had declared for Holkar; but that the fort, which contained the elephants and baggage, still held <b>out.</b> <b>That</b> <b>evening</b> Monson learnt <b>that</b> some of his Sepoy officers were in communication with Holkar; and two companies, and a large portion of the native cavalry deserted.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{however, they}} went to dinner, and while seated there, Miss Waddington told her aunt {{that she did not}} feel equal to going <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening.</b> Miss Baker of course said {{something}} in opposition to this, but that something was not much. It might easily be understood that a young lady who had just lost her lover was not in a fit state to go to a Littlebath card-party.|$|R
40|$|Fourth attempt of CL to get intonational data on questions, {{declarations}} and imperatives {{by asking}} somebody {{to enact the}} prepared material. But as this instruction wasn't clear enough, WN just asked to read the sentences which caused some difficulties, as people {{are not used to}} read the Totoli language. As this was the second time the sentences were read <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> the reading is a bit more fluent than the first time...|$|R
25|$|On 24 August, Hitler {{approved}} a general plan for seizing Gibraltar. On 23 October, he personally met with Franco at Hendaye, France, and proposed that Spain enter {{the war on}} the Axis side as early as January 1941; Gibraltar would be taken by special Wehrmacht units and turned over to Spain. Franco however refused the offer, emphasizing Spain's need for large-scale military and economic assistance. Hitler took offence when Franco expressed doubts {{about the possibility of}} a German victory in fighting the UK on its home territory. Franco also pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if the British Isles were invaded and conquered, the British government, as well as most of the British Army and vastly powerful Royal Navy, would probably retreat to Canada and continue the Battle of the Atlantic, with U.S. support.|$|E
25|$|Goldman Sachs' {{entry into}} the {{commodities}} market via the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index has been implicated by some in the 2007–2008 world food price crisis. In a 2010 article in Harper's magazine, Frederick Kaufman accused Goldman Sachs of profiting while many people went hungry or even starved. He argued that Goldman's large purchases of long-options on wheat futures created a demand shock in the wheat market, which disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand and price levels. He argues that {{the result was a}} 'contango' wheat market on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which caused prices of wheat to rise much higher than normal, defeating the purpose of the exchanges (price stabilization) in the first place. however, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – using data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission – showed tracking funds (of which Goldman Sachs Commodity Index was one) did not cause the bubble. For example, the report points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> commodities without futures markets also saw price rises during the period. Some commodities without futures markets saw their prices rise {{as a consequence of the}} rising prices of commodities with futures markets: the World Development Movement states there is strong evidence that the rising price of wheat caused the price of rice to subsequently rise as well.|$|E
25|$|On April 4, 1975, Aquino {{announced}} that he was going on a hunger strike, a fast to the death to protest the injustices of his military trial. Ten days through his hunger strike, he instructed his lawyers to withdraw all motions he had submitted to the Supreme Court. As weeks went by, he subsisted solely on salt tablets, sodium bicarbonate, amino acids, and two glasses of water a day. Even as he grew weaker, suffering from chills and cramps, soldiers forcibly dragged him to the military tribunal's session. His family and hundreds of friends and supporters heard Mass nightly at the Santuario de San Jose in Greenhills, San Juan, praying for his survival. Near the end, Aquino's weight had dropped from 54 to 36 kilos. Aquino nonetheless was able to walk throughout his ordeal. On May 13, 1975, on the 40th day, his family and several priests and friends, begged him to end his fast, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Christ fasted only for 40 days. He acquiesced, confident that he had made a symbolic gesture. But he remained in prison, and the trial continued, drawn out for several years. On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission charged Aquino along with NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad. The death sentence was never carried out as Aquino's death sentence was commuted by President Marcos in May 1980.|$|E

60|$|Samuel Hopkins, {{who lived}} under Fisher's roof, last saw Fisher on June 17, 1826 (June 16 may be meant), in the evening. Some other people, {{including}} one Lawrence, {{were in the}} house, they left shortly after Fisher went <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> and later remarked on the strangeness of his not returning. Nathaniel Cole gave evidence to the same effect. Fisher, in short, strolled out on June 17 (16?), 1826, and was seen no more in the body.|$|R
