5|$|Hartmann patiently {{waited for}} the right moment to escape, then, using the {{distraction}} of the Stukas attack, he attacked the single guard. Hartmann jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the truck and ran into a large field of giant sunflowers. Evading the pursuing soldiers, Hartmann hid and waited for nightfall. In the dark, Hartmann followed a Soviet patrol heading west to the front. As he approached the German position, he was challenged by a sentry who fired a shot which passed through his trousers.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the early 2000s, the band {{continued}} to tour and shuffle through members. In late 2001, while touring in Milton, Pennsylvania with the band Submerge, they convinced two of its members—bassist Matthew Taylor and drummer Tony Thaxton—to join Motion City. Thaxton initially took about a year to convince to join the band. Jesse Johnson, a friend and co-worker of Cain's, joined the band as keyboardist just three weeks before the band recorded their first album. Johnson had never played the keyboard before but Cain taught him the parts that had already been written. After their first attempt at self-recording an album failed, the band culled together $6,000 to record with producer Ed Rose, best known for his work with the Get Up Kids. They recorded much of their debut album in ten days, which was stressful, and Rose would frustrate the band with insults in order to record better. Initial copies of the band's debut, I Am the Movie, were hand-packaged inside floppy disks, which were sold <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of their tour van for a year.|$|E
50|$|Camp Records was {{a record}} label based <b>out</b> <b>of</b> California in <b>the</b> 1960s that {{specialized}} in producing anonymous gay-themed novelty records and singles, mostly sold <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> beefcake magazines.|$|R

5|$|Fässler {{extended}} his lead to 13 seconds when Jani was delayed by a Porsche LMGTE car at Brooklands corner. Jani {{was able to}} reduce the time deficit to ten seconds before Fässler made a pit stop for new tyres. Jani recorded the fastest lap of the race in response, at one minute and 30.303 seconds. Jani made his pit stop for new tyres with over a minute lead with Fässler retaking the first position. After five minutes Jani's front-right tyre was punctured, necessitating an unscheduled pit stop to change the wheel, and for extra fuel. Fässler made his final scheduled pit stop for fuel to {{reach the end of}} the race and remained in the lead with a seven-second lead over Jani. Bachler suffered a front-right suspension issue on his car. Smoke bellowed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of Richie Stanaway's Aston Martin heading into Copse corner and he retired from the event. Joël Camathias took over the LMGTE Am lead but slowed with a car problem and returned slowly to the pit lane, allowing the No. 83 AF Corse into first place. Pantanici lost sixth place in LMP2 to Merhi at the loop and Rast moved into third place in category at Copse corner. The final period of pit stops began when Bruni made a stop, followed by Filipe Albuquerque who gained the LMP2 lead from co-driver Senna earlier in the race. Jani and Kobayashi both stopped for fuel which enabled the pair to reach the end of the event.|$|E
25|$|Mood-neutral {{delusion}}: A delusion {{that does}} not relate to the sufferer's emotional state; for example, a belief that an extra limb is growing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of one's head is neutral to either depression or mania.|$|E
25|$|Several concept {{cars have}} {{featured}} suicide doors, {{such as the}} Lincoln C, a hatchback with no B-pillar and rear suicide doors, or the Carbon Motors Corporation E7, a police car with rear suicide doors designed to aid officers getting handcuffed passengers in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat. The Kia Naimo, an electric concept car, also has rear suicide doors.|$|E
50|$|Clancy {{had become}} a Christian within the {{previous}} three months. The surgeon who operated on the mother stated that rather than the fetus' hand clutching on to his finger, he was simply pushing the fetus' arm that had suddenly jolted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> womb <b>back</b> into <b>the</b> womb in order to finish the surgery.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> sounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{characters}} {{are taken from}} the 1985 film Red Sonja. Most notably the [...] "EEY-ECH!" [...] sound that plays when the player attempts to decapitate an opponent.

50|$|His intimidating {{presence}} {{became a}} telling feature of his play. Respected for his ferocious attitude on the pitch, he was dubbed 'the Wild Bull <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pampas' by the Australian press, {{in reference to}} the Argentine boxer Luis Ángel Firpo, who had knocked World Heavyweight Boxing Champion Jack Dempsey <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>back</b> in 1923.|$|R
25|$|The final half of {{the game}} saw two more touchdowns before Taylor Potts {{replaced}} Graham Harrell in the quarterback position. Potts passed for three touchdowns—two to Detron Lewis and one to Lyle Leong. Additionally, the Red Raiders scored on a safety when a fumble by the Demons bounced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> {{of the end zone}} in the fourth quarter. All Tech touchdowns in the game were followed by point after conversions by Alex Trlica.|$|E
25|$|During the reward, {{all three}} members of Alpha {{admitted}} that they had expected to lose the task. Their advert, which involved parents discussing {{the use of the}} tissues for their ill child, was later discussed on You're Hired as being humorously flawed on a number of points – the child being sent to school when she was ill; one parent pinching the child's nose and thus likely to spread their illness; the mother appearing dazed; and the product appearing to have been chucked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the car and into a flower bed.|$|E
25|$|Biba's {{early years}} were rather humble, {{with many of}} the outfits being cheap and {{available}} to the public by mail order. Biba’s postal boutique had its first significant success in May 1964 when it offered a pink gingham dress with a hole cut <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the neck with a matching triangular kerchief to readers of the Daily Mirror. The dress had celebrity appeal, as a similar dress had been worn by Brigitte Bardot. By the morning after the dress was advertised in the Daily Mirror, over 4,000 orders had been received. Ultimately, some 17,000 outfits were sold.|$|E

50|$|After {{receiving}} a bursary from the University for postgraduate studies, {{he decided to}} travel to Amsterdam in 1938 and enrol at <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Amsterdam. He was to receive his PhD degree on 10 May 1940, but two weeks before took <b>the</b> last boat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Netherlands <b>back</b> to South Africa as WWII swept over Europe and <b>the</b> German invasion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands seemed imminent.|$|R

25|$|The eye is {{connected}} to the visual cortex by the optic nerve coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the eye. The two optic nerves come together behind the eyes at the optic chiasm, where about half of the fibers from each eye cross over to the opposite side and join fibers from the other eye representing the corresponding visual field, the combined nerve fibers from both eyes forming the optic tract. This ultimately forms the physiological basis of binocular vision. The tracts project to a relay station in the midbrain called the lateral geniculate nucleus, part of the thalamus, and then to the visual cortex along a collection of nerve fibers called the optic radiation.|$|E
25|$|The fullback {{position}} {{has always been}} a purely defensive role, with the aim of stopping the full-forward from getting the ball and scoring. But, in recent times, where the ability to move the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and down the field quickly has become a more important tactic, the fullback often starts a chain of passes up the ground. The defensive aspect of the position remains important, with the ability to accelerate and change direction quickly. Spoiling the ball is also of utmost importance. The fullback often kicks the ball back into play after a point has been scored, although some teams prefer a midfielder or the small back pockets for this role, freeing the (typically taller) fullback player to attempt to mark the kick in.|$|E
25|$|Bad Religion slowly {{reformed}} in 1986 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Back</b> to the Known line-up when Graffin called Bentley {{and asked}} him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back. This lineup recorded the band's third album, Suffer, which was released in 1988. Although the album did not chart on the Billboard 200, it received some positive reviews, and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as Trust, Maximum Rocknroll and Flipside.|$|E

2500|$|When Ashoka died in 232 BC, Mauryan {{hold on the}} Indus began {{weakening}} as Brahminism {{was attempting}} to retake control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ganges heartland though the Shunga revolt. As such, the Mauryans began retreating <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indus <b>back</b> east towards Pataliputra (Patna) to protect the imperial capital. This left most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indus Valley unguarded and most importantly left the Khyber Pass open to invasion. In 230 BC, Euthydemus overthrew Diodotus to establish himself as king. The Greco-Bactrians were allied with the Mauryans and had kept close relations with Ashoka.|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} hastily built wooden {{factories}} constructed by Ybor and Haya, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first structures in Ybor City were 50 small houses (‘’casitas’’) for prospective employees. These narrow shotgun-style homes (so called because a shot fired {{through the front}} door would theoretically exit harmlessly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aligned <b>back</b> door) were small wooden structures, but they were well-built and relatively comfortable. Ybor offered them for sale at a price just above his cost to build them (initially $400), payable in small deductions from the workers’ salary in his cigar factory.|$|R
25|$|WVU {{entered the}} game against Pitt as 28 point {{favorites}} {{to win the}} 100th Backyard Brawl and earn a berth in the BCS championship game. The Mountaineers, however, could never get their high-powered offense going against the Panthers and were hurt by fumbles, missed field goals, and ineffective performances by Steve Slaton and Pat White, the latter of whom missed {{part of the game}} with a thumb injury. Pittsburgh, starting their backup QB Pat Bostick, was equally ineffective at moving the ball outside of the play of LeSean McCoy. Trailing by one possession late in the fourth quarter, West Virginia twice had the ball in Pitt territory, with both drives ending in Pat White being stopped on downs. The final Pitt possession saw the Panthers run the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the end zone for a safety as the clock expired, ending WVU's National Championship hopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{season began}} with two {{consecutive}} road losses. Despite taking a 31-24 lead {{late in the}} fourth quarter against the Rams, a defensive breakdown allowed a touchdown by the Rams in the final minute, and the Rams prevailed in overtime 34-31. The following week, the Seahawks traveled to Green Bay to face the Packers, and lost 27-17, their first loss by double digits in 59 regular season games (67 games including the postseason). However, the team would right the ship with two straight wins against the hapless Chicago Bears and the Detroit Lions on Monday Night - the latter win ending controversially when a last-second play by Lions received Calvin Johnson was fumbled at the 1-yard line and linebacker KJ Wright batted the ball <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the end zone for a safety. Although this could have been ruled a penalty against the Seahawks which would have given possession to the Lions at the 1/2-yard line, no penalty was called.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} drive {{of the second}} half, New England had a 4th-and-2 and chose to punt. However, after the play had been run, Patriots' head coach Bill Belichick {{challenged}} that New York had too many players {{on the field and}} replay confirmed that was the case as Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn was unable to get to the sidelines as the ball was being snapped. Therefore, referee Mike Carey reversed the play, and the Giants were penalized 5yards for having too many players on the field, giving the Patriots a first down. The Patriots then drove to the Giants' 25, but Strahan sacked Brady for a 6-yard loss on third down. Then on 4th-and-13, with the ball on the Giants' 31, Belichick decided against a long field goal attempt by Stephen Gostkowski and tried to pick up a first down instead. Brady's pass to Jabar Gaffney was incomplete as it went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the end zone and the Giants took over on downs.|$|E
