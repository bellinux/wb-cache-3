5|$|The main {{failure mode}} for die casting dies is wear or erosion. Other failure modes are heat {{checking}} and thermal fatigue. Heat checking is when surface cracks <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> die {{due to a}} large temperature change on every cycle. Thermal fatigue is when surface cracks <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> die due to {{a large number of}} cycles.|$|E
5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{may occur}} {{directly}} under the site of impact, or it may <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side opposite the impact (coup and contrecoup injury, respectively). When a moving object impacts the stationary head, coup injuries are typical, while contrecoup injuries are usually produced when the moving head strikes a stationary object.|$|E

5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins of the wound, whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trunk of the body.|$|E
5|$|In North America, extra-tropical storm surges may <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pacific and Alaska coasts, {{and north}} of 31°N on the Atlantic Coast. Extra-tropical storm surges may be {{possible}} for the Gulf coast mostly during the wintertime, when extra-tropical cyclones affect the coast, {{such as in the}} 1993 Storm of the Century.|$|E
5|$|Rail {{operators}} in Victoria {{can also be}} the subject of no blame investigations conducted by the Chief Investigator, Transport Safety or the Australian Transport Safety Bureau(ATSB). The Chief Investigator is charged by the Transport Integration Act with conducting investigations into rail safety matters including incidents and trends. ATSB, on the other hand, claims jurisdiction over the same matters where they <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Designated Interstate Rail Network.|$|E

5|$|The folly and {{absurdity of}} the Queen in {{allowing}} this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers themselves do not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> occasion. The idea... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower {{us in the}} eyes of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the dark patches, which mainly <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> leading {{hemisphere}} and inside craters, is not known. Some scientists hypothesized that they are of cryovolcanic origin (analogs of lunar maria), while others think that the impacts excavated dark material buried beneath the pure ice (crust). In the latter case Oberon {{should be at least}} partially differentiated, with the ice crust lying atop the non-differentiated interior.|$|E
5|$|The varied age and canopy {{structure}} of woodland encourages a high diversity of butterflies, nationally scarce species including the white-letter hairstreak (Strymonidia walbum) and {{high brown fritillary}} (Argynnis edippe), while species such as the chalkhill blue (Lysandra coridon) and brown argus (Aricia agestis) <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> limestone grassland. Greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and lesser horseshoes (Rhinolophus hipposideros) regularly use sites in the Gorge as hibernacular roosts. The site also supports birds of prey and a few red deer.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other authors}} of the genre, Tolkien never favoured signing his works. Owing to his popularity, handsigned copies of his letters or of the first editions of his {{individual}} writings have however achieved high values at auctions, and forged autographs may <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market. In particular, the signed first hardback edition of The Hobbit from 1937 has reportedly been offered for $85,000. Collectibles also include non-fiction books with hand-written annotations from Tolkien's private library.|$|E
5|$|Westhay Moor {{supports}} a nationally outstanding community of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates. At least 28 nationally notable invertebrate species also <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moor. The meadows, ditches, abandoned peat workings and hedgerows provide suitable breeding habitats for a diverse and nationally important breeding bird community.|$|E
5|$|A journey between Arnos Grove and Southgate {{typically}} takes {{slightly more}} than four minutes. Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3-9 minutes between 07:07 and 01:07 eastbound, and every 2-6 minutes between 05:19 and 00:06 westbound. When operational problems <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line, Arnos Grove station may act as a temporary terminus of a reduced service – either a shuttle service between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London. The station has a set of seven sidings to its south for stabling trains.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 202 {{different}} birds {{have been recorded}} on the island. Eighteen species of land birds breed {{on the island and}} there are many more migratory species that <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island and its adjacent islets, many tame enough that it is possible for humans to get quite close. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Endemic Bird Area, and the Permanent Park Preserve as an Important Bird Area, because it supports the entire population of Lord Howe woodhens, most of the breeding population of providence petrels, over 1% of the world population of another five seabird species, and the whole populations of three endemic subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
5|$|After the {{plaintiff}} rests, {{the defense lawyer}} calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys {{is to try to}} prove sexual intercourse did not <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know exactly how much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wing}} develops, the dorsal and ventral integumental layers become closely apposed {{over most of}} their area forming the wing membrane. The {{remaining}} areas form channels, the future veins, in which the nerves and tracheae may occur. The cuticle surrounding the veins becomes thickened and more heavily sclerotized to provide strength and rigidity to the wing. Two types of hair may <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wings: microtrichia, which are small and irregularly scattered, and macrotrichia, which are larger, socketed, and may be restricted to veins. The scales of Lepidoptera and Trichoptera are highly modified macrotrichia.|$|E
5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally <b>occur</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
