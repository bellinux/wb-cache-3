5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy {{of physics}} {{is the study}} of the fundamental, {{philosophical}} questions underlying modern physics, the study of matter and energy and how they interact. The main questions concern the nature of space and time, atoms and atomism. Also included are the predictions of cosmology, the interpretation of quantum mechanics, the foundations of statistical mechanics, causality, determinism, and the nature of physical laws. Classically, several <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> were studied as part of metaphysics (for example, those about causality, determinism, and space and time).|$|E
5|$|The {{aftermath}} of the First World War left many issues to be settled, including the exact position of national boundaries and which country particular regions would join. Most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> were handled by the victorious Allied powers in bodies such as the Allied Supreme Council. The Allies tended to refer only particularly difficult matters to the League. This meant that, during the early interwar period, the League played little part in resolving the turmoil resulting from the war. The questions the League considered {{in its early years}} included those designated by the Paris Peace treaties.|$|E

5|$|The exam {{is offered}} {{every year in}} May. Students are not {{expected}} to memorize any formulas; rather, a list of common statistical formulas related to descriptive statistics, probability, and inferential statistics is provided. Moreover, tables for the normal, Student's t and chi-squared distributions are given as well. Students are also expected to use graphing calculators with statistical capabilities. The exam is three hours long with ninety minutes allotted to complete each of its two sections: multiple choice and free-response. The multiple choice portion of the exam consists of forty questions with five possible answers each. The free response section contains six open-ended questions that are often long and divided into multiple parts. The first five <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> may require twelve minutes each to answer and normally relate to one topic or category. The sixth question consists of a broad-ranging investigative task and may require approximately twenty-five minutes to answer.|$|E

Taken all together, the six pairs of questions and responses provide a profile of an individual's sexual orientation. However, results can be further simplified into four summaries that look specifically at responses that correspond to either homosexuality, heterosexuality, bisexuality or asexuality.|$|E
25|$|That the Canberra was {{a foreign}} {{aircraft}} meant that its superiority {{in terms of}} performance did not guarantee political support, {{in spite of the}} urgent need, particularly in light of there being several rival indigenous aircraft designs; there were also doubts about production availability with English Electric being able to mesh with USAF demands, as well as questions over continued spares support. In March 1951, many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> were answered when, in part due to its production lines being sustained at full capacity to meet orders from the Royal Air Force in addition to those emerging from other export customers, English Electric entered into discussions with Glenn L. Martin Company, under which it was proposed that Martin would receive a license to domestically build the Canberra in the United States. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Americanization of the Canberra program proved effective at dismissing many of the political opponents that had opposed the project.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just our bike cars, serve our entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|E
40|$|This paper pursues a thorough-going instrumentalist, or meansends, {{approach}} {{to the theory of}} inductive inference.

For each <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> two <b>questions</b> arise: (1) What is the structure of inductive problems in which these aims are feasible ?

500|$|Zacharias {{states that}} a {{coherent}} worldview {{must be able}} to satisfactorily answer four questions: that of origin, meaning of life, morality and destiny. He says that while every major religion makes exclusive claims about truth, the Christian faith is unique in its ability to answer all four <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions.</b> He routinely speaks on the coherence of the Christian worldview, saying that Christianity is capable of withstanding the toughest philosophical attacks. Zacharias believes that the apologist must argue from three levels: the theoretical, to line up the logic of the argument; the arts, to illustrate; and [...] "kitchen table talk", to conclude and apply. [...] Zacharias' style of apologetic focuses predominantly on Christianity's answers to life's great existential questions, with defense of God.|$|E
500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is examined using {{a set of}} procedures known as neuropsychological assessment. [...] There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise. [...] The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli. [...] If so, the next {{question is whether the}} patient can respond in a meaningful way to questions and commands. [...] If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time.

In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing pro-integration literature {{on behalf of a}} number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to desegregation, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge). Scull refused to answer some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> and the committee went to court to force him to answer. A state circuit court ruled against Scull and ordered him to answer the questions. He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court.|$|E
