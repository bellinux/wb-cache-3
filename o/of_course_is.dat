5|$|P. canariensis, the Canary Islands {{chiffchaff}} is a non-migratory species formerly occurring on {{the major}} Canary Islands, which is differentiated from P. collybita by morphology, vocalisations and genetic characteristics, and, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>is</b> not sympatric with any other chiffchaffs. The nominate western subspecies P. c. canariensis of El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera, Tenerife, and Gran Canaria is smaller than common chiffchaff, and has shorter, rounder wings. It is olive-brown above and has a buff breast and flanks; it has a rich deep chip-cheep-cheep-chip-chip-cheep song, and a call similar to the nominate race. The eastern P. c. exsul of Lanzarote and possibly Fuerteventura is paler above and less rufous below than its western relative, and had a harsher call; {{it might have been}} a distinct species, but it became extinct in 1986 at latest, probably much earlier. The reasons for its extinction are unclear, but it appears always to have been scarce and localised, occurring only in the Haria Valley of Lanzarote.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{two kinds}} of course in this family of bonds is called a {{stretching}} course, and this typically comprises nothing but stretchers at the face from quoin to quoin. The other kind <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> the heading course, and this usually consists of headers, with two queen closers—one by the quoin header at either end—to generate the bond.|$|E
25|$|These {{results also}} can be {{obtained}} directly by two time differentiations of rB (t). Agreement of the two approaches demonstrates that one could start from the general expression for fictitious acceleration above and derive the trajectories shown here. However, working from the acceleration to the trajectory {{is more complicated than}} the reverse procedure used here, which, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>is</b> made possible in this example by knowing the answer in advance.|$|E

Among the figures studied were Al-Ghazali, Ibn 'Arabi, Averroës (Ibn Rushd), Ibn Masarra, and Ibn Hazm, as well as the rabbi Maimonides (all from Al-Andalus except al-Ghazali). Asín did comparative work vis-à-vis Islam respecting Ramon Lull, Thomas Aquinas, Dante Alighieri, Teresa of Avila, John of the Cross, and Blaise Pascal.|$|E
25|$|It {{is amazing}} {{to think that}} this is the only country in Europe where this form of sport is not permitted...

There would be no better time than now to introduce this form of racing to the roads, what with the decreased amount of motor traffic and the important part that the cycle is playing in wartime transport.|$|E
25|$|From a calculational {{point of}} view, the {{drawback}} <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> {{that one must}} first calculate the Fourier transforms of the boundary conditions, then assemble the solution from these, and then calculate an inverse Fourier transform. Closed form formulas are rare, except when there is some geometric symmetry that can be exploited, and the numerical calculations are difficult because of the oscillatory nature of the integrals, which makes convergence slow and hard to estimate. For practical calculations, other methods are often used.|$|E

25|$|To the {{objection}} {{that the new}} calendar has created problems by adjusting only the fixed calendar, while leaving all of the commemorations in the moveable cycle on the original Julian calendar, the obvious answer, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>is</b> that the 1923 Synod, which adopted the new calendar, did in fact change the moveable calendar as well, and that calendar problems introduced {{as a result of}} the adoption of the (fixed) new calendar alone, would not have existed had the corrections to the moveable calendar also been implemented.|$|E
25|$|Every {{partially}} {{ordered set}} {{can be viewed as}} a category (with a single morphism from x to y if and only if x ≤ y). A pair of adjoint functors between two {{partially ordered set}}s is called a Galois connection (or, if it is contravariant, an antitone Galois connection). See that article for a number of examples: the case of Galois theory <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> a leading one. Any Galois connection gives rise to closure operators and to inverse order-preserving bijections between the corresponding closed elements.|$|E

25|$|When light travels from {{a medium}} {{with a higher}} {{refractive}} index to one with a lower refractive index, Snell's law seems to require in some cases (whenever the angle of incidence is large enough) that the sine of the angle of refraction be greater than one. This <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> impossible, and the light in such cases is completely reflected by the boundary, a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. The largest possible angle of incidence which still results in a refracted ray is called the critical angle; {{in this case the}} refracted ray travels along the boundary between the two media.|$|E
25|$|From {{beyond the}} boundary, it is {{difficult}} to gauge Snow's pace as Lindsay Hassett conceded. He appears to bowl his bumper appreciably faster than most of his fuller-length deliveries, but I do not believe even his faster bumper knocks {{at the door of the}} pace of bowlers I have named. His top pace, I consider, lies somewhere between that of Statham and Trueman...Snow's loping, almost lazy run, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>is</b> sinisterly deceptive. It is in that last stride, or last two strides, when that long, straight powerful arm gathers its impetus and either whips or coasts through, that the potential is born.|$|E
25|$|A very {{effective}} measure of both protection {{to both the}} staff and the patient <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>is</b> applying less radiation. There is always a trade-off between radiation dose and image quality. A higher x-ray dose leads to a clearer picture. Modern software technology can improve image quality during post-processing, such that the same image quality is reached with a lower dose. Image quality thereby is described by contrast, noise, resolution and artifacts. In general, the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable) should be followed. Dose should be as low as possible, but image quality can only be reduced to the level that the diagnostic benefit of the examination is still higher than the potential harm to the patient.|$|E
