5|$|Following the December 1983 {{release of}} the first album in the Now That's What I Call Music series, {{compilation}} albums featuring various artists became very popular in the UK during {{the mid to late}} 1980s; this is reflected in the albums that were Christmas number one during this time.

The annual lighting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> lights on the Salling department store in Søndergade has also become an attraction in recent times, packing the pedestrianised city centre with thousands of revellers.

5|$|Roman Catholic {{and more}} {{traditional}} Protestant clergy wear green vestments at liturgical celebrations during Ordinary Time.

Romans used green holly and evergreen as decorations for their winter solstice celebration called Saturnalia, which eventually evolved into a Christmas celebration. In Ireland and Scotland especially, green is used to represent Catholics, while orange is used to represent Protestantism. This is shown on the national flag of Ireland.|$|E

More {{recordings of the}} Magnificat became available, for instance directed by Kurt Redel, Leonard Bernstein, Karl Richter and Karl Ristenpart. The {{second half of the}} 1960s saw the first recordings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Christmas</b> version of the Magnificat BWV 243a including the laudes, and new recordings of the D major version by von Karajan, Karl Münchinger and Daniel Barenboim.|$|E
