5|$|Later {{deep water}} depositional {{sequences}} formed the <b>overlying</b> Brallier Formation and Harrell Formation.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the <b>overlying</b> rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle {{onto the surface of}} the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the <b>overlying</b> rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E
5|$|The blood supply, {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage of the parathyroid glands {{correspond to}} the thyroid <b>overlying</b> gland.|$|E
50|$|They <b>overlie</b> Precambrian {{conglomerates}} and are <b>overlain</b> by the Calcaires de Laize.|$|R
50|$|In the Williston Basin it is <b>overlain</b> by the Winnipeg Formation in {{the center}} and by the Red River Formation near the margins. In the central and {{southern}} Black Hills it is <b>overlain</b> by the Mississippian Englewood Formation. In Alberta and Saskatchewan it is <b>overlain</b> by the Devonian Elk Point Group.|$|R
50|$|The {{underlying}} bedrock {{is composed}} of Cretaceous shales, and (below that) sandstone, which <b>overlie</b> deeper deposits of Devonian limestone, which in turn <b>overlie</b> Precambrian granite.|$|R
5|$|The rate of {{cementation}} of the <b>overlying</b> substrate {{relative to}} the rate of decomposition of the organism determines whether the top or bottom surface of an organism is preserved. Most disc-shaped fossils decomposed before the <b>overlying</b> sediment was cemented, whereupon ash or sand slumped in to fill the void, leaving a cast of the organism's underside.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Precambrian {{a shallow}} inland sea covered {{much of the}} Lake Superior region and formed the Animikie Group, layers of {{sedimentary}} rocks <b>overlying</b> 2700-million-year-old Archean rocks. The Rove Formation is {{the youngest of the}} many Animikie layers.|$|E
5|$|In {{petroleum}} geology, {{these black}} shales {{are an important}} source rock that filled conventional petroleum reservoirs in <b>overlying</b> formations, are an unconventional shale gas reservoir, and are an impermeable seal that traps underlying conventional natural gas reservoirs.|$|E
30|$|The Hoiho Group is <b>overlain</b> by the Pakaha Group, {{which is}} {{formed by the}} {{deposition}} of fine-grained marine siliciclastics in the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene. Transgressive sandstones of the Kawau Formation makes up {{the base of the}} Pakaha Group, which is <b>overlain</b> by the Wickliffe Formation (Fig.  2). Sandstones of the Taratu Formation in turn <b>overlie</b> the Kawau sandstones (Schiøler et al. 2009).|$|R
50|$|The Lompico Sandstone is a {{sedimentary}} rock formation of lower to middle Miocene age. It overlies the Salinian basement rocks of Santa Cruz County, California. It interfingers with and is <b>overlain</b> by the Miocene Monterey Formation. These are in turn <b>overlain</b> {{by the mid}} to upper Miocene Santa Margarita Sandstone which is in turn <b>overlain</b> by the upper Miocene Santa Cruz Mudstone.|$|R
50|$|The Eastend Formation is {{conformably}} <b>overlain</b> by the Whitemud Formation {{and gradually}} overlies the Bearpaw Formation. In the Frenchman River valley, the Eastend Formation is erosionally <b>overlain</b> by the Frenchman Formation.|$|R
5|$|Most {{exploitation}} of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after {{which one can}} burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of surface mining involve open pit mining and strip mining. These procedures remove most of the <b>overlying</b> material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. Underground mining of oil shale, which removes less of the <b>overlying</b> material, employs the room-and-pillar method.|$|E
5|$|Subglacial mounds (SUGM) of the Mount Edziza {{volcanic}} complex are {{an unusual}} type of subglacial volcano formed when subglacial eruptions began melting <b>overlying</b> glacial ice {{at a time}} when this region was covered by glacial ice during the Pleistocene and early Holocene periods. These subglacial eruptions were not hot enough to melt a vertical pipe right through the <b>overlying</b> glacial ice, instead forming mounds of hydrated volcanic rock made up of volcanic fragments called hyaloclastite and lava that solidified into pillow-shaped masses called pillow lava deep beneath the glacial ice field. Once the glaciers had retreated, the subglacial volcanoes would be revealed, with a unique shape {{as a result of their}} confinement within glacial ice.|$|E
5|$|The geology of {{the area}} {{consists}} mainly of brickearth <b>overlying</b> chalk. Tertiary sands overlain by London clay form St. Thomas's Hill and St. Stephen's Hill about a mile northwest of the city centre.|$|E
50|$|The Battle Formation unconformably overlies the Whitemud Formation. It is <b>overlain</b> by the Scollard Formation and {{the contact}} is erosional {{in some areas}} where basal Scollard paleochannels have cut into or eroded through the Battle. In other areas the contact may be conformable. In the {{southern}} Alberta plains it is <b>overlain,</b> apparently conformably, by the Willow Creek Formation, and in Saskatchewan it is <b>overlain</b> by the Frenchman Formation.|$|R
50|$|The Slave Point Formation is unconformably <b>overlain</b> by the Beaverhill Lake Group or Waterways Formation in {{northern}} Alberta {{and by the}} Otter Park Member or Muskwa Member of the Horn River Formation in north-eastern British Columbia. It conformably overlays the Fort Vermilion Formation (or is unconformably <b>overlain</b> by the Watt Mountain Formation) {{in northern}} Alberta and it is conformably <b>overlain</b> by the Sulphur Point Formation or Presqu'ile Formation in north-eastern British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|The Liard Formation is {{conformably}} <b>overlain</b> by the Garbutt Formation and Buckinghorse Formation in the Liard River area, and is disconformably <b>overlain</b> by the Charlie Lake Formation {{toward the}} south. It overlays the Toad Formation between Pine River and Williston lake.|$|R
5|$|Blackdown and Sampford Commons have {{extensive}} surviving {{examples of the}} heathland, carr woodland and marshy grassland habitats that have developed on the acidic soils <b>overlying</b> the Greensand and Keuper Marls of the Blackdown Hills. The heathland supports a typical invertebrate fauna, including {{a wide variety of}} butterfly species, and with spiders notably abundant. The site is regionally important for birds which favour heathland habitats.|$|E
5|$|Favoured {{soils are}} deep grey sandy loams or {{shallower}} sand <b>overlying</b> claypan. Associated vegetation is typically scrubland or shrubland, although moisture-loving trees such as B.littoralis (Swamp Banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (Moonah) {{may also be}} present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low open woodland.|$|E
5|$|Further east, the {{homogeneous}} Cardiff divides {{into the}} Bridgewater, Solsville, and Pecksport shale members, from base to top. The Bridgewater is a fissile dark silty shale with relatively rare fossils. A thin concretionary zone lies above, then the Solsville grades from a gray calcareous shale, to sandy siltstones and fine sandstones at the top, with the gray shale of the Pecksport shale and siltsone <b>overlying</b> it.|$|E
50|$|Viewpoints is a {{technique}} of composition {{that acts as a}} medium for thinking about and acting upon movement, gesture and creative space. Originally developed in the 1970s by choreographer Mary <b>Overlie</b> as a method of movement improvisation, The Viewpoints theory was adapted for stage acting by directors Anne Bogart and Tina Landau.Bogart and <b>Overlie</b> were on the faculty of ETW at NYU in the late 1970s and early 1980s during which time Bogart was influenced by <b>Overlie's</b> innovations. <b>Overlie's</b> Six Viewpoints (space, story, time, emotion, movement, and shape) are considered to be a logical way to examine, analyze and create dances, while Bogart's Viewpoints are considered practical in creating staging with actors.|$|R
50|$|There are {{important}} exposures of rocks {{of the lower}} and middle Jurassic Periods. The lowest part of the exposure consists of Cotswold Sand Formation which is <b>overlain</b> by the 'Cephalopod bed'. The 'Cephalopod bed' exposure is relatively thick and contains valuable fossil molluscs ammonites. The 'Cephalopod bed' is <b>overlain</b> by the 'scissum' beds (Leckhampton Limestone) of the Middle Jurassic, Aalenian Stage. The upper exposure consists of lower Inferior Oolite (Fiddler’s Elbow Limestone and Frocester Hill Oolite). This is <b>overlain</b> by Upper 'Trigonia' Grit.|$|R
50|$|The Beaverhill Lake Group is {{conformably}} underlain by {{the formations of}} the Elk Point Group. In {{most areas}} it is conformably <b>overlain</b> by the formations of the Woodbend Group, and in northwestern Alberta and northeastern British Columbia it is disconformably <b>overlain</b> by the Muskwa Formation.|$|R
5|$|In current practice, the Marcellus Formation(abbr. Dm or Dms) is {{classified}} as the basal unit of the Hamilton Group(Dh), lying beneath the Mahantango Formation(Dmh) member of this group in Pennsylvania and Maryland. In New York, the Mahantango, also of Middle Devonian age, is further divided. There the Marcellus is separated from the <b>overlying</b> Skaneateles Formation, a more clastic and fossiliferous dark shale, by the thin Stafford or Mottville Limestone bed.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's core is generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which {{is higher than the}} core temperature of the Sun, but is less efficient than the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The <b>overlying</b> atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an <b>overlying</b> convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{vertical}} joint planes controlled {{where and how}} fast erosion took place. Most of these long, linear and very deep cracks trend northeast or northwest and form parallel, often regularly spaced sets. They were created by uplift-associated pressure release and by the unloading of <b>overlying</b> rock via erosion.|$|E
50|$|The New Oxford Formation is <b>overlain</b> by the Gettysburg Formation in Frederick County, Maryland and in Adams, Cumberland, Lancaster, and York Counties in Pennsylvania. In {{all other}} areas to the {{northeast}} in Pennsylvania the New Oxford Formation is <b>overlain</b> by the Hammer Creek Formation.|$|R
50|$|The Baldonnel Formation is {{the middle}} member of the Schooler Creek Group. It is {{conformably}} <b>overlain</b> by the Pardonet Formation limestone and siltstone or unconformably <b>overlain</b> by the Fernie Formation shale. North of the Williston Lake it overlies the dolomite beds of the Charlie Lake Formation.|$|R
50|$|The geology of Suffolk {{in eastern}} England largely {{consists}} of a rolling chalk plain <b>overlain</b> in the east by Neogene clays, sands and gravels and isolated areas of Palaeocene sands. A variety of superficial deposits originating {{in the last couple}} of million years <b>overlie</b> this 'solid geology'.|$|R
5|$|The Marcellus {{is easily}} eroded, {{and is also}} found {{underlying}} low areas between some Appalachian ridges, forming linear valleys of moderate relief. These bedrock surfaces are typically covered with colluvium from erosion of stratigraphically higher and more erosion-resistant strata that form the surrounding higher ground. The soils formed from the Marcellus and the <b>overlying</b> Hamilton shales are deep, free of stones, and well suited for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The Peak District {{is formed}} almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Carboniferous period. They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, the <b>overlying</b> Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins of the area and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.|$|E
5|$|The {{burial of}} algae and {{bacteria}} below the mud {{of the sea}} floor during this time resulted {{in the formation of}} North Sea oil and natural gas, much of it trapped in <b>overlying</b> sandstone by deposits formed as the seas fell to form the swamps and salty lakes and lagoons that were home to dinosaurs.|$|E
5000|$|The Colorado Group is <b>overlain</b> by the Montana Group and {{underlain}} by the Dakota Group in the Williston Basin of {{the western}} Great Plains. It is unconformably <b>overlain</b> by the Lea Park Formation shale and unconformably underlain by the Blairmore, Mannville or Swan River Group in Western Canada.|$|R
50|$|The Kilimli is unconformably <b>overlain</b> by {{the sandy}} {{limestone}} of the Cemaller Formation. The unconformity lasts at least 6.5 Ma and the Zonguldak basin experiences continuous deposition from the Turonian - Campanian. The Cemaller Fm. is <b>overlain</b> by the siltstone and limestone of the Baþköy formation. The Dinlence Formation overlies the Cemaller {{and consists of}} andesites and andesitic tuffites. It {{is possible that the}} Dinlence is the Yemislicay Formation since it too contains andesites and andesitic tuffites. The Dinlence is <b>overlain</b> by the marls, and limestones of the Alapý Formation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overlie</b> {{continued}} {{as a member}} of the Natural History of the American Dancer with Carmen Beauchat, Cynthia Hedstrom, Judy Padow, Rachel Lew and Suzanne Harris from 1970 to 1975. The company performed at The Whitney Museum, 112 Greene St. Gallery, Ornette Coleman’s Artist’s House, Paula Cooper Gallery, Bennington College, Oberlin College and other venues.  In 1972, <b>Overlie</b> began experimenting with the early explorations of Steve Paxton, founder of Contact Improvisation. From 1975-1979, <b>Overlie</b> danced with the Judy Padow Dance Company before she started her own company and work as a soloist.|$|R
