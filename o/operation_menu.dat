5|$|By {{the last}} day of Operation Freedom Deal (15 August 1973), 250,000 tons of bombs had been dropped on the Khmer Republic, 82,000 tons of which had been {{released}} in the last 45 days of the operation. Since the inception of <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu</b> in 1969, the U.S. Air Force had dropped 539,129 tons of ordnance on Cambodia/Khmer Republic.|$|E
5|$|Operation Freedom Deal {{followed}} <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu.</b> Under Freedom Deal, from 19 May 1970 to 15 August 1973, U.S. {{bombing of}} Cambodia extended {{over the entire}} eastern one-half {{of the country and}} was especially intense in the heavily populated southeastern one-quarter of the country, including a wide ring surrounding the largest city of Phnom Penh. In large areas, according to maps of U.S. bombing sites, it appears that nearly every square mile of land was hit by bombs.|$|E

5|$|Nixon {{approved}} a secret B-52 carpet bombing campaign of North Vietnamese (and, later, allied Khmer Rouge) positions in Cambodia in March 1969 (code-named <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu),</b> {{without the consent}} of Cambodian leader Norodom Sihanouk. In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, did not result in an agreement. In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1969, on secret {{orders from}} Nixon, the U.S. Air Force {{carried out the}} bombing of Base Area 353 (in the Fishhook region {{opposite}} South Vietnam's Tây Ninh Province) by 59 B-52 Stratofortress bombers. This strike {{was the first in}} a series of attacks on the sanctuaries that lasted until May 1970. During <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu,</b> the Air Force conducted 3,875 sorties and dropped more than 108,000 tons of ordnance on the eastern border areas. Only five high-ranking Congressional officials were informed of the bombing.|$|E

During the next 14 months this operation was followed by Lunch, Snack, Dinner, Dessert, and Supper as American bombers flew 3,630 sorties and expended 100,000 tons of ordnance on the Base Areas in {{what came to be}} called <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu.</b> During this time frame, the entire program was held as a closely guarded secret from Congress, the American people, and amazingly, from the Air Force itself.|$|E

25|$|Nixon had {{escalated}} U.S. {{involvement in}} Cambodia by authorizing the secret <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu</b> bombings {{and by the}} time of Sihanouk's ouster, the program had been in operation for 14 months. Lon Nol promptly ordered North Vietnamese personnel out of the country. North Vietnam responded with an invasion of the country launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge following negotiations with Nuon Chea. Nixon then authorized a series of incursions by U.S. and South Vietnamese ground forces that began on 30 April. With intelligence on communist Base Areas in eastern Cambodia gleaned from MACSOG, huge stockpiles of PAVN arms, ammunition, and supplies were overrun and captured. In May, Operation Freedom Deal, a continuous aerial campaign against the PAVN/Viet Cong and the Khmer Rouge was initiated. SOG recon teams in Cambodia now had all the air support that they needed.|$|E
500|$|The new {{commander}} of the US Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), General Creighton W. Abrams, recommended to President Richard M. Nixon shortly after his inauguration that the Cambodian Base Areas be attacked by aerial bombardment utilizing B-52 Stratofortress bombers. The president initially refused, but the breaking point came with the launching of PAVN's [...] "Mini-Tet" [...] Offensive of 1969 within South Vietnam. Nixon, angered at what he perceived {{as a violation of}} the [...] "agreement" [...] with Hanoi after the cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam, authorized the covert air campaign. The first mission of <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu</b> was dispatched on 18 March and {{by the time it was}} completed 14 months later more than 3,000 sorties had been flown and 108,000 tons of ordnance had been dropped on eastern Cambodia.|$|E
500|$|As {{relations}} with China worsened, Sihanouk pursued rapprochement with the US. He learned that Kennedy's widow, Jacqueline Kennedy, had {{expressed a desire}} to see Angkor Wat. Seeing {{this as an opportunity to}} restore {{relations with}} the US, Sihanouk invited her to visit Cambodia and personally hosted her visit in October 1967. Jacqueline Kennedy's visit paved the way for Sihanouk to meet with Chester Bowles, the US ambassador to India. To Bowles, Sihanouk expressed his willingness to restore bilateral relations with the US, hinted at the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia, and suggested he would turn a blind eye should US forces enter Cambodia to attack Viet Cong troops retreating into Cambodia from South Vietnam—a practice known as [...] "hot pursuit"—provided that Cambodians were unharmed. Kenton Clymer notes that this statement [...] "cannot reasonably be construed to mean that Sihanouk approved of the intensive, ongoing B-52 bombing raids" [...] the US launched in eastern Cambodia beginning in March 1969 as part of <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu,</b> adding: [...] "In any event, no one asked him.... Sihanouk was never asked to approve the B-52 bombings, and he never gave his approval." [...] The bombing forced the Viet Cong to flee from their jungle sanctuaries and seek refuge in populated towns and villages. As a result, Sihanouk became concerned that Cambodia might get drawn into fighting in the Vietnam War. In June 1969 he extended diplomatic recognition to the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam (PRGSV), hoping that he could get the Viet Cong troops under its charge to leave Cambodia should they win the war. At the same time, he also openly admitted the presence of Viet Cong troops in Cambodia for the first time, prompting the US to restore formal diplomatic relations with Cambodia three months later.|$|E

[...] By March 1967, 15,000 Skyspot sorties had been flown, and raids controlled by AN/MSQ-77s included those of <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu</b> from Bien Hoa Air Base, Operation Niagara, and Operation Arc Light.

2500|$|Nixon {{approved}} a secret B-52 carpet bombing campaign of North Vietnamese positions in Cambodia in March 1969 (code-named <b>Operation</b> <b>Menu),</b> {{without the consent}} of Cambodian leader Norodom Sihanouk. The bombing of Cambodia continued into the 1970s in support of the Cambodian government of Lon Nol—which was then battling a Khmer Rouge insurgency in the Cambodian Civil War—as part of Operation Freedom Deal. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 150,000 people were killed during the bombing of Cambodia between 1970 and 1973. The relationship between the massive carpet bombing of Cambodia by the United States and the growth of the Khmer Rouge, in terms of recruitment and popular support, has been a matter of interest to historians. Some historians have cited the U.S. intervention and bombing campaign as a significant factor leading to increased support of the Khmer Rouge among the Cambodian peasantry. However, Pol Pot biographer David Chandler argues that the bombing [...] "had the effect the Americans wanted – it broke the Communist encirclement of Phnom Penh". Chandler states that [...] "If you just made a very cold, calculating, military decision, the bombing of 1973 was in fact a sensible thing to do , because had it not happened, the Khmer Rouge would have taken Phnom Penh [...] and South Vietnam would have had a communist country on its flank." [...] Peter Rodman and Michael Lind claimed that the US intervention saved Cambodia from collapse in 1970 and 1973. Craig Etcheson agreed that it was [...] "untenable" [...] to assert that US intervention caused the Khmer Rouge victory while acknowledging that it may have played a small role in boosting recruitment for the insurgents. William Shawcross, however, wrote that the [...] "Khmer Rouge were born out of the inferno that American policy did much to create" [...] and that Sihanouk's [...] "collaboration with both powers ... was intended to save his people by confining the conflict to the border regions. [...] It was American policy that engulfed the nation in war." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{a conference}} in London, on 2 January 2013, Mark Shuttleworth {{unveiled}} the concept for an upcoming mobile operating system - [...] "Ubuntu Touch", that will probably be released [...] "by {{the end of the}} year. The device(s) on which it will be released will deliver a personalised, full screen-to-screen experience - with a 'welcome screen, not a lock screen'". Thereafter, a concept for one phone with Ubuntu for Phones was published on Ubuntu's official channel on YouTube, in which it is shown as a simple, rounded bar-type smartphone, with no buttons on the front, unlike what is usually seen on most smartphones. The Welcome Screen is shown to have the standard Ubuntu background image, with digital clock on top, and small-to-big circles in the centre, circulating Unread/Notifications/Talk Time. Each of these parts appear and fade each after the other, while changing the colour of the circles in the background and the placement of the little ones. From the Welcome screen, the user could swipe to any of the four directions: up for notifications, left for the app menu, swipe from the right to launch the previous app, and swipe from the bottom to display the <b>operations</b> <b>menu.</b> Also, the user would be able to launch Voice Control by touching the bottom-right corner outside the interface, where the soft buttons would be on other smartphones. In the main menu, you could swipe far to the bottom and release to launch the Home Screen. The Ubuntu for Android project, as said, is the first step for this new phone OS. Developers will be able to create one app, with two interfaces: a smartphone UI, and, when docked, a desktop UI. The software would then be integrated with Qube, and Quickly development (as told in the OMG! Ubuntu's Google+ hangout). Full information about the phone and OS is currently available in Ubuntu's official page for the product [...] A Developer Preview was released in February 2013.|$|R
