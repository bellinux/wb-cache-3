The public expressed <b>outrage</b> <b>that</b> Wanderer—a war hero who was expecting a child—would be set upon and have {{his pregnant wife}} killed. Wanderer was praised for his bravery in defending his wife. However, the circumstances of Ruth's death were suspicious enough to inspire a police investigation.|$|E
25|$|From the 1960s to the present, most U.S. {{states have}} moved towards the {{elimination}} of segregated institutions.

25|$|Castlereagh {{discovered}} the deal in September 1809 and demanded redress. He challenged Canning to a duel, which Canning accepted. Canning {{had never before}} fired a pistol. The duel was fought on 21 September 1809 on Putney Heath. Canning missed but Castlereagh wounded his opponent in the thigh. There was much <b>outrage</b> <b>that</b> two cabinet ministers had resorted to such a method, and they both felt compelled to resign from the government. Six months later, Canning published a full account of his actions in the affair, and many who had initially rallied to him became convinced Castlereagh had been betrayed by his cabinet colleague.|$|E
25|$|The {{provision}} Congress most intensely {{focused on}} amending was Section 2, which prescribes a general prohibition of discriminatory voting laws. Two years earlier, the Supreme Court, in Mobile v. Bolden (1980), held that racially discriminatory laws violated the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments {{only if the}} laws were enacted or maintained for a discriminatory purpose; thus, showing that a law simply had a discriminatory effect was insufficient to state a constitutional claim of discrimination. The Court further held that Section 2 mirrored this constitutional standard. The decision had a major effect on voting rights litigation; civil rights lawyers decided not to pursue many planned cases, and courts overturned several judgments that were previously entered in favor of plaintiffs. This prompted nationwide <b>outrage</b> <b>that</b> weighed heavily on Congress as it considered amending the Act in 1982.|$|E

Kyle leaves the school feeling lonely and excluded because he cannot celebrate Christmas with everyone else.|$|E
500|$|Van der Kiste {{writes that}} Charlotte and Feodora had very similar personalities, [...] "both strong-willed creatures who loved gossip and were too ready {{to believe the}} worst of each other". Eventually, their {{relationship}} deteriorated enough for Charlotte to bar Feodora and Henry from her house. Charlotte refused to accept Feodora's claim to have malaria, believing instead that her daughter had contracted a venereal disease from Henry; this opinion outraged Feodora. Over the years {{members of the family}} tried to repair the mother-daughter relationship, without success. Charlotte did not write to Feodora for nearly a decade, finally doing so after Feodora underwent a dangerous operation to help her conceive. Charlotte expressed <b>outrage</b> <b>that</b> such an operation had been approved, but eventually visited her in the sanatorium at Feodora's request.|$|E

500|$|Mohammed M'Barek {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the French authorities that had kept him [...] "in prison for two-and-a-half years for nothing". He {{thought it was an}} <b>outrage</b> <b>that</b> the French regarded the dumping of an inconveniently dead body in a ravine as a crime. He {{even went so far as}} to appeal to the new French president Nicolas Sarkozy for justice. On the third day of the trial, the courtroom descended into chaos as Monsieur M'Barek burst into tears then jumped to his feet pointing at Shaftesbury's family. He attempted to blame the Ashley-Cooper family for the peer's death, claiming that they were the guilty ones. [...] "You're the guilty ones, you the rich, who want to take his inheritance!" [...] he shouted as police wrestled with him in the dock. After refusing requests from his lawyer and the judge to sit down and be quiet, M'Barek was taken down to the cells and the hearing temporarily adjourned.|$|E
500|$|Finkelstein {{grew up in}} Borough Park, then Mill Basin, both in Brooklyn, New York, where [...] he {{attended}} James Madison High School. In his memoir, Finkelstein recalls his strong youthful identification with the <b>outrage</b> <b>that</b> his mother, witness to the genocidal atrocities of World War II, felt at the carnage wrought by the United States in Vietnam. [...] One childhood friend recalls his mother's [...] "emotional investment in left-wing humanitarian causes as bordering on hysteria". He had [...] "internalized [...] indignation", a trait which he admits rendered him [...] "insufferable" [...] when talking of the Vietnam War, and which imbued him with a [...] "holier-than-thou" [...] attitude at the time which he now regrets. But Finkelstein regards his absorption of his mother's outlook—the refusal to put aside a sense of moral outrage {{in order to get}} on with one's life—as a virtue. Subsequently, his reading of Noam Chomsky {{played an important role in}} tailoring the passion bequeathed to him by his mother to the necessity of maintaining intellectual rigor.|$|E
500|$|At the Milburn House, McKinley {{seemed to}} be recovering. [...] On Saturday, September 7, McKinley was relaxed and conversational. [...] His wife was allowed to see him, as was Cortelyou; the President asked his secretary, [...] "How did they like my speech?" [...] and was pleased on hearing of {{positive}} reactions. [...] Meanwhile, Vice President Roosevelt (who had been in Vermont), much of the Cabinet, and Senator Hanna hurried to Buffalo. [...] Cortelyou continued to issue encouraging bulletins. [...] The President was permitted few visitors, and complained of loneliness. [...] As the crisis seemed to have passed, dignitaries started to leave on September 9, confident of the President's recovery. [...] Roosevelt left for a vacation in the Adirondack Mountains after expressing <b>outrage</b> <b>that</b> Czolgosz might serve {{only a few years}} under New York State law for attempted murder, the maximum penalty for attempted murder in New York at that time being ten years. [...] Attorney General Philander Knox went to Washington, searching for a means to bring Czolgosz under federal law. [...] Secretary of State John Hay had been closely associated with the two presidents to be assassinated: [...] he had been Lincoln's secretary, and a close friend of James Garfield. [...] He arrived on September 10; met at the station by Babcock with an account of the President's recovery, Hay responded that the President would die.|$|E

500|$|Despite Mary Shelley's {{attempts}} to assist Gatteschi financially, {{he tried to}} blackmail her one year later in 1845using indiscreet letters she had written. After not hearing from Gatteschi for months, she received threatening letters, which claimed that she had promised him financial success and even possibly marriage. He claimed that her letters would demonstrate this. The contents of Mary Shelley's letters are unknown as they were later destroyed, but she must have felt some danger, for she took great pains to recover the letters and wrote agonised letters to her friends: [...] " [...] were written with an open heart – & contain details with regard to my past history, which it [...] destroy me for ever if they ever saw light." [...] Shelley turned to Alexander Knox for help. After obtaining help from the British government, he travelled to Paris and had the Paris police seize Gatteschi's correspondence. Implying that Gatteschi was {{a danger to the}} state, Knox and the Paris police called upon the cabinet noir system in order to retrieve the letters. On 11 October, Le National and Le Constitutionnel reported in <b>outrage</b> <b>that</b> Gatteschi's personal papers were seized because he was a suspected revolutionary. Mary wrote to Claire that [...] "It is an awful power this seizure", but she did not regret using it. After Knox retrieved her letters, he burned them. Shelley spent £250 of her own money to finance the operation. She was embarrassed by the entire incident.|$|E
