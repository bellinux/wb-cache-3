5|$|Although it was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be {{a simple}} {{solution}} of molecules, the cytosol has multiple levels of organization. These include concentration gradients of small molecules such as calcium, large complexes of enzymes that act together to carry out metabolic pathways, and protein complexes such as proteasomes and carboxysomes that enclose and separate parts of the cytosol.|$|E
5|$|Unburnt bone can be tested; it is usual to date {{it using}} collagen, the protein {{fraction}} that remains after washing away the bone's structural material. Hydroxyproline, {{one of the}} constituent amino acids in bone, was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be a reliable indicator as it was not known to occur except in bone, but it has since been detected in groundwater.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} dromaeosaurs, Velociraptor tails had long bony {{projections}} (prezygapophyses) {{on the upper}} surfaces of the vertebrae, as well as ossified tendons underneath. The prezygapophyses began on the tenth tail (caudal) vertebra and extended forward to brace four to ten additional vertebrae, depending on position in the tail. These were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> fully stiffen the tail, forcing the entire tail {{to act as a}} single rod-like unit. However, at least one specimen has preserved a series of intact tail vertebrae curved sideways into an S-shape, suggesting that there was considerably more horizontal flexibility than once thought.|$|E

5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in documents from 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E
5|$|Granite {{intrusions}} {{are found}} in the parish of Barvas in west Lewis, and another forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon. There are relatively small outcrops of Triassic sandstone at Broad Bay near Stornoway. The Shiant Isles and St Kilda are formed from much later tertiary basalt and basalt and gabbros respectively. The sandstone at Broad Bay was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be Torridonian or Old Red Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless {{bird that}} was endemic {{to the island}} of Mauritius, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest genetic {{relative}} was the also extinct Rodrigues solitaire, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae {{of the family of}} pigeons and doves. The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. A white dodo was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have existed on the nearby island of Réunion, but this is now thought to have been confusion based on the Réunion ibis and paintings of white dodos.|$|E
50|$|Leptodesmus thwaitesii, is {{a species}} of millipedes in the family Chelodesmidae. It was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> endemic <b>to</b> Sri Lanka, where first {{documented}} from Peradeniya.|$|R

5|$|The dodo {{is used as}} a mascot {{for many}} kinds of products, {{especially}} in Mauritius. It appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Mauritius, {{is used as a}} watermark on all Mauritian rupee banknotes, and features as the background of the Mauritian immigration form. A smiling dodo is the symbol of the Brasseries de Bourbon, a popular brewer on Réunion, whose emblem displays the white species <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have lived there.|$|E
5|$|There is {{one large}} beach {{on the eastern}} side of the isle where the only {{settlement}} of note (‘The Village’) was located and a tiny cove at Skipsdale (Old Norse: ship valley). Bagh na h-Aioneig (Scots Gaelic: bay of the steep promontory) on the western side is a deep cleft in the sea-cliffs <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be the highest in the UK which rise to 213m (699ft) above sea level at Builacraig.|$|E
5|$|While long {{thought to}} have been aquatic or semiaquatic, hadrosaurids were not as well-suited for {{swimming}} as other dinosaurs (particularly theropods, who were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been unable to pursue hadrosaurids into water). Hadrosaurids had slim hands with short fingers, making their forelimbs ineffective for propulsion, and the tail was also not useful for propulsion because of the ossified tendons that increased its rigidity, and the poorly developed attachment points for muscles that would have moved the tail from side to side.|$|E

50|$|It was <b>thought</b> {{originally}} <b>to</b> {{be closely}} related to Iris sari, and was <b>once</b> also <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{be a form of}} Iris atrofusca, but after genetic testing in 2001, it was found to be a separate but linked species.|$|R
5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be a way by which {{individuals}} identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks {{can be used to}} identify individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the heads}} are realistic, unidealised and frank {{descriptions}} of the men. It is likely that they were portraits of living (or recently deceased) rulers well known to the sculptors. Each head is distinct and naturalistic, displaying individualised features. They were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> represent ballplayers although this theory is no longer widely held; it is possible, however, that they represent rulers equipped for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Facial expressions depicted on the heads vary from stern through placid to smiling. The most naturalistic Olmec art is the earliest, appearing suddenly without surviving antecedents, with a tendency towards more stylised sculpture as time progressed. Some surviving examples of wooden sculpture recovered from El Manatí demonstrate that the Olmecs {{are likely to have}} created many more perishable sculptures than works sculpted from stone.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its very}} patchy range, the copper shark has been scientifically {{described}} several times from different locales. The earliest valid description is presently {{considered to be}} British zoologist Albert Günther's account of Carcharias brachyurus in the 1870 eighth volume of Catalogue of the fishes in the British Museum. The earliest name was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be Auguste Duméril's 1865 Carcharias remotus, until {{it was found that}} the type specimen associated with that name is actually a blacknose shark (C. acronotus). Thus, this shark was often referred to as C. remotus in older literature. An even earlier name, Richard Owen's 1853 Galeolamna greyi, is of questionable taxonomic status as it was based solely on a set of now-destroyed jaws that may or may not have belonged to a copper shark. Modern authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus.|$|E
25|$|The An-225 {{has since}} become the {{workhorse}} of the Antonov Airlines fleet, transporting objects <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> impossible <b>to</b> move by air, such as 150-tonne generators. It has become an asset to international relief organizations {{for its ability to}} quickly transport huge quantities of emergency supplies during disaster relief operations.|$|R
50|$|The PPN is {{involved}} in many functions, including arousal, attention, learning, reward, and voluntary limb movements and locomotion. While <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> important <b>to</b> the initiation of movement, recent research suggests a role in providing sensory feedback to the cerebral cortex. It is also implicated in the generation and maintenance of REM sleep.|$|R
5000|$|The 15 {{species of}} this genus were <b>once</b> all <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> {{be a single}} species, which was {{discovered}} in Acadia in present-day Nova Scotia. Differences in range, voice, and habitat eventually identified them as separate species. The present-day [...] "Acadian flycatcher" [...] is not found in Acadia.|$|R
5|$|Common {{over much}} of the Northern Hemisphere, S.coccinea occurs in the Midwest, in the valleys between the Pacific coast, the Sierra Nevada, and the Cascade Range. Its North American {{distribution}} extends north to various locations in Canada and south to the Mexican state Jalisco. The fungus has also been collected from Chile in South America. It is also found in the Old World—Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, and India. Specimens collected from the Macaronesian islands that <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be S.coccinea were later determined to be the distinct species S.macaronesica. A 1995 study of the occurrence of British Sarcoscypha (including S.coccinea and S.austriaca) concluded that S.coccinea was becoming very rare in Great Britain. All species of Sarcoscypha, including S.coccinea, are Red-Listed in Europe. In Turkey, it is considered critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|Crops {{included}} wheat, rye, barley and oats. Peas, beans, and vetches became common {{from the}} 13th century onward as a fodder crop for animals {{and also for}} their nitrogen-fixation fertilizing properties. Crop yields peaked in the 13th century, and stayed more or less steady until the 18th century. Though the limitations of medieval farming were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have provided a ceiling for the population growth in the Middle Ages, {{recent studies have shown}} that the technology of medieval agriculture was always sufficient for the needs of the people under normal circumstances, and that it was only during exceptionally harsh times, such as the terrible weather of 1315–17, that the needs of the population could not be met.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins {{may be used in}} treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} vultures, Gyps species have quite {{feathered}} heads, with characteristic downy covers. Indeed, {{rather than being}} an adaptation for scavenging as <b>once</b> <b>thought,</b> it seems <b>to</b> be related to thermoregulation.|$|R

Sasha eventually comes to understand that Lyuba is not the ideal woman he <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> her <b>to</b> be. He is reunited with his patient wife.|$|R
50|$|The Necromancer; or, The Tale of the Black Forest is a Gothic {{novel by}} Ludwig Flammenberg (which is a {{pseudonym}} for Carl Friedrich Kahlert) {{first published in}} 1794. It {{is one of the}} seven 'horrid novels' lampooned by Jane Austen in Northanger Abbey, <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> not <b>to</b> exist except in the text of Northanger Abbey.|$|R
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus was belatedly {{described}} in 1923 by William Parks, {{over twenty years}} after the first material was studied by Lawrence Lambe. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, in part because small-bodied crested hadrosaurids now recognized as juveniles were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> belong to their own genera and species. Currently, the various skulls assigned to the type species L. lambei are interpreted as showing age differences and sexual dimorphism. Lambeosaurus was closely related to the better known Corythosaurus, which is found in slightly older rocks, as well as the less well-known genera Hypacrosaurus and Olorotitan. All had unusual crests, which are now generally assumed to have served social functions like noisemaking and recognition.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, {{about a quarter of a}} mile north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but it is more likely that the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E
50|$|Thomas Donald Hawkins (January 11, 1927 - September 23, 1988), who {{was born}} in Pangurn, Arkansas and grew up in Port Angeles, Washington, was an American writer who is the {{probable}} author of the Wanda Tinasky letters, <b>once</b> widely <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> be the work of novelist Thomas Pynchon.|$|R
25|$|Obsidian is {{the rock}} {{formed as a}} result of quickly cooled lava, which is the parent material. Tektites were <b>once</b> <b>thought</b> by many <b>to</b> be {{obsidian}} produced by lunar volcanic eruptions, though few scientists now adhere to this hypothesis.|$|R
