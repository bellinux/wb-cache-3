5|$|The most {{prominent}} building in Lookout Point {{is the local}} fire station, which also serves both Caversham and Green Island. This 1956 structure is located immediately to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle</b> and is a prominent landmark upon entering or leaving Dunedin. Not far from the fire station to the north-east is Dunedin's tallest tree, a eucalyptus measuring an estimated 100 metres. The Dunedin Southern Motorway officially begins at the Lookout Point saddle, between Calton Hill and Maryhill, and sweeps down over broken hill country past Green Island to Mosgiel and the Taieri Plains.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of horses in warfare {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including the invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddle,</b> the stirrup, and later, the horse collar.|$|E

25|$|Cleaning is an {{important}} part of caring for tack. Tack that is not cleaned will start to build up sweat and dirt, which will cause uncomfortable rubbing on the horse.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the extensive structural analysis and design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support <b>saddles</b> for <b>the</b> Extended Barrel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ATLAS Tilecalorimeter {{that has taken}} place at Argonne National Laboratory over the past several months. This work has been a continuation and expansion of work {{that has taken place}} over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> several years within the ATLAS Tilecalorimeter collaboration. This paper will be divided into four main sections. Section 1 is the introduction to the analysis and will give a brief history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work that had previously been done. Section 2 examines the design and structural analysis that has occurred on <b>the</b> support <b>saddles.</b> <b>The</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support <b>saddles</b> has evolved over the last few months. There are three main analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> that are discussed in Section 2. First, the forces that act upon <b>the</b> support <b>saddles</b> and <b>the</b> resulting deflections and stresses are examined when <b>the</b> support <b>saddle</b> is subjected only to gravity loading. Next, <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> are examined when subjected to a combination of gravity and a seismic load of. 15 g in the X, Y, and Z directions. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>saddles</b> are analyzed when subjected to a combination of gravity, magnetic, and seismic loading. Section 3 describes a detailed analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back cryostat support structure in the Extended Barrel. This design has evolved significantly throughout the analysis process and every design iteration and analysis is described in detail. The initial design is described in Section 3. 1 that analyzed the back cryostat support only under vertical static loading. Section 3. 2 then examines <b>the</b> stiffening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cryostat support plate that had {{to be included in the}} design in order to provide sufficient stiffness in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> seismic loading in the X, Y, and Z directions. Finally, Section 3. 3 describes the final design, which has a modified stiffener...|$|R
