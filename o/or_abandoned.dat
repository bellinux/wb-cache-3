5|$|Redevelopment is {{underway}} {{for some of}} the abandoned industrial facilities, with the abandoned Oliver Corporation buildings being the most recent example of reclaimed property. The city also faced programs with large swaths of vacant housing after the decline of the manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant <b>or</b> <b>abandoned.</b> However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 homes have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E
5|$|In antiquity, many {{infants with}} disabilities were either killed <b>or</b> <b>abandoned.</b> A number of {{historical}} pieces of art {{are believed to}} portray Down syndrome, including pottery from AD 500 from South America and the 16th-century painting The Adoration of the Christ Child.|$|E

5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began {{a continuing}} decline. The city began {{the first of}} several urban renewal plans shortly after adopting its 1962 master plan. Those plans called for the demolition of many buildings downtown, {{to be replaced by a}} new arterial road, large public housing projects and a shopping mall. After various delays, those projects were either scaled back <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> entirely. In the interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E
5|$|Meat ants are {{generally}} intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) {{living in their}} colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey on workers as discussed earlier, some are inquilines {{and live in the}} nest commensally. Unused <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> areas inside colonies are sometimes occupied by other species of ants and in some cases, termites. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{people were}} arrested for looting or {{attempting}} to loot from evacuated <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> homes {{as a result of}} the fire. On September 14, a man posing as a California Highway Patrol officer was arrested in Whispering Pines on suspicion of removing an artifact of archaeological interest. On September 17, three {{people were arrested}} by Lake County Sheriff's Deputies for attempting to loot from homes in Hidden Valley Lake. They were allegedly in possession of burglary tools and an unregistered firearm.|$|E

5|$|Some closed station {{buildings}} are still standing, converted {{for other uses}} <b>or</b> <b>abandoned,</b> while others have been demolished and their sites redeveloped. A number of stations, while still open, have closed platforms or sections, such as the Jubilee line platforms at Charing Cross. The interiors and platforms of a few closed stations are among parts of the London Underground available for filming purposes, such as those at Aldwych.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Empire's {{military}} {{position in}} the Balkans collapsed in the early 7th century {{as a result of}} disastrous military ventures against the Persians and then the Arabs in the East, which forced the effective abandonment of the Danube limes and opened the way for large-scale penetration and settlement of the Balkan hinterland by various Slavic tribes. The Slavs raided as far as southern Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. Most of the region's cities were sacked <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> and only a few, including Thessalonica, remained occupied and in imperial hands.|$|E
5|$|The Yavapai built brush shelter {{dwellings}} called Wa'm bu nya:va (Wom-boo-nya-va). In summer, {{they built}} simple lean-tos without walls. During winter months, closed huts (called uwas) {{would be built}} of ocotillo branches or other wood and covered with animal skins, grasses, bark, and/or dirt. In the Colorado River area, Ɖo:lkabaya built Uwađ a'mađva, a rectangular hut, that had dirt piled up against its sides for insulation, and a flat roof. They also sought shelter in caves <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> pueblos to escape the cold.|$|E

5|$|Assemblies and councils {{operated}} {{according to}} established procedures {{overseen by the}} augurs. They could only be convened by magistrates, and citizens only voted on matters proposed by the presiding magistrate. Over the years, laws were passed which mandated a written ballot, attempted to reduce voter intimidation, and established procedures to watch over voting and prevent voter fraud. For elections, {{it was not a}} matter of who received the most votes, but rather who could first be approved by a majority of the voting blocs. All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted <b>or</b> <b>abandoned.</b>|$|E
5|$|For example, of the 15 dolphin {{carcasses}} {{found in}} the Japurá River in 2010–2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because {{a variety of factors}} make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that legal action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a variable length of time.|$|E
50|$|In the {{communist}} lexicon, anti-revisionism is opposition to attempts to revise, modify, <b>or</b> <b>abandon</b> {{the fundamentals of}} revolutionary theory and practice. In this view, reformism within communism is rejected as representing dangerous concessions to communism's adversaries.|$|R
50|$|In some {{versions}} of the game there are additional options for emergency situations, such as calling for help from a Starbase, using the experimental Death Ray, loading raw dilithium crystals into the warp drive, <b>or</b> <b>abandoning</b> ship.|$|R

Humorous characters such as The Addams Family, Casper the Friendly Ghost, or The Munsters may be included. Haunted attractions can be created at many locations: temporarily constructed simulated [...] "haunted houses" [...] <b>or</b> actual <b>abandoned</b> and dilapidated homes, corn mazes or cornfields, hedge mazes, farms or farmhouses, wooded areas <b>or</b> forests, <b>abandoned</b> asylums, defunct <b>or</b> old prisons, <b>abandoned</b> amusement parks <b>or</b> active amusement parks, ships <b>or</b> boats, <b>abandoned</b> factories, shopping malls, and parks.|$|R
5|$|From the mid-first century AD, Christianity {{took root}} in Egypt {{and it was}} {{originally}} seen as another cult that could be accepted. However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from Egyptian Religion and Greco-Roman religion and threatened popular religious traditions. This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out. In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples. Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed. As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline. While the native population certainly continued to speak their language, {{the ability to read}} hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished. The temples themselves were sometimes converted to churches <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> to the desert.|$|E
5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen {{as something of a}} creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E
5|$|Mallards usually form pairs (in October and November in the Northern Hemisphere) {{until the}} female lays eggs {{at the start}} of the nesting season, which is around the {{beginning}} of spring. At this time she is left by the male who joins up with other males to await the moulting period, which begins in June (in the Northern Hemisphere). During the brief time before this, however, the males are still sexually potent and some of them either remain on standby to sire replacement clutches (for female mallards that have lost <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> their previous clutch, replacement clutch) or forcibly mate with females that appear to be isolated or unattached regardless of their species and whether or not they have a brood of ducklings.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{contentious}} areas of religious freedom is the right of an individual to change <b>or</b> <b>abandon</b> his <b>or</b> her own religion (apostasy), {{and the right to}} evangelize individuals seeking to convince others to make such a change.|$|R

5|$|New York City {{was struck}} {{particularly}} {{hard by the}} storm. It is estimated that 42 people perished, and several hundred more people were injured. The storm disrupted the city for days, and forced schools to close. Streets throughout Queens became impassable; mail service, buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and trash collection were all disrupted. Thousands of motorists became trapped on the New York State Thruway. A snow emergency was issued in the city, and the Long Island Rail Road suspended all service at the time. The snowstorm left approximately 6,000 travelers stranded at Kennedy Airport. They slept on chairs and floors. Over 1,000 vehicles were stalled <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> on the Tappan Zee Bridge; most of these were removed within a day.|$|E
5|$|The 1834 revolt and the {{immediate}} aftermath reduced the male population of Palestine by about one-fifth. This decrease is attributed to {{the large numbers of}} peasants who were either deported to Egypt to work in manufacturing, drafted into Egypt's military, <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> their villages and farms to join the Bedouin nomadic populations. Around 10,000 peasants were deported to Egypt and the general population was disarmed. The conscription orders were extended beyond the Muslim population to the local Christians. Taxes were also extended from landed property to include livestock as well. As Ibrahim consolidated his hold over Palestine and disarmed the population, banditry by local tribesmen and civil strife was largely eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew of the}} Ethel & Millie then {{abandoned}} their battered boat and were hauled aboard the German submarine, where the Nelson survivors last saw them standing in line being addressed by a German officer. The seven British sailors of the Ethel & Millie were never seen again, and much controversy exists surrounding their disappearance. Prevailing opinion {{at the time was}} that they were murdered and dumped overboard by the German crew <b>or</b> <b>abandoned</b> at sea without supplies, but these scenarios cannot be substantiated. Another theory is that they were taken prisoner aboard the boat and killed when the submarine was itself sunk. The son of Arthur Soanes, a sailor who disappeared in this incident, later claimed to have contacted his father through his powers as a spiritual medium, reporting that he had died on board the German vessel. UC 63 has been named as the submarine that sank both vessels.|$|E
30|$|Figure  5 {{indicates}} {{that those who}} face uncertainty of the first revenue tend to wait <b>or</b> <b>abandon</b> their entrepreneurial attempts.

50|$|By 1992, the {{direction}} was to either privatize <b>or</b> <b>abandon</b> the narrow-gauge railways. A first victim was the Oschatz-Kemmlitz railway.
