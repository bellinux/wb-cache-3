30|$|We have {{recently}} {{described in this}} Journal the promising results of detailed testing of the GreenCaps {{in the formation of}} greener <b>one</b> <b>component</b> polyurethane <b>foams</b> (<b>OCFs)</b> under standard conditions [1]. Proposed as potential new solid curing agents, the GreenCaps are comprised of microporous silica-based microspheres encapsulating aqueous glycerol [2]. Adding to their environmental merit, the GreenCaps microparticles, in addition, are made using biodegradable, non toxic surfactant sorbitan oleate (Span 80) derived from natural products oleic acid and sorbitol [3].|$|R

40|$|Ceramic {{open cell}} <b>foams</b> (<b>OCF)</b> are {{characterized}} by lower pressure drop, high geometric surface area, and enhanced radial convection in comparison with monolith-type supports. In this work, silicon carbide (SiC) and zirconia (Zir) OCF with different pore per inch (ppi) density were coated with 200 mg of Co 3 O 4 by solution combustion synthesis and doped with 3 wt % of Pd via wetness impregnation. Their catalytic activity was tested toward the lean oxidation of methane at different weight hourly space velocities. Zir OCF with 30 ppi exhibits the best catalytic activity for all reacting conditions, followed by Zir 45 ppi, SiC 45 ppi, and SiC 30 ppi. The better performance of Zir OCF was rationalized considering their lower volumetric heat exchange coefficients, which favor the reaction heat removal by convection via the flue gases. A 200 h stability test on the best structured catalyst demonstrated full methane conversion at a temperature below 400 Â°C. These results confirm the fundamental role of thermal conductivity of the structured catalysts' support...|$|R

Time-resolved correlation of the scattered speckle intensities reveals the details of foam dynamics during aging. We introduce Temporal Contrast Analysis, a novel statistical tool that can be effective in characterizing structural rearrangements. Using Temporal Contrast Analysis {{we were able to}} detect two distinct dynamical <b>components</b> present during <b>foam</b> aging: spontaneous and intermittent, avalanche-like events and continuous, flow-like rearrangements in the foam structure. We were able to measure these contributions separately from the intrinsic statistical noise contribution, and thereby independently analyze the decay of each dynamical <b>component</b> during <b>foam</b> aging process...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a 2 Ã 2 system of parabolic equations with first and zeroth coupling {{and establish a}} Carleman estimate by extra data of only <b>one</b> <b>component</b> without data of initial values.

The main results are Lipschitz stability estimates for the inverse problems. For the Lipschitz stability, we have to assume some non-degeneracy condition at Î¸ for the two components and for it, we can approximately control the two components of the 2 Ã 2 system by inputs to only <b>one</b> <b>component.</b> Such approximate controllability is proved also by our new Carleman estimate. Finally we establish a Carleman estimate for a 3 Ã 3 system for parabolic equations with coupling of zeroth-order terms by <b>one</b> <b>component</b> to show the corresponding approximate controllability with a control to <b>one</b> <b>component...</b>|$|R
