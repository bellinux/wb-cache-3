Electronic switches (S 01, S 02) are switched between the energy storage element and outputs (36, 38). The switches connect the energy storage element with the outputs during a free-wheel phase of a single-phase inverter (26), and isolate the energy storage element from the <b>outputs</b> <b>outside</b> the free-wheel phase of the inverter. The storage element is switched between a connection and another connection of the inputs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a system for converting a received direct current voltage into an alternating voltage, comprising a solar generator (2) a method for converting the received direct current voltage into the alternating voltage by the solar generator. USE - Isolating circuit for a single-phase inverter in a H 4 -bridge circuit for converting an electrical direct current voltage into an elctrical alternating voltage. ADVANTAGE - The switches connect the energy storage element with the outputs during the free-wheel phase of the single-phase inverter, and isolate the energy storage element from the <b>outputs</b> <b>outside</b> the free-wheel phase of the inverter, so that a grounded solar generator is separated, thus avoiding a short-circuit between the generator and a grounded network...|$|R

In addition, the article maps the relationship between Richards' narrative to the languages of her epoch and how she articulates these.

40|$|Purpose: TX {{regulations}} and the ACR require that CT radiation output be measured {{within 30 days}} of major service. The most common major service is tube replacement. We hypothesized that historical QC data could be used instead to determine if output measurements are necessary, reducing the need for costly output measurements. Methods : We reviewed 66 records of tube replacements to determine with what frequency <b>output</b> falls <b>outside</b> specifications. We also conducted an experiment to verify that clinically significant output changes could be identified by comparing image noise in historical QC data with the same data after tube replacement. We used 30 days of historical QC data to establish a baseline noise level and 95 % confidence interval (CI) for individual noise measurements. To simulate output changes, we acquired phantom images with our QC protocol while manually changing output (mA). We acquired 10 images using the baseline output and 10 images at each different “output”. We evaluated individual images and subsets of images at each “output” {{to determine if the}} system was within the manufacturer’s specifications. Results: None of the 66 tube replacements resulted in an output change that exceeded specifications. Analysis of 30 days of historic QC data for our experimental system indicated a mean noise of 5. 4 HU with 95 % CI of 5. 1 ‒ 5. 7 HU. When using the mean noise of 10 images acquired at each of the varying outputs, we were able to identify, with 100 % accuracy, images acquired at <b>outputs</b> <b>outside</b> manufacturer’s specifications. Conclusion : The results of our review of historical tube replacement data indicated the likelihood of <b>output</b> falling <b>outside</b> manufacturer’s specifications is low. Considering this, it is likely that by using QC data from programs required by regulation and the ACR physicists can reliably verify radiation output stability remotely instead of making physical measurements.

40|$|Quality reports or {{profiles}} {{of health care}} providers are inevitably based on only a measurable subset of the ``outputs" of the organization. Hospitals, for example, are being profiled on their mortality in the cardiac area but not in some other areas where mortality {{does not seem to}} be the appropriate measure of quality. If inputs used for outputs included in the profile also affect <b>outputs</b> <b>outside</b> the scope of the profile, it can be taken into account in constructing a profile of the measured outputs. This paper presents a theory for how such a commonality in production should be taken into account in designing a profile for a hospital or other health care provider. We distinguish between ``conventional" weights in a quality profile, and ``optimal" weights that take into account a commonality in the production process. The basic idea is to increase the weights on discharges for which output is measured that use inputs that are important to other discharges whose outputs are not included in the profile. ...|$|R

Separability an important property of production, confirms the existence of aggregation in variables and the decentralization of decision making.

Weak separability in the estimation of a systems of demand functions was first explored by Sono(196 1) and Leontief(1947) to deal with aggregation problems in consumer and producer theory respectively.

40|$|African {{central banks}} have covered an {{extraordinary}} distance {{since the early}} 1990 s—closing the gap, in the process, between their own policy challenges and those of richer-country central banks. Some striking differences are nonetheless easily missed, amid the many parallels between central banking reforms in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{and those in the}} industrial and emerging-market economies. The abandonment of soft pegs in low-income SSA, for example, had less to do with capital mobility than with the failures of exchange control systems under pressure from fiscal imbalances and external shocks. Fiscal and quasi-fiscal demands, in turn, have almost certainly been more important than conventional stabilisation objectives as potential sources of inflation bias in SSA. Money-based disinflation programmes, to take a final example—often supported by tight fiscal rules under IMF conditionality—do not appear to have involved costly sacrifices of <b>output,</b> <b>outside</b> of South Africa.   These observations, and more in the papers collected here, suggest that the distinctive structural and institutional features of low-income countries may have distinctive implications for the design and conduct of monetary policy.
