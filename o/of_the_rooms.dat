5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, over 100 western {{movies were}} filmed in nearby Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon. The Hotel Monte Vista in Flagstaff hosted many film stars during this era, {{including}} Jane Russell, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, and Bing Crosby. A {{scene from the}} movie Casablanca was filmed in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> of the hotel.|$|E
5|$|Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> {{has its own}} {{balcony and}} is {{designed}} in the Beverly Hills Hotel colors of peachy pinks and greens, apricots and yellows. Several of the more expensive rooms have private patios, Jacuzzis and their own kitchens.|$|E
30|$|The {{standard}} {{lightweight and}} heavyweight floor impact sounds were measured 0.75  m {{away from each}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and four points, including <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> were selected for the measurement locations in the field test. Microphones were also located to acquire the floor impact sound data at distances of 0.75  m from <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and situated at a height of 1.2  m from the floor. Figure  4 indicates <b>the</b> locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sound and receiver points on <b>the</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
30|$|In the {{proposed}} approach, {{we assume that}} room {{is divided into two}} regions: occupied- <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where <b>the</b> occupant is present; and unoccupied - <b>the</b> other part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> long <b>room</b> {{is full of}} {{children}} looking at books. Bookcases line the walls. Windows are on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> In <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> children are standing at the librarian's desk writing. A vase of flowers is on the desk. A hat {{is on the floor}} by a child seated at the center table. A card catalog is at <b>the</b> other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in <b>the</b> center...|$|R
5|$|The Bishops House {{consists}} of two narrow ranges with a narrow courtyard. The {{front of the building}} on the south side is crenelated. The arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> inside has been changed many times over the years. It still includes features from the 15th century including a doorway and oak screens. The windows include some remnants of 16th century stained glass.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Frets {{is located}} on the fourth terrace of the Acropolis. The south facade of the palace is {{decorated}} with four large stepped frets. On {{the east side of the}} palace a stairway leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> of the palace contains a stucco decoration representing feathered serpents and crossed bones.|$|E
5|$|The {{east and}} west wings of the {{building}} once each contained a transit room. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> had a mounted transit telescope on a brick pier; the piers are still visible in the basement below the transit rooms. The western transit rooms were converted into office space by the 1920s. The eastern transit rooms were converted to office space more recently.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>room</b> is entered {{from the}} Center Hall on <b>the</b> north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Three large windows on <b>the</b> south side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> face <b>the</b> South Lawn and The Ellipse. The {{southwest}} window has a swing-sash door {{leading to the}} Truman Balcony. Double doors on <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> with flags <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> presidency on either side, lead {{to the president and}} first lady's bedrooms, private sitting room and dressing room.|$|R

50|$|A {{large room}} is {{selected}} as the speed geeking venue. All the presenters are arranged in a large circle along <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> remaining members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience stand at <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Ideally there are about 6-7 audience members for each presenter. One person acts as the facilitator.|$|R
5|$|Alexander Luttrell, who {{inherited}} Dunster Castle in 1910, {{chose to}} live at East Quantoxhead instead, and it was left empty until his son Geoffrey reoccupied the castle in 1920, redecorating some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in a contemporary style and building a polo ground alongside the castle. The castle and the surrounding countryside at this time was very popular with the Luttrells for fox hunting and shooting. During the Second World War the castle {{was used as a}} convalescent home for injured naval and American officers between 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was {{building}} the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion {{was once again}} plundered of its fittings. As a result, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by Richard Westmacott. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.|$|E
5|$|During the 1640s and 1650s, Velázquez {{served as}} both court painter and curator of PhilipIV's {{expanding}} collection of European art. He {{seems to have}} been given an unusual degree of freedom in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the sourcing, attribution, hanging and inventory of many of the Spanish king's paintings. By the early 1650s, Velázquez was widely respected in Spain as a connoisseur. Much of the collection of the Prado today—including works by Titian, Raphael, and Rubens—were acquired and assembled under Velázquez's curatorship.|$|E

50|$|The {{first couple}} join hands and - to wild applause - they proceed down <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dance to <b>the</b> far end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> then (to even wilder applause) they {{come all the}} way back down <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> to where they began.|$|R
5|$|Excavated between 1992 and 1995, it {{is located}} {{underneath}} the western sector of the palace {{at a depth of}} almost 6 meters. The tomb is composed of two rooms opened on each other's with lime plaster floors. Both rooms are rectangular in shape; the eastern room (L.6402) is 4 meters wide, more than 3,5 meters long (total length is unknown due to heavy damage) and west-east oriented. The western room (L.5762) is 5.20 meters long, 4 meters wide and west-east oriented. Limestone was used to build the walls and few blocks protruding from the sides toward the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> suggest the roof to have been a corbelled vault.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{the site}} hosted eleven {{different}} residential halls and pavilions; in 2012 only three are left, {{although they have}} been completely reconstructed: The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall, the Moon Satharn Borom Ard Hall and the Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat Hall. Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, which has been recently rebuilt. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> {{are open to the}} public, as state functions are still carried out within. The changing of the guards occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of an {{interior}} view of Los Angeles City Hall, showing the city council's meeting room, [s. d. ]. A long rectangular {{room with a}} very high ceiling can be seen. Rows of wooden benches fill most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> has a large desk with several chairs behind it, facing out towards the benches. Flags flank the desk on either side. Lamps hang from the ornately decorated ceiling, and large windows let in light on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>room</b> is entered {{from the}} second floor {{corridor}} on <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> A large fanlight window on <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> faces <b>the</b> Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, the East Colonnade, the East Wing, and the U.S. Treasury. Two disguised doors allow access to a closet and a staircase up to the third floor.|$|R
5|$|Group G {{lies just}} south of the Mendez Causeway. The complex dates to the Late Classic and {{consists}} of palace-type structures {{and is one of the}} largest groups of its type at Tikal. It has two stories but most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> are on the lower floor, a total of 29 vaulted chambers. The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey. One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask.|$|E
5|$|In many bathhouses the {{customer}} has {{a choice between}} renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), some or all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> are freely available to all patrons.|$|E
5|$|On {{display in}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> are {{surviving}} works from Louis René deRohan's vast collection of Japanese vases and Chinese pottery and lacquerware from the Ming and Qing dynasties, originally {{destined for the}} new castle in Saverne. A curio cabinet in the Garde-robe du prince-évêque displays dessert tableware from the Manufacture de Sèvres, made in 1772–1774 for Louis-René deRohan's special embassy in Vienna. These items now belong to the Musée des arts décoratifs.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he passed}} {{on with the}} Doctor to <b>the</b> other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> Major nodded as he came up.|$|R
25|$|As an example, for a {{glass of}} ice water in air at <b>room</b> temperature, <b>the</b> {{difference}} in temperature between a warm <b>room</b> (<b>the</b> surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room),</b> begins to equalize as portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to <b>the</b> cooler system <b>of</b> ice and water. Over time <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass and its contents and <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> become equal. In other words, <b>the</b> entropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.|$|R
50|$|The {{narrative}} moves like {{a knight}} in a chess game, one chapter for each <b>room</b> (thus, <b>the</b> more <b>rooms</b> an apartment has the more chapters {{are devoted to}} it). In each room we learn about <b>the</b> residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> or <b>the</b> past residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> or about someone they have come into contact with.|$|R
5|$|St Briavels Castle {{remained}} an important {{location in the}} reign of Edward II, as the Welsh Marches were a key region in the wars between the king, his favourites and various noble factions during the period. Roger d'Amory was the constable of the castle {{during the early years}} of Edward's reign. D'Amory was a royal favourite and Edward II visited the Castle several times, with an extensive renovation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> and quarters occurring during this time. Around £500 was spent on the work, a substantial sum.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Baronet who {{was also}} Edward Strachey, a Liberal politician, was {{returned}} to Parliament for Somerset South at the 1892 general election. He served under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and later H. H. Asquith as Treasurer of the Household from 1905 to 1909 and under Asquith as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries from 1909 to 1911. He was raised to the Peerage as Baron Strachie in 1911. During the 1970s major restoration work was undertaken to deal with dry rot and replace wiring {{which resulted in the}} removal of several ceilings and decorations from many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Blathwayt {{family owned}} the house until 1956, when the {{government}} acquired it, but during the Second World War it was used for child evacuees while rented by Lady Anne Islington, the wife of John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington, who redecorated many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b> The National Trust acquired it in 1961. In 2015 major renovation work, costing £3.8 million, included replacing the roof. Part of the cost was met from a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £85,000. While the repairs were in progress, visitors could view the house from a rooftop walkway.|$|E

Rooms of Humanity connects to themes such as individual and collective responsibility, exclusion, war, genocide, (in)humanity, propaganda, and the dynamic between victim - perpetrator - bystander.|$|R
40|$|Bookcases line <b>the</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Marble stairs at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> lead to <b>the</b> {{second floor}}. Two large carved vases are at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stairs. The second floor gallery that {{surrounds}} <b>the</b> lower <b>room</b> also holds bookcases. There is a railing along <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gallery. A large circular light fixture hangs {{down from the}} ceiling.
