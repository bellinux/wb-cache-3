50|$|Robert Gee Witty {{and five}} other pastors founded Luther Rice Seminary in 1962 in Jacksonville, Florida. The school was founded {{to meet the needs}} of pastors and Christian leaders who could not quit their jobs and uproot their {{families}} to go away to seminary.

Luther Rice delivers distance education through <b>online</b> <b>studies.</b> All degrees except the DMin are available completely through <b>online</b> <b>studies.</b>|$|R
40|$|Instructional {{manipulation}} checks (IMCs) {{have become}} popular tools for identifying inattentive participants in <b>online</b> <b>studies.</b> IMCs function {{by attempting to}} trick inattentive participants into responding incorrectly. However, from a conversational perspective, question characteristics {{are part of the}} researcher’s contribution to the conversation, and IMCs may teach participants that there is “more than meets the eye,” prompting systematic thinking on subsequent tricky-seeming questions in an attempt to avoid being tricked. In two <b>online</b> <b>studies,</b> participants responded to a simple task either before or after completing an IMC. As expected, answering an IMC prior to the task improved performance on items that benefit from increased systematic thinking—namely, the Cognitive Reflection Test (Study 1), and a probabilistic reasoning task (Study 2). We conclude that IMCs change attention rather than merely measure attention and discuss implications for their use in <b>online</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Online</b> <b>studies</b> are {{increasingly}} utilized in applied research. However, lack of external diagnostic verification {{in many of}} these investigations is seen {{as a threat to the}} reliability of the data. The present study examined the robustness of internet studies on psychosis against simulation. We compared the psychometric properties of the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences scale (CAPE), a self-report instrument measuring psychotic symptoms, across three independent samples: (1) participants with a confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia, (2) participants with self-reported schizophrenia who were recruited over the internet, and (3) clinical experts on schizophrenia as well as students who were asked to simulate a person with schizophrenia when completing the CAPE. The CAPE was complemented by a newly developed 4 -item psychosis lie scale. Results demonstrate that experts asked to simulate schizophrenia symptoms could be distinguished from real patients: simulators overreported positive symptoms and showed elevated scores on the psychosis lie scale. The present study suggests that simulated answers in <b>online</b> <b>studies</b> on psychosis can be distinguished from authentic responses. Researchers conducting clinical <b>online</b> <b>studies</b> are advised to adopt a number of methodological precautions and to compare the psychometric properties of <b>online</b> <b>studies</b> to established clinical indices to assert the validity of their results...|$|R

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the topic of ethics in {{large-scale}} <b>online</b> <b>studies</b> on social network sides. “Big data” and large-scale <b>online</b> field <b>studies</b> are a relatively new phenomenon and clear ethical guidelines for social science research are still lacking. In this article, I focus on the ethical question of getting informed consent when we collect data from social network sites (SNS). I argue that data from SNS are not per se public and research based on these data should not be exempt from the ethical standard that informed consent must be obtained from participants. Based {{on the concept of}} privacy in context (Nissenbaum,), I further propose that this is because the norms of distribution and appropriateness are violated when researchers manipulate online contexts and collect data without consent. Finally, I make suggestions for existing and possible future practices for large-scale <b>online</b> <b>studies...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Finland, online {{learning}} {{has become more}} common in recent years. In this study, we examined why adult students chose to <b>study</b> <b>online</b> for upper secondary school. The research also focused on the support needed for learning from a special education perspective. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected using an electronic questionnaire. In total, 58 students responded. Data were analyzed qualitatively using the content analysis technique. The findings indicate that {{the main reasons for}} <b>online</b> <b>studies</b> are similar in Finland to those found internationally: flexibility of timetables, the student’s health condition, and family situations. The findings also indicate that a student’s school history leads them to choose <b>online</b> <b>studies.</b> This history included a lack of support, health issues, bullying, and too large class size. Suggested future research and practical implications also are discussed...|$|R
