We are subject to the scorn of our enemies (Muslims) who view us as defenseless and do with us whatever they like. We live every day, hour and moment of our lives in constant dread of some new tragedy which they might bring upon us. our lives, property, honor, everything that is dear to us is at the mercy of their anger and hostility, a situation which is worse than slavery. Apostate Jews have the right to inherit their parents entire estate, the widow and orphans who did not abandon their faith must hand over their property to the apostate. A Muslim who kills a Jew will not go to a trial, even if there were witnesses to the crime, the Muslim will pay at most a fine for his deed. We are groaning under the burden of disgraceful taxes.|$|E

In {{an act of}} seeming jealousy, Kain tears the bones from Raziel's wings and has him thrown into the Lake of the Dead, a large natural whirlpool; however, Raziel is resurrected as a wraith by The Elder God to become his [...] "soul reaver" [...] and kill Kain, thus restoring Nosgoth. With The Elder God's guidance, Raziel adapts to his new form and returns to Nosgoth. Infiltrating a Necropolis inhabited by the Melchahim vampires, Raziel finds his brother Melchiah, who has devolved into a beast unable to sustain his <b>own</b> <b>flesh.</b> After Raziel kills Melchiah and absorbs his soul, he confronts Kain among the ruined Pillars of Nosgoth in the Sanctuary of the Clans. Kain does not appear surprised to see Raziel, apparently having even been expecting him, and implies that he has destroyed Raziel's vampire clan, which only enrages Raziel even further. When Raziel begins to criticize him, Kain simply launches a tirade against him before noting what has become of the empire and engaging him in combat. Kain quickly overpowers Raziel and attempts to strike him down with the Soul Reaver, a powerful sword that absorbs its victims' souls; however, the Reaver shatters when it strikes Raziel, and Kain escapes, strangely satisfied. Raziel enters the spectral realm to find the blade's soul-devouring spectral form, which binds itself to him. After this, Raziel meets Ariel, who restores his strength, and learns of Zephon's location from The Elder God.|$|E

2500|$|In Protestantism, the {{continental}} reformers criticized fasting as a purely external observance {{that can never}} gain a person salvation. Martin Luther believed that a Christian may choose to fast individually as a spiritual exercise to discipline his <b>own</b> <b>flesh,</b> but that the time and manner of fasting {{should be left to}} the individual's discretion, thus he rejected the collective diet rules and prohibitions imposed by the canon law of the Catholic Church. This position was upheld by Lutheran churches, in that collective fasting was not officially enforced, whereas individual voluntary fasting was encouraged. John Calvin argued that instead of relying on designated fasting periods, the entire life of the religious should be [...] "tempered with frugality and sobriety" [...] {{in such a way as}} to produce [...] "a sort of perpetual fasting". He believed that collective public fasting could be appropriate only in times of calamity and grief for the community.

2500|$|The torture was {{conducted}} publicly in the captors' village, {{and the entire}} population (including children) watched and participated. Common torture techniques included burning the captive, which was done one hot coal at a time, rather than on firewood pyres; cutting with knives, beatings with switches or sticks, and jabs from sharp sticks. [...] Prisoners' fingernails were ripped out. Their fingers were broken, then twisted and yanked by children. [...] Captives were made to eat pieces of their <b>own</b> <b>flesh,</b> and were scalped alive. To make the torture last longer, the Native Americans would revive captives with rest periods during which time they were given food and water. [...] Tortures typically began on the lower limbs, then gradually spread to the arms, then the torso. [...] The Native Americans spoke of [...] "caressing" [...] the prisoners gently at first, which meant that the initial tortures were designed to cause pain, but only minimal bodily harm. [...] By these means, the execution of a captive, especially an adult male, could take several days and nights.|$|E

Canadian journalist and writer Frederick Arthur McKenzie wrote that in poorer areas, [...] "there was {{a vast amount of}} sympathy with the rebels, particularly after the rebels were defeated". He wrote of crowds cheering a column of rebel prisoners as it passed, with one woman remarking [...] "Shure, we cheer them. Why shouldn't we? Aren't they our <b>own</b> <b>flesh</b> and blood?". At Boland's Mill, the defeated rebels were met with a large crowd, [...] "many weeping and expressing sympathy and sorrow, all of them friendly and kind". Other onlookers were sympathetic but watched in silence. Christopher M. Kennedy notes that [...] "those who sympathised with the rebels would, out of fear for their own safety, keep their opinions to themselves". Áine Ceannt witnessed British soldiers arresting a woman who cheered the captured rebels. An RIC District Inspector's report stated: [...] "Martial law, of course, prevents any expression of it; but a strong undercurrent of disloyalty exists".

Some of the poems are conversational in which the poet pleads, begs, chides or praises the king. One such example is poem 46. The poet Kovur Kizhaar address the Chola king Killivalavan to save the lives of the children of a defeated enemy who are about to be executed by being trampled under an elephant. The poet says, [...] "… O king, you belong to the heritage of kings who sliced their <b>own</b> <b>flesh</b> {{to save the life of}} a pigeon, look at these children; they are so naïve of their plight that they have stopped crying to look at the swinging trunk of the elephant in amusement.

Remaining true to this inspiration, this book compiles a curious array of imaginative-philosophical texts {{by a variety of}} poets, fiction writers, theorists illuminating, illustrating, fabulating, and riffing upon a wide range of petrochemical-based objects and ideas.
