25|$|Parabolic trough {{power plants}} use a curved, {{mirrored}} trough which reflects the {{direct solar radiation}} onto a glass tube containing a fluid (also called a receiver, absorber or collector) running {{the length of the}} trough, positioned at {{the focal point of the}} reflectors. The trough is parabolic along one axis and linear in the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>axis.</b> For change of the daily position of the sun perpendicular to the receiver, the trough tilts east to west so that the direct radiation remains focused on the receiver. However, seasonal changes in the angle of sunlight parallel to the trough does not require adjustment of the mirrors, since the light is simply concentrated elsewhere on the receiver. Thus the trough design does not require tracking on a second axis. The receiver may be enclosed in a glass vacuum chamber. The vacuum significantly reduces convective heat loss.|$|E

BVGMs with intervals <b>orthogonal</b> to the <b>axis</b> are shown to be equivalent to the "polar visibility graphs " studied by Hutchinson [7]. BVGMs with intervals parallel to the axis are characterized as those graphs G which satisfy the following condi tions: G is embedded on the Mobius band; the block-cutpoint tree of G is a caterpillar in which all but at most one block is planar; and the non-planar block, if it exists, is at the "head " of the caterpillar. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} spatial frequency and orientation tuned channels {{in the perception of}} visual symmetry. Subjects discriminated between band-pass filtered, white noise textures that either did or did not contain vertical bilateral symmetry (VBS, i. e., around a vertical midline) {{as a function of the}} spatial phase disruption imposed on the images. Resistance to phase noise is largely scale-invariant for isotropically filtered images, but horizontally filtered images are consistently more noise-resistant than vertical. However, when stimuli are rotated through 90 deg (horizontal bilateral symmetry, HBS) performance is better withvertically filtered images suggesting a general advantage for orientations <b>orthogonal</b> to the <b>axis</b> of symmetry. At these orientations symmetry may be signaleddirectly by clusters of features along the axis. Our data further suggest that the established disadvantage for HBS may be attributable to an over-reliance on the output of horizontal filters. We compare models which exploit feature clustering around the axis by measuring the co-alignment in the output of oriented filters. Models using filters oriented <b>orthogonal</b> to the <b>axis</b> of symmetry predict the psychophysical performance for isotropic patterns and for patterns filtered <b>orthogonal</b> to the <b>axis.</b> For patterns filtered parallel to the axis, our data suggest that visual attention may play a role...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1980s, {{the small}} and {{lightweight}} HP 7470 introduced the [...] "grit wheel" [...] mechanism, {{eliminating the need for}} perforations along the edges, unlike the Calcomp plotters two decades earlier. The grit wheels at opposite edges of the sheet press against resilient polyurethane-coated rollers and form tiny indentations in the sheet. As the sheet is moved back and forth, the grit wheels keep the sheet in proper registration due to the grit particles falling into the earlier indentations, much like the teeth of two gears meshing. The pen is mounted on a carriage that moves back and forth in a line between the grit wheels, representing the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>axis.</b> These smaller [...] "home-use" [...] plotters became popular for desktop business graphics and in engineering laboratories, but their low speed meant they were not useful for general printing purposes, and different conventional printer would be required for those jobs. One category, introduced by Hewlett Packard's MultiPlot for the HP 2647, was the [...] "word chart", which used the plotter to draw large letters on a transparency. This was the forerunner of the modern Powerpoint chart. With the widespread availability of high-resolution inkjet and laser printers, inexpensive memory and computers fast enough to rasterize color images, pen plotters have all but disappeared. However, the grit wheel mechanism is still found in inkjet-based, large format engineering plotters.|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} proposed is that topology of {{a rotating}} gaseous cloud can be {{variable in the}} contraction process. Due to rotation an originally spherical cloud {{is transformed into a}} toroidal body. The contraction of a thin torus is considered with different suppositions on cooling the gas.

The number of the fragments and their mass distributions are calculated. The proposed hypothesis on toroidal stages in stellar evolution can remove some difficulties in the theory of structure and evolution of stars, such as absence of limitary stars, distribution of rotation velocities of early-type stars, origin of poloidal magnetic fields and decline rotators with the magnetic <b>axis</b> <b>orthogonal</b> to the <b>axis</b> of rotation...|$|R
