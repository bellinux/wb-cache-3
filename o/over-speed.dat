5|$|At {{the maiden}} voyage of the Springfield monorail, Lanley {{arranges}} for a well-attended opening ceremony, which will divert the town's attention while he escapes {{on a plane}} to Tahiti. The whole town turns out, and Leonard Nimoy is the guest of honor. The monorail departs just before Marge and Cobb arrive. Although it runs normally at the start, the controls soon malfunction and immediately begins to <b>over-speed</b> around the track, leaving Homer, Bart, and the passengers in danger, as the monorail's electricity cannot be shut off due to it being solar powered.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Omsk at 0:30 and was refueled with 38 tons of jet fuel. 5 hours after landing, the four engine propfan lifted off the runway {{on its way}} to Yakutsk for cold weather testing. Within seconds of becoming airborne one of the Progress D-27 engines with Contra-rotating propellers reached an <b>over-speed</b> condition and automatically shut down. The forward propeller stopped rotating but {{due to the nature of}} the failure the aft propeller kept turning, producing negative thrust. At this point the flight crew increased power to the remaining three engines but a problem with the RPM sensors on one of them led to automatic engine shut-off. Thus, the An-70 ended up flying at low speed with only two properly functioning engines, with the third engine generating over 11,000 pounds of negative thrust and disrupting airflow across the wing.|$|E
500|$|The {{tank was}} {{powered by a}} T-26 [...] flat row 4-cylinder {{air-cooled}} petrol engine, which was a complete Soviet copy of the Armstrong Siddeley engine used in the Vickers 6-Ton. The engine was located in the rear part of the hull. Early Soviet-made tank engines were of bad quality but they became better beginning in 1934. The T-26 (Armstrong Siddeley) engine {{did not have an}} <b>over-speed</b> limiter, which often resulted in overheating and engine valve breakage, especially in summer. A fuel tank for [...] and an oil box for [...] were placed alongside the engine. The engine required top-grade petrol; the use of second-rate petrol could cause damage to the valve units because of engine detonation. From mid-1932, a more capacious fuel tank (290 L instead of 182 L) and a simplified oil box were introduced. An engine cooling fan was mounted over the engine in a special shroud. From early 1932, the exhaust silencer was affixed by three clamps instead of two.|$|E

2500|$|During manufacture, {{propeller}} pistons, which {{control the}} pitch of the propellers, are coated through a process called nitriding, which hardens them and makes them more resistant to surface wear. [...] They {{are supposed to be}} inspected to make sure the process is completed. [...] While it is not known why the propeller on N73130 was not nitrided or failed inspections, the fact remains that it was, and was installed on N73130. [...] During the life of the engine, the piston had been slowly wearing away. During the flight, the piston finally failed, causing the propeller to <b>over-speed.</b> [...] The propeller subsequently failed due to overstress, 1 to 2 seconds later. [...] When the propeller failed, the blades were hurled through the cabin, severing control cables as well as the structural integrity of the plane itself. [...] The investigators determined that the crash was solely caused by the propeller defect and subsequent failure.|$|E

30|$|Traffic {{violations}} {{are also}} proved {{to have a}} greater probability of resulting in fatal truck crashes. In examining the crash samples of Shaanxi, truck drivers who frequently commit <b>over-speeding</b> (OR 2.137, 95  % CI 1.339 – 4.081) and over-loading (OR 1.209, 95  % CI 1.177 – 1.699) behaviors {{are more likely to be}} involved in fatigue crashes.|$|R
50|$|In 1941 {{experiments}} with boosting the W.1's thrust by introducing a liquid coolant were initiated, the first fluid tried being liquid ammonia which proved too effective, {{resulting in the}} engine <b>over-speeding</b> and pushing the thrust and rpm indicators off the scales, before later trials changed to using water, and water-methanol. A system to trial the technique in the E.28/39 was devised but never fitted.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine speed}} {{governor}} is used to prevent the engine from <b>over-speeding.</b> It has the capability of disregarding the FCU control. It does this by use of a diaphragm which senses the engine speed {{in terms of the}} centrifugal pressure caused by the rotating rotor of the pump. At a critical value, this diaphragm causes another spill valve to open and bleed away the fuel flow.|$|R
50|$|The 3.5-litre {{engine that}} powered the KF series Verada was {{identical}} to that fitted to the KE series.

40|$|In {{order for}} a wind {{generator}} (WG) to participate in load-frequency control (LFC) - either primary or secondary - some de-loading of its turbine is required. This paper discusses and rectifies important drawbacks of methods previously suggested on the two main de-loading techniques, i. e. <b>over-speeding</b> and pitch-controlled de-loading. In the same scope, the inertial support offered by WGs is also discussed. Two enhanced control strategies emerge from the above analysis: the first is based on <b>over-speeding</b> de-loading, which, for wind speed close to or above nominal, avoids overloading the converter of WGs equipped with Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG); the second is a method of pitch-controlled de-loading combined with inertial support for fast LFC action. Simulations presented show both the positive performance of the two proposed strategies and their favorable results versus previous cited methodologies. In MATLAB® Simulink, a two-bus power system consisting of a varying load, a diesel-synchronous generator and WG topologies with either a DFIG or a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) are considered. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The propeller was <b>over-speeding</b> to a high degree, causing a cooling system rupture. With steam obscuring his view the pilot force-landed the 28 VD with nil visibility, destroying the aircraft but not causing serious injury to the pilot.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Duterte became {{controversial}} {{after she}} repeatedly punched a court sheriff for insisting on demolishing houses inside a contested property in Barangay Soliman in Davao City. In 2014, Inday Sara Duterte {{was caught by}} traffic enforcers <b>over-speeding</b> along Quimpo Boulevard. The mandatory speed limit along Quimpo Boulevard is 40 kilometer per hour (㎞/h) but her car was caught speeding at 57 ㎞/h. Sources stated that the traffic enforcers were at first hesitant upon seeing who they were apprehending but Sara insisted that they instead confiscate her driver’s license and fine her for violating the speed limit law.|$|R
50|$|Cataracts {{were also}} used as an <b>over-speed</b> safety device for direct-acting water pumps. A seesaw or 'differential' lever was placed between the pump's piston rod and a {{cataract}} adjusted for the pump's normal working speed. If the pump suddenly accelerated, owing to the pump bursting or similar, the piston would overtake the cataract and {{the action of the}} differential lever would then close the pump's steam inlet valve and stop the pump, limiting possible damage.|$|E

50|$|The first prototype, the Ju 90 V1 was {{powered by}} four Daimler-Benz DB 600C liquid-cooled {{inverted}} V engines delivering 820 kW (1,100 hp) each. These were {{more powerful than}} both those of its Ju 89 predecessor and of production commercial Ju 90s. Named Der Grosse Dessauer as had been the earlier Junkers G 38, its maiden flight took place on 28 August 1937. Deutsche Luft Hansa carried out the long-distance testing. After eight months of flight tests, this prototype broke up on 6 February 1938 during <b>over-speed</b> tests.|$|E
30|$|The {{modeling}} {{results also}} show that among driver’s violation behaviors, <b>over-speeding</b> (OR 2.349, 95  % CI 1.875 – 3.941) and over-loading (OR 0.848, 95  % CI 0.464 – 1.223) significantly {{increase the risk of}} being involved in truck crashes. Considering the environmental factors, fatigue-related truck crashes are more likely to happen between 0 am and 6 am (OR 0.907, 95  % CI 0.561 – 0.976), under poor visibility conditions (OR 1.376, 95  % CI 0.877 – 1.740), during adverse weather periods (OR 0.518, 95  % CI 0.284 – 0.809), and on winter days (OR 1.465, 95  % CI 1.043 – 2.557) in Jiangxi, China.|$|R
50|$|The {{airborne}} {{opposition is}} made up from MiGs: Mikoyan MIG-31 Foxhound, Mikoyan MIG-27 Flogger and Mikoyan MIG-29 Fulcrum. Most of the missions start with the player inside a hangar, from which the player enters an IFF code, initiate engine start up, taxi without <b>over-speeding,</b> getting on the runway and takeoff - which adds to the tension if the base is under attack. On the ground, there are tank battalions (which moved to different locations as war progressed), radar & missiles installations and Triple-A guns around enemy airfields. It is possible to shoot down friendly aircraft by gunfire, but friendly aircraft can not be designated or tracked by player's radar.|$|R
5000|$|Singapore Police Force land {{division}} officers typically respond to calls in rapid-deployment vehicles {{now known as}} the Fast Response Car (FRC) which are the main police cars in Singapore. Prior to 2000, they were known in public simply as police patrol cars. Fast Response Cars are usually composed of Japanese-made saloon cars. Most commonly seen are the Toyota Corolla Altis and the Hyundai Avante. Around 2000, Nissan Sunny and Subaru Impreza sedans were added to the fleet. Unlike civilian vehicles in Singapore in which speed limiters (speed governors) are installed to prevent <b>over-speeding,</b> Police Fast Response Cars are able to reach their maximum speed potential without hindrance when the need arises.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flight control}} system on the 777 is {{designed}} to restrict control authority beyond certain range by increasing the back pressure once the desired limit is reached.

40|$|The {{flywheels}} {{on nuclear}} reactor coolant pump motors provide inertia {{to ensure a}} slow decrease in coolant flow {{in the event of}} loss of power; thus preventing possible fuel damage due to the reduced coolant flow. During operation at normal speed, a flywheel has sufficient kinetic energy to produce high-energy missiles and excessive vibration of the coolant pump assembly if the flywheel should fail. It is thus important to evaluate the fracture properties of the material to ensure it can withstand the applied stress. The structural integrity of a large steel flywheel {{to be used in the}} primary cooling system of the OPAL research reactor at Lucas Heights was evaluated according to the requirements of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission guide RG 1. 14. The guide was developed for nuclear power plants where significant <b>over-speeds</b> in pumps are possible. In the OPAL reactor at ANSTO such pump <b>over-speeds</b> are not possible, however, the code was used to demonstrate the incredibility of failure of the flywheel. An experimental program determined the fracture toughness and tensile properties of the flywheel material; thick section AS 3678 Grade 350 plate. Revision 4 of the well-validated British Energy R 6 defect assessment procedure was used to analyse the critical speed and crack length for the flywheel using the two-component failure assessment diagram which considers brittle fracture and plastic collapse. The results of the evaluation are presented in this paper, and illustrate what can be accomplished through the application of modern methods of integrity assessment...|$|R
50|$|Motor damage {{may occur}} from <b>over-speeding</b> (running at a {{rotational}} speed {{in excess of}} design limits) if the unit is operated with no significant mechanical load. On larger motors, sudden loss of load is to be avoided, {{and the possibility of}} such an occurrence is incorporated into the motor's protection and control schemes. In some smaller applications, a fan blade attached to the shaft often acts as an artificial load to limit the motor speed to a safe level, as well as a means to circulate cooling airflow over the armature and field windings. If there were no mechanical limits placed on a universal motor it could theoretically speed out of control in the same way any series-wound DC motor can.|$|R
50|$|The first non-fatal {{accident}} occurred on 23 July 1952. It involved a Handley Page HP.81 Hermes 4A (registration: G-ALDB) operating a trooping flight from Blackbushe to the RAF station in Fayid, Egypt. While the aircraft was overflying France, the flightdeck crew noticed a {{defect in the}} no. 4 engine and decided to make an emergency landing at the nearest diversion airfield. This resulted in a crash landing at Pithiviers. Although the aircraft was damaged beyond repair, there were no fatalities among the 70 occupants (six crew and 64 passengers). The evidence at the crash site seemed to suggest that an internal failure occurred inside the no. 4 engine, which caused <b>over-speeding</b> and subsequent disintegration of the reduction gear pinion bearing.|$|R
50|$|While at Eniwetok, {{five of the}} ship's American sailors {{were angry}} over the dismal working {{conditions}} aboard Sakawa. In a ship normally staffed by over 730 men, the U.S. Navy used a crew of 165 doing the work of 325. The five sailors sabotaged the ship by removing the pressure line to the <b>over-speed</b> trip valves in the fuel system and pouring sand into the oil and water pumps. They smashed gauges, tachometers, and cut high pressure steam lines {{in an attempt to}} get relieved of duty aboard the filthy warship. Rather than being relieved of duty, the five sailors were brought up on charges. In May, after emergency repairs, Sakawa reached Bikini Atoll.|$|E
50|$|By using {{a simple}} {{centrifugal}} governor, {{the speed of}} the motor may be controlled. When the governor detects an <b>over-speed</b> it interrupts the cam linkage so that the switches are activated for less time and so the motor slows. As there is already a cam and switch mechanism required, the addition of a governor link is a relatively simple addition. The use of a geared-up camshaft, as was common on the large power-producing motors, is also beneficial to permitting a smaller and more sensitive centrifugal governor. The ability to govern the power of the motor by switching the contact times gradually meant that this motor, unlike most other designs where the regulator shut off power altogether, meant that it could be governed very precisely.|$|E
50|$|Japanese {{air raids}} on Northern Australia hastened the {{formation}} in late 1942 of No. 1 Wing RAAF, comprising No. 54 Squadron RAF, No. 452 Squadron RAAF and No. 457 Squadron RAAF, {{under the command}} of Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, flying the Spitfire Vc(trop). The wing arrived at Darwin in February 1943, and saw constant action until September. The Mk Vc versions received by the RAAF proved unreliable and, initially at least, had a relatively high loss rate. This was due to several factors, including pilot inexperience, engine <b>over-speed</b> due to the loss of oil from the propeller speed reduction unit (a problem resolved by the use of a heavier grade of oil), and the practice of draining glycol coolant before shipment, resulting in internal corrosion of the Merlin engines.|$|E
40|$|Speed trap {{systems have}} been widely used {{worldwide}} by local authorities. This is one of the ways to control the speeding of public cars. The systems are often installed at hidden areas. In real situation, the image of <b>over-speeding</b> vehicle is captured by a high speed camera. In this study, a mobile phone equipped with a camera is used to capture the plate number and the image is sent by the mobile phone to the modem. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a system that can be used by the public to capture overspeeding vehicles or offender images and send to the modem which is connected to the computer that acts like the main control office. The received image is analyzed to extract the plate numbers into individual character using image processing technique...|$|R
30|$|Consistent with present {{findings}} in the literature, our results also reveal that the commercial male truck drivers with less experience exhibit a propensity for fatigue crashes, because they are doing a high-risk job and have to drive more often and longer on the road, under time constraints, as well as are more frequent to engage in risky driving behaviours, such as <b>over-speeding</b> and over-loading. All these in turn {{increase the likelihood of}} being in a fatigue crash. Specially, employed truck drivers exhibit higher probabilities of involvement in fatigue crashes in Jiangxi, China, because a large percentage of traffic are pass through vehicles, especially the bidirectional traffic between Guangdong Province in South China and North China as well as those between the developed east coast provinces and the remote western areas in China. In Shaanxi, however, such effects are not observed.|$|R
40|$|Use of ADAS in top end cars {{has been}} {{prevalent}} over past decade.
