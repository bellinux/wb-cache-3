50|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of this early post-glacial landscape {{in the so-called}} Boreal period, were very small and scattered populations living from hunting of reindeer and <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> and gathering whatever fruits the climate was able to offer. Around 8,300 BC the temperature rose drastically, now with summer temperatures around 15 degrees Celsius, and the landscape changed into dense forests of aspen, birch and pine and the reindeer moved north, while aurochs and elk arrived from the south. The Koelbjerg Man is the oldest known bog body {{in the world and}} also the oldest set of human bones found in Denmark, dated to the time of the Maglemosian culture around 8,000 BC. With a continuing rise in temperature the oak, elm and hazel arrived in Denmark around 7,000 BC. Now boar, red deer, and roe deer also began to abound.|$|E
50|$|Pakicetids are {{classified}} as cetaceans mainly due {{to the structure of}} the auditory bulla (ear bone), which is formed only from the ectotympanic bone. The shape of the ear region in pakicetids is highly unusual and the skull is cetacean-like, although a blowhole is still absent at this stage. The jawbone of pakicetids also lacks the enlarged space (mandibular foramen) that is filled with fat or oil, which is used in receiving underwater sound in modern cetaceans. They have dorsal orbits (eye sockets facing up), which are similar to crocodiles. This eye placement helps submerged predators observe potential prey above the water. According to a 2009 study, the teeth of pakicetids also resemble the teeth of fossil whales, being less like a dog's incisors, and having serrated triangular teeth, which is another link to more modern cetaceans.It was initially thought that the ears of pakicetids were adapted for underwater hearing, but, as would be expected from the anatomy of the rest of this creature, the ears of pakicetids are specialized for hearing on land. However, pakicetids were able to listen underwater by using enhanced bone conduction, rather than depending on the tympanic membrane like <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammals.</b> This method of hearing did not give directional hearing underwater.|$|E

40|$|Aleutian Islands and Alaska Peninsula {{residents}} have selectively introduced land mammals to their primarily marine based economy {{over the past}} two centuries. This paper describes these many introductions, contexts, and the longer term roles of these cattle, sheep, reindeer, and <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> in discrete island settings and the regional food economy based upon interviews in ten communities and comprehensive household surveys in eight of these. Caribou are indigenous and traditionally hunted {{in other parts of the}} state but are legally “invasive” in island contexts now managed by the federal government. Access to land and natural resources by Alaska Natives and rural peoples is regulated by state and federal agencies, but Aleutian {{residents have}} shaped their environment and engineered food sources to support their communities.

40|$|Humans hunt {{or raise}} {{a wide variety}} of animals for meat, which vary from free-range to intensively reared. These animals form a {{valuable}} part of human nutrition. Their tissues, including the fat, contain vitamin and other essential nutrients necessary for health. However, animal fat from ruminants and <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> is usually regarded as saturated. The purpose of this review is partly to examine the basis for the saturated fat hypothesis of cardiovascular disease given more recent research, to examine the human health effects of animal fats, and partly to draw into one place the diverse knowledge about animal fat and the effects of fat on metabolism. Mechanistic understanding of the initiation of the fatty streak and atherosclerosis calls into question the avoidance of ruminant or porcine fat. Due to high levels of oleic acid, a low n- 6 :n- 3 fatty acid ratio in some groups, and the presence of specific micronutrients including vitamins and essential fatty acids, animal fats are of benefit in human nutrition. Animal fats can be obtained in minimally processed form making them a convenient source of energy and micronutrients...|$|E
40|$|Humans, {{like all}} organisms, {{are subject to}} {{fundamental}} biophysical laws. Van Valen predicted that, because of zero-sum dynamics, all populations of all species in a given environment flux {{the same amount of}} energy on average. Damuth's 'energetic equivalence rule' supported Van Valen's conjecture by showing a trade off between few big animals per area with high individual metabolic rates compared to abundant small species with low energy requirements. We use established metabolic scaling theory to compare variation in densities and individual energy use in human societies to <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammals.</b> We show that hunter-gatherers occurred at lower densities than a mammal of our size. Most modern humans, in contrast, concentrate in large cities at densities that are up to four orders of magnitude greater than hunter-gatherers yet cities consume up to two orders of magnitude greater energy per capita. Today, cities across the globe flux greater energy than net primary productivity on a per area basis. This is possible through enormous fluxes of energy and materials across urban boundaries to sustain hyper-dense, modern humans. The metabolic rift with nature created by hyper-dense cities supported by fossil fuel energy poses formidable challenges for establishing a sustainable relationship on a rapidly urbanizing, yet finite planet...|$|E

6000|$|Of the {{existence}} of truly indigenous <b>land</b> <b>mammals</b> in New Zealand there is at present no positive evidence, {{but there is some}} reason to believe that one if not two species may be found there. The Maoris say that before Europeans came to their country a forest-rat abounded and was largely used for food. They believe that their ancestors brought it with them when they first came to the country; but it has now become almost, if not quite, exterminated by the European brown rat. What this native animal was is still somewhat doubtful. Several specimens have been caught at different times which have been declared by the natives to be the true Kiore Maori--as they term it, but these have usually proved on examination to be either the European black rat or some of the native Australian rats which now {475} often find their way on board ships. But within the last few years many skulls of a rat have been obtained from the old Maori cooking-places, and from a cave associated with moa bones; and Captain Hutton, who has examined them, states that they belong to a true Mus, but differ from the Mus rattus. This animal might have been on the islands when the Maoris first arrived, and in that case would be truly indigenous; while the Maori legend of their [...] "ancestors" [...] bringing the rat from their Polynesian home may be altogether a myth invented to account for its presence in the islands, because the only <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammal</b> which they knew--the dog--was certainly so brought. The question can only be settled by the discovery of remains of a rat in some deposit of an age decidedly anterior to the first arrival of the Maori race in New Zealand.[118] ...|$|R
500|$|Different {{from all}} <b>other</b> large <b>land</b> <b>mammals,</b> hippos are of semiaquatic habits, {{spending}} {{the day in}} lakes and rivers.

Hippo mostly live in freshwater habitats, however populations in West Africa mostly inhabit estuarine waters and may even be found at sea. With the exception of eating, most of hippopotamuses' lives – from fighting with other hippos, mating, to parturition – occurs in the water.

5000|$|Despite {{their close}} genetic {{relationship}} {{and the ability}} to inter-breed, {{there are a number of}} diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs. Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains. The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs. Dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive [...] "stop" [...] between forehead and nose. The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them. [...] Most dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year. So-called primitive dogs such as Dingoes and Basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle. Dogs generally have brown eyes and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes. The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather. The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>mammal.</b> For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a 6 in in the Chihuahua to 3.3 ft in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called [...] "blue") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" [...] or [...] "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed their coat.|$|R
50|$|Virginia opossums {{can vary}} {{considerably}} in size, with larger specimens found {{to the north}} of the opossum's range and smaller specimens in the tropics. They measure 13-37 in (35-94 cm) long from their snout to the base of the tail, with the tail adding another 8.5-19 in (21.6-47 cm). Weight for males ranges from 1.7 to 14 lb (0.8-6.4 kg) and for females from 11 ounces to 8.2 lb (0.3-3.7 kg). They are one of the world's most variably sized mammals, since a large male from northern North America weighs about 20 times as much as a small female from the tropics. Their coats are a dull grayish brown, other than on their faces, which are white. Opossums have long, hairless, prehensile tails, which can be used to grab branches and carry small objects.
