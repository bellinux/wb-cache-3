Two elements u and v of a vector space with bilinear form B are orthogonal when B(u,v) = 0. When the bilinear form corresponds to a pseudo-Euclidean space, there are non-perpendicular vectors that are hyperbolic-orthogonal.

The spherical harmonics are a complete set of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>functions</b> on the sphere, and thus may be used to represent functions defined {{on the surface of}} a sphere, just as circular functions (sines and cosines) are used to represent functions on a circle via Fourier series. Like the sines and cosines in Fourier series, the spherical harmonics may be organized by (spatial) angular frequency, as seen in the rows of functions in the illustration on the right. Further, spherical harmonics are basis functions for SO(3), the group of rotations in three dimensions, and thus {{play a central role in}} the group theoretic discussion of SO(3).|$|E
2500|$|The {{first proof}} of the theorem was given by Carlo Severini in 1910: he used the result as a tool in his {{research}} on series of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>functions.</b> His work remained apparently unnoticed outside Italy, {{probably due to the}} fact that it is written in Italian, appeared in a scientific journal with limited diffusion and was considered only as a means to obtain other theorems. A year later Dmitri Egorov published his independently proved results, and the theorem became widely known under his name: however, it is not uncommon to find references to this theorem as the Severini–Egoroff theorem or Severini–Egorov Theorem. The first mathematicians to prove independently the theorem in the nowadays common abstract measure space setting were , and in : an earlier generalization is due to Nikolai Luzin, who succeeded in slightly relaxing the requirement of finiteness of measure of the domain of convergence of the pointwise converging functions in the ample paper [...] Further generalizations were given much later by Pavel Korovkin, in the paper , and by Gabriel Mokobodzki in the paper [...]|$|E

40|$|Vegetation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the energy exchange of the land surface, biogeochemical cycles, and hydrological cycles. MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) is considered as a quantitative indicator for examining dynamic vegetation changes. This paper applied a new method of integrated empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> (EOF) and temporal unmixing analysis (TUA) to detect the vegetation decreasing cover in Jiangsu Province of China. The empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> (EOF) statistical results provide vegetation decreasing/increasing trend as prior information for temporal unmixing analysis. Temporal unmixing analysis (TUA) results could reveal the dominant spatial distribution of decreasing vegetation. The results showed that decreasing vegetation areas in Jiangsu are distributed in the suburbs and newly constructed areas. For validation, the vegetation’s decreasing cover is revealed by linear spectral mixture from Landsat data in three selected cities. Vegetation decreasing areas pixels are also calculated from land use maps in 2000 and 2010. The accuracy of integrated empirical <b>orthogonal</b> <b>function</b> and temporal unmixing analysis method is about 83. 14 %.
