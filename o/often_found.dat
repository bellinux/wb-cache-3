5|$|Many modern insect genera {{developed}} during the Cenozoic. Insects from this period on are <b>often</b> <b>found</b> preserved in amber, often in perfect condition.

5|$|Some true fungi specialise in the {{colonisation}} of the Myxogastriae: {{almost all}} of these are species of sac fungi. The most common such fungus is Verticillium rexianummainly species from Comatricha or Stemonitis. Gliocladium album and Sesquicillium microsporum are <b>often</b> <b>found</b> on Physaridae, while Polycephalomyces tomentosus is <b>often</b> <b>found</b> on certain species of Trichiidae. Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and bacteria can bind atmospheric nitrogen or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan. In a few cases, the plasmodia acquired salt tolerance or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E
