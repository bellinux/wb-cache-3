50|$|NCR: In 1982, NCR became {{involved}} in <b>open</b> <b>systems</b> <b>architecture,</b> starting with the UNIX-powered TOWER 16/32, and placed more emphasis on computers smaller than mainframes. NCR was acquired by AT&T Corporation in 1991. A restructuring of AT&T in 1996 led to its re-establishment on 1 January 1997 as a separate company. In 1998 NCR sold its computer hardware manufacturing assets to Solectron and ceased to produce general-purpose computer systems.|$|E

The ORS Office focuses on material (spacecraft, launch, range payloads) and non-material solutions (business model, acquisition, policy, industrial base, training, command and control, tasking, exploitation, processing, & dissemination, concept of operations), and collaborates with national and international agencies to leverage existing investments and develop long-term relationships.|$|E
50|$|Strong {{interest}} {{prompted the}} addition of German and French to the R&D News database, marking the first language addition to an English language environment. Migration onto a new <b>open</b> <b>systems</b> <b>architecture</b> (UNIX-like system, FULCRUM databases, Web and FTP servers) facilitated {{the introduction of a}} number of new features - a WWW service, and a user-friendly Windows interface, WatchCORDIS. These measures boosted the system's attractiveness to users. By the end of the year, CORDIS offered some 130 000 database records which encouraged 11 000 registered users to perform nearly 15 000 user sessions per month.|$|E
50|$|In 1982, NCR became {{involved}} in <b>open</b> <b>systems</b> <b>architecture.</b> Its first such system was the UNIX-powered TOWER 16/32, the success of which (approximately 100,000 were sold) established NCR as a pioneer in bringing industry standards and <b>open</b> <b>systems</b> <b>architecture</b> to the computer market. These 5000-series systems were based on Motorola 68k CPUs and supported NCR's proprietary transaction processing system TMX, which was mainly used by financial institutions. This product line also saw the first time NCR had offered its products through other than its own direct sales channels since the early 1900s. Formally added to its company structure in March 1984, NCR's OEM System's Division spearheaded the design, sales revenue and market awareness and acceptance of NCR's Tower family. Part of {{the cause of this}} success was the decision by NCR senior management to hire reseller industry veterans for key positions within the fledgling operation and have that unit work with, but not answerable to, NCR's traditional management structure. The industry shift from minicomputers brought personnel with minicomputer and reseller backgrounds such as the division head, Dan Kiegler (ex-Datapoint marketing), marketing manager and later Director of Field Sales, Dave Lang (ex-DEC reseller marketing director and salesperson) and other critical contributors at corporate levels; who then hired a complementary field sales organization primarily made up of proven people from DEC, Wang and other faltering minicomputer firms.|$|E

5000|$|The {{significance}} of these models to data interchange for manufacturing and materials flow was recognized early in the Air Force Integrated Computer Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) Project and {{gave rise to the}} IDEF formal modeling project. IDEF produced a specification for a formal functional modeling approach (IDEF0) and an information modeling language (IDEF1). The more recent [...] "Product Data Exchange Specification" [...] (PDES) project in the U.S., the related ISO Standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP) and the Computer Integrated Manufacture <b>Open</b> <b>Systems</b> <b>Architecture</b> (CIMOSA) ISO87 project in the European Economic Community have whole heartedly accepted the notion that useful data sharing is not possible without formal semantic data models of the context the data describes.|$|E

As of 2007 {{it was one}} of the world's most advanced net-centric systems. The system provides fully automatic as well as Human-in-the-Loop options at every stage of battle operation management. It is also capable of interoperability with other theater missile defense systems and C3I systems. Notably Link 16, TADIL-J, communications were being altered to allow interoperability with Patriot fire control units. Assigned targets can be handed over to the Patriot's AN/MPQ-53 fire control radar. Tests carried out by the U.S and Israel have successfully linked the Arrow with both U.S and Israeli versions of the Patriot.|$|E
50|$|The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile has {{its roots}} in a Technology Demonstration Programme (TDP), jointly funded by MBDA and the Ministry of Defence as part of the United Kingdom's Future Local Area Air Defence System (FLAADS). Phase 1 of the TDP worked on {{technologies}} for soft vertical launch, the low-cost active radar seeker, a dual-band two-way datalink and a programmable <b>open</b> <b>systems</b> <b>architecture.</b> Phase 2 began in 2008 and covered the manufacture of flight-worthy subsystems, mid-course guidance firings and captive airborne seeker trials on a Qinetiq Andover experimental aircraft. The Soft Vertical Launch was proven over a series of trials, culminating in a successful truck launch in May 2011. The MoD decision on the business case for the naval variant was scheduled for 2010. After publishing the Strategic Defence and Security Review in October 2010, the business case was approved in April 2011.|$|E

A development team, through the <b>Open</b> <b>System</b> <b>Architecture</b> for Condition-Based Maintenance (OSA-CBM) program, has addressed a framework {{for the next generation}} of machinery monitoring and diagnostic systems. This framework employs an <b>open</b> <b>system</b> <b>architecture</b> that uses a distributed software model approach to facilitate the integration and interchangeability between of a variety of hardware and software components. OSA-CBM is striving to build a de-facto standard to encompass the entire range of functions from data collection through the recommendation of specific maintenance actions. The potential benefits of a robust non-proprietary standard include improved ease of upgrading for system components, a broader supplier community, more rapid technology development, and reduced cost to end users.
