He steals Bernard's cup and, with a lighter borrowed from Beach, proceeds to burn away the wine to reveal a mysterious liquid at the bottom.

5|$|On December 8, 1972, United Airlines Flight 553, a Boeing 737-200, {{crashed into}} a {{residential}} area outside Midway during landing. The crash of the 737-200 killed 43 of the 61 <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> <b>and</b> two on the ground. One of the victims on the plane was Dorothy Hunt, the wife of Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt. She was carrying $10,000 in cash. James McCord alleged that she supplied the Watergate defendants with money for legal expenses.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between firm performance <b>and</b> women <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> top management positions {{in a sample of}} large Spanish firms in the period 2000 - 2004. The results of the study indicate that the percentage of women <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> top management teams is much lower in industrial and technological sectors than in services. The participation of women is greater in industries that have greater percentages of women in the workforce. The relationship between women participation <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> firm performance depend on the measure of female representation and the measure of firm performance. The variation of firm performance in the period 2000 - 2004 does not explain the variation of female representation <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> top management during that period...|$|R

Thor pulls the serpent <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> <b>and</b> violently slams him in the head with his hammer.

5|$|First-run Lassie was {{televised}} September 12, 1954 to March 24, 1973 {{with its}} first 17 seasons airing on CBS Sundays at 7:00p.m. EST. In 1971, {{in order to}} promote community-related programming among local affiliates, the Federal Communications Commission moved primetime Sundays to 8:00 P.M. EST with the institution of the Prime Time Access Rule. CBS executives felt Lassie would not be well received in a time slot other than its traditional 7:00p.m. slot, and, with the network's other family programs set, the show was canceled. (Lassie was among several shows that CBS canceled during this time period as part of a change in its target demographics.) Lassie then entered first-run syndication with Jack Wrather and Campbell's Soup still <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> <b>and</b> remained on the air for another two years with its final episode airing in March 1973. All totaled, 591 episodes were produced.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{was criticized}} {{severely}} {{by the international}} press for lax security measures in Frankfurt Airport that allowed Demeke to smuggle a pistol <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> <b>and</b> for allowing the hijacked aircraft to leave after refueling in Hannover. Frankfurt Airport, the busiest airport in Europe at the time, had recently come under fire after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, when it had been alleged that the explosives had been loaded in Frankfurt. Since the 1988 bombing, the Frankfurt airport had performed numerous security reviews and implemented more stringent security procedures.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine whether}} the {{representation}} of women <b>on</b> the <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> the audit committees {{is associated with a}} reduction in earnings management. We also observe if family ownership moderates the relationship between women <b>on</b> <b>boards</b> (<b>and</b> audit committees) and earnings management. Examining Bursa Malaysia listed firms in 2008, we show that the presence of women <b>on</b> the <b>boards</b> <b>and</b> audit committees would restrict earnings management. This is especially so for non-family-owned firms, but for family-owned firms such evidence was not found. This suggests that women outperform men in the accounting oversight role when control from family members is minimal...|$|R

5|$|Historians have {{questioned}} the competence of the senior Allied officers. Muirhead-Gould had been hosting a dinner party {{on the night of}} the attack, and one of the main guests was the senior United States Navy officer in Sydney Harbour, Captain Howard Bode of USS Chicago. Both officers were sceptical that any attack was taking place. Muirhead-Gould arrived aboard HMAS Lolita at approximately midnight, an action he described as attempting to learn about the situation. But members of Lolitas crew later recounted that when Muirhead-Gould came aboard he immediately chastised the patrol boat's skipper and crew, and quickly dismissed their report. Junior officers on Chicago provided similar descriptions of Bode's return <b>on</b> <b>board,</b> <b>and</b> members of both crews later claimed that Muirhead-Gould and Bode were intoxicated. It was only after the destruction of HMAS Kuttabul that both officers began to take the attack seriously.|$|E

5|$|Other {{theories}} {{of foul play}} have suggested an attack by Riffian pirates, who were active {{off the coast of}} Morocco in the 1870s. Charles Edey Fay, in his 1942 account, observes that pirates would have looted the ship, yet the personal possessions of captain and crew, some of significant value, were left undisturbed. In 1925, the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs, in a fit of a religious mania, had slaughtered all <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> then killed himself. In a later edition of his book Lockhart, who had by then spoken to Briggs's descendants, apologized and withdrew this theory.|$|E

They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to be crushed. Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> resumed preparations for Nansen's journey.
