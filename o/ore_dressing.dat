5|$|Although the {{proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce fell steadily, the mining boom {{of the first half}} of the 19thcentury took the total number to between 4,000 and 14,400 by the 1840s. The 1841 Census (the first full census of England) shows 3,250 women working in the mines, but the mine returns of the same year show over 5,000 women in the tin, lead and copper mines of Cornwall and West Devon. Increased mechanisation of the <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to the harsh working conditions of the mines meant that {{the proportion}} of bal maidens in the workforce continued to fall, and it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20% of mine workers were female. By the 1861 census, coinciding with the peak of the Cornish mining industry, a minimum of 6,000 women were working in mining in Cornwall, at least 2,500 of whom worked within a five-mile radius of Camborne. Although employed primarily in copper and tin mines, bal maidens also worked in lead, zinc, manganese, iron, antimony, wolfram, and uranium mines, and in slate and china clay quarries.|$|E
5|$|Women {{typically}} {{began working}} at the mines at around the age of 10 or 11, {{although there are some}} cases of girls starting work at as young as six, and in areas such as Camborne with a high demand for workers it was not unusual for girls to start work at age seven or eight. (Charles Foster Barham's enquiry of 1841 found an average age for starting work of 12.) Until the 1870s Cornwall was largely unaffected by legislation which limited child labour in mines elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and the typical ages of bal maidens remained virtually unchanged between the 1841 census and the 1871 census. Women would typically remain at the mine until they married; while this generally meant that they stopped working at between the ages of 19 and 24, it was not unusual for unmarried women and widows to continue working into their 60s and 70s; and a 93-year-old bal maiden was recorded in the 1891 census. A typical working day would last from 7.00am to 5.00pm in summer and from dawn to dusk in winter, (<b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> by candle-light was not cost effective) with a lunch break of either half an hour or an hour at noon. Lunch typically consisted of pasties, hoggans (hard pasties made with unleavened barley flour and filled with pork, potato or dried fruit) or fish eaten cold or warmed in ovens attached to the mine's furnaces, along with mugwort or pennyroyal tea, and it was not usual even for workers who lived near their workplace to go home for meals. Although still not paid on a piece-rate basis, each bal maiden would be expected to meet a daily quota to earn her pay; some mines operated on the basis that once the quota had been met the bal maidens were allowed to go home, meaning the working day could finish up to two hours early. Although at a few tin mines at which water-powered machinery was in continuous operation bal maidens would work seven days a week, {{in the vast majority of}} the industry they were not expected to work on Sundays. As well as the religious holidays observed in the rest of the United Kingdom, Cornish miners also celebrated St Piran's Day (5March) and Chewidden Thursday (the Thursday before Christmas), purportedly the day on which St Piran rediscovered tin-smelting. Other than religious holidays and parish feast days, Cornish miners had no holidays until labour reforms in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
25|$|Cape Cornwall Mine was a tin mine on Cape Cornwall, a cape at {{the western}} tip of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.

25|$|Completion of the Low Horse Level in the 1840s {{meant that}} new <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> {{facilities}} were needed {{at a lower}} level than at the old High Mill. A new Low Mill was built near the smelt mill, with a self-acting incline to lower wagons of ore to the new mill. There it was crushed, washed, and the concentrated ore was delivered to the smelt mill. Leats from Glenridding Beck brought a plentiful supply of water to operate the machinery at the mill. Increased ore production in the 1840s also meant that the smelting capacity had to be increased. One reverberatory furnace {{seems to have been}} installed in 1844, with more in 1851. These could process much larger amounts of lead ore, but were expensive to run, consuming large amounts to coal, and needing frequent replacements of their fireclay brick linings. They were soon abandoned and a number of the simpler ore hearths were installed in 1855. Since these produced greater quantities of lead dust and fumes, the flue was extended {{at the same time to}} the new chimney.|$|E
500|$|In around 1865, {{faced with}} {{increased}} competition from overseas mines {{and with the}} most productive copper mines becoming exhausted, the Cornish mining industry went into terminal decline. By 1880 the level of Cornish copper production was at around {{a quarter of its}} 1860 level. As production fell, the numbers of employees in the mines fell with it. Much of the copper industry collapsed, causing a movement within Cornwall from the copper to the tin mining. While some bal maidens continued to work at the mines, many worked in tin streaming [...] in the rivers and streams flowing from the tin mining areas. In those copper mines which survived, [...] investment in new machinery virtually ceased, so employment of some bal maidens continued. The tin industry, which was still economically successful, began to invest in new machinery to replace manual <b>ore</b> <b>dressing,</b> drastically reducing the number of female workers. By 1870 the number of bal maidens in work had fallen by around 50%.|$|E

5|$|Little {{can be seen}} of {{the levels}} now for the entrances were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up the hillside, a self-acting incline to lower <b>ore</b> to the <b>dressing</b> floor, and the old winding-drum house.

2500|$|In 1864 {{the mine}} was reopened under the {{ownership}} of St Just Consolidated Mines, and an engine house with an elaborate chimney was built near {{the peak of the}} cape to serve the boiler of the mine's whim (a machine for raising ore to the surface). The engine house and its associated boiler house were built near the foot of the hill and connected to the chimney stack by a long stone flue. With surrounding steep cliffs limiting the space for <b>ore</b> <b>dressing,</b> [...] "spalling braces" [...] (platforms attached to the shaft) were fitted to house spalling (breaking the ore into chunks for sorting) operations. In 1869 St Just Consolidated Mines abandoned the Cape Cornwall Mine, although it continued to operate independently until 1875.|$|E
2500|$|The {{high level}} of {{production}} proved to be unsustainable. Development work of new reserves could not {{keep pace with the}} production of 6,000 tons of crude ore per month. In January 1943 production had to be scaled down, and the <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> mill reduced to a single shift per day. But a bigger blow was to follow. In May 1943, as one of the shafts was being deepened, the miners encountered bands of soft, black shale. The Ministry sent in a team of Canadian Engineers with diamond drilling equipment, and this confirmed that the Skiddaw Group of rocks lay at about [...] below the main entrance to the mine (The Lucy Level), not at [...] as the geologists had predicted.

50|$|Most of {{the shallow}} {{workings}} were exhausted in the 1820s and 1830s.Steam-powered pumps {{were used to}} keep the mines dry as the shafts were sunk deeper.By the 1850s the mines employed several thousand men, women and children.The setts that became the Basset Mines were most profitable in the 1850s and 1860s, extracting copper.Production was cut {{back in the late}} 1860s when the price of copper declined, and some mines went below the copper lodes for tin.The tin deposits were deeper and the <b>ores</b> harder to <b>dress</b> than copper, and profits were lower.The Great Flat Lode was reached around 1872-74.This is a large tin deposit to the south of Carn Brea that is tilted at an average angle of about 32 degrees.Most lodes tilt at 60 degrees or more so the lode is relatively flat, hence the name.|$|R
25|$|Once the ore {{had been}} brought out of the mine {{it had to be}} {{separated}} from rock and other vein minerals (gangue). The surface survey found evidence of an early dressing floor beside the marsh on the valley floor, at 550metres AOD, where a little stream provided a small source of water. In that area were found many pieces of very weathered galena. It also found the washings had later been moved to another area beside the marsh, which could be supplied with a more reliable water supply. A leat had collected water from the original stream, 36metres above the old dressing floor, and conducted it to some small storage ponds further east, which could collect from other sources as well. However the site of the new washing floor had been destroyed by a later mine building. After the <b>ore</b> had been <b>dressed</b> it was taken by packhorses over Sticks Pass to a smelter at Stoneycroft in the Newlands Valley, near Keswick.|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of flotation tailings is today {{a subject of}} interest in mineral processing {{because of the potential}} of wasted materials as an actual mineral resource and because of environmental reasons. Decantation ponds are found at almost every mine in the world. They are large earth fill dams containing the residue of the milling process to extract metals from mined ores. Traditional wet tailings disposal has been problematic due to the risk of ground water contamination and the difficulty in rehabilitating storage sites. Tailings dams are at risk of failure due to leakage, instability, liquefaction, and poor design. In the last few years the use of paste technology in the disposal of mine tailings is increasingly studied as an option to conventional tailings dams. The Lucky Invest Concentrator is located in the Eastern Rhodopes Mountain of Bulgaria. Since 1959 lead-zinc <b>ores</b> are <b>dressed.</b> Finally, during the flotation cycle lead and zinc concentrates are produced. The final technological processing waste precipitates in tailing pond. Research and development program has started to established opportunities to obtain dry deposit of the ore processing residue and analyses the feature of new tailing disposal method. The tailings particle size distributions and chemical compositions were determined. The data from laboratory and pilot scale tests clearly illustrate that there are the possibilities to obtaine lead-zinc dewatered tailings. The experimental results show that new cyclone modifications have a potential in dewatering technology of flotation tailings. It appears that dewatering cyclones can be an approach on new tailings pond elimination technology...|$|R
25|$|During {{his years}} in Cornwall, Lewis credits Kranich with {{introducing}} useful innovations at Sir Francis Godolphin's tin works, among them the hydraulic stamp mill and improved methods of <b>dressing</b> <b>ore,</b> {{as well as the}} use of charcoal as fuel for smelting instead of the traditional peat. However Lewis also allows for the possibility that these innovations should be credited to Daniel Hoechstetter. Richard Carew, on the other hand, mentions the 'rubble of certain mines and remains of a fining house' which demonstrate Kranich's 'vain endeavour in seeking of silver ore' in Cornwall. After Kranich had left Cornwall, a 16-page memorandum was prepared by William Carnsew 'relating to silver and lead mines in Cornwall and activities of Dr Burchard Kranich' in response to a request for information about the potential profitability of the mines from Piers Edgcumbe of Cotehele. Among the matters covered in the memorandum were 'the many disputes and arguments Kranich had with his sponsors'. According to Wallis, Kranich's mining enterprises in the West Country were ultimately a failure, and he moved to London.|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} of industrial cities is usually exposed to extreme impacts of anthropogenic contamination originating from fossil fuel combustion, road traffic, industry, <b>ore</b> mining and <b>dressing.</b> The degradation potential of contaminated soils greatly {{depends on the}} diversity and function of the microbial ecosystem in the given locality; in individual communities, {{it is possible to}} diagnose identical as well as different characteristics of specific bacterial strains. From the real soil samples within the City of Ostrava, namely localities strained by industrial activities, new strains were isolated and compared on the grounds of biochemical identification results using a modern system of BIOLOG MicroStation. Basic characteristics of the new isolated strains are stated, which document their phenotypic diversity not only on the level of the Pseudomonas genus but also on the level of the individual species. The differences in the physiological parameters of isolated strains are attributed to the capacities of the soil microorganisms to adapt to the polluted environment conditions. The paper offers an overview of the significance of phenotypic characterization for identification of microorganisms and their correct taxonomic classification...|$|R

40|$|Ball mill {{is vital}} {{equipment}} in industries viz. mineral <b>dressing,</b> <b>ore</b> processing, fertilizers, food and diary, pharmaceuticals and many others. The present work involves a meticulous {{study of the}} effect of the various parameters on the performance of a ball mill. The parameters studied in this work are particle size, number of balls, time of grinding, particle density, and speed of the ball mill (rpm). An attempt has been made to develop correlation for the performance of the ball mill by correlating these variables with the grindability on the basis of dimensional analysis approach as well as fractional factorial design method. It is observed that these parameters influence the performance of the ball mill significantly. The performance of a ball mill is measured with reference to the quantity of undersize or fines (amount of grounded material passing through 120 mesh screen) per revolution of the mill, collected for variation of each of the individual parameters. Finally the calculated values of the fines in terms of the grindability of the mill obtained through the correlations by both the above-mentioned methods are compared with the experimental values thereby justifying the analysis with reasonable deviations. Thus the developed correlations can be applied to know the grindability of the Ball Mill over a wide range of parameters...|$|R

50|$|After 1850 {{the small}} and {{scattered}} stamp mills and ore washeries were replaced by central <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plants. The basic steps - coarse crushing - manual separation - sieving - jigging - fine crushing - table work and slime washing - remained much the same. The process was increasingly mechanised and perfected. In 1905 the most modern <b>ore</b> <b>dressing</b> plant in Germany went into operation in Clausthal using the gravity dressing process. It was located near the Ottiliae Shaft {{on the site of}} the old central ore processing plant of 1872. It employed up to 650 workers and processed all ore from the Clausthal and Zellerfeld pits until 1930. A change occurred in the 1920s with the introduction of the froth floatation in Bad Grund and later in Lautenthal. This technique enabled the required production of metal concentration without manual pre-sorting and a much higher yield. The flotation process was steadily developed during the 20th century and was used right up to the end of vein mining in the Upper Harz in 1992.|$|E
50|$|Failure {{of mining}} {{companies}} to adopt new treatment methods contributed to higher realisation costs.
