40|$|The South African law {{and legal}} system {{can and should}} be a {{mechanism}} through which the lives of all resident there are enhanced through the safeguarding and advancement of the fundamental rights guaranteed in its Bill of Rights. This thesis focuses on ‘legal aid’ service delivery (broadly speaking) for the indigent in a particular locality by and through registered law clinics, <b>other</b> <b>legal</b> <b>services</b> providers and via other means in civil rather than criminal matters. In this regard there continue to be very substantial differences between the proper access to civil justice requirements of constitutional South Africa and the actual situation which has existed since the dawn of South Africa’s democratic era which continues unabated. Justice and equality are promised to all in South Africa, yet due to gaps in the ‘net’ of free legal services provided to the indigent, the ability to pay for legal services in civil cases often remains the deciding factor. This study examines the constitutional obligations which, it is argued, apply to the provision of free civil legal services to impoverished people in South Africa. This research considers the law as a vector for necessary positive transformation in the daily lives of those resident in South Africa, which is considered within the country’s woefully unequal socio-economic situation. It builds upon existing research and court authority which show the function of access to justice as an important promoter of the type of society envisaged by the South African Constitution - one where the enjoyment of justice and equality are within the reach of all. However, at present, if one can afford the expensive services of lawyers in civil matters, then access to justice is far more readily attainable. But the opposite is true where someone is denied meaningful access to justice through a lack of legal representation because they cannot afford prohibitively high lawyers’ costs (and disbursements) and no adequate alternatives are provided for by the state or through other means. In these circumstances a vulnerable, unrepresented litigant in a civil case faces a greatly increased likelihood of being denied proper access to a daunting and intricate legal system. There are two main reasons for concentrating on free legal services to the ‘needy’ in civil rather than criminal matters. In the first place, all available statistics show that a huge proportion of legal aid services in South Africa has been and continues to be dispensed in criminal rather than civil cases. Secondly, there has been minimal research or case authority in South Africa on legal aid and other free legal services for impoverished people in civil matters. This thesis examines the state of free civil legal service provision and the need for such assistance within the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, one of South Africa’s largest metropoles. This analysis includes an empirical study of the requests for free civil legal services in a particular year by qualifying potential clients in eThekwini {{and the degree to which}} free legal service providers are meeting or failing to meet those needs. The study considers the legal service provision in such matters by legal non-governmental organisations, state-supported legal service providers and the work of legal professionals in private practice acting pro bono. The thesis then proposes a model for eThekwini for coordinating (and concurrently improving) civil legal aid services, pro bono legal work and other forms of free legal assistance - like community service by senior law students and law graduates - in response to the particular needs and circumstances facing the indigent there. When referring to the concept of ‘legal aid services’, this research concentrates on legal advice, assistance and representation to indigent clients. However, the promotion of legal rights awareness to such clients is often necessary to open their eyes to the possibility of legal avenues, where appropriate, to improve their situations. Therefore this study also considers - albeit to a lesser degree - this more indirect form of legal assistance through the dissemination of legal knowledge in an accessible form to clients who would qualify for legal aid assistance. The work concludes by briefly postulating the likely appropriateness (and/or limitations) of the aforementioned ‘free civil legal service model for the indigent’ beyond eThekwini...|$|E
40|$|TORONTO, March 7, 2016 – Residents of the Jane-Finch {{community}} who are facing employment law issues {{are about to}} get a helping hand from the Community and Legal Aid Services Programme (CLASP) at York University’s Osgoode Hall Law School. CLASP – a free legal clinic at Osgoode that helps York University undergraduate students and low-income persons in Toronto, with priority given to Jane-Finch residents – will officially launch its new Employment Law Division one-year pilot project on Thursday, March 10, 2016 with a reception from 4 to 6 p. m. in the Goodmans LLP Junior Common Room (1017) at the Law School. The Employment Law Division will assist clients with employment agreements; employment insurance; employment standards; health and safety reprisals; human rights in the workplace; and wrongful dismissal. Employment lawyer Phanath Im will serve as the Review Counsel for the Employment Law Division. She will supervise Osgoode students who will represent clients in negotiations and mediations as well as in litigation at the Ontario Labour Relations Board, Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, Social Security Tribunal of Canada, and Small Claims Court in Toronto. In addition, the students will engage in community outreach and law reform initiatives and present public legal education sessions in the community about matters related to employment law. Im, who graduated from Osgoode in 2010, is a former CLASP Division Leader and former volunteer Senior Editor for Jane-Finch. com. The first Cambodian-Canadian to be called to the Ontario Bar, she worked at the Ontario Ministry of Labour prosecuting health and safety offences and representing the Director of Employment Standards in employment standards appeals. Later, she moved into private practice, where she worked with leading employment lawyers and represented both employers and employees {{on a wide range of}} employment law issues. “As a resident of Jane-Finch’s government-subsidized housing projects for over 20 years, I have a unique understanding of the issues facing the community and a personal interest in advocating for its residents,” Im said. “I will bring a balanced understanding of employment law issues gained from representing both employers and employees in legal disputes, and acting as a prosecutor and defence counsel. ” The addition of employment law complements the <b>other</b> <b>legal</b> <b>services</b> offered by CLASP that include administrative law (tenant rights, Ontario Disability Support Program appeals, Criminal Injuries Compensation Board applications, human rights), criminal law, immigration law and family law. Funding for CLASP’s Employment Law Division is being provided by Legal Aid Ontario, which announced last fall that it would increase the funding of each of Ontario’s seven student legal aid clinics by $ 100, 000 annually. “This funding has allowed CLASP to have a division devoted to employment law for the first time,” said Im, who has engaged in extensive consultations with community groups, residents and non-profit organizations in Toronto and the Jane-Finch community to identify recurring employment law issues and determine the best types of service the new Employment Law Division can offer. “CLASP’s Employment Law Division will respond to the needs in the Jane-Finch community in particular by increasing access to justice, and help law students gain invaluable experience in employment law and workers’ rights. ” CLASP is currently accepting a limited number of employment law cases, and will expand its intake starting on Tuesday, May 24, 2016.
