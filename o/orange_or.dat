Results indicated that FW and RW grapefruit (and FW and RW oranges) are not substitutes; however, RW tangerine is a substitute of FW tangerines. In addition, promoting FW grapefruit would not influence the demand for RW grapefruit and vice versa.

5|$|G. juniperina subsp. trinervis (R.Br.)

5|$|Lactarius deterrimus {{belongs to}} the section Deliciosi of the genus Lactarius. According to {{molecular}} phylogenetics studies, this section forms a definite phylogenetic group within the milk cap relatives. Deliciosi species mainly have an <b>orange</b> <b>or</b> reddish-coloured latex and taste mild to slightly bitter. They are strict mycorrhizal associates of conifers.

5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{mushrooms}} are edible. They {{have been used}} in traditional Chinese medicine to treat lumbago, numbed limbs, and as an antihemorrhagic. Bioactive compounds that have been identified from the fruit bodies include pulveravinA, pulveravinB, vulpinic acid, and pulverolide. Mushrooms are also used in mushroom dyeing to produce the colors yellow, gold, greenish yellow, <b>orange,</b> <b>or</b> olive, depending on the mordant used.|$|E

5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from winter to early summer and are red, <b>orange</b> <b>or</b> yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed.

5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast <b>orange</b> <b>or</b> yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus is {{classified}} in the section Dapetes of the genus Lactarius. This section, which also includes other popular edible species such as L.deliciosus, and the less popular L.deterrimus, is characterized by mushrooms with <b>orange</b> <b>or</b> red latex that often impart a greenish stain on the flesh and gills, an often sticky cap, and association with conifers.

5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when the Sun is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, <b>orange,</b> <b>or</b> magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
5|$|The {{likewise}} {{very common}} Lactarius deliciosus {{is similar in}} appearance. Lactarius deterrimus differs basically from the first because its flesh becomes reddish within 10minutes and in about 30minutes dark maroon, caused by the discolouration of the milk. The milk of L.deterrimus stays <b>orange</b> <b>or</b> becomes reddish within 30minutes. Also, the milk of the latter tastes mild, while the milk of the first distinctly bitter. The cap of L.deterrimus changes its colour in old age or if injured distinctly greenish and is common only under spruces, while L.deterrimus is native under pines.|$|E
5|$|This {{mushroom}} is edible {{but very}} peppery. The Italian chef Antonio Carluccio recommends only {{using it to}} add flavour to other mushrooms. It {{has been used as}} a condiment in many countries. The mushroom should be well-cooked before consumption to minimize the risk of gastric symptoms; the peppery taste is lost with cooking. In powdered form, it loses its peppery taste quickly. Some guidebooks classify C.piperatus as inedible. Fruit bodies can be used for mushroom dyeing; depending on the mordant used, yellow, <b>orange,</b> <b>or</b> greenish-brown dyes can be made.|$|E
