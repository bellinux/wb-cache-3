40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} on four sibling pairs affected by cystic fibrosis. Of each sibling pair, one was more <b>affected</b> than <b>the</b> other. The {{results show that the}} lymphoblastic response to the antigen Pseudomonas aeruginosa <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most <b>affected</b> patient was strongly reduced in comparison to <b>the</b> response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less <b>affected</b> one. <b>The</b> plasma from <b>the</b> most <b>affected</b> patient contains an inhibitory factor which reduces <b>the</b> lymphoblastic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less <b>affected</b> one. On <b>the</b> other hand, plasma fom <b>the</b> less <b>affected</b> patient improves <b>the</b> lymphoblastic response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most <b>affected</b> one (although not significantly). One notes a better lymphoblastic response when <b>the</b> most <b>affected</b> patient's lymphocytes are put in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less <b>affected</b> one's antigens and plasma.

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} characterised by loss of neurons and synapses in the {{cerebral}} cortex and certain subcortical regions. This loss results in gross atrophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, {{and parts of}} the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. Degeneration is also present in brainstem nuclei like the locus coeruleus. Studies using MRI and PET have documented reductions in the size of specific brain regions in people with AD as they progressed from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease, and in comparison with similar images from healthy older adults.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E

5|$|In {{adults and}} adolescents, {{hypothesized}} causes generally fall {{into one of}} either category: habit-induced, and trauma-induced. Habit-induced individuals generally have a history of bulimia nervosa or of intentional regurgitation (magicians and professional regurgitators, for example), which though initially self-induced, forms a subconscious habit that can continue to manifest itself outside the control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> individual. Trauma-induced individuals describe an emotional or physical injury (such as recent surgery, psychological distress, concussions, deaths in the family, etc.), which preceded the onset of rumination, often by several months.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E

40|$|It is shown, both deductively {{and with}} <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{empirical}} evidence provided by Libet, that consciousness is deprived of any decisional power.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{presenting}} sign is a coarse slow tremor {{of the hand}} at rest which disappears during voluntary movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> arm and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in only one hand, eventually affecting both hands as the disease progresses. Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz (cycles per second). A feature of tremor is pill-rolling, the tendency of the index finger and thumb to touch and perform together a circular movement. The term derives from the similarity between the movement of people with PD and the early pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{communication}} disruptions on Socotra made {{it difficult}} for relief workers to determine the needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>affected</b> residents. Due to the main port being damaged, residents built a makeshift pathway to assist relief distribution from a ship carrying 700tons of supplies from the United Arab Emirates. Relief distribution was also disrupted by the heavy damage to Socotra's infrastructure, including damaged roads and minimal power or fuel supply. After the storm, displaced residents stayed in public buildings or outside damaged houses. Due to the collective impacts of Chapala and Megh, various Persian Gulf countries sent 43planes with supplies to the island by 19November. The United Arab Emirates sent a ship and a plane, carrying 500tons of food, 10tons of blankets and tents, and 1,200barrels of food. The local Red Cross gave cooked meals and tarps to the island's residents. The International Organization for Migration provided 2,000shelter kits as well as a medical team to Socotra.|$|E
