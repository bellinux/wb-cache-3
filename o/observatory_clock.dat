5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the <b>observatory</b> <b>clock,</b> and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{observatory}} was a time service. The transits of stars through the meridian were observed and used to keep the <b>observatory</b> <b>clock</b> accurate. Accurate time was important for navigation, and mariners would bring ships' chronometers from the port of Leith up to Calton Hill for adjustment. In 1854 the time ball was installed on Nelson's Monument next to the observatory and visible from the port. This was controlled by electrical pulses from the <b>observatory</b> <b>clock.</b> A few years later the One O'Clock Gun on Edinburgh Castle was added. This was also controlled through an electrical wire, spanning the city from Calton Hill to the Castle. Today the time ball and One O' Clock Gun are tourist attractions.

50|$|In 1852 Charles Piazzi Smyth - second Astronomer Royal for Scotland - came up {{with the}} idea of {{building}} astronomical observatories on high mountains with good weather.

A time service was established in 1858. Timings of star transits were used to keep the <b>observatory</b> <b>clock</b> accurate. The clock was wired up to control the drop of a time ball on Nelson's Monument. This is visible from the port of Leith, thus providing accurate time for shipping.

50|$|Sidereal time is {{time by the}} stars. A sidereal {{rotation}} is {{the time}} it takes the Earth to make one revolution with respect to the stars, approximately 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds. For accurate astronomical work on land, it was usual to observe sidereal time rather than solar time to measure mean solar time, because the observations of 'fixed' stars could be measured and reduced more accurately than observations of the Sun (in spite of the need to make various small compensations, for refraction, aberration, precession, nutation and proper motion). It is well known that observations of the Sun pose substantial obstacles to the achievement of accuracy in measurement. In former times, before the distribution of accurate time signals, {{it was part of the}} routine work at any observatory to observe the sidereal times of meridian transit of selected 'clock stars' (of well-known position and movement), and to use these to correct <b>observatory</b> <b>clocks</b> running local mean sidereal time; but nowadays local sidereal time is usually generated by computer, based on time signals.|$|R

It {{was the first}} time ball in the United States, being placed into service in 1845, and the 12th in the world. Maury kept accurate time by the stars and planets. The time ball was dropped every day except Sunday precisely at the astronomically defined moment of Mean Solar Noon, enabling all ships and civilians to know the exact time. By the end of the American Civil War, the <b>Observatory's</b> <b>clocks</b> were linked via telegraph to ring the alarm bells in all of the Washington, D.C. firehouses three times a day, and by the early 1870s the Observatory's daily noon-time signal was being distributed nationwide via the Western Union Telegraph Company.

Early in the 20th century, the Arlington Time Signal broadcast this service to wireless receivers.|$|R

50|$|The {{station was}} started in 1923 by the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with a call sign of 9CC on an {{experimental}} basis until 1928. Regular daytime transmission began under the callsign of VE9OB in January 1929 on a wavelength of 40.8 metres (about 7.353 MHz). Continuous transmission at 90 metres began {{at the end of}} 1929, with other wavelengths being used experimentally. Time signals were generated from the <b>observatory's</b> own pendulum <b>clocks.</b> The transmitter oscillators were condenser-tuned and so frequency stability was not high until quartz crystal control was implemented in 1933. In 1938 the call was changed to CHU, operating on frequencies of 3.33, 7.335 and 14.670 MHz, at a transmitter power of only 10 W. The 1,000 Hz tone imposed on the carrier was derived from the quartz oscillator that determined transmit frequency, but the seconds pulses were still derived from the <b>observatory</b> pendulum <b>clocks.</b> The station automatically sent its call sign in Morse code once per hour, and pulses were coded to identify the time of day. Since the CHU power was not high enough to cover much of Canada, including survey parties working in the North, observatory time signals were also transmitted by a Department of Transport station with 2 kW power. In 1947 three new transmitters with 300 W power were installed for the three frequencies. In 1951, a Collins transmitter rated for 3 kW was put in service on 7.335 MHz.|$|R

Towneley had recognised that the second hand of pendulum clocks, using an anchor escapement, jerked backward due to recoil, causing inaccuracy.
