5|$|By 1900 Bolton was Lancashire's {{third largest}} {{engineering}} centre after Manchester and Oldham. About 9,000 men {{were employed in}} the industry, half of them working for Dobson and Barlow in Kay Street. The firm made textile machinery. Another engineering company Hick, Hargreaves & Co based at the Soho Foundry made Lancashire boilers and heavy machinery. Thomas Ryder and Son <b>of</b> <b>Turner</b> Bridge manufactured machine tools for the international motor industry. Wrought iron was produced for more than 100 years at Thomas Walmsley and Sons' Atlas Forge.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case <b>of</b> <b>Turner,</b> however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her off-screen image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Welles's {{daughter}} Beatrice Welles sued Turner Entertainment, {{claiming the}} Welles estate {{is the legal}} copyright holder of the film. She claimed that Welles's deal to terminate his contracts with RKO meant that Turner's copyright of the film was null and void. She also claimed that the estate of Orson Welles was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld. In 2007 she was allowed {{to proceed with the}} lawsuit, overturning the 2004 decision in favor <b>of</b> <b>Turner</b> Entertainment on the issue of video rights.|$|E

These had been commanded by SS-Standartenführer (SS-Colonel) Wilhelm Fuchs, who had overseen the shooting of many Serbian and Jewish males and others, mainly by Wehrmacht units, between August 1941 and the end of that year. Meyszner's deputy was SS-Standartenführer Emanuel Schäfer {{and the head of the}} Belgrade Gestapo was SS-Sturmbannführer (SS-Major) Bruno Sattler. The head of the Gestapo Jewish Section was SS-Untersturmführer (SS-Lieutenant) Fritz Stracke.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Winchester, on June 2, Steuart was {{involved}} in an unfortunate incident in which the 2nd Virginia Cavalry was mistakenly fired on by the 27th Virginia Infantry.

5|$|The station depot was {{replaced}} by a wooden one-story depot, referred to by locals as a shack, {{along the side of the}} tracks in downtown Turner. The new station itself lasted around the same amount of time that its predecessor station depot had; however, the widow of Edward Henry Harriman (d. September 9, 1909), a local railroad executive whose Arden estate was in the nearby hills, donated land in February 1910 in a different portion <b>of</b> <b>Turner</b> to build a brand new station to the east. The old one-story depot had a roof and structural supports that were aging and on the verge of collapsing to the ground.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To study {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>Turner's</b> syndrome in Denmark and {{to assess}} validity of prenatal diagnosis. DESIGN [...] Study of data on prenatal and postnatal Turner's syndrome in Danish Cytogenetic Central Register. SUBJECTS [...] All registered Turner's syndrome karyotypes (100 prenatal cases and 215 postnatal cases) during 1970 - 93. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Prevalence <b>of</b> <b>Turner's</b> syndrome karyotypes among prenatally tested fetuses and Turner's syndrome among liveborn infants. RESULTS [...] Among infant girls, prevalence <b>of</b> <b>Turner's</b> syndrome was 32 / 100, 000. Among female fetuses tested by amniocentesis, prevalence <b>of</b> <b>Turner's</b> syndrome karyotypes was 176 / 100, 000 (relative risk of syndrome, 6. 74 compared with prevalence among untested pregnancies). Among female fetuses tested by chorion villus sampling, prevalence of syndrome karyotypes was 392 / 100, 000 (relative risk, 16. 8). We excluded prenatal tests referred because of results of ultrasound scanning: among fetuses tested by amniocentesis revised relative risk was 5. 68, while revised relative risk among fetuses tested by chorion villus sampling was 13. 3. For 29 fetuses with prenatal diagnosis <b>of</b> possible <b>Turner's</b> syndrome, pregnancy was allowed to continue and 24 children were live born. Thirteen of these children were karyotyped postnatally, and diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>Turner's</b> syndrome had to be revised for eight, seven being normal girls and one boy. This gives tentative predictive value of amniocentesis in diagnosing <b>Turner's</b> syndrome <b>of</b> between 21 % and 67 %. There was no significant relation between mother's age and risk <b>of</b> <b>Turner's</b> syndrome. CONCLUSIONS [...] Discrepancy between prenatal and postnatal prevalence <b>of</b> <b>Turner's</b> syndrome challenges specificity of prenatal examination in diagnosing Turner's syndrome...|$|R

Artists include Beryl Cook whose {{paintings}} depict the culture of Plymouth and Robert Lenkiewicz, whose paintings investigated themes of vagrancy, sexual behaviour and suicide, {{lived in the}} city from the 1960s until his death in 2002. Illustrator and creator of children's series Mr Benn and King Rollo, David McKee, was born and brought up in South Devon and trained at Plymouth College of Art. Jazz musician John Surman, born in nearby Tavistock, has close connections to the area, evidenced by his 2012 album Saltash Bells. The avant garde prepared guitarist Keith Rowe was born in the city before establishing the jazz free improvisation band AMM in London in 1965 and MIMEO in 1997. The musician and film director Cosmo Jarvis has lived in several towns in South Devon and has filmed videos in and around Plymouth. In addition, actors Sir Donald Sinden and Judi Trott.

5|$|For Alderson {{the battle}} {{had been a}} failure: {{although}} his troops had held, he had found himself {{out of touch with}} the front line and unable to get accurate information about the situation. At one stage he had been commanding 33 battalions across several miles of front line with no central co-ordination and great confusion between his distant headquarters and the trenches. In addition to his personal failings however, the Ross rifles had proven almost useless in battle and some of Alderson's officer corps had performed poorly. In particular Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commander of the 3rd Brigade, and Turner's brigade-major, Colonel Garnet Hughes, the son of Sam Hughes, caused much havoc when on the second day of the battle, they unilaterally withdrew the 3rd Brigade from the front line, opening up a 4,000-yard gap through which the Germans threatened the entire Ypres Salient. Colonel John Carson however, who reported personally to Hughes, downplayed the difficulties and blamed the heavy casualties on Alderson's leadership, indicating that the division had only been saved from annihilation by the actions <b>of</b> <b>Turner</b> and Hughes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the growth}} of phylogenetic studies in the 1980s, Coelurus has usually {{been found to be}} a coelurosaurian of {{uncertain}} affinities, not fitting with the better-known clades of the Cretaceous. Along with several other generalized coelurosaurians such as the compsognathids, Ornitholestes, and Proceratosaurus, it has had multiple placements around the base of Coelurosauria. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut (2003) and Smith et al. (2007) found that Coelurus was more closely related to compsognathids than to other coelurosaurs. Oliver Rauhut (2003) proposed that Coeluridae was composed of Coelurus plus the compsognathids, but he and others have not since found the compsognathids to group with Coelurus. However, a work published by Phil Senter in 2007 following the description of Tanycolagreus found it and Coelurus to be closely related at the base of Tyrannosauroidea. Senter proposed that Coelurus and Tanycolagreus were the only coelurids and were actually tyrannosauroids, but the phylogenetic analysis <b>of</b> <b>Turner</b> et al. (2007b) found that Coelurus was a basal coelurosaur, although more derived than the tyrannosaurids. Zanno in 2010 recovered Coelurus as a basal maniraptoran. Coelurus is sometimes put into its own family, Coeluridae, although the membership of the family has not been stable.|$|E
