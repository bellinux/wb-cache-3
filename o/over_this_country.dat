25|$|George and Robert Stephenson were hugely {{influential}} {{figures in}} the development of the early railways. George developed Blücher, a locomotive working at Killingworth colliery in 1814, whilst Robert was instrumental in the design of Rocket, a revolutionary design that was the forerunner of modern locomotives. Both men were involved in planning and building railway lines, all <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and abroad.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1830s Ripley became {{increasingly}} engaged in [...] "Associationism", an early Fourierist socialist movement. In October 1840 he {{announced to the}} Transcendental Club his plan to form an Associationist community based on Fourier's Utopian plans. His goals were lofty. As he wrote, [...] "If wisely executed, {{it will be a}} light <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1840, George Ripley {{announced}} to the Transcendental Club that {{he was planning to}} form a Utopian community. Brook Farm, as it would be called, was based on the ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment was meant to serve as an example {{for the rest of the}} world, based on the principles of [...] "industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity". At Brook Farm, as in other communities, physical labor was perceived as a condition of mental well-being and health. Brook Farm was one of at least 80 communal experiments active in the United States throughout the 1840s, though it was the first to be secular. Ripley believed his experiment would be a model for the rest of society. He predicted: [...] "If wisely executed, it will be a light <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and this age. If not the sunrise, it will be the morning star." [...] As more interested people began to take part in planning, Ripley relocated meetings from his home to the West Street bookshop operated by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody.|$|E

2500|$|Albino bias is also alleged {{in modern}} times. For example, the 2003 Warner Bros movie The Matrix Reloaded {{featured}} two sociopathic characters with pale skin and white hair frequently interpreted to be albinos despite studio declarations {{that they are}} not. [...] Positive depictions of albinos in mass culture are rarer, though {{one example is the}} 1995 film Powder which depicts an exceptionally gifted albinistic youth and the cruelty he endures from [...] "normal" [...] people because of his differences. In recent years, the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation (NOAH) has spoken out against albino bias in the United States. [...] Albinistic actor Michael C. Bowman, of Me, Myself and Irene, has said, [...] "Kids all <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> are being affected in a very negative and harmful way because of the sloppiness and laziness of a writer in Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Referencing {{contemporary}} Western {{views on}} gender diversity, psychologist Diane Ehrensaft states: [...] "I am witnessing a shake-up {{in the mental}} health community as training sessions, workshops and conferences are proliferating all <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> and around the world, demanding that we reevaluate the binary system of gender, throw out the idea that gender nonconformity is a disorder, and establish new guidelines for facilitating the healthy development of gender-creative children." [...] Child-adolescent psychiatrist Edgardo Menvielle and psychotherapist Catherine Tuerck offer a support group for parents of gender non-conforming children at the Children's National Medical Centre in Washington D.C., aimed [...] "not at changing children's behaviours but at helping parents to be supportive". Other publications are beginning to call for a similar approach, to support parents to help their child become their authentic self. Community organizations established to support these families have begun to develop, such as Gender Spectrum, Trans Youth Family Allies, Gender Creative Kids Canada, and Trans Kids Purple Rainbow, as well as conferences such as Gender Odyssey Family Conference and summer camps such as Camp Aranu'tiq, all with the goal of supporting healthy families with gender non conforming or transgender children. Popular media accounts of parents assisting their children to live in their felt gender role have recently begun to emerge. These stories demonstrate that children and their parents face substantial stigma; however, Menvielle maintains that [...] "the therapist should focus on helping the child and family cope with intolerance and social prejudice, not on the child's behaviours, interests or choice of playmates". A host of new terms being applied to these children (such as gender variant), gender non-conforming, gender-creative and gender-independent) indicates that many are beginning to reject the label of Gender Identity Disorder in Children.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the same}} time as the {{sanctions}} against Russia, mainly caused by the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and Russia's response in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, Niinistö said that the focus should be on easing tensions and increasing understanding between Europe and Russia. He stated that Finland should serve as a broker between Russia and Europe. He also stated that “Russia understands that the conflict in Ukraine has generated debate in Finland <b>over</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> own security policy. It’s important that President Putin understands Finland’s position on NATO membership in this debate. Finland accepts that Russia is working to find a solution to the acute conflict in Ukraine, but it needs to do more.” ...|$|R

One of these clients was a man whom the spirits (if one may thus plurally describe the ingenious Manchester) were teaching how to contrive an improved railway car-wheel. It is coarse employment for a spirit, but it is higher and wholesomer activity than talking for ever about 'how happy we are.' ...|$|E
