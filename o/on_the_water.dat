5|$|Ecotourism has a {{large portion}} of the tourism market in Virginia Beach. There are many eco-adventures {{companies}} which offer tours on the land and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Coyotes, foxes and bobcats can be seen inland of Virginia Beach in False Cape State Park.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{not known}} with {{certainty}} how the spores are dispersed, they may disperse passively in the water, or a mature spore-containing fruit body may float <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface for dispersal. L.incarnatum is homothallic, a mode of reproduction commonly employed by marine fungi that may confer a competitive advantage in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Logging {{settlements}} {{were established}} {{on the northern}} shore of Lake Washington in the 1860s and 1870s, relying primarily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> for intercity transportation. The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was built along the lakefront in 1888, connecting Seattle to the new towns of Bothell and Kenmore. By the 1890s, unpaved logging trails had been completed along Lake Washington and the railroad, reaching as far northeast as Maltby.|$|E
5|$|Marine {{transport}} {{can also}} be impacted by volcanic ash. Ash fall will block air and oil filters and abrade any moving parts if ingested into engines. Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during ash fall. Vesiculated ash (pumice and scoria) will float <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> surface in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.|$|E

5|$|No threats {{came upon}} the embassy during the day, {{although}} truckloads of armed Somalis frequently drove by the embassy along Afghoy Road. Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy. A sniper and a spotter were positioned on the embassy's water tower (the highest structure in the compound) and came under fire; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> tower.|$|E
5|$|Scientific data <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{currents}} and food {{availability of the}} seamount was collected, as was information on the age and growth patterns of the corals themselves. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) filmed the cruise for their series, Planet Earth. A total of 70 hours of observations and 102 deep-sea animal and rock specimens were collected during the cruise. The expedition, which lasted from January 26 through February 4, made use if the MBARI's research vessel Western Flyer and the ROV Tiburon.|$|E
5|$|The Montana {{class would}} have used {{aircraft}} for reconnaissance and for gunnery spotting.

They would have landed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and taxied to {{the stern of the}} ship to be lifted by a crane back to the catapult.|$|E

5|$|The flame tree {{does not}} rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when {{the two sides of}} its long pods crack apart explosively on drying. The {{miniature}} cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the seeds on the surface of water. Mangroves often grow in water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree. These float <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take root.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E

5|$|The hen alone incubates {{the eggs}} for 22 to 24 {{days before they}} hatch.

The chicks fledge in 46 to 47 days after hatching, but stay with the female until she has {{completed}} moulting.|$|E
5|$|The {{steamship}} Rosetta sailed out of Bombay on June 7, carrying Kalākaua and {{his friends}} to Aden for an afternoon of shopping on June 14, and then onto the Red Sea. In a letter to Liliuokalani, Kalākaua described how his romantic boyhood dreams of sailing the Red Sea were dashed by the tedium of a week <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> with no land in sight. All was not lost, since he and the estimated 70 other passengers passed the week playing games and dancing.|$|E
5|$|Three {{of the six}} prion {{species have}} bills filled with lamellae, which act as filters to sift {{zooplankton}} from the water. Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected. This technique is often {{used in conjunction with}} a method known as hydroplaning where the bird dips its bill beneath the surface and propels itself forward with wings and feet as if walking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
