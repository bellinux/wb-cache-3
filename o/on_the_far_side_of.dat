5|$|The crater Nöther <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Moon {{is named}} after her.|$|E
5|$|Also {{named after}} him is the Champollion crater, a lunar crater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Grissom crater is one {{of several}} located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Moon named for Apollo astronauts, near a large crater (walled plain) named Apollo.|$|E

5|$|The southwestern {{corner of}} Gyeongju, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Taebaek range, drains into the Geumho River, which then {{flows into the}} Nakdong. A small area of the south, {{just west of the}} Dongdae range, drains into the Taehwa River, which flows into the Bay of Ulsan.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded to}} the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was {{deflected}} to Ronaldo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the goal, but it was deemed to have crossed the goal line first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the goal line, he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.|$|E
5|$|Zethus Crater is {{the largest}} (diameter about 40km) crater on and the only named surface feature of Jupiter's moon Thebe. There are several bright spots at the rim of this crater. It is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Thebe, facing away from Jupiter. It was {{discovered}} by the Galileo spacecraft. It is named for Zethus, the husband of the nymph Thebe in Greek mythology.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, little {{was known about}} <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> Moon. Librations of the Moon {{periodically}} allowed limited glimpses of features near <b>the</b> lunar limb <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b> These features, however, were seen from a low angle, hindering useful observation. (It proved difficult to distinguish a crater from a mountain range.) The remaining 82% of <b>the</b> surface <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> remained unknown, and its properties were subject to much speculation.|$|R
5|$|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly is a hotspot (volcanic complex) on the Moon. It is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Moon and {{was found}} by a gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} in 1998. It {{is an area of}} concentrated thorium, a radioactive element. Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago, but could have been as recent as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's far side.|$|E
5|$|The long, sandy Watergate Bay {{leads to}} St Columb Porth and Newquay. A rail link with through trains to London and the North of England on summer {{weekends}} {{has helped the}} town prosper as a seaside resort popular with surfers and clubbers. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the town, beyond Fistral Beach, lies the River Gannel. There are seasonal ferries to Crantock and a footbridge which is passable at low tide, otherwise there is a detour inland to use the road bridge.|$|E
5|$|With Norfolk and its navy yard in Portsmouth, the Confederacy {{controlled}} the southern side of Hampton Roads. To prevent Union warships from attacking the yard, the Confederates set up batteries at Sewell's Point and Craney Island, at the juncture of the Elizabeth River with the James. (See map.) The Union retained possession of Fort Monroe, at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula. They also held a small man-made island {{known as the}} Rip Raps, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the channel opposite Fort Monroe, and on this island they completed another fort, named Fort Wool. With Fort Monroe went control of the lower Peninsula as far as Newport News.|$|E
50|$|In the 2,000 Guineas, two {{distinct}} groups formed {{on either side}} of the straight track, with <b>the</b> faster ground <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b> Hawk Wing was in <b>the</b> group <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stands side, while <b>the</b> group <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side,</b> containing Rock Of Gibraltar, was travelling slightly further ahead. Hawk Wing beat his own group, and was rapidly closing in on Rock Of Gibraltar but lost by a neck.|$|R

5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{before the start of the}} {{services}} to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge. Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large steel ball of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E
5|$|In 1689, William III {{moved his}} {{residence}} to Kensington Palace <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Hyde Park {{and had a}} drive laid out across its southern edge which {{was known as the}} King's Private Road. The drive is still in existence as a wide straight gravelled carriage track leading west from Hyde Park Corner across the southern boundary of Hyde Park towards Kensington Palace and now known as Rotten Row, possibly a corruption of rotteran (to muster), Ratten Row (roundabout way), Route du roi, or rotten (the soft material with which the road is covered). It {{is believed to be the}} first road in London to be lit at night, which was done to deter highwaymen. In 1749, Horace Walpole was robbed while travelling through the park from Holland House. The row was used by the wealthy for horseback rides in the early 19th century.|$|E
50|$|Paracelsus is {{an impact}} crater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moon's <b>far</b> <b>side.</b> It is located {{to the east}} of the crater Barbier, and to the {{southwest}} of the large walled plain Vertregt. To the south is the Mare Ingenii, one of the few lunar maria <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R

5|$|Russell had {{not broken}} the French line and her {{opponent}} Témeraire {{got the better}} of her, knocking away a topmast and escaping to windward with Trajan and Eole. Russell then fired on several passing French ships before joining Leviathan in attacking the centre of the French line. Russell's boats also took the surrender of America, her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize (although later replaced by men from Royal Sovereign). Royal Sovereign lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as Terrible fell out of the line to windward and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship Montagne, which had escaped from Queen Charlotte, and it was Montagne which Royal Sovereign engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by Valiant, and beginning a long-range action.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{published}} a book of short stories, The Voice of the Dolphins (1961), in which he dealt with the moral and ethical {{issues raised by the}} Cold War and his own {{role in the development of}} atomic weapons. The title story described an international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

5|$|The first clash {{occurred}} at Awala on 23 July, when a platoon from 'B' Company, {{under the command}} of Captain Sam Templeton, having destroyed the footbridge over the Kumusi River, engaged the Japanese <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the river. The Australians were forced to withdraw, however, when hundreds of Japanese marines began crossing the river under a barrage of mortar and machine gun fire. They withdrew only a few miles, before Templeton set up a successful ambush for the advancing Japanese {{on the banks of the}} Gorari Creek. Nevertheless, they were forced back further towards the high ground at Oivi where they attempted to make a stand while Templeton tried to make contact with battalion headquarters and the rest of the battalion who were spread out further along the track, in order to get more reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the island. Finishing the game unlocks one {{of more than a dozen}} game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E
5|$|From the 18th century onwards, the {{interior}} of the castle was converted to provide accommodation for the Lord Wardens, almost all of which is now open to visitors. The castle is still entered through the ground floor of the gatehouse in the western bastion, which contains the original porter's lodge. In the middle of the castle is the keep, which originally housed the Servants' Hall and now a set of tea rooms. In the southern bastion is a set of rooms which are reached through the Hall Room, originally built as gunners' lodgings in the 18th century and converted into the entrance hall to the castle in the 1930s. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bastion are the Sackville and Willingdon Rooms, built in the 18th century; the Willingdon Room is now used as a museum for objects relating to William Pitt. The Lucas Room has been redecorated in a mid-19th century style and is used to present various items of Wellington memorabilia. The north and east bastions are filled in, providing solid foundations for the gun platforms above.|$|E
