40|$|Projections {{regarding}} the rapidly {{increasing number of}} Spanish speakers in the United States combined with the increasing incidence of bilingual aphasia have inspired researchers to collect normative data on confrontation naming tasks {{that can be used}} in bilingual patient populations. Studies that have reported normative data for English/Spanish bilingual speakers have found that relatively more English proficient bilingual speakers do not perform like English monolinguals and, therefore, bilingual performance has to be compared to bilingual norms and not to monolingual norms. Using An Object and Action Naming Battery, this study aims to 1) provide Spanish/English bilingual normative data for nouns and verbs, 2) evaluate performance in naming across three proficiency groups: English dominant, balanced, and Spanish dominant, 3) conduct an error analysis to examine the error patterns according to proficiency group. Consistent with the predictions, overall results showed overall accuracy was higher in English than Spanish, but three proficiency groups did emerge, with each proficiency group scoring better in the stronger language, and the balanced group scoring similarly across languages. The balanced group was the only group that benefited from the use of a composite score, which provides credit for all responses regardless of language. Overall, the predominant error type was no response/I <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know.</b> Within language errors occurred more often than crosslinguistic errors.

This kind of project has a strong social responsibility and impact on the city.

Consequently they <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> which are the best practices to follow and build-ing managers are not aware of the measures that must be adopted for efficient building operation.

Nowadays, while some people are still one or more tantalising steps removed from having the basic {{information}} they need on agriculture and rural development, {{there is a growing}} feeling that many others have, at first sight, perhaps too much. The emphasis is coming to lie on being able to select what is important from what is less important, and to manage it efficiently. Here, the complex skill of priority setting can help in raising the quality of agricultural information services, from defining user needs to delivery. Over the last three years, CTA has been steadily refining a methodology for the determination of priority themes for agricultural information, and it recently completed a series of six pilot studies at national level. The studies were undertaken in Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Senegal and Zambia. They centred around workshops involving representatives of National Agricultural Systems as well as related non-governmental organisations and rural organisations. As a result, the next phase of this programme will enable other ACP countries to be able to conduct similar exercises, although the issue of their funding remains an item.

40|$|Biodiversity is {{the most}} {{important}} foundation for food security. This is particularly true in the isolated, resource-poor, small island developing states of the Pacific Islands. Food security will ultimately depend on the protection of the cultural and natural ecosystems and services, as well as the knowledge and materials needed to produce and process our food and drinks, for example our forests, reefs, rivers, agricultural systems, firewood and knowledge about farming, fishing, food preservation, processing and cooking, etc. Food security, here, as elsewhere, depends on three sources: wild harvest, agricultural production, and trade. Islanders originally depended almost exclusively on the first two: wild food and water from our forests, non-forest land, rivers and seas, and plant and animal products from our agricultural systems. In terms of wild harvest, Pacific Islanders eat wild yams, ferns, birds, bats, guavas, citrus fruits, tropical almonds, wild leafy greens, and an extremely wide variety of freshwater and marine foods. For example, in eastern Viti Levu, Fiji Islands, the people eat over 200 different types of finfish and over 70 different types of shellfish, crustaceans and marine invertebrates. Over half of these are sold to provide cash incomes and feed the growing urban population. A rich heritage In terms of agricultural production, staple root crops include four taro species, five yam species, sweet potato, and cassava. Important tree crops include coconut, banana and plantain, breadfruit, pandanus, Tahitian chestnut and a wide range of fruit and nut trees. Other locally grown foods include taro leaf spinach, hibiscus spinach, sugarcane and sugarcane inflorescence, corn and many other vegetables, beans and pulses and a wide range of spice and beverage plants. There are wild and locally-raised chickens, ducks, pigs, goats and cows to supply fresh lean meat, eggs and dairy products. These local foods traditionally provided us with all the proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and other micronutrients, and the fibre and water needed for good health. They are low in salt, sugar and saturated fats. Most of these plants and animals have many different varieties or breeds. For example, in Fiji there are at least 100 named taro varieties, 7 cattle and 5 traditional pig breeds. In the atoll country of Kiribati, there are over 200 edible varieties of pandanus, a staple food plant that will produce during the severest droughts when no other plants can. This genetic diversity adds insurance to our food system, protecting our Today, Pacific Islanders are increasingly dependent on trade and imported foods food plants and animals against diseases and natural disasters, such as hurricanes and drought. Unfortunately, many of these have already disappeared or are disappearing because they have been replaced by new or imported varieties and breeds. Traditional knowledge But perhaps most important is the great knowledge of our diverse cultures, through which we have traditionally known how to collect, hunt, fish, farm and care for wild and domestic plants and animals. Such knowledge includes beliefs, seasonal migrations, recipes, ways of preserving and preparing food, how to breastfeed and nurture babies, as well as the language and names associated with the plants and animals that supply our foods and drinks, and how they affect our health. Today, Pacific Islanders are increasingly dependent on trade and imported foods. This is partly because they live in towns and some of these local foods are now rare or too expensive, or because people no longer know how to catch, produce or prepare them, or have even lost the taste for these foods. Unfortunately, given the purchasing power and low level of nutritional awareness of most of our people, much of the imported food they eat consists of nutritionally inferior products that are high in animal fat, sugar and salt and low in high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals, fibre and water. As a result, Pacific Islanders now have some of the highest and most rapidly increasing levels of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, obesity, dental disease and cancer. An irreplaceable loss Sadly, many of the sources of our nutritious food plants and animals are now endangered. Our mangrove forests and coral reefs are dying or being destroyed. Many of the fish that were common in the past are now rare. Our coastal and inland forests are disappearing and our agricultural lands are being eroded. Many of the traditional varieties of taro, sugarcane, rice, breadfruit, coconut, pandanus and wild yam are dwindling, as are fruit and medicinal trees. Our traditional chicken, pig and goat breeds are disappearing. Of at least equal concern is that the current generation often know few of the names of our fish, shellfish, crabs, wild and cultivated plants and cultivars. They <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> how to hunt, fish, farm, preserve, prepare or eat many of our traditional foods. Young farmers, who <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> the names of our fruit trees and medicinal plants, no longer protect or plant them. In short, because of our ignorance and the shortsightedness of our national planners, we are losing our biodiversity. It is our choice. The sustainable use and protection of island and marine biodiversity is vital for food security for all of our island people. Email: Thaman_r@usp. ac. fj The opinions expressed in Viewpoint are those of the authors, and do not necessarily reflect the views of CTA.

It {{sought to determine}} if internationally trained medical doctors have similar work qualifications as Scandinavian trained physicians and if the current national integration process is a cause of concern. It addresses {{the issue of the}} quality of the primary health care provided by IMGs, resident in Norway, as experienced by their Norwegian professional peers. Questionnaires were sent to 485 physicians. 327 returned the filled-in questionnaires and reported about their experiences with colleagues with a non-Scandinavian medical education. The returned questionnaires show how the respondents assess the professional, cultural, and communication skills of the foreign-trained physicians after their authorization as medical doctors in Norway. Interviews were conducted with representatives from the medical faculty, SAFH and the Norwegian Board of Health to discuss their plans for the future assessment and support of IMGs. Results: 1. Respondents express low satisfaction with IMGs trained in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, and point to inadequate language and communication skills as the number-one problem among these physicians. 2. Respondents report that the problems they see with the foreign trained physicians were compromising the quality of health care provided. Substantial proportions (5 %) of all reports conclude that poor communication skills are a very or fairly serious problem for patients, and of even greater concern, 4, 6 % of all respondents say that as a result of poor communication quality of care suffers and may put patients at risk. 3. Beyond the problems with communication, the Eastern Europe and World groups are united when it comes to IMGs medical professional skills (core medical knowledge, technical skills). Almost one third of the respondents pointed out that they are poorly satisfied with the quality of the professional skills of these IMGs. 4. Only a minority of respondents had concerns about IMGs respect for the autonomy of patients. 5. The solutions to the quality problems identified by the respondents and the interviewees include mandatory increased support and good parenting practices, better opportunities for continuing education and a stronger social and cultural training. To conclude, this study indicates that there are greater variations in the skill mix among internationally trained medical doctors than among their Scandinavian trained colleagues in tertiary health care. About one third of the reports point to more or less impaired quality of care. In 5 per cent of the reports these quality problems are closely linked to patient and colleague (dis) satisfaction. The problems are so grave in these cases that they may affect patient safety. The single most important problem identified in this report is inadequate language and communication skills. Given these results, it is clearly not a problem limited to certain facilities, professions, regions or places of education. Those working closely with foreign-trained physicians do, however, think that it is possible to introduce an educational program that might significantly alleviate the problems identified through this study...|$|R

40|$|Migration is {{sometimes}} a calculated grab at a better life, sometimes a horrified flight from killing fields, or an escape from fields that feed too few. It is both a cause and an effect of change in ACP agriculture and rural life, a symptom full of surprises. We are all migrants, or descendants of migrants, some of us more than others. Some people choose to move, others have no choice and are forced migrants. The world s first migrants were African: in September 2000, archaeologists announced {{the discovery of a}} ancient settlement, established 50, 000 years ago in north-east Brazil by, it is conjectured, migrants from central Africa. What pushed them to leave home? Was it the human urge to colonise? Or was it more material, in the need to ensure a richer diet and a safer life? Despite the sad plight of the so-called voluntary migrant who moves from village to city, or seeks to pierce the none-too-welcoming economies of the North, it is involuntary migration that requires the greatest attention, especially in terms of rural livelihoods. Today the world has more than 130 million involuntary migrants, forced by circumstance, or coerced by compatriots, to live outside their countries of birth. Of these, 12 million are in Africa. In addition there are several {{tens of millions of people}} forced to move within their own country by unrest and violence, natural disaster and extreme economic pressures. Since most involuntary migrants today are rural, the link between migration, agriculture and rural livelihoods is a strong one. Most involuntary migration arises, according to the Worldwatch Institute, in cases of persecution, warfare and famine. Less extreme pushes are political disempowerment, redrawing of borders and forced resettlement. The most controversial forms, where the definition voluntary is often borderline, are economic and environmental refugees, who are not recognised in international law. Opportunities and threats As a person who represents both the new and the unknown, a migrant induces fear and mistrust. But such emotions gnaw away at any hopes of stability, food security or communal welfare and must be mastered. Any host country or community must learn to identify and to emphasise the elements of opportunity which exist in migration, however scarce and fragile. Migration is a means, unintentional maybe, of sharing knowledge: the introduction of certain food processing and storage techniques, and ways of organising credit and savings schemes, have been catalogued in Ghana, Benin and Côte d Ivoire as coming from migrants from the Sahel famines of the mid- 1970 s. In central and southern Africa, seed exchanges have been initiated by resettled refugees. In South Africa, the department of revenue argues that inward migration from as far as West Africa helps to invigorate the (informal) economy. Few such cases are documented; most talk of benefits from migrants occurs at the level of transnational migration. Within ACP countries and other developing countries, most benefits remain largely to be identified. Migration is however primarily an indicator of a problem, most tragically at times of conflict, within and between countries, and of extreme environmental breakdowns. The hand of man lies heavily on such cases as a civil war between political factions in Chad, savage greed for diamonds (nobody s best friend in truth) in Angola and Sierra Leone, or the famines induced by over-grazing and planning blindness in the Sahel, Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa. People literally place themselves at the mercy of neighbouring communities, countries and ecosystems. UNHCR: 'with the spontaneous movement of thousands of desperate people, the results can be disastrous for the environment'. 'Who has seen my cows? Who has seen my goats? These leafless trees and this dry land must be why they left'- Youssou N'Dour, Senegalese singer Illustration Terri Andon The key issue in post-war or post-disaster migration is re-settlement, either by returning home or in new locations. Here a key strategy is to ensure financial security for re-migrants: those who still have capital are unwilling to invest in agriculture or to entrust funds to banks. This restricts credit to help the cash-impaired develop their economic activities and pin down their essential land rights land tenure being central in migration-retention strategies also. But let us be clear. Agriculturally speaking, return and re-settlement strategies are not applicable in the cases of most migrants. They have gone, gone away, and they will not be coming back, nor will they be farming elsewhere. They will go to the market towns and cities. Their departure will carry the blessing, perhaps, of alleviating excess labour in their birthplace, increased cash remittances to family members who stayed and new economic exchanges between town and country, as a CTA co-seminar on urban-rural interaction in Senegal in 1999 (see Spore 87) stressed. Spirals to oblivion Current waves of migration reflect the environmental fact that the carrying capacity of the land is reaching its limits. As food production becomes ever more intensive, the pressure grows to expand land use into marginal desert-risk or upslope areas, or into ever-smaller less-productive plots. Even in apparently land-rich Africa, such pressures can boil over into deadly conflict. Worldwatch Institute: 'Land scarcity played a critical role in the recent eruption of war in Rwanda'. Such scenarios sometimes intersect explosively with existing conflicts. 'In the conflict in Somalia in 1994, most fighting occurred in the farm belt. It is the continuation of a 100 -year-old movement of major clans southwards from nomadic grazing areas that have been becoming more and more overpopulated'. As it is with land, so it is with water; there are several simmering conflicts in water-stressed areas in Africa and Asia (see Spore 74). Such crises could on their own, with the proper resources, be monitored, mitigated, managed. But the environmental cocktail which will provoke future migrations becomes all the more volatile if we add the notion of climate change, an ongoing phenomenon on which man has little immediate influence. Temperature rises of 2 - 3 ºC in the next 70 years could create floods, droughts and volatile food production in many developing countries as has been seen for several decades in the Horn of Africa. <b>Don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> where, <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> when In recent years there has already been one exodus, of the people of Haiti to neighbouring United States. There, a sequence of human decisions and the involuntary choices of the poor overgrazing, deforestation for fuelwood, political competition, misguided aid interventions with alien animal species have all come together to push people off the land. To have predicted in, say, 1970 that such an implosion would happen in Haiti in the 1990 s was impossible just as few dared to openly predict Rwanda s collapse. To predict where the next exoduses will be is equally impossible, though several zones in ACP countries are often suggested (such as the entire Sahel belt, west central Africa, Great Lakes, and some small and low-lying islands). Rather than wringing our hands and trying vainly to halt the flow, we must accept, no doubt involuntarily, that some people many people are being born to run. Somewhere, perhaps in a foreign field or on a foreign hillside, there must be a welcome. [summary points] Despite being seen as a disturbing and unpredictable phenomenom, the benefits of migration include: - Exchange of agricultural skills and knowledge to the host community, such as new seeds and cultivation methods - Injection of new productive energy and processing techniques - New markets for local production These benefits need to be better identified, and included in strengthened efforts by ACP and other countries to better prepare for future migration.

40|$|This is {{the summary}} of my {{research}} and thesis done here at the University of Oslo on the environmental problems and environmental preferences in China. This thesis begins with a description on the environmental problems along with the economic development. Even though GDP total in China increases each year, environment becomes worse and worse. Local environmental problems include air pollution, water pollution, solid waste and noise pollution. Particles, dust, SO 2, CO, NOX from coal burning increases year by year. Coal smoke pollution is {{the main source of}} air pollution. TSP (total suspended particular) is the principal air pollutant in urban areas. Acid rain is another effect from coal burning. Acid rain expands more than one third of the country now. Water pollution is mainly caused by industrial and urban sewage that are discharged in river, lake. Industrial solid waste store-up and garbage from cities occupy large land space, pollute the air, surface water and underground water. Meanwhile, increased traffic in the city increases the noise as well. Actually, National Environmental Protection Administration in China has some good policies for environment. However, the local government seems not to execute. They take more care of economic growth. Provincial government s incentives are not in line with national welfare priorities. This is seen by many as the main reason that environmental problems in China come into crisis. In order to monitor the environment, Chinese government has carried out two studies to calculate the environmental costs. The project Economic Measure and Research on the Loss of Environmental pollution in China was undertaken by the State Environmental Protection Administration and Economic Policy Research Center (Xia, 1998). Another project Estimation of Economic Loss Caused by the Environment and Ecology Problems in the 90 s is completed by the Environment and Development Research Center of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Zheng, 1995). Also, David Norse, together with some Chinese researchers, has studied environmental cost of rice production in China (Norse et al. 2001; Huang et al. 2001). Chang, Seip and Vennemo have studied the environmental cost of water pollution in Chinese cities (Chang, Seip and Vennemo, 2001). By calculating environmental cost, we can know how much China have sacrificed on environment for the economic growth. It helps us to look at the economical achievement objectively, and take some methods to reduce the environment loss. In the model A presented in section 4, I discuss environmental preferences and environmental quality in 3 kinds of situation: i.) social planner s decision which takes account into both ordinary people and leader s preferences on environment and material production; ii.) local leader s decision which only includes leader s preference, i. e., to maximize material production; iii.) leader s decision taking environmental quality into account, in which leaders begin to think about environment. In different situation, we get different environmental quality. In the first situation, social planner s decision, the environmental quality is best; in the second situation, local leader s decision, environmental quality is worst; in the third situation, leader s preferences is influenced by knowledge on the environment, for instance, green accounting. Population s welfare has been taken account into leaders consideration, and the environmental quality is better than the second situation. Model B is a two period model. I discuss about the ordinary people and the leader s preferences on allocation of material production in period one and period two. If the ordinary people have a higher discount rate than the leaders, the ordinary people will tend to need all they can on consumption mainly in period 1, and not able to think so far ahead. When there is an uncertain political environment, the leaders may still have a higher discount rate than the ordinary people. The leaders <b>don</b> <b>t</b> <b>know</b> how long they will be in power, so they are interested in achieving much now, and leave environment to next period. When leaders have an insecure position, their discount rate is tending to be high. To improve environment in China, I proposed some suggestions for the environmental policy in China. First is to make environmental cost visible, as well as to make the leadership aware the scale of environmental degradation and the cost of economic growth. This can be achieved by setting up Green GDP or green accounting. Green GDP is an adjustment of GDP. In Green GDP, environmental cost caused by economical activities has been deducted from traditional GDP. Green accounting, also named as environmental accounting, is physical and monetary accounts of environmental assets and the costs of their depletion and degradation (United Nations, 1997). Second is to change the current indices of measuring officials political achievement. Once environmental quality is put into the indices of measuring officials political achievement, the leadership would invest more in the environment sector. Economic growth and environmental protection complement one another. Without economic growth, we <b>don</b> <b>t</b> have enough capital, technology, equipment to protect and administrate ecological environment. In the contrary, without good environment, it s difficult to keep healthy, not to say economic growth...|$|R
