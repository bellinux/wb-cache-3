5|$|Though cyclizations {{following}} the general template above had been observed prior to Nazarov's involvement, {{it was his}} study of the rearrangements of allyl vinyl ketones that marked the first major examination of this process. Nazarov correctly reasoned that the allylic <b>olefin</b> isomerized in situ to form a divinyl ketone before ring closure to the cyclopentenone product. The reaction shown below involves an alkyne oxymercuration reaction to generate the requisite ketone.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium in {{the form}} of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as {{catalyst}} for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts used for this process contain rhenium. The <b>olefin</b> metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is used for this process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol <b>olefin</b> followed by loss of the silyl group and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. β-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0. The reversibility of the elimination step allows equilibration, leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in acyclic substrates. It {{has been shown that}} the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction.|$|E
5000|$|C16 - C18 linear <b>olefins</b> {{find their}} primary {{application}} as the hydrophobes in oil-soluble surfactants and as lubricating fluids themselves. C16 - C18 alpha or internal <b>olefins</b> {{are used as}} synthetic drilling fluid base for high value, primarily off-shore synthetic drilling fluids. The preferred materials for the synthetic drilling fluid application are linear internal <b>olefins,</b> which are primarily made by isomerizing linear alpha-olefins to an internal position. The higher internal <b>olefins</b> appear to form a more lubricious layer at the metal surface and are recognized as a better lubricants. Another significant application for C16 - C18 <b>olefins</b> is in paper sizing. Linear alpha <b>olefins</b> are, once again, isomerized into linear internal <b>olefins</b> are then reacted with maleic anhydride to make an alkyl succinic anhydride(ASA), a popular paper sizing chemical.|$|R
40|$|A {{systematically}} varied {{series of}} conformationally restricted ketones, readily prepared from N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, were tested against representative <b>olefins</b> as asymmetric epoxidation catalysts showing useful selectivities against terminal <b>olefins</b> and, in particular, typically difficult 2, 2 -disubstituted terminal <b>olefins...</b>|$|R
50|$|Industrially, linear alpha <b>olefins</b> are {{commonly}} manufactured by two main routes: oligomerization of ethylene and by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis followed by purification. Another route to linear alpha <b>olefins</b> {{which has been}} used commercially on small scale is dehydration of alcohols. Prior to about the 1970s, linear alpha <b>olefins</b> were also manufactured by thermal cracking of waxes, whereas linear internal <b>olefins</b> were also manufactured by chlorination/dehydrochlorination of linear paraffins.|$|R
25|$|<b>Olefin</b> space {{velocity}} {{is defined as}} the volume of <b>olefin</b> charged per hour divided by the average volume of sulfuric acid in the contactor reactor. In general, higher <b>olefin</b> space velocities tend to increase sulfuric acid consumption rates and decrease alkylate octane.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the unit is to react an <b>olefin</b> feed with {{isobutane}} in the reaction section {{in the presence of}} the HF acting as catalyst to produce alkylate.

50|$|The {{two most}} common {{petrochemical}} classes are <b>olefins</b> (including ethylene and propylene) and aromatics (including benzene, toluene and xylene isomers). Oil refineries produce <b>olefins</b> and aromatics by {{fluid catalytic cracking}} of petroleum fractions. Chemical plants produce <b>olefins</b> by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane. Aromatics are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha. <b>Olefins</b> and aromatics are the building-blocks {{for a wide range}} of materials such as solvents, detergents, and adhesives. <b>Olefins</b> are the basis for polymers and oligomers used in plastics, resins, fibers, elastomers, lubricants, and gels.|$|R
40|$|New {{methodology}} for the selective cross-metathesis (CM) of terminal <b>olefins</b> employing ruthenium benzylidene 1 is described. 1 CM with symmetric internal <b>olefins</b> {{was found to}} provide a useful means for homologating terminal <b>olefins</b> to protected allylic alcohols, amines, and esters. Due to the limited commercial availability of symmetric internal <b>olefins,</b> a two-step CM procedure was developed in which terminal <b>olefins</b> were first homodimerized prior to the CM reaction. Terminal <b>olefins</b> with allylic methyl substituents were observed to provide CM products in diminished yield albeit with markedly improved trans-selectivity. Reaction rates were measured for CM reactions utilizing butenediol and allyl alcohol derivatives, and the results demonstrated distinct advantages in reaction rate and stereoselectivity for reactions employing the disubstituted <b>olefins.</b> In the course of studies of substrates with allylic oxygen substituents, a new CM application was discovered involving the metathesis of acrolein acetal derivatives with terminal <b>olefins.</b> Acrolein acetals, including asymmetric variants derived from tartaric acid, proved to be exceptionally robust and trans-selective CM substrates. In related work, a pinacol-derived vinyl boronate was also {{found to be a}} reactive CM partner, providing a novel means for converting terminal <b>olefins</b> into precursors for the Suzuki coupling reaction...|$|R
5000|$|Citric acid: Osmium tetroxide is an electrophilic oxidant {{and as such}} reacts {{slowly with}} {{electron-deficient}} <b>olefins.</b> It {{has been found that}} the rate of oxidation of electron-deficient <b>olefins</b> can be accelerated by maintaining the pH of the reaction slightly acidic. On the other hand, a high pH can increase the rate of oxidation of internal <b>olefins,</b> and also increase the enantiomeric excess (e.e.) for the oxidation of terminal <b>olefins.</b>|$|R
25|$|Polymerization {{results from}} the {{addition}} of a second <b>olefin</b> to the C8 carbocation formed in the primary reaction. The resulting C12 carbocation can continue to react with an <b>olefin</b> to form a larger carbocation. As with the previously described mechanisms, the heavy carbocations may at some point undergo a hydride transfer from isobutane to yield a C12 – C16 isoparaffin and a t-butyl cation. These heavy molecules tend to lower the octane and raise the boiling end point of the alkylate effluent.|$|E

25|$|Cyclic <b>olefin</b> {{copolymers}} {{are prepared}} by copolymerization of ethene and cycloolefins (usually norbornene) produced by using metallocene catalysts. The resulting polymers are amorphous polymers and particularly transparent and heat resistant.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{analyzed}} {{the structures of}} sulfurized <b>olefins</b> using NMR spectroscopy and studied the effects of sulfur chain length and alkyl structure on the ironing performance. They found that branched chain <b>olefins,</b> which contain branched alkyl groups, show superior ironing performance to straight chain <b>olefins,</b> provided that their carbon numbers are relatively low. When the sulfurized <b>olefins</b> were used in combination with overbased detergents (calcium sulfonate or salicylate), they showed a higher performance in ironing than with sulfurized <b>olefins</b> alone. It was also found that lubricating films consisting of both iron sulfide and calcium carbonate seem to improve ironing performance...|$|R
50|$|Linear Alpha <b>Olefins</b> (LAO) or Normal Alpha <b>Olefins</b> (NAO) are <b>olefins</b> or alkenes with a {{chemical}} formula CxH2x, distinguished from other mono-olefins {{with a similar}} molecular formula by linearity of the hydrocarbon chain and {{the position of the}} double bond at the primary or alpha position.|$|R
40|$|Low-carbon light <b>olefins</b> are {{the basic}} {{feedstocks}} for the petrochemical industry. Catalytic cracking of crude bio-oil and its model compounds (including methanol, ethanol, acetic acid, acetone, and phenol) to light <b>olefins</b> were performed by using the La/HZSM- 5 catalyst. The highest <b>olefins</b> yield from crude bio-oil reached 0. 19 kg/(kg crude bio-oil). The reaction conditions including temperature, weight hourly space velocity, and addition of La into the HZSM- 5 zeolite {{can be used to}} control both <b>olefins</b> yield and selectivity. Moderate adjusting the acidity with a suitable ratio between the strong acid and weak acid sites through adding La to the zeolite effectively enhanced the <b>olefins</b> selectivity and improved the catalyst stability. The production of light <b>olefins</b> from crude bio-oil is closely associated with the chemical composition and hydrogen to carbon effective ratios of feedstock. The comparison between the catalytic cracking and pyrolysis of bio-oil was studied. The mechanism of the bio-oil conversion to light <b>olefins</b> was also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Unactivated acyclic {{internal}} aliphatic <b>olefins</b> {{are often}} {{found to be}} unreactive in conventional alkenylation reactions. To address this problem, a cobalt catalyzed allylic selective dehydrogenative Heck reaction with internal aliphatic <b>olefins</b> has been developed.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the catalytic cracking of the microalga Isochtysis zhanjiangensis over a modifled ZSM- 5 catalyst {{with the aim of}} producing C 2 -C 4 light <b>olefins.</b> Compared with the thermal cracking process, the catalytic cracking of this microalga displayed higher selectivity for and greater yield of these <b>olefins.</b> The catalytic cracking of extracted lipids and the corresponding residues of the microalga was also examined, and the results showed that the lipids could be efficiently converted to light <b>olefins.</b> The catalytic cracking of lipids extracted by different solvents demonstrated that neutral lipids gave the highest yield of light <b>olefins</b> at 36. 7 %. The yields of light <b>olefins</b> obtained from catalytic cracking of the extraction residues were much lower than the yields obtained from lipids, and thus the lipids, especially the neutral lipids, are the primary contributors to the generation of light <b>olefins.</b> Isochrysis zhanjiangensis with an elevated neutral lipid content will therefore give the highest yield of light <b>olefins</b> through catalytic cracking.

25|$|The <b>olefin</b> feed to an {{alkylation}} unit generally originates from a FCCU {{and contains}} butene, isobutene, and possibly propene and/or amylenes. The <b>olefin</b> feed {{is also likely}} to contain diluents (such as propane, n-butane, and n-pentane), noncondensables (such as ethane and hydrogen) and contaminants. Diluants in principle have no effect on the reaction of alkylation but occupy a portion of the reactor and can influence the yield of secondary reactions of polymerisation and of undesired organofluorine side products. Incondensable are from a chemical perspective similar to diluents but they do not condense at the pressure and temperature of the process, and therefore they concentrate to a point that must be vented. Contaminants are compounds that react with and/or dilute the sulfuric acid catalyst. They increase acid consumption and contribute to produce undesirable reaction products and increase polymer formation. Common contaminants are water, methanol and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Currently, many {{countries}} set limits on gasoline aromatics in general, benzene in particular, and <b>olefin</b> (alkene) content. Such regulations led to increasing preference for high octane pure paraffin (alkane) components, such as alkylate, and is forcing refineries to add processing units to reduce benzene content. In the EU the benzene limit {{is set at}} 1% volume for all grade of automotive gasoline.|$|E
