25|$|The {{resurgence}} of feminist activism {{in the late}} 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> considered female-associated issues, such as concerns for the earth, spirituality, and environmental activism. The atmosphere this created reignited the study of and debate on matricentricity as a rejection of determinism, such as with Adrienne Rich in Of Woman Born and Marilyn French in Beyond Power. For socialist feminists like Evelyn Reed, patriarchy held the properties of capitalism.|$|E
500|$|Concerns that {{defamation}} under {{common law}} might be {{incompatible with the}} new republican form of government caused early American courts to struggle between William Blackstone's argument that the punishment of [...] "dangerous or offensive writings [...] [...] [...] [...] necessary {{for the preservation of}} peace and good order, of government and religion, the only solid foundations of civil liberty" [...] and the argument that the need for a free press guaranteed by the Constitution outweighed the fear <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> written. Consequently, very few changes were made in the first two centuries after the ratification of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the focus}} {{in this essay}} is largely on the {{character}} of Prince Hamlet, Hazlitt also comments on the movement of the dramatic action. Shakespeare lends all the characters and settings an air of verisimilitude, so that the reader might consider [...] "the whole play [...] an exact transcription <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark, at the remote period of time fixed upon, before the modern refinements in morals and manners were heard of. [...] the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. There is no set purpose, no straining at a point." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} 33 years, {{the fate of}} the {{expedition}} was shrouded in mystery and its disappearance part of cultural lore in Sweden and to a certain extent elsewhere. It was actively sought {{for a couple of years}} and remained the subject of myth and rumor, with frequent international newspaper reports of possible findings. An extensive archive of American newspaper reports from the first few years, 1896–99, titled [...] "The Mystery of Andree", shows a much richer media interest in the expedition after it disappeared than before. A great variety of fates are suggested for it, inspired by finds, or reported finds, of remnants <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a balloon basket, or great amounts of balloon silk, or by stories of men falling from the sky, or visions by psychics, all of which would typically locate the stranded balloon far from Danes Island and Svalbard.|$|E
500|$|We {{as readers}} or {{audience}} appreciate the characters {{by the force}} of our imagination's seeming to participate in the scene, as if we were present during such an event in real life. Commenting on the scene in Julius Caesar where Caesar confides to Marc Antony his apprehensions about Cassius, Hazlitt writes: [...] "We know hardly any passage more expressive of the genius of Shakespeare than this. It is {{as if he had been}} actually present, had known the different characters and what they thought of one another, and had taken down what he heard and saw, their looks, words, and gestures, just as they happened." [...] In [...] "Hamlet", he observes that [...] "the characters think and speak and act just as they might do, if left entirely to themselves. [...] The whole play is an exact transcript <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> supposed to have taken place at the court of Denmark [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Every shot in {{the film}} passed through the hands of eight {{different}} teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and general lighting. Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting {{the location of the}} virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes. Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and Ash Brannon, each shot went to the animation department from the layout. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical. The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or [...] "keyframes") was created, the software would build poses for the frames in-between. The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing. To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.|$|E
