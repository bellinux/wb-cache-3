The two girls offered Falle {{a place to sleep}} at their apartment while their pimp was away; feeling there was no alternative, she accepted. Out of concern for Falle's safety, they taught her how to put a condom on a penis by practicing on a cucumber. These children effectively groomed Falle. She stayed at the apartment for several days, and she was watched by various men. By the time the pimp returned, Falle had moved on.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{and women}} with CAH {{constitute}} the majority of genetic females with normal internal reproductive hormones who {{have been exposed to}} male levels of testosterone throughout their prenatal lives. Milder degrees of continuing androgen exposure continue throughout childhood and adolescence {{as a consequence of the}} imperfections of current glucocorticoid treatment for CAH. The psychosexual development <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> and women has been analyzed as evidence of the role of androgens in human sex-dimorphic behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Based {{on a study}} {{released}} by Dallas Women's Foundation, sex trafficking of young girls {{is not an isolated}} phenomenon, but a widespread criminal activity in Texas. The research found that 740 girls under age 18 were documented being marketed for sex during a 30-day period in Texas, of whom 712 <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> were being marketed through Internet classified web sites and 28 were being marketed through escort services. More information concluded from the research is that there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are women killed in domestic violence with former or current husbands, intimate partners or boyfriends in Texas over an entire year. There are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are females of all ages who died from complication due to AIDS in one year in Texas. And finally, there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are teen girls who died by suicide, homicide, and accidents in the state in one year.|$|E
500|$|On 14 April 1899, Chief Chintanda gave a BSAC {{commissioner}} at Mazoe, Southern Rhodesia {{a statement}} in which, among other things, he asserted that Clark had been claiming to be a Company official and had been collecting tariffs such as hut tax under that pretence {{for at least two}} years. Clark's labour and mining concessions, Chintanda said, had been agreed under the impression that he represented the BSAC. Chintanda furthermore claimed that Clark was a prolific womaniser who had once raped a pregnant woman. [...] "Whenever Clark sees a girl he fancies he takes her as his mistress for a few days, and when tired of her sends her home," [...] Chintanda said. [...] "The fathers and husbands <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> are constantly complaining to me about Clark's actions, but I can do nothing as Clark is a white man, and professed to be representing the government."

500|$|The next {{scenes in}} the film depict child labour in Nepal, and {{indicate}} that child workers in the textile industry are commonly targeted by sex traffickers. A brothel raid in India, led by Balkrishna Acharya of the Rescue Foundation in Mumbai, is then shown. Ten young girls are rescued from a four-by-three-foot closet and a crawl space. The madam reacts furiously, perceiving the raid as taking away her livelihood. Then, the trafficking of children into the sex industry is depicted in Cambodia. Some scenes take place in Svay Pak, Phnom Penh, one of the cheapest sex tourism destinations in the Mekong Delta. Women of the Somaly Mam Foundation are depicted working with girls who have been sexually trafficked. A large number <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> are pictured one by one, each child fading into the next {{against the backdrop of}} a doorway. An interview with one of the Somaly Mam Foundation workers, Sophea Chhun, reveals that her daughter, Sokny, was kidnapped in 2008 at age 23. [...] "Most likely Sokny too was sold," [...] Chhun says, claiming that [...] "the police treated it like she wasn't important"—perhaps, she suggests, because Sokny was an adopted child. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions is interviewed, and says that all of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them. Bilheimer agreed with this assertion in an interview outside the film.|$|E

2500|$|While it is {{recommended}} that women with CAIS eventually undergo gonadectomy to mitigate cancer risk, there are differing opinions regarding the necessity and timing of gonadectomy. [...] The risk of malignant germ cell tumors in women with CAIS increases with age and has been estimated to be 3.6% at 25 years and 33% at 50 years. [...] However, only three cases of malignant germ cell tumors in prepubescent girls with CAIS {{have been reported in the}} last 100 years. [...] The youngest <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>girls</b> was 14 years old. [...] If gonadectomy is performed early, then puberty must be artificially induced using gradually increasing doses of estrogen. [...] If gonadectomy is performed late, then puberty will occur on its own, due to the aromatization of testosterone into estrogen. [...] At least one organization, the Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group, classifies the cancer risk associated with CAIS as low enough to recommend against gonadectomy, although it warns that the cancer risk is still elevated above the general population, and that ongoing cancer monitoring is essential. [...] Some choose to perform gonadectomy if and when inguinal hernia presents. [...] Estrogen replacement therapy is critical to minimize bone mineral density deficiencies later in life.|$|E
