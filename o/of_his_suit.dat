25|$|Moscone {{originally}} {{indicated a}} willingness to reconsider, but more liberal city leaders, including Harvey Milk, lobbied him against the idea, and Moscone ultimately decided not to appoint White. On November 27, 1978, three days after Moscone's 49th birthday, White went to San Francisco City Hall to meet with Moscone and make a final plea for appointment. When Moscone refused to reconsider his decision, White pulled a gun out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> jacket and shot and killed Moscone. White then went to Milk's office and shot Milk, killing him as well.|$|E

The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps naturally, Lever {{felt that}} {{the failure of the}} Soap Combine was the result of {{animosity}} and resentment directed at him personally, rather than as a consequence of its members’ dishonesty. Having sought several opinions on the authority <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit,</b> he retained Sir Edward Carson and two juniors, one of whom was Frederick Edwin Smith, later Lord Birkenhead. For the defendants, Rufus Isaacs, later Marquess of Reading and Viceroy of India, assisted by another K.C. and two juniors, acted for Associated Newspapers Ltd. Lever’s legal team were in no doubt of the outcome; as F.E. Smith reportedly observed 'There is no answer to this action for libel and the damages must be enormous.' On 15 July 1907 the case came up at Liverpool before Mr Justice Lawrence.|$|E
500|$|Everest has, {{according}} to Vogue, dressed [...] "some of the world's most famous people". He has clients worldwide and travels regularly for fittings in New York, Los Angeles and Japan. Closer to home, Everest's bespoke atelier in Spitalfields has a diverse client base that includes politicians (including British Prime Ministers past and present), and sports and Hollywood personalities. <b>Of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> worn to the Oscars, Tom Cruise commented: [...] "Of course it fits; it's a Timothy Everest".|$|E

500|$|Oscar Wilde {{alluded to}} the scandal in The Picture of Dorian Gray, first {{published}} in 1890. Reviews of the novel were hostile; in a clear reference to the Cleveland Street scandal, one reviewer called it suitable for [...] "none but outlawed noblemen and perverted telegraph boys". Wilde's 1891 revision of the novel omitted certain key passages, which were considered too homoerotic. In 1895, Wilde unsuccessfully sued Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry, for libel. Sir Edward Carson, Lord Queensberry's counsel, used quotes from the novel against Wilde and questioned him about his associations with young working men. After the failure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit,</b> Wilde was charged with gross indecency, found guilty and subsequently sentenced to two years' hard labour. He was prosecuted by Charles Gill, who had defended Veck in the Cleveland Street case.|$|E
500|$|By 1873, Hay was wooing Clara Stone, {{daughter}} of Cleveland multimillionaire railroad and banking mogul Amasa Stone. The success <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> (they married in 1874) made the salary attached to office a small {{consideration for the}} rest of his life. Amasa Stone needed someone to watch over his investments, and wanted Hay to move to Cleveland to fill the post. Although the Hays initially lived in John's New York apartment and later in a townhouse there, they moved in June 1875 to Stone's ornate home on Cleveland's Euclid Avenue, [...] "Millionaire's Row", and a mansion was quickly under construction for the Hays next-door. The Hays had four children, Helen Hay Whitney, Adelbert Barnes Hay, Alice Evelyn Hay Wadsworth Boyd, and Clarence Leonard Hay. Their father proved successful as a money manager, though he devoted much of his time to literary and political activities, writing to Adee that [...] "I do nothing but read and yawn".|$|E
500|$|... "Survivor Man" [...] {{received}} a 4.9/7 in the Nielsen ratings, meaning that 4.9 {{percent of households}} were tuned in {{at any given moment}} and seven percent of all televisions in use were tuned in to the program. The episode was watched by 8.29 million viewers and achieved a 4.3/10 in the ages 18–49 demographic. Travis Fickett of IGN stated that [...] "Overall, this isn't a terrific episode, but holds up the show's usual standard. Steve Carell is hilarious as usual. Watching him attempt to make shelter and clothing out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> over the span of only a few hours is great fun." [...] Fickett also stated that {{a good portion of the}} humor in the episode came from in-jokes that required previous knowledge of the series, specifically pointing out the parallel comparison between Michael and Jim's lives. [...] Like Fickett, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode's comparison between Michael and Jim. [...] Fenno also went on to praise other points of the episode, stating she also enjoyed the overall episode for its [...] "just outdoorsiness with Michael and Dwight, and infighting among the rest of the staff." [...] Oscar Dahl, a Senior Writer for BuddyTV, stated that [...] "What seems like a one and done episode without much character work at first turns into much more by the end." [...] Dahl went on to praise the episode, stating that it was [...] "lighter" [...] in comparison to Carell's previous episode [...] "Casino Night".|$|E

2500|$|Pomposity. Hacker {{is often}} seen going off into sentimental, overly pretentious speeches either to himself or to Bernard and Sir Humphrey, holding his lapel on his suit jacket in a very royal manner. He also mimicked Napoleon by {{slipping}} {{his hand in the}} front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> jacket upon hearing he was selected by the party to become party leader and hence Prime Minister. However, it appears that Hacker's political idol is Winston Churchill: he occasionally speaks in the statesman's gruff style, on several occasions imitating or paraphrasing Churchill's [...] "We shall fight on the beaches" [...] speech, and is seen reading biographies of him.|$|E

50|$|Though by {{no means}} a {{particularly}} influential nobleman of the Elizabethan court, he was nonetheless greatly admired for his sporting skill. It is apparent from the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suits</b> <b>of</b> armour that he was powerfully-built and tall for his time, and he is recorded as having won first place in the Accession Day tilt at least once. The Queen's personal attendance of Scudamore's own tilt-yard at Holme Lacy is a testament to his gallant reputation.|$|R
2500|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit,</b> Hunt filed a {{legal action}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in September 1978 {{requesting}} that Szulc be cited for contempt if he refused to divulge his sources. Three months earlier, Szulc stated in a deposition that he refused to name his sources due to [...] "the professional confidentiality of sources" [...] and [...] "journalistic privilege". Rubin stated that knowing {{the source of the}} allegation that Hunt was in Mexico City in 1963 was important because Szulc's passage [...] "is what everybody uses as an authority... he's cited in everything written on E. Howard Hunt". He added that rumors that Hunt was involved in the Kennedy assassination might be put to end if Szulc's source was revealed. Stating that Hunt had not provided a sufficient reason to override Szulc's First Amendment rights to protect the confidentiality of his sources, United States District Judge Albert Vickers Bryan Jr. ruled in favor of Szulc.|$|E
2500|$|In , his {{origins and}} first {{encounter}} with Batman is featured in the DLC Story [...] "Cold, Cold Heart" [...] {{which is based on}} the Batman: The Animated Series episode [...] "Heart of Ice". Mr. Freeze also has a new design for the DLC featuring cleated boots and a larger freeze gun built into the right arm <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit.</b> In the DLC, Mr. Freeze is in collaboration with the Penguin's gang in order to crash a party at Wayne Manor in order to capture Ferris Boyle. When Batman arrives at GothCorp, he finds Penguin trying to backstab Mr. Freeze into giving him what Freeze is after (thinking it to be weapons) until Mr. Freeze uses his freeze gun to create a chain reaction that traps Penguin in a wall of ice. Upon getting the X-E suit to withstand the cold, and acquiring a cryogenic drill to penetrate the ice wall, Batman finds residual evidence that Boyle was behind the accident that turned Victor Fries into Mr. Freeze, and that Boyle is in possession of Mr. Freeze's cryogenically frozen wife. Batman later confronts and defeats Mr. Freeze. Boyle then takes a piece of machinery and attacks Mr. Freeze only for Batman to knock out Boyle. During the DLC's credits, a news voice-over states that Mr. Freeze, Penguin, and Boyle have been all arrested by the police.|$|E
2500|$|Jaime Reyes is a {{featured}} {{character in}} the animated series , voiced by actor Will Friedle.

In the episode [...] "Night of the Huntress!", Blue Beetle, Batman, and the Huntress have to stop the gangsters Baby-Face and Mrs. Manface. Blue Beetle develops a crush on Huntress in the episode. Reyes appeared again in [...] "The Fate of Equinox!" [...] where he, along with Doctor Fate, Aquaman, Black Canary, Black Lightning, Fire, the original Flash, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, Plastic Man and Red Tornado temporarily gave their powers to Batman, turning the Dark Knight into Bat Monolith to battle the omnipotent Equinox. In [...] "Revenge of the Reach!", Jaime learns that his Scarab is a part of the Reach. His suit temporarily takes control of him and has him shut down the defenses around Oa, allowing the Reach to invade. Fortunately, Jaime regains control <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>suit,</b> reminding it that what they did was of their will, not the Reach's. Channeling the energy of the Green Lanterns through his suit, Blue Beetle is able to free all those under the Reach's control. The Guardians of the Universe then ask Jaime for his scarab so it can be destroyed along with the others, but Guy Gardner convinces them that Jaime proved he was the suit's master.|$|E
