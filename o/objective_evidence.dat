According to some scholars, {{the concept of the}} cycle of birth and death, the concept of samsara and the concept of liberation may quite possibly be from śramaṇa or other ascetic traditions.

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the relative strengths {{of different types of}} research. Because randomized trials provide clear, <b>objective</b> <b>evidence</b> on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes. In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments. Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods. On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective, or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real school settings.|$|E

Cyclic FES, FES augmented by biofeedback, and FES used in various daily activities can result in substantial improvements of the voluntary control of upper extremities...|$|R

Instead, this object is to connect to the tocapu (an ideogram already used by pre-Incas civilizations) called “llave inca” (i.e. Inca key) and to the yanantin-masintin philosophy. The scholar reaches this conclusion starting {{from the lack of}} <b>objective</b> <b>evidences</b> which recognize a yupana in this object, a belief that consolidated over years only for the repeat of this hypothesis never demonstrated, and by crossing data from the Miccinelli Documents and the tocapu(s) catalogued by Victoria de la Jara.|$|R
25|$|The American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute do not {{advise the}} use of Hoxsey Therapy, as neither has found any <b>objective</b> <b>evidence</b> that the {{treatment}} provides tangible benefit to people with cancer.

A controlled experiment in lab mice did not find any difference in tumor growth between untreated mice and those given the Hoxsey tonic. An FDA review of 400 people claiming to have been cured by the Hoxsey method found that many of the patients never in fact had cancer, or had received successful medical treatment elsewhere before being treated with Hoxsey Therapy. Those who had cancer at the time they used Hoxsey Therapy were uniformly either deceased or alive with active cancer. There were no cases of actual cures among those promoted as such by the Hoxsey clinic.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for SRA was {{primarily in the}} form of testimonies from children who made allegations of SRA, and adults who claim to remember abuse during childhood, that may have been forgotten and recovered during therapy. With both children and adults, no corroborating evidence has been found for anything except pseudosatanism in which the satanic and ritual aspects were secondary to and used as a cover for sexual abuse. Despite this lack of <b>objective</b> <b>evidence,</b> and aided by the competing definitions of what SRA actually was, proponents claimed SRA was a real phenomenon throughout the peak and during the decline of the moral panic. Despite allegations appearing in the United States, Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia, no material evidence has been found to corroborate allegations of organized cult-based abuse that practices human sacrifice and cannibalism. Though trauma specialists frequently claimed the allegations made by children and adults were the same, in reality the statements made by adults were more elaborate, severe, and featured more bizarre abuse. In 95% of the adults' cases, the memories of the abuse were recovered during psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Its use is {{endorsed}} by the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms {{as long as there}} are not other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery). This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome. When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality. 6.4% of people with large strokes developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality. Additionally, the American Academy of Emergency Medicine states that <b>objective</b> <b>evidence</b> regarding the efficacy, safety, and applicability of tPA for acute ischemic stroke is insufficient to warrant its classification as standard of care. Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.|$|E

In view of these hazards, therefore, the administration of an antibiotic must be initiated only when there are definite <b>objective</b> <b>evidences</b> of an infection from clinical and laboratory parameters.

40|$|Abstract�Decision fusion {{is one of}} hot {{research}} {{topics in}} classification area, which aims to achieve the best possible performance for the task at hand. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of this concept to improve change detection accuracy in remote sensing.

This method fuses the <b>objective</b> <b>evidences</b> produced by the change detectors with respect to fuzzy measures that express the difference of performance between them. The proposed fusion framework is evaluated in comparison with some ordinary fuzzy aggregation operators. Experiments carried out on two SPOT images showed that the fuzzy integral was the best performing.

30|$|Combining {{multiple}} {{neural networks}} {{has been used}} to improve the decision accuracy in many application fields including pattern recognition and classification. In this paper, we investigate the potential of this approach for land cover change detection. In a first step, we perform many experiments in order to find the optimal individual networks in terms of architecture and training rule. In the second step, different neural network change detectors are combined using a method based on the notion of fuzzy integral. This method combines <b>objective</b> <b>evidences</b> in the form of network outputs, with subjective measures of their performances. Various forms of the fuzzy integral, which are, namely, Choquet integral, Sugeno integral, and two extensions of Sugeno integral with ordered weighted averaging operators, are implemented. Experimental analysis using error matrices and Kappa analysis showed that the fuzzy integral outperforms individual networks and constitutes an appropriate strategy to increase the accuracy of change detection.|$|R

This exploratory pilot study examines self-report of cognitive failure in driving beginners and error during real driving as observed by driving instructors. Methods. Forty-two driv-ing learners of 14 driving instructors filled out a work-related cognitive failure questionnaire. Driving instruc-tors observed driving errors during the next driving lesson. In multiple linear regression analysis, driving errors were regressed on cognitive failure with the number of driving lessons as an estimator of driving expe-rience controlled. Results. Higher cognitive failure predicted more driving errors (p <. 01) when age, gender and driving experience were controlled in analysis. Conclusions. Cognitive failure was significantly associ-ated with observed driving errors. Systematic research on cognitive failure in driving beginners is recommended. young drivers cognitive failure conscientiousness traffic safet...|$|R
