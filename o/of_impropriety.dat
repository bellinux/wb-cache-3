5|$|In 1869, Sir Charles Mordaunt, a British Member of Parliament, {{threatened}} to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, {{he did not}} do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the House of Commons. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> was damaging.|$|E
5|$|On September 21, 1970, Wilhelm was {{selected}} off waivers by the Chicago Cubs, {{for whom he}} appeared in three games. He was traded back to the Braves for Hal Breeden after the season. As the Cubs had acquired Wilhelm {{late in the season}} to bolster their playoff contention, the trade back to the Braves was a source of controversy. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn investigated the transaction, and in December ruled that he did not find evidence <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> associated with the transactions that sent Wilhelm to the Cubs and quickly back to the Braves.|$|E

5|$|The {{civil parish}} of Burnham-on-Sea and Highbridge has {{responsibility}} for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) {{to cover the}} council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. In recent years the parish council has become a significant grant funder of local organisations and events. There is currently a debate underway about the correct disbursement and monitoring of these grants, following allegations <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> regarding some councillors.|$|E

25|$|The {{latter part}} of Gibbs' tenure as Chief Justice was {{dominated}} by allegations <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> against Lionel Murphy, a fellow justice of the High Court.

Two Senate Committees were established to look into the matter along with the Stewart Royal Commission in NSW to look into the tapes. A lengthy court case ensued resulting in Murphy's acquittal.|$|E

25|$|Although Baker {{claimed that}} his {{relationship}} with the woman was a love-affair which had not yet been consummated, the outcry surrounding the incident led to a series of accusations <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> on Baker's part, including the admissions by several female members of the community that they had had affairs with Baker before or during his tenure as abbot. The community's sense of crisis sharpened when the woman's husband, one of SFZC's primary benefactors, threatened to hold the organization legally responsible for its abbot's apparent misconduct.|$|E
25|$|Sparks and WFAA's sports director, Dale Hansen, {{decided to}} follow up on the tip and asked Stanley to speak with them {{regarding}} this newest set of allegations <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> by SMU. Stanley claimed that SMU athletic officials paid him $25,000 to sign with SMU in 1983 and continued to pay him monthly while he played for the Mustangs. His mother, Dawn, and his father, Harley, were also given money according to Stanley's claims. If these claims were proven true, this would have meant that SMU was still paying players after assuring the NCAA that payments had stopped.|$|E

25|$|However, Savage had an impetuous {{nature and}} he found himself in trouble after leaving home and moving to Gisborne at the age of 21 after falling out with his father.

There he found work as a farmhand with a local farmer by the name of Tom Murray at his {{property}} around Ryal Bush. Sometime later he and Murray's daughter, Lettie, became engaged although the pair were not married before the war in Europe separated them.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} issued {{new rules}} on December 28, 2012 requiring Internet users {{to provide their}} real names to service providers, while assigning Internet companies greater responsibility for deleting forbidden postings and reporting them to the authorities. The new regulations, issued by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, allow Internet users to continue to adopt pseudonyms for their online postings, {{but only if they}} first provide their real names to service providers, a measure that could chill some of the vibrant discourse on the country’s Twitter-like microblogs. The authorities periodically detain and even jail Internet users for politically sensitive comments, such as calls for a multiparty democracy or accusations <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> by local officials.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notorious {{examples}} <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> {{on the part of}} the railroads surround the process of land acquisition and sales. Since the federal government granted to the companies alternate tracts of land that ran along the tracks they had laid, it was generally assumed that the land would in turn be sold at its fair market value at the time the land was subdivided; circulars distributed by the SP (which was at the time a holding company formed by the Central Pacific Railroad) certainly implied as much. However, at least some of the tracts were put on the market only after considerable time had passed, and the land improved well beyond its raw state.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Master of the Hospitallers, Fulk de Villaret, {{was also}} delayed in his travel to France, {{as he was}} engaged with a battle at Rhodes. He did not arrive until late summer, so while waiting for his arrival, Molay met the Pope to discuss other matters, {{one of which was}} the charges by one or more ousted Templars who had made accusations <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> in the Templars' {{initiation}} ceremony. Molay had already spoken with the king in Paris on 24 June 1307 about the accusations against his order and was partially reassured. Returning to Poitiers, Molay asked the Pope to set up an inquiry to quickly clear the Order of the rumours and accusations surrounding it, and the Pope convened an inquiry on 24 August.|$|E
25|$|McCreight {{resigned}} in 1872 on a motion of non-confidence, and on December 23, 1872, Trutch asked De Cosmos {{to form a}} new government as Premier. De Cosmos populated his cabinet with reformers, mostly born in North America, many of whom would come to dominate provincial politics for a generation. His government pursued an agenda of political reform, economic expansion, and the development of public institutions — especially schools. De Cosmos also focused on advancing the completion of the transcontinental railway promised under the Terms of Union. It was, however, De Cosmos' attempt to alter the Terms of Union in order to obtain monetary guarantees from the federal government to complete a dry dock at Esquimalt that eventually led to accusations <b>of</b> <b>impropriety,</b> and ended his provincial political career. He speculated heavily in land and in Texada Island Iron mines, which brought further criticism, as he was a public official. Thus he ended his tenure as Premier on February 9, 1874.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the middle}} of the fifteenth century the patriarch Shemon IV Basidi made the patriarchal {{succession}} hereditary, normally from uncle to nephew. This practice, which resulted in a shortage of eligible heirs, eventually led to a schism in the Church of the East. The patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb (1539–58) caused great offence {{at the beginning of his}} reign by designating his twelve-year-old nephew Khnanisho as his successor, presumably because no older relatives were available. Several years later, probably because Khnanisho had died in the interim, he designated as successor his fifteen-year-old brother Eliya, the future patriarch Eliya (VI) VII (1558–91). These appointments, combined with other accusations <b>of</b> <b>impropriety,</b> caused discontent throughout the church, and by 1552 Shemon VII Ishoyahb had become so unpopular that a group of bishops, principally from the Amid, Sirt and Salmas districts in northern Mesopotamia, chose a new patriarch, electing a monk named Yohannan Sulaqa, the former superior of Rabban Hormizd Monastery near the Assyrian town of Alqosh. However, no bishop of metropolitan rank was available to consecrate him, as canonically required. Franciscan missionaries were already at work among the Nestorians, and they persuaded Sulaqa's supporters to legitimise their position by seeking their candidate's consecration by Pope Julius III (1550–5).|$|E
