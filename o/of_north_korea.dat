5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> tend to speak positively <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E
5|$|While the US X Corps {{was being}} {{evacuated}} {{from the eastern}} front, the US Eighth Army had already retreated to the 38th parallel {{on the western front}} {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. With the entire UN front collapsing, the race to the Yalu was ended with the communist forces of China recapturing much <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea.</b> The Korean War would drag on for another two and a half years before the armistice was signed on 27 July 1953. Besides the loss <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> the US X Corps and the ROK I Corps later reported a total of 10,495 battle casualties, of which 4,385 were from the US Marines, 3,163 were from the US Army, 2,812 were from South Koreans attached to American formations and 78 were from the British Royal Marines. Outside of the combat losses, the 1st Marine Division also reported 7,338 non-battle casualties due to the cold weather.|$|E

Han became the minister of education in May 1956 and retained his post as the chairman of the Writers' Union. During his ministerial career, Han initiated a campaign to diminish the importance of Russian language teaching in North Korean colleges in the spring of 1956.

5|$|On 25 November, the Chinese {{entered the}} war in defense <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea.</b> The People's Liberation Army force, which totaled 260,000 troops, flooded into North Korea and caught the Eighth Army by surprise. Chinese forces crushed the UN and South Korean forces with {{overwhelming}} numbers, surrounding and destroying elements of the US 2nd Infantry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and South Korean forces. The 24th Infantry Division, {{on the west coast}} of the Korean peninsula, was hit by soldiers from the 50th and 66th Chinese field armies. Amid heavy casualties, the Eighth Army retreated to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force.|$|E
5|$|The Air Battle of South Korea {{was an air}} {{campaign}} early in the Korean War occurring roughly from June 25 to July 20, 1950, over South Korea between the air forces <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> and the United Nations, including the countries of South Korea, the United States and the United Kingdom. The month-long fight for air supremacy over the country saw several small engagements over airfields in Seoul and Taejon and ultimately ended in victory for the UN air force, which was able to destroy the small North Korean People's Air Force.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{tracking}} inland on July16, {{interaction with}} China's mountainous terrain disrupted {{the organization of}} Billie, weakening it down to tropical storm intensity. However, the tropical cyclone's stint over land was short-lived as the system quickly curved northward into the Yellow Sea by July17. Despite moving back over water, Billie continued to weaken, and made landfall on the western coast <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> with winds of 75km/h (40mph). Over the Korean peninsula, Billie began to intake cold air from a polar front, enabling the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone by 1800UTC that day. These remnants tracked eastward across the Sea of Japan before they were last noted just off of Hokkaido on July18.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned {{too late}} to see any combat in World War II, Boxer {{spent much of her}} career in the Pacific Ocean seeing 10 tours in the western Pacific. Her initial duties {{involved}} mostly training and exercises, including launching the first carrier-based jet aircraft, but demobilization prevented much activity in the late 1940s. At the outbreak of the Korean War, she was used as an aircraft transport before arriving off Korean waters as the third U.S. carrier to join the force. She supported the Inchon landings and subsequent invasion <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> and was among the ships that provided support during the Chinese counteroffensive against an under-prepared and spread out United Nations (UN) force. She saw three subsequent combat tours in Korea conducting close air support and strategic bombing in support of UN ground troops fighting along the 38th parallel, as the battles lines had largely solidified by this time. She was awarded eight battle stars for her service in Korea.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November, China {{entered the}} war on the side <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> against the UN. Massed Chinese attacks were {{immediately}} launched against troops of the corps. The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties, ordering a complete withdraw to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force. In {{the wake of the}} retreat, the disorganized Eighth Army regrouped and re-formed. I Corps relinquished command of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, and the 27th British Brigade, taking command of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division in their place. On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops attacked the Eighth Army's line at the Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, battered by the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground.|$|E

In that year they were reclassified Chŏngiha (전기하) class and numbered 전기하1 through 전기하9, and were refurbished at the engine shops at Yangdŏk for use on the Yangdŏk-Ch'ŏnsŏng section of the P'yŏngra Line, which had been electrified in 1956 as the first stage <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> electrification plans.|$|R
5|$|When Korea {{was split}} into two {{separate}} countries, North and South, along the 38th parallel tensions {{between the two countries}} were worsened when other countries began to get involved on both sides. The communist country <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> was supported by Russia, China and others, while the democratic South was supported by the United Nations and the United States. In 1950 the United States got involved and {{over the next three years}} more than 1.5 million US service members would serve in Korea. During the three years of the war 133 Medals of Honor were presented and although more than 150,000 Jewish American men and women were serving in Korea at that time, not one received the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Amphibious {{landings}} at Inchon by X Corps hit North Korean {{forces from}} behind, allowing I Corps and IX Corps {{to break out}} of Pusan. Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city. The advance continued, but against unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance. On 25 October the first Chinese prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops. By the end of October the city of Chongju, forty miles from the Yalu River border <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> had been captured.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, X Corps, with the 7th Infantry Division and 1st Marine Division, {{attacked}} Incheon, striking the North Korean army from the rear. The attack routed the surprised North Koreans, and by 19 September, the Eighth Army {{pushed out of}} the Pusan Perimeter and advanced north. The 24th Infantry Division advanced to Songju, then to Seoul. The Army advanced north along {{the west coast of}} Korea through October. By mid-October, the North Korean Army had been almost completely destroyed, and US President Harry S. Truman ordered General MacArthur to advance all units into North Korea as quickly as possible to end the war. The 24th Infantry Division, with the South Korean 1st Infantry Division, moved to the left flank of the advancing Eighth Army, and moved north along Korea's west coast. The 24th Division then moved north to Chongju. On 1 November, the division's 21st Infantry captured Chonggodo, 18 miles from the Yalu River and Korea's border with China. Units of the Eighth Army and X Corps spread out as they attempted to reach the Yalu and complete the conquest <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> as quickly as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Claims {{similar to}} Ilbe's were disproved by the {{government}} a few times. The Minister of National Defense, Kim Gwan-jin, dismissed the allegation <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> involvement during democratization as 'groundless'. The Korean Communications Standards Commission decided to take disciplinary action against the right-wing television news programs, 'TV Chosun' and 'Channel A', which made allegation <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> involvement during democratization. It was accused of [...] "both defamation and spreading false information".|$|R

5|$|Following {{the impacts}} of Wipha to the already {{severely}} flooded areas <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea,</b> the International Red Cross delivered relief supplies to the 2,000 people made homeless by the typhoon. Hundreds of medical clinics which were damaged or destroyed set up makeshift clinics as up to 70 percent of the affected population reported abdominal pains or diarrhea. More than 23,000 volunteers from the Red Cross mobilized to provide quick rehabilitation in the affected regions. By mid-September, €420,000 ($527,000 USD) was provided to repair hospitals and an additional €110,000 ($138,000USD) was planned to be sent. By the end of September, health kits were provided for 300,000 people and an additional $300,000 (USD) was provided for medical supplies in hospitals. From October15 to 18, a Rapid Nutritional Screening of children {{took place in the}} worst affected areas. Eleven hospitals were restocked with medical supplies and a permanent water supply was constructed at the Wonsan general hospital. About $180,000 in aid from Norway was sent to North Korea. By October 22, 2007, 80 percent of the $14.1million pledged in assistance had been funded. About 4,800 tonnes of cereal was to be distributed in October as part of the second shipment of food, following the first which was sent prior to Wipha. Funds and materials, worth $166,000 (USD), for revegetation were expected to arrive between December 2007 and February 2008.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} {{reaching}} its peak intensity, Wipha began to weaken as {{it started to}} interact with the high terrain of Taiwan. Early on September18, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon Goring as it left their area of responsibility. Later that day, the center of the typhoon passed roughly 130km/h (80mi) north of Taipei, Taiwan. Continued weakening took place as the storm neared landfall in Mainland China. Around 1800UTC, the eye of Wipha crossed the Chinese coastline near Wenzhou with sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph 10-minute sustained). The JTWC assessed Wipha to have made landfall as a low-end Category3 typhoon with winds of 185km/h (115mph 1-minute sustained). Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved further inland. The JTWC issued their final advisory on Wipha during the afternoon of September19 as they classified the system as an extratropical cyclone. However, the JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression until September20. At this time, the remnants of Wipha had entered the Yellow Sea and accelerated northeastward towards the Korean Peninsula. The extratropical remnants of Wipha persisted for several more hours before dissipating off the coast <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> that afternoon.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November, China {{entered the}} war on the side <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> against the UN. Massed Chinese attacks were {{immediately}} launched against troops of the corps, with Chinese forces penetrating the corps' rear from its exposed east flank. The 2nd Infantry Division, {{at the front of}} IX Corp's advance in Kunuri, was overwhelmed from all sides by Chinese forces of the 40th CPV Army Corps, and elements from the 38th CPV Army Corps on 29 November in the Battle of Kunuri. By 1 December, the division was almost completely destroyed; it lost virtually all of its heavy equipment and vehicles, as well as suffering 4,940 men killed or missing. The 25th Infantry Division, on its western flank, was also hit by overwhelming Chinese forces of the 39th CPV Army Corps, facing strong attacks and suffering heavy casualties and losses in equipment in the Battle of Ch'ongch'on River. However, it was spared the same losses as the 2nd Infantry Division by escaping across the Ch'ongch'on River. The Eighth Army suffered heavy casualties, ordering a complete withdraw to the Imjin River, south of the 38th parallel, having been devastated by the overwhelming Chinese force. IX Corps retreated along the western coast to safety via Anju.|$|E

Chapter 1 presents <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> initial and subsequent economic plans. Chapter 2 contains a literature review of previous studies <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> foreign trade, and a discussion of data problems and methods used in preparing the data. Chapter 3 examines changes in the composition and level <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> trade, and changes in its balance of trade. Chapter 4 analyzes changing patterns <b>of</b> <b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> foreign trade through the coefficient of redistribution and the shift-share technique. Chapter 5 examines North Korean imports and exports through regression analysis, particularly the effects of foreign debt problem and open door policy on the North Korean imports. Chapters 6 and 7 detail North Korean trade with communist and noncommunist partners. In Chapter 8, the prospect for economic cooperation between the two Koreas is explored.
