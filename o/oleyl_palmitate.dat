40|$|A novel nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) assay has been developed to monitor lipase-catalyzed esterification reactions without the need to extract and purify the individual components. The technique measures ratios of ester:alcohol signals and {{has been shown to}} be both efficient and reproducible. The assay has proven useful as a quick screen for the effect of varying conditions on the extent of esterification in various biphasic solvent systems and can be applied to both saturated and unsaturated long-chain fatty acid and alcohol substrates. The NMR ratio technique has been used to quantitate the extent of reaction in the Candida cylindracea lipase-catalyzed synthesis of <b>oleyl</b> <b>palmitate,</b> stearyl palmitate, oleyl oleate, oleyl gamma-linolenate and oleyl linoleate. The identity of these products was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry...|$|E
3000|$|The {{chemical}} composition of six lipophilic extractives from wheat straw by extraction with toluene-ethanol (2 [*]:[*] 1, v/v), chloroform-methanol (2 [*]:[*] 1, v/v), methyl tert-butyl ether, hexane, petroleum ether, and dichloromethane, respectively, in a Soxhlet extractor, and one water-soluble lipophilic extract has been examined. Five main lipid classes (free fatty/resin acids, sterols, waxes, steryl esters, triglycerides) {{were identified and}} their individual components quantified by gas chromatography as their trimethylsilyl (TMS) esters (free fatty/resin acids) and TMS ethers (sterols). The abundant saturated fatty acids were palmitic acid (C 16 : 0), myristic acid (C 14 : 0), and pentadecanoic acid (C 15 : 0). Palmitoleic acid (C 16 : 1), linoleic acid (C 18 : 2), and oleic acid (C 18 : 1) were the major unsaturated free fatty acids. Abietic acid was detected as the only single component in the resin acids. Of the sterols identified, Î²-sitosterol {{was found to be}} the major compound together with minor amounts of cholesterol, ergosterol, stigmasterol, and stigmastanol. Palmityl palmitate and <b>oleyl</b> <b>palmitate</b> were identified as the major components in waxes. The steryl esters analyzed were composed of steryl laurate, steryl myristate, steryl palmitate, steryl heptadecanoate, and steryl oleate. Tripalmitin, dipalmitoyl-oleoylglycerol, and triolein were the major components of the triglycerides.|$|E
