Hinde that he had visited the region in order that the people might see and know their superintendent; remarking, [...] "The {{shepherd}} ought to know the flock, and the flock the shepherd: they ought to know what man it is that governs them, and I have come nearly one hundred miles out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see them." [...] The writer exclaims, [...] "O Asbury, the inhabitants of these hills and mountains will long make mention of thee!" ...|$|E

Tarantino said: [...] "I didn't go out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do a rip-off of The Killing, but I did {{think of it}} as my [...] "Killing," [...] my take on that kind of heist movie." [...] The film's plot was suggested by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Tarantino has denied that he plagiarized with Reservoir Dogs and instead said that he does homages. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire.|$|E

6000|$|Edgar {{gave him}} a brief sketch {{of what he had}} been doing since he had been away, and then said, [...] "I am desirous <b>of</b> making <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> England. <b>Of</b> course it will be {{impossible}} to go direct, but if I could get to Italy, I might get a ship home from there." ...|$|R

'But {{when you}} speak--when Guy speaks <b>of</b> <b>my</b> holding the place I do, you little {{know what it}} is to feel that powers of {{usefulness}} are wasted--to know I have the means <b>of</b> working <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> honour and distinction, such as you would rejoice in Laura, to have it all within, yet feel it thrown away. Locksley Hall, again--"every door is barred with gold, and opens but to golden keys.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I {{would not}} suit you," [...] said Geoffrey. [...] "I'm rather too fond <b>of</b> <b>my</b> own <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{make a good}} servant, and of late I have not done badly {{fighting}} for my own hand. Therefore, while I thank you, and should be glad to undertake any minor contracts you can give me, I prefer to continue as at present." ...|$|R

60|$|As {{the boat}} {{approached}} {{me in the}} moonlight, this person corrected my first impression, and revealed herself as a young girl. So far as I could perceive she was a stranger to me. Who could the girl be, alone on the river {{at that time of}} night? Idly curious I followed the boat, instead <b>of</b> pursuing <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the village, to see whether she would stop at the mill, or pass it.|$|R

'With a parting nod the two old soldiers strode off together down the crowded Fore Street, while I made the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> the Mayor's hospitable dwelling, where I had to repeat my story all over again to the assembled household before I was at last suffered to seek my room.|$|R

60|$|I {{took the}} next train back. I do not now travel much out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see the {{original}} {{of the picture}} postcard. Maybe others have had like experience and the picture postcard {{as a guide to}} the Continent has lost its value.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{intend to}} stop here, but I heard such a barking and {{screaming}} in your cabin, that I turned out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{see what the}} row was about. I've just come up from the railroad. Does old Michaels keep store here yet?" ...|$|E

Still, if one got mixed up with any of that East-Side crowd, he would be a mighty useful friend to have. I guess there's no harm done by getting him grateful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why {{the devil}} has the Sergeant sent {{for me to}} travel {{a hundred and fifty}} miles in this outlandish manner? Give me an offing, and the enemy in sight, and I'll play with him in his own fashion, as long as he pleases, long bows or close quarters; but to be shot like a turtle asleep is not to my humor. If it were not for little Magnet there, I would tack ship this instant, make the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> back <b>to</b> York, and let Ontario take care of itself, salt water or fresh water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the meantime," [...] I continued, [...] "I may {{discover}} some means <b>of</b> winning <b>my</b> <b>way</b> alone <b>to</b> {{the land}} of the yellow men, but if I am unsuccessful one life only will have been sacrificed. Should we all go on and perish, there will be none to guide a succoring party to Dejah Thoris and your daughter." ...|$|R
60|$|If I {{had only}} {{asked her what}} {{associations}} she connected with my Christian name--if I had only persuaded her to speak in the briefest and most guarded terms of her past life--the barrier between us, which the change in our names and the lapse of ten years had raised, must have been broken down; the recognition must have followed. But I never even thought of it; and for this simple reason--I {{was in love with}} her. The purely selfish idea <b>of</b> winning <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> her favorable regard by taking instant advantage of the new interest that I had awakened in her was the one idea which occurred to my mind.|$|R
6000|$|Hardy {{shook his}} head impatiently. [...] "You don't seem to suffer from an excess of intellect yourself," [...] he retorted.

60|$|Next Day {{we set out}} for Victoria. It is a sweet, delicious, and {{pleasant}} Town. It received that Name in Memory of a considerable Victory there obtained over the Moors.

5000|$|Frenzy is {{an album}} {{released}} by Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper in 1986. It was re-released on CD in 2005 {{with the entire}} contents of the mini-album Get Out <b>Of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Way!</b> added <b>to</b> the end. The CD uses the Get Out <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Way!</b> mix <b>of</b> [...] "Stuffin' Martha's Muffin", which filters the telephone conversation part of Nixon's opening monologue to sound like he is talking on the phone, instead of the original Frenzy LP mix. [...] "Transylvanian Xmas" [...] is a version of [...] "Joy to the World", performed by Roper on harmonica with the melody tweaked to sound spooky with Nixon on bongos. [...] "Jesus at McDonalds" [...] is a newer recording of the song from their first LP, Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper.|$|R
5000|$|The lyrics <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Way</b> {{are related}} <b>to</b> those of Comme d'habitude {{in terms of}} {{structure}} and metre, but the meaning is completely different. The French song is about routine in a relationship that is falling out of love, while the English language version is set {{at the end of}} a lifetime, approaching death, and looking back without regret - expressing feelings that are more related to Piaf's song [...] "Non, je ne regrette rien".|$|R
60|$|Now {{all this}} leads very {{directly}} {{to a discussion of}} the relations of a person <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> thinking <b>to</b> the Church and religious institutions generally. I have already discussed my relation to commonly accepted beliefs, but the question of institutions is, it seems to me, a different one altogether. Not to realize that, to confuse a church with its creed, is to prepare the ground for a mass of disastrous and life-wasting errors.|$|R

"By {{this means}} I got {{clear of the}} current {{and was able to}} steer within {{a quarter of a mile}} of the beach, which indeed I might have {{approached}} still nearer by making another tack, but being an excellent swimmer, I deemed it best to leave the vessel, which was almost waterlogged, and to make the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> the shore.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have fallen}} {{head over heels}} {{in love with the}} young lady," [...] he confessed. [...] "Don't think I am a confounded jackass. I am not in the habit of doing such things.

'Everything is wearisome; {{but here}} I have a proud feeling <b>of</b> having paid <b>my</b> <b>way.</b> <b>To</b> have settled {{in advance for}} your dinner for six weeks to come is a {{magnificent}} thing.

60|$|I have a {{place where}} I buy very nice {{homemade}} biscuits, sweet crackers, etc. Among others, one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>ways</b> is <b>to</b> get a good lot of these, and, for supper, go {{through a couple of}} wards and give a portion to each man--next day two wards more, and so on. Then each marked case needs something to itself. I spend my evenings altogether at the hospitals--my days often. I give little gifts of money in small sums, which I am enabled to do--all sorts of things indeed, food, clothing, letter-stamps (I write lots of letters), now and then a good pair of crutches, etc., etc. Then I read to the boys. The whole ward that can walk gathers around me and listens.|$|R
