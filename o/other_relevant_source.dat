The writer conducts this research by using descriptive method. In collecting data, the speech and its history were taken from the website American speech miler center and <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>source</b> from internet as a source data. The data analysis was based on by Halliday and Hasan (1976) and supported by De Beaugrande and Dressler (1986 : 8) and Brown and Yule (1983 : 191). These five general cohesive devices were applied in George W. Bush 2 ̆ 7 s speech. The theory consists of five devices, they are:pronoun (personal, possessive, demonstrative, and interrogative pronoun) substitusion, ellipsis, conjuction (adversative, temporal, coordinating, correlative, subordinating, and causal), lexical (repetition, synonym, antonym, hyponym, equivalent, correlation). The result of this research shows that there are 76 pronouns consist with 48 personal pronouns, 16 demonstrative pronouns, 12 interrogative pronouns, and there is no possessive pronoun, and there are 2 subtitusions, 49 conjuctions consist with 43 coordinating conjunctions, 4 adversative conjunctions, 3 causal conjunctions, 2 temporal conjunctions, and there is no correlative and subordinating conjunction, and also there are 15 lexicals, and there is no ellipsi...|$|E

The data analysis was based on by Juez (2008 : 20) and supportedby De Beaugrande and Dressler (1986 : 8) and Aarts and Aarts (1982 : 4). These discourse analysis norms were applied in the Martin Luther King Jr 2 ̆ 7 s Speech. The theory consists of seven norms, they are: cohesion (pronoun, substitusion, ellipsis, conjuction, and lexical), coherence (mark coherence and unmark coherence), intentionality, acceptability, informatifity, situationality, and intertextuality. The result of this research shows that in the cohesion norm, there are 131 pronouns, 52 subtitusion, 1 ellipsis, 90 conjuction and 16 lexical. In coherence norm, there are 46 mark coherence and there is no unmark coherence. There are also others norms like intentionality, acceptability, informatifity, situationality, and intertextuality.

Customs supervision and service office has role in controlling and analyzing thecountry acceptance potency because there are still many violation happening aroundthe customs supervision and service office. This research is aimed to understand the kind of effort that can be done bycustoms supervision and service office in controlling the excise wisdoms, role andfunction of customs supervision and service office and the obstacle that may beexperienced by customs supervision and service office in the implementation ofmonitoring of the excise wisdom. Research methods used is descriptive qualitative. The primary data sources were taken from interview, information from document,archives, and <b>other</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>source</b> to this research. Result of the research show that customs supervision and service office medium type of Kudus 2 ̆ 7 excise has efforts in monitoring and giving service to the service users through the preventive effort in form of administration monitoring and socializing to the service users and societies that involve in the cigarette industries. Repressive effort is one way to save the country disadvantage and decrease the excise violation. The repressive effort is being done by the physical monitoring and examination to the companies, regular market checking, and treating the violation with criminal and administration sanctions. The suggested recommendation is to increase the monitoring ability within the five working areas of customs supervision and service office of medium type Kudus 2 ̆ 7 excise by optimizing more performance of customs supervision and service office of medium type Kudus 2 ̆ 7 excise workers cooperate with local government and give the appeal to society about the danger it may cause because of violation in the cigarette production activities...|$|E
