40|$|The {{elimination}} of all external incisions {{is an important}} step in reducing the invasiveness of surgical procedures. Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is an incision-less surgery and provides explicit benefits such as reducing patient trauma and shortening recovery time. However, technological difficulties impede the widespread utilization of the NOTES method. A novel robotic tool has been developed, which makes NOTES procedures feasible by using multiple <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> tips. The robotic tool has the capability of entering the body cavity through an orifice or a single incision using a flexible articulated positioning mechanism and once inserted is not constrained by incisions, allowing for visualization and manipulations throughout the cavity. Multiple <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> tips of the robotic device initially consist of three end effectors: a grasper, scissors, and an atraumatic Babcock clamp. The tool changer is capable of selecting and switching between the three tools depending on the surgical task using a miniature mechanism driven by micro-motors. The robotic tool is remotely controlled through a joystick and computer interface. In this thesis, the following aspects of this robotic tool will be detailed. The first-generation robot is designed as a conceptual model for implementing a novel mechanism of switching, advancing, and controlling the tool tips using two micro-motors. It is believed that this mechanism achieves a reduction in cumbersome instrument exchanges and can reduce overall procedure time and the risk of inadvertent tissue trauma during exchanges with a natural orifice approach. Also, placing actuators directly at the surgical site enables the robot to generate sufficient force to operate effectively. Mounting the multifunctional robot on the distal end of an articulating tube provides freedom from restriction on the robot kinematics and helps solve some of the difficulties otherwise faced during surgery using NOTES or related approaches. The second-generation multifunctional robot is then introduced in which the overall size is reduced and two arms provide 2 additional degrees of freedom, resulting in feasibility of insertion through the esophagus and increased dexterity. Improvements are necessary in future iterations of the multifunctional robot; however, the work presented is a proof of concept for NOTES robots capable of abdominal surgical interventions...|$|R

40|$|Study Objective: To {{highlight}} {{the first case}} of laparoscopic hysterectomy performed with percutaneous instruments (The Percuvance System, Teleflex Incorporated, Wayne, PA). Design: The basis {{of the system is}} a < 3 -mm diameter shaft that, when connected to an introducer tool tip, can be inserted percutaneously through the skin. The introducer tool tip can then be exchanged outside the body {{for a wide variety of}} 5 -mm <b>interchangeable</b> surgical <b>tool</b> tips. The shaft is sufficiently strong to hold structures, and surgeons can use its <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> tips to grasp, cut, and manipulate tissue. We used a 3 -dimensional high-definition 10 -mm flexible tip endoscope (ENDOEYE FLEX 3 D, Olympus Winter & IBE GMBH, Hamburg, Germany). Background: Minilaparoscopy is an attractive approach for hysterectomy due to advantages such as reduced morbidities and enhanced cosmesis. However, it has not been popularized because of the lack of suitable instruments and high technical demand. The Percuvance system represents a significant advance in minimally invasive surgery. Setting: Catholic University of the Sacred Hearth, Rome, Italy. Patient: A 53 -year-old, multiparous patient with endometrial endometroid cancer grade 1, Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique stage IA. The patient provided informed consent to use the images and video of the procedure. Institutional review board approval was not required. Intervention: The patient was hysteroscopically diagnosed with endometrial cancer after removal of an endometrial polyp adnexectomy. Once referred to our center, surgical staging was planned, including total hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy. Laparoscopy with 2 lateral percutaneous and 1 soprapubic 3 -mm instruments was believed to be feasible to achieve these procedures. Main Results: The operation was performed successfully with no intraoperative or postoperative complications. Operative time was 80 minutes overall, and blood loss was 50 mL. The pathology report confirmed endometrial endometroid cancer grading 1, Fédération Internationale de Gynécologie et d'Obstétrique stage IA. The patient was discharged on day 1. After 2 months, no late complications or recurrence was detected. Conclusion: Percutaneous total hysterectomy is technically feasible, and the use of this novel device permits surgeons to mantain a standard setting. Further studies are mandatory to define the benefits, advantages, and costs of this novel approach with respect to other minimally invasive approaches...|$|R
40|$|A {{new era of}} {{robotic surgery}} is poised to begin when {{critical}} patents held by Intuitive Surgical (IS) expire in 2016. IS market dominance for decades {{has led to an}} effective monopoly that will be challenged by several commercial enterprises working on next generation general robotic surgery systems. Robotic surgery has the potential to alleviate the skill-gap between experienced and inexperienced surgeons through the automation of sub-tasks within surgicalprocedures. The primary objective of this dissertation is to explore the process of design itself through the presentation of these devices. The common intention throughout the presented case studies is Frugal Design. Secondarily, this dissertation explores limitations of current surgical automation and addresses the design considerations of hardware modifcations to the daVinci Research Kit which enable automation. Part I (Chapter 1) of this dissertation describes the considerations that make a design frugal and the methodology used by the author across three conceptual examples including:- an inexpensive physical environment for machine learning,- a device for cloud-enabled irrigation optimization, and- an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> interface for surgical robotics. Part II of this dissertation presents frugal design case studies for system components that enable an automated silicone-phantom tumorectomy. Chapter 2 provides an overview of existing technology and related work in the field of surgical automation. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 describe designs for devices that enable automation of the four subtasksinvolved in a tumorectomey: Palpation, Incision, Debridement, and Closure. Specifically, these devices include:- an inexpensive palpation probe to locate tumors (Chapter 3),- an <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tool</b> interface for surgical robotics (Chapter 5),- a fluid injector for surgical robotics (Chapter 4), and- a passive needle orientation texture (Chapter 6). Part III of this dissertation describes the design theory behind the author's work presented in Part 1 (examples) and Part 2 (case studies). In Chapter 7, a short history of design theory in the Bauhaus school of (1919 - 1933) is presented through examples taken from the author's work. Chapter 8 serves as a link to future efforts by the author by bridging the presented frugal design work into the global development effort of frugal innovation. The design theory material in Part 3 is presented for three reasons:First: Conceptual design depends on the practitioner's ability to abstract design criteria into diverse functional solutions. The author's practice in this area involves the artistic study of functionalist abstraction as unconstrained exploration of the design space. That practice is presented to elucidate the creative origins of the solutions presented herein, and to provoke creative problem solving in others. Second: A socially-progressive responsibility, inherent in the Bauhaus ideology, is modernized in Chapter 8 as Frugal Design, which borrows its motivation from a new trend indevelopment for emerging markets known as Frugal Innovation. Third: A parallel is drawn to the climate of artificially intelligent automation in present-day Bay Area research in Berkeley, Stanford, and Silicon Valley to the Bauhaus, which was founded as a reaction to increasing automation during the first machine age in Germany...|$|R

40|$|Background: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines (CPG) {{have been}} shown to improve processes of care and clinical outcomes. The present study sought to determine how clinicians in Queensland public hospitals view and use such guidelines. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted of a convenience sample of medical practitioners, nurses and allied-health professionals in 19 public hospitals. Results: Of 333 surveyed clinicians, 216 returned questionnaires (65 % response rate). Of these, 67 % reported guideline use in their clinical area; more so in general than in tertiary hospitals (75 % vs. 60 %; P = 0. 03) or in district hospitals (75 % vs. 56 %; P = 0. 05). The guidelines were considered useful by 85 % of respondents; 45 % used them at least once a week. Lack of awareness of guidelines (45 %) or inability to access them when needed (44 %) prevented greater use. Concise, quickreference formats were preferred to detailed texts (35 % vs. 6 %; P < 0. 001). Sixty per cent of respondents became acquainted with guideline recommendations through informal discussions with colleagues rather than through organized awareness-raising (27 %) or educational forums (41 %; P < 0. 001). Guideline endorsement by senior colleagues (68 %) and peers (53 %) was considered essential to maximizing uptake. Barriers to implementing guideline recommendations were encountered by 62 % of clinicians, including insufficient clinical resources (29 %) or time (24 %), and conflict with accepted practice codes (19 %). Conclusions: In general, clinicians working in public hospitals use CPG and view them positively. Based on freetext comments, a minority of non-medical respondents perceived guidelines and pathways as <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tools.</b> Improved uptake is dependent on increasing access, enhancing user-friendly guideline presentation, deploying local opinion leaders, and mitigating environmental barriers to implementation.

40|$|PDE-based {{numerical}} simulation applications commonly use basic software infrastructure to manage mesh, geometry, and discretization data.

40|$|The key task in {{initiating}} the fabrication of mirror substrates {{for the new}} High NA Camera is in preparing the specification package that details the substrate geometry and the specifications for the optical surface. This specification package has been completed for substrate M 1, and the vendor has begun optical fabrication. In addition, mounting hardware has been designed and fabricated, and substrates have been bonded to the kinematic mounts. The design of the secondary substrate, M 2, is underway, but will depend upon details of the PO Box actuation system and space constraints. Sufficient details of the M 2 design to enable the vendor to procure material will be determined during October, while the final details of the mounting surfaces will be completed prior {{to the end of}} Q 4 1999. The geometry of the Ml substrate is compatible with our planned approach for fixturing the optic within the PO Box and within metrology tools. The completion of this specification package required detailed consideration of: the mounting approach within the PO Box, degrees of actuation required for PO Box alignment, space constraints imposed by the vendor's metrology, requirements for LLNL metrology, and datum definitions needed for mechanical assembly of the PO Box. In addition, each of the degrees of freedom of the substrate has been properly constrained, and shown to be sufficiently insensitive to disturbance forces for minimizing deformation. An approach to fixturing has been adopted that extends beyond the approach taken for the Engineering Test Stand (ETS). For the ETS, each substrate, including spares, has dedicated mounting hardware that is used exclusively for each element. In exchange for a reduced risk of mounting-induced deformation, this incurred substantial expense and precluded optics from using <b>interchangeable</b> <b>tooling.</b> For the current High NA camera, we have adopted an approach that employs interchangeable mounting hardware {{that can be used for}} any of the substrates. This approach better accommodates a large number of manufacturing spares and the need for different mounting hardware for the PO Box and the metrology tools. This approach was enabled by designing the mounting hardware to minimize differences in the disturbance forces offered by different fixtures on the optic. An error budget and sensitivity analysis indicates that figure errors induced on the optics due to changes in fixturing are within the required tolerances for high quality imaging. The specifications for the optical surface on Ml are nominally the same as for the ETS substrates. These impose requirements for 0. 25 nm rms for figure, 0. 20 nm rms for mid-spatial frequency roughness, and 0. 10 nm rms for high spatial frequency roughness. These designations are sufficient for controlling wavefront quality, image contrast, and multilayer reflectivity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{development}} of new technologies in surgery, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has drastically improved the way conventional medical procedures are performed. However, a new learning curve has resulted requiring an expertise in integrating visual information with the kinematics and dynamics of the surgical tools. The Red DRAGON is a multi-modal simulator for teaching and training MIS procedures allowing one to use it with several modalities including: simulator (physical objects and virtual objects) and an animal model. The Red DRAGON system is based on a serial spherical mechanism in which all the rotation axes intersect at a single point (remote center) allowing the endoscopic tools to pivot around the MIS port. The system includes two mechanisms that incorporate two <b>interchangeable</b> MIS <b>tools.</b> Sensors are incorporated into the mechanism and the tools measure the positions and orientations of the surgical tools as well as forces and torques applied on the tools by the surgeon. The design is based on a mechanism optimization to maximize the manipulability of the mechanism in the MIS workspace. As part of a preliminary experimental protocol, five expert level surgeons performed three laparoscopic tasks – a subset of the Fundamental Laparoscopic Skill (FLS) set as a baseline for skill assessment protocols. The results provide an insight into the kinematics and dynamics of the endoscopic tools, as the underlying measures for objectively assessing MIS skills...|$|R

The original shape of the beam is round, but {{with the use of}} the shutters one can limit the beam to avoid obstacles or parts of the set that should not be illuminated in a specific look. Another feature is a gate, also in the focal plane, for sliding in gobos (also known as templates or deckles). These have patterns cut into them, much like a stencil. These patterns are projected onto the stage. An iris can be also be inserted in this position to make the beam smaller in diameter, reducing the light cast without the sharp edges of the shutters. ERS instruments from ETC, Altman, Selecon, and a variety of <b>others</b> have <b>interchangeable</b> lens tubes (or barrels) which can both create a very sharp or very soft beam as well as alter the beam spread. The barrel sizes can range from a narrow, long distance 5- or 10-degree spot to a broad and short-distance 50- or even 90-degree. The first 90-degree profile lantern was developed by Selecon Performance Lighting as part of their [...] "Pacific" [...] range of products. Since its introduction many other manufacturers have introduced their own 90-degree barrels. ERS instruments allow many different lens tubes to be used with the same body. This makes them more versatile, since a venue can purchase varying degrees of barrels without buying as many instruments. Many manufacturers also produce zoom lenses which offer the ability to change the beam angle. Some zoom ranges have a poorer optical quality making them difficult to use in sharp focus.|$|R
