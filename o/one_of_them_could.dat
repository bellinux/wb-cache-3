5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe and that he did not tell them about the scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking any <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>could</b> be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E
5|$|This was {{addressed}} in the major production model, the Do 17 Z-2. The Z-2 mounted the new 323P-1 version of the Fafnir with 746kW (1,000hp), which was specifically tuned to the performance needs of the Do 17 by decreasing supercharger power at lower altitudes and thus improving low-level performance. The increase in takeoff power allowed the bomb load to be increased from 500kg (1,102lb) to 1,000kg (2,200lb). However the combat range with a full 1,000kg (2,200lb) bomb load was a very short 330km (200mi). The armament was further upgraded by adding another pair of guns firing out of {{the sides of the}} upper part of the pod, but as the three guns were all fired by a single gunner, only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>could</b> be fired at a time. From May 1940, 422 Do 17 Z-2s flew with Kampfgeschwader 2, Kampfgeschwader 3, Kampfgeschwader 76 and Kampfgeschwader 77. The upgrades of the Z-2 had its overall weight increased from 17,600lbs to 17,920lbs (7,983 to 8128kg). After heavy losses of Do 17s during the Battle of Britain it was decided to replace the MG FF cannon with the more powerful MG 151/15. Losses had mounted in spite of an increase of up to eight machine guns in some Dorniers. The standard MG 15 machine guns were retained. These features were present in the next variant the Z-3.|$|E
25|$|Fakhr Al-Din Al-Turaihi, a Muslim {{scholar who}} lived in the 17th Century C.E, {{believed}} that the archangel Gabriel {{is the head of the}} cherubim. A Hadith in Shiite tradition tells us that Muhammad heard cherubs wailing and crying with sympathy for sinners in Heaven during his night journey, known as Isra and Mi'raj. Other traditions say that cherubs are so bright that the light of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>could</b> suffice the whole world. When Moses asked God to show him his face, he made one of his cherubs shine upon the mountain, shattering it to pieces. According to this tradition, God was showing Moses that since he could not bear to look at a cherub, he would not be able to bear looking at God.|$|E

500|$|Belle {{was also}} the main {{character}} in various comic books based on the film, including one set during Belle's stay at the castle published by Marvel Comics, and a prequel set several years before the film distributed by Disney Comics. In the former, the storylines generally have the servants trying to coax Belle into doing something with the Beast, only for it to backfire and nearly ruin their friendship before they make up. In the latter serial, Belle ends up {{locked up in a}} cellar by village children after reluctantly playing pirates with them, and later nearly goes down the path leading to Beast's castle. The latter serial also implies that she holds misandric views and refuses to associate herself with the village children, especially the males, due to their not being as well-versed in literature as she."Maurice: You should be playing outside with the other children! // Belle: I'm having a much better time in King Arthur's Court!

2500|$|The writers {{characterized}} resident {{lesbian and}} good girl Bianca Montgomery's romantic life as tortured; she consistently fell for heterosexual or unavailable women. When the series showcased her having {{fallen in love}} with best friend and confidante Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson), this theme was continued. Maggie declared herself heterosexual and told Bianca she was only romantically interested in men. To show Bianca moving on, and to add conflict to Bianca and Maggie's relationship, the writers introduced Lena Kundera in December 2002. Lena, a [...] "sassy" [...] bisexual from Poland, was characterized as a temptress [...] "in the mold of Juliette Binoche". [...] Bianca instantly found Lena attractive and competed for her attention with friend Boyd Larraby (Marc Menard), as they bet on which <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>could</b> date Lena first.

2500|$|... 1985 saw {{the end of}} the {{synthesizer}} era at NBC as composer John Williams wrote {{a series}} of themes for all NBC News programs, with a cut entitled [...] "The Mission", serving as the principal theme for NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw. Williams also composed two themes for Today: an opening fanfare for the program that was derived from the opening of [...] "The Mission"; and a two-minute closing theme for the show entitled [...] "Scherzo for Today", a dramatic arrangement that made heavy use of strings and flutes. In the late 1980s, [...] "Scherzo" [...] was played in its entirety multiple times daily during the weather scrolls that ran during local commercial breaks; however, most NBC affiliates preempted these segments with locally slotted advertising. The new Today themes – used in tandem with the show's new opening sequence featuring the Statue of Liberty and a new living room studio set – gave the program a distinctly modern look and sound beginning in September 1985. A series of Williams-penned bumpers featuring the [...] "Mission" [...] signature were also used to open and close segments. [...] "Scherzo for Today" [...] was used as the program's closing theme until 1990, and the [...] "Mission" [...] bumpers were used until 1993 (<b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>could</b> be heard as a station break lead-in on NBC's Meet The Press until 2004).|$|E
2500|$|Plutarch {{wrote that}} when Caesar was {{allocated}} the governorship of the Roman province of Hispania Ulterior for 60 BC {{he was in}} debt and his creditors prevented him from going to his province. Crassus paid off the most intransigent creditors and gave a surety of 830 talents. Caesar was then allowed to leave. Suetonius noted this episode as well, but did not mention who made the payments and gave the surety [...] Plutarch thought that Crassus did this because he needed Caesar for his political campaign against Pompey. However, this cannot be taken for granted. In a speech Cicero made against an agrarian bill proposed by the plebeian tribune Publius Servilius Rullus in 63 BC, he claimed that Rullus was an insignificant figure and a front for unsavoury 'machinators' whom he described as the real architects of the bill and as {{the men who had}} the real power and who were to be feared. He did name these men, but he dropped hints that made them identifiable by saying, [...] "Some of them to whom nothing appears sufficient to possess, some to whom nothing seems sufficient to squander." [...] Sumner points out that these were references to the popular images of Crassus and Caesar. Thus, it cannot be ruled out that Crassus, Pompey and Caesar might have been willing to co-operate on a specific policy issue they agreed with as they had done in 70 BC. Moreover, Caesar had supported the Manilian law of 66 BC, which gave Pompey the command of the final phase of the Third Mithridatic War and in 63 BC and, as noted above, he proposed a motion to recall Pompey to Rome to restore order in Rome {{in the wake of the}} Catalinarian Conspiracy. Therefore, Caesar was willing to support Pompey because, although he was not a popularis, he was not an optimate and, therefore, a potential ally. Moreover, at the time of the creation of the first triumvirate Pompey was at odds with Caesar's enemies, the optimates. The suspension for his praetorship in 62 BC by the senate when he advocated the recall of Pompey had probably shown Caesar that his political enemies, the optimates, had the means to marginalise him politically. To attain the consulship Caesar needed the support of Pompey and Crassus who, besides being the two most influential men in Rome, did not belong to the optimates and were liable to politically marginalised by the optimates as well. Plutarch maintained that Caesar sought an alliance with both men because allying with only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>could</b> have turned the other against him and that he thought that he could play them off against each other. However, the picture might have been more nuanced than this.|$|E
