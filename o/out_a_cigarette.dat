2500|$|The footage {{shows that}} Encinia {{initially}} wrote a routine traffic violation warning for Bland. After {{he returns to}} her car and speaks briefly to her again, he asks her to put out her cigarette. She responds, [...] "Why do I have to put <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> when I'm in my own car?" [...] Encinia orders her to [...] "get out of the car", and, when she repeatedly refuses to exit, he tells her she is under arrest. Bland repeatedly asks why she is under arrest, and Encinia responds, [...] "I am giving you a lawful order." [...] She refuses to leave her car, stating she is not under arrest as she is unaware of the reason and not obliged to. Encinia then opens her car door and tells her {{more than a dozen}} times {{to get out of the}} car before [...] he tries to pull her out. After struggling, he draws his Taser and points it at Bland, shouting [...] "I will light you up! Get out! Now!", at which point she exits her vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Hazel Grace Lancaster—a 16-year-old {{with cancer}} that {{has spread to}} her lungs—attends a cancer patient support group at her mother's behest. At first she hesitates because she feels like it has done her nothing. She thinks {{attending}} the support group could be {{the worst part of}} her life, until a particular support meeting, Hazel meets a 17-year-old boy named Augustus Waters, whose osteosarcoma caused him to lose his right leg, which was replaced with a prosthetic. On catching Augustus stare at her, Hazel feels weird. They meet after the Support Group and converse on {{the fact that they were}} not [...] "literally" [...] in the heart of Jesus, but in a basement. When everything seems to go well, Augustus pulls <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> and puts it between his lips. Hazel is disgusted by this and yells at him saying that he's already got cancer and he wants to pay money for more cancer, [...] "Not being able to breathe sucks," [...] she yells. Augustus calmly explains the metaphor, which is, [...] "You put the thing that kills you right between your teeth but you don't give it the power to kill you." [...] Hazel, impressed by this, goes to his place to watch a movie. Augustus is at the meeting to support his friend, Isaac, whose only remaining eye is soon to be removed due to cancer. Hazel and Augustus strike a bond immediately and agree to read each other's favorite novels. Augustus gives Hazel The Price of Dawn, and Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel written by Peter Van Houten, who lives in Amsterdam, about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's own experience. After Augustus finishes reading her book, he is frustrated upon learning that the novel ends abruptly without a conclusion. Hazel explains the novel's author had retreated following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.|$|E
2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I think he did it. Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E

The [...] frightened MERCY peers <b>out,</b> spying for <b>a</b> chance, to escape. [...] Then from the house STRANGWAY comes in. All his dreaminess is [...] gone.] ...|$|R

60|$|Shortly after eleven, {{restless and}} moody, he wandered <b>out</b> with <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{into the big}} patio, where he smiled grim {{amusement}} at the various tell-tale signs of Paula's neglect of her goldfish.

Thither he went, through doors without knobs, by ways known only to Paula and the servants.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why {{should one}} search at all?" [...] {{the other man}} asked, drawing <b>out</b> <b>a</b> gold <b>cigarette</b> case from his {{trousers}} pocket, and carefully selecting <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b> [...] "Life comes easiest to those who go blindfold. I've got a brother, private secretary to a Member of Parliament. He's got views about things, and he makes an awful fag of life. What's the good of it!

Butter appeared to have softened Geoffrey.|$|E
50|$|Monk, Natalie, and Stottlemeyer confront Breen at his office, but {{he denies}} everything. They inform him {{about how they}} know he was mugged as he was making his {{way back from the}} fire.

60|$|Apparently engrossed {{with his}} task, Mr. Vyner worked cheerfully for ten minutes. The hand {{that held the}} trowel was so far fairly clean, and {{he was about to}} use it to take <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> when he paused, and a broad smile spread slowly over his features. He put down the trowel, and, {{burrowing}} in the wet earth with both hands, regarded the result with smiling satisfaction.

60|$|Jake took <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> and was {{lighting}} it when {{he heard}} a swift, stealthy step close behind him.

Still he thought he saw a shadow flit across the veranda and vanish into the mist. Next moment there were heavier footsteps, and a crash as a man fell over the projecting legs of the chair. The fellow rolled down the shallow stairs, dropping a pistol and then hurriedly got up.|$|E
5000|$|A short middle segment shows E.S. {{getting up}} to speak at a conference on Palestinian film making; the {{microphone}} immediately begins feeding back and he leaves the podium. The last section, [...] "Jerusalem Political Diary, has a quicker narrative pace and a more overtly ideological message. Absurd humor is evoked alongside feelings of anti-Israeli paranoia in the characters; for example, what first {{appears to be a}} terrorist's hand grenade held by <b>a</b> Palestinian turns <b>out</b> to be <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> lighter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{remark about}} Fatime {{suggested}} reservations," [...] he remarked. [...] "I wonder why?

5000|$|In {{one of the}} {{few times}} Serling {{accommodated}} his sponsor during an episode, [...] "Ross" [...] takes <b>out</b> <b>a</b> pack of <b>cigarettes</b> and lights and smokes one using three hands.
