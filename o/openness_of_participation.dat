Teachers’ trust in management was expected to mediate these relationships. Furthermore, the adequacy and <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> communication and <b>participation</b> in decision making were expected to reduce psychological distance. At 10 Dutch schools for vocational education and training, 884 teachers completed a questionnaire. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Teachers’ psychological distance had a negative effect on trust in management (supervisor and higher management) and AOC. Trust in management had a positive effect on AOC, and trust in the supervisor had a positive effect on OCB. Structural distance did not influence teacher outcomes. Communication and participation in decision making reduced teachers’ psychological distance from management. The discussion focuses on the implications of the findings to improve the effectiveness of schools...|$|R

It explores how multiple interpretations of these concepts coalesce around a particular initia-tive, shaping ways of working and understanding across different epistemic cultures (Knorr-Cetina, 1999) in the network. The resultant shared meanings and practices, it is argued, are a product of existent epistemic and participa-tory cultures, internal and external dynamics and economies of power, and emergent ways of working that are further shaped by engagement with par-ticular information technologies and protocols. The process through which these shared meanings are constructed, however, is rarely transparent or openly reºected on, but rather, it emerges through the normalization of par-ticular practices that “organize ” our social relations.

40|$|In {{the current}} debate about {{evidence}} based education comparisons between countries are in focus. Learning and teaching are influenced by a control oriented paradigm at a far distance from the persons concerned, e. g. pupils, students and teachers. In education other perspectives are called for in order to catch the complexity of educational processes. Nomothetic information about learners needs to be complemented by ideographic information. The aim of the article is to argue for some alternative ways of knowledge contribution based on {{the voices of the}} individual in special educational settings in relation to the rights to education for all. Narrative approaches have a methodological potential <b>of</b> <b>openness</b> and <b>participation</b> where the researcher is engaged in a dialectic interaction between two subjects. Making room for the voice of the Other and finding a view different from one’s own is suggested as a powerful knowledge contribution in educational research which only can be provided by the persons concerned. One conclusion is that the narrative approaches advocated for here have a potential that is seldom given justice in the present era of documentation and measuring...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in ICTs have enabled educational institutions to rethink and {{experiment with the}} ways in which they conduct learning using digital social media. Meanwhile, various initiatives within the Open Education Resource (OER) movement have been launched since the early 2000 s, to create building blocks that would engage educational, cultural institutions and ordinary publics in providing access to, and repurposing of, free content, ranging from courseware to academic resources, from pedagogical designs to instructional learning archives (e. g. Atkins et al., 2007; OECD, 2007; JISC, 2009). With several well-known – yet distinct – initiatives continuing to purport a mission of education as a ‘public good’, and current thinking as well as emerging UK and international policy agendas on education shifting from the idea of simply providing access to content, towards the notion of creating ‘Open Participatory Learning Ecosystems’ (e. g. Seely-Brown & Adler 2008), the mediation of open education requires further theoretical exploration. Combining notions of ‘institutional mediation’ articulated by activity theory (e. g. Engeström, 1993; Engeström et al., 2003) with sociocultural perspectives (e. g. Thompson, 2005; Silverstone, 2005; Livingstone, 2009) the paper considers the meaning of Open Educational Resources (OERs) as participatory learning media (cf. Dalsgaard, 2008). Drawing on textual analyses, and a number of interviews with stakeholders from higher education institutions, policy advocates and members from popular community initiatives, a working typology of OERs is proposed. The paper argues that the multiple articulations of ‘mediated learning’ and (global) ‘learning media’, framing the socio-technical affordances and OERs, hinder many tensions pertaining the definition <b>of</b> <b>openness,</b> the nature <b>of</b> <b>participation</b> and indeed the purpose, legitimacy and quality of such resources...|$|R

Research methods involve: description, analysis of documents, questionnaires, expert interviews, analysis of statistical data.   Results. The article presents the results of a social audit <b>of</b> information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> the municipal General educational system of Pervouralsk city district. The analysis of the content of the official websites of educational organizations in the network «Internet» was conducted at the first stage of social audit. It showed that only one school website fully complies with the proposed requirements. The best developed parameter of website is technological effectiveness; less developed – the communicativeness and multimedia. Diagnostics of awareness among parents of the pupils of the schools activities was conducted at the second stage of the social audit. A survey of parents has shown that the most popular are the traditional ways of obtaining information: teacher-parent meetings and communication with child. Less than half of parents receive information via the websites of the schools. Expert assessment <b>of</b> the information <b>openness</b> <b>of</b> schools was realized at the third stage.
