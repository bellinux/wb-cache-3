5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became the director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists {{to shut down the}} lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical imaging and neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, the IMA {{announced}} a $2.6 million {{grant from the}} Lilly Endowment to be used toward {{the creation of a}} state-of-the-art conservation science lab. Through a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Dr. Gregory Dale Smith, was hired in October 2009 to lead the lab as its senior conservation scientist. A main focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> is researching the IMA's collection, including couture fashion in the textile collection and objects made of synthetic materials in the design collection. Another focus is scientific research on materials found in the collections, such as resins and dyes on African art pieces and glazes on Asian ceramics. Through the addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab,</b> the IMA aims to establish itself as an internationally recognized conservation center and to increase its potential as a training and professional development resource in conservation science.|$|E

5|$|Dexter's Laboratory (commonly {{abbreviated}} as Dexter's Lab) is an American comic {{science fiction}} animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network, {{and the first}} of the network's Cartoon Cartoons.

Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute in the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab.</b> He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers {{at the cost of}} his own life, saving the cure.

5|$|Veronica {{connects the}} five {{people who were}} framed to an {{incident}} where a student was publicly harassed in gym class. Keith is still dating Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel). Veronica and Wallace spend the night investigating students, and Veronica eventually deduces that Wallace ingested {{a small amount of}} an illegal substance, most likely in a gift basket earlier that year. In a flashback, Veronica and Logan make out in the car until the PCH bikers shoot out the car's windows. Veronica asks Keith for help in finding out the names of a company's shareholders. Veronica believes that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lab</b> assistants was paid off to forge the results. The previous summer, Logan was involved with an arson crime. Logan sunbathes with Dick (Ryan Hansen) and Beaver (Kyle Gallner) poolside, and they ogle at the brothers's stepmother, Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter).
