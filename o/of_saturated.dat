30|$|Since the {{question}} of the oil saturation of the Paleocene sediments within the Blagodarnenskaya structure is considered for the first time, it is important to confirm the type <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> hydrocarbon. Unfortunately, the absence of acoustic and gamma-density tools at the time of logging does not allow to draw a conclusion about the type <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> hydrocarbon by the characteristic separations between the readings of acoustic, neutron- and density-logging instruments. However, since the reservoirs of the Paleocene sediments of the Blagodarnenskaya structure represent siltstones of turbidite origin clamped in source rocks, conclusions on the type <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> hydrocarbon can be made from geochemical studies of core samples by the means of source rock pyrolysis.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Humberto left 10homes {{completely}} destroyed in Galveston County, {{with an additional}} 19 severely damaged in the county; several homes received minor shingle damage, and road closures left about 5,000houses isolated in the county. The combination <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> grounds and strong winds uprooted many trees and downed power lines across {{the path of the}} hurricane, with at least 50high voltage transmission poles blown down or seriously damaged; over 120,000power customers in Orange and Jefferson counties lost power, with 118,000Entergy customers in the state without electricity. Widespread flooding occurred in Jefferson and Orange counties, and at least 20homes in Beaumont were flooded. Additionally, several roadways were flooded. The passage of the hurricane caused one fatality in the state; a Bridge City man was killed when his carport crashed on him outside his house. Initially, press reports indicated that the storm wrought up to $500million in damage; however, final damage estimates were about $50million.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point <b>of</b> <b>saturated</b> salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of the {{possible}} saturation of the continuous control variable in the sub-optimal second order sliding mode controller applied to relative degree one systems with saturating actuators is addressed. It is proved that during the sliding phase, if basic assumptions are made, the continuous control variable never saturates, while, during the reaching phase, the presence <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> actuators can make the steering of the sliding variable to zero in finite time not always guaranteed. In the present paper, the original algorithm is modified in order to solve this problem: a new strategy is proposed, which proves to be able to steer the sliding variable to zero in a finite time in spite of the presence <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> actuators...|$|R

40|$|The kinetic {{mechanism}} of dopamine beta-hydroxylase (dopamine beta-monooxygenase EC 1. 14. 17. 1) was studied {{either in the}} absence or {{the presence of the}} nonessential activator fumarate. In the absence of fumarate, intersecting initial velocity patterns were obtained, consistent with a sequential mechanism. In the presence <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> concentrations <b>of</b> fumarate, initial velocity patterns became parallel. Other activating anions, such as acetate and chloride, could replicate the effects of fumarate. Since previous initial rate studies of dopamine beta-hydroxylase have been performed in the presence <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> concentrations <b>of</b> fumarate, the present results may explain why parallel initial velocity patterns, apparently consistent with a ping-pong mechanism, have been so far observed.

40|$|With sliding actin-filament {{motility}} assays, filament velocity {{should be}} independent {{of changes in the}} level of actomyosin activation under unloaded conditions. Using a simple modification of the motility assay to measure relative changes in isometric force (activation), we determined that isometric force increased 200 -fold with thiophosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain, and that with thiophosphorylated myosin, isometric force was further increased by the addition <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> smooth-muscle tropomyosin (100 %) or tropomyosin plus calponin (500 %), and decreased with the addition <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> caldesmon (- 100 %). Under "reducing conditions," filament velocity (2. 0 microns/s) was constant for mixtures of dephosphorylated and thiophosphorylated myosin containing > 5 % thiophosphorylated myosin, and was unaffected by the addition <b>of</b> <b>saturating</b> concentrations <b>of</b> tropomyosin or caldesmon. In contrast, "standard assay conditions" were found to be nonreducing. With fully thiophosphorylated smooth-muscle myosin, saturating smooth-muscle tropomyosin increased velocity to 150 % of control, and caldesmon halted all filament motion; with fully dephosphorylated myosin (< 0. 002 mol/mol) filaments only moved when tropomyosin or tropomyosin plus calponin was added. Taken together, these observations suggest that under "standard conditions" a mechanical load is present that is eliminated by "reducing conditions. " Filament velocity was insensitive to changes in cross-bridge density, under all conditions, suggesting that noncycling cross-bridges, generated by photochemical oxidation of myosin, is a likely source of mechanical loading...|$|R
