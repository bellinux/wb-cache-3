40|$|<b>The</b> tidal <b>marshes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dollard have {{recently}} {{become an important}} staging area for Greylag Geese and Barnacle Geese. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> were designated a nature reserve in 1981, which {{was followed by a}} decrease in management (abandoning of ditching and a change from high- to low-intensity cattle grazing). Other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> are still being exploited by farmers and grazed more intensively. This paper presents data on habitat selection and diet composition of both Greylag and Barnacle Geese. The conclusion is that <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> in <b>the</b> Dollard for geese is dependent on a continuation of a grazing management...|$|R
50|$|By <b>the</b> 2003 {{invasion}} <b>of</b> Iraq, <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> {{had lost}} 90% of their size {{from the previous}} decades. The Central and Hammar Marshes were nearly drained and only 35% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hawizeh <b>Marshes</b> remained. After <b>the</b> invasion, locals destroyed dikes. <b>The</b> combined efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iraq government, United Nations, U.S. agencies and record precipitation in Turkey helped begin a restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marshes.</b> As <b>of</b> late 2006, 58% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>marshes</b> had been reinundated. The Nasiriyah Drainage Pump Station was completed in 2009, affording the Third River {{to be used for}} agricultural drainage. However, recent drought and continued upstream dam construction and operation in Turkey, Syria and Iran have reduced <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> to around 30% of their original size by 2009.|$|R
5|$|Northumberland {{failed to}} engage, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} presence of the Stanleys, whose intentions were unclear, or due to the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> (or for both reasons). With his situation deteriorating, Richard decided to launch an attack against Henry Tudor, which almost succeeded, but the king's horse became stuck in the marsh, and he was killed. Fen Hole (where the boar badge was found) is believed to be a residue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh.</b> When Richard began his charge, Sir William Stanley intervened from the vicinity of Stoke Golding. It was here, on what {{came to be known as}} Crown Hill (the closest elevated ground to the fighting), that Lord Stanley crowned Henry Tudor after Richard was killed.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni is an extinct rodent of María Madre Island, Nayarit, Mexico. Within {{the genus}} Oryzomys {{of the family}} Cricetidae, {{it may have been}} most closely related to the {{mainland}} species O.albiventer. Since its first description in 1898, most authors have regarded it as a distinct species, but it has also been classified as a mere subspecies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat (O.palustris).|$|E
5|$|Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 and {{consolidated}} {{many forms}} {{into a single}} species Oryzomys couesi, with ten subspecies distributed from southern Texas and western Mexico south to Costa Rica. He placed it in an Oryzomys palustris group with the marsh rice rat and several species with more limited distributions, which he regarded as related to O.couesi but distinctive enough to be classified as separate species. In the 1930s, a few more forms related to O.couesi were described. As then recognized, the ranges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat, a United States species, and Oryzomys couesi meet in southern Texas. In 1960, Raymond Hall reviewed specimens from this contact zone and found no grounds on which to separate the two species; thus, he reduced O.couesi to a subspecies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. Other workers continued this lumping and by 1971 all other species Goldman had placed in the O.palustris group were classified under the marsh rice rat, together with Oryzomys azuerensis from Panama, described as a species in 1937.|$|E

50|$|Biggin is a {{late medieval}} hamlet on <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> {{that was part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} parish and remains so ecclesiastically (in terms of Anglican church).|$|R
5|$|In Tamaulipas and {{southern}} Texas, the ranges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat {{and the related}} Oryzomys couesi meet; in parts of Kenedy, Willacy and Cameron counties, Texas, and in far northeastern Tamaulipas, the two are sympatric (occur in the same places). In experimental conditions, they fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to O.couesi, the marsh rice rat shows less genetic variability within but more between populations in the contact zone, probably because the species is restricted to isolated populations near the coast.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, and juvenile Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most important}} predator on eggs and young <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that the range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct giant armadillo Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able {{to survive in the}} north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because environmental constraints were relaxed in commensal populations.|$|E
50|$|As in most {{wetlands}} in Europe in the past, <b>the</b> Pinsk <b>Marshes</b> {{were seen}} as an unhealthy area, a focus <b>of</b> maladies. In <b>the</b> late 19th century, drainage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> recovered 1.5 million hectares of wetlands.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, Delton Hanson {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a study of}} the relationships among populations of Oryzomys on the basis of data from three genes—the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b (Cytb) and two nuclear markers, exon 1 of the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene (Rbp3) and intron 2 of alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2). The Cytb data placed all marsh rice rats studied sister to a clade containing various populations of O.couesi; the mean genetic distance between the two groups was 11.30%. The marsh rice rats fell into two main groups, differing on average by 6.05%, one containing animals from Mississippi, southwestern Tennessee, and further west, and the other including specimens from Alabama and further east. Within the eastern group, variation was only about 0.65%, though examples of the putative subspecies O. p. palustris, O. p. coloratus, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. planirostris were all included. Data from both of the slower-evolving nuclear markers Rbp3 and Adh1-I2 also placed examples of Oryzomys in two main clades, but did not recover the western and eastern groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat as separate clades. In addition, Adh1-I2 placed a Costa Rican population within the marsh rice rat clade and some other southern Oryzomys specimens closer to the marsh rice rat than to the O.couesi group. The combined data supported the western and eastern clades within the marsh rice rat and placed the Costa Rican population marginally closer to the marsh rice rat than to O.couesi. Using the genetic species concept, the authors suggested that the western populations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. They recommended further research in the Mississippi–Alabama–Tennessee region, where the ranges of the two meet.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}} (lower jaw), {{the upper}} and lower masseteric ridges come close together below the first molars, but do not fuse. The back end of the lower incisor root is in a capsular process, a raising of the mandibular bone behind the molars. The upper incisors have yellowish enamel and are opisthodont, with the cutting edge inclined backwards. The molars are relatively small and are brachydont (low-crowned) and bunodont (with the cusps higher than the connecting crests). They are similar to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat in structural details. The upper and lower first molars have small accessory roots, as in many other oryzomyines, and the second and third lower molar each have two roots only.|$|E
5|$|John Bachman {{discovered}} the marsh rice rat in 1816, {{and it was}} formally described in 1837. Several subspecies have been described since the 1890s, mainly from Florida, but disagreement exists over their validity. The Florida Keys population is sometimes classified as a different species, the silver rice rat (Oryzomys argentatus). Data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicate a deep divergence between populations east of Mississippi and those further west, {{which suggests that the}} western populations may be recognized as a separate species, Oryzomys texensis. The species is part of the genus Oryzomys, which also includes several others occurring further south in Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America, some of which have previously been regarded as subspecies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. One, Oryzomys couesi, occurs with the marsh rice rat in Tamaulipas and southern Texas.|$|E

5|$|Many animals prey on marsh rice rats. The {{barn owl}} (Tyto alba) {{is among the}} most important; one study found that 97.5% of {{vertebrate}} remains in barn owl pellets were marsh rice rats. Other predators include birds (marsh hawks, Circus cyaneus; and barred owls, Strix varia), snakes (cottonmouth moccasins, Agkistrodon piscivorus; and others), alligators, and carnivorans (raccoons, Procyon lotor; red foxes, Vulpes vulpes; minks, Neovison vison; weasels of the genus Mustela; and striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis). Many parasites have been recorded on the marsh rice rat, including various ticks and mites, lice, and fleas among external parasites and many nematodes and digeneans, a pentastomid, and several coccidians among internal parasites (see parasites <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat).|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> shrew extends from southwest British Columbia, {{along the western}} regions of the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon and through northwestern California to the area north of San Francisco. The subspecies S. b. albiventer is found on the Olympic Peninsula. S. b. palmeri is found from western Oregon (south of the Columbia River) to extrema northwestern California. S. b. bendirii is found from the northern parts of the range (except for the Olympic Peninsula) south along the eastern range to the remaining range in California. In British Columbia the eastern limits are the Chilliwack River and Agassiz, and the northern limits are the low elevations {{on the north shore}} of Burrard Inlet.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{residential}} development continued {{to expand in}} the watershed of Darby Creek. The automobile replaced railroads as the dominant form of transportation, and it allowed workers to live farther from their places of employment. As a result, the population of Springfield Township more than doubled between 1950 and 1960. The Tinicum Wildlife Preserve was established in 1955 after the Gulf Oil Corporation donated a diked impoundment on the creek to the City of Philadelphia. Local resident Jean Diehl started a grassroots campaign to preserve the marsh in 1969, and Two Studies of Tinicum Marsh was published the following year which demonstrated the ecological importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh.</b> The Folcroft Landfill and the Clearview Landfill operated along the creek between the 1950s and the 1970s before closing in the mid 1970s. The former is {{on the west bank}} of the creek and the latter is on the east bank. They supposedly accepted municipal waste, demolition waste, and medical waste. A number of businesses operated at the site of the Clearview Landfill after its closing.|$|E
25|$|Other {{potential}} {{threats to}} the vole are groundwater pumping and {{development and implementation of}} water diversion structures, which alter the flow and hydrology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marshes</b> and reduce <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> available surface water that feeds that <b>marshes</b> on which <b>the</b> Amargosa voles rely.|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} 1750s, even {{the roof of}} Ardincaple Castle, seat of the clan chief, had fallen in. The overall {{condition}} of the castle had deteriorated {{to such an extent}} that the next laird was forced to abandon it and live in nearby Laggarie. The bulk of the Ardincaple estate ultimately passed into the hands of John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll. The last chief of the MacAulays, Aulay MacAulay, died at High Laggarie (now encompassed by the tiny village of Rhu) landless and without an heir to succeed as chief in about 1767. In 1794, Lord Frederick Campbell (brother of John, 5th Duke of Argyll) supervised the draining <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> and bog-ridden former lands of the Lairds of Ardincaple. The poor state of the lands of Ardincaple before that year is illustrated in the statement by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll: that much of the land could not bear the weight of a cow, and local men of the time remembered when horses would be lost in the bogholes prevalent in the area.|$|E
5|$|Merriam and Goldman had {{recognized}} {{that a number}} of Central American species, including Oryzomys couesi and numerous forms with more limited distributions, are related to the marsh rice rat. O.couesi ranges north to southernmost Texas, where its distribution meets that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat. In 1960, Raymond Hall argued that specimens from the contact zone were intermediate between the local forms of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat, and accordingly included the former in the marsh rice rat. While reporting on the ecology of Texan O.couesi in 1979, Benson and Gehlbach noted that populations of O.couesi and the marsh rice rat there were in fact distinct, with the latter being smaller and less brown and more gray in color; their karyotypes were also distinct. Since then, the two have generally been retained as distinct species, as supported by further research; a 1994 study even found the two to occur at some of the same places (in sympatry) in southern Texas and nearby Tamaulipas, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys antillarum was a {{medium-sized}} rodent, about {{as large as}} O.couesi. According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow {{on the inner side}} and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>marsh</b> rice rat, Oryzomys palustris natator, for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.|$|E

50|$|As {{their name}} suggests, <b>the</b> Mesopotamian <b>Marshes</b> {{are located in}} the larger region which used to be called Mesopotamia.
