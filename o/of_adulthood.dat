The album's production incorporates orchestral elements and musical references to both contemporary and golden age hip hop, including boom bap beats and old school samples.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{throughout}} 2003, Blink-182 marks {{a departure}} from the band's earlier work, infusing experimental elements into their usual pop punk sound. These elements were inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects. Its songs are characterized by downcast and expansive sonic atmospheres, showcasing what critics dubbed a more elaborate, mature side of the band. Songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities <b>of</b> <b>adulthood</b> and unexpected hardships. The record features a collaboration with The Cure frontman Robert Smith.|$|E

Findings indicated measurement invariance of the Inventory of Dimensions <b>of</b> Emerging <b>Adulthood</b> (IDEA-short form) across national groups and across gender and occupational groups within each national sample.

5|$|Feathers become abraded {{over time}} and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are {{particularly}} dependent {{on their ability to}} fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently, and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her so she does not need to fly much. The first primary feather to be shed is the central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year <b>of</b> <b>adulthood.</b> The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being moulted the following year.|$|E

Such milestones include driving a vehicle, having legal sexual relations, serving {{in the armed forces}} or on a jury, purchasing and drinking alcohol, voting, entering into contracts, finishing certain levels of education, and marriage. Adolescence is usually accompanied by an increased independence allowed by the parents or legal guardians, including less supervision as compared to preadolescence.|$|E

25|$|Tinnitus is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} a symptom <b>of</b> <b>adulthood,</b> and is often overlooked in children. Children with hearing loss have a high incidence of tinnitus, even though they do not express the condition or its effect on their lives.

Among those children who do complain of tinnitus, there is an increased likelihood of associated otological or neurological pathology such as migraine, juvenile Meniere’s disease or chronic suppurative otitis media. Its reported prevalence varies from 12% to 36% in children with normal hearing thresholds and up to 66% in children with a hearing loss and approximately 310% of children have been reported to be troubled by tinnitus.|$|E

25|$|For decades, practitioners' {{handbooks}} and textbooks on IQ testing {{have reported}} IQ declines with age after the beginning <b>of</b> <b>adulthood.</b> However, later {{researchers pointed out}} this phenomenon {{is related to the}} Flynn effect and is in part a cohort effect rather than a true aging effect. A variety of studies of IQ and aging have been conducted since the norming of the first Wechsler Intelligence Scale drew attention to IQ differences in different age groups of adults. Current consensus is that fluid intelligence generally declines with age after early adulthood, while crystallized intelligence remains intact. Both cohort effects (the birth year of the test-takers) and practice effects (test-takers taking the same form of IQ test more than once) must be controlled to gain accurate data. It is unclear whether any lifestyle intervention can preserve fluid intelligence into older ages.|$|E
25|$|When {{males are}} fully mature {{they leave their}} webs {{to search for a}} {{suitable}} female, often using web characteristics to identify potential mates. Females are most likely to mate directly after their final molt at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>adulthood</b> and later in adulthood when they are feeding. There are often multiple males attempting to court the same female and thus competition for territory on the web occurs but is rarely physical as smaller males surrender area to larger ones. When males approach females they are often feeding, allowing the males to get closer without an aggressive response and also meaning the female is not moving. On approach the male makes himself known by tapping on a web strand to ensure the female is amenable before proceeding to mate. When met with aggression males will stop approaching and remain in the same location until the female relaxes or they retreat. Females engage in multiple mating but there is no benefit to the offspring as a result of this, however the energy cost of repelling a male is higher than that of allowing him to copulate. As a result of this sperm competition occurs through males altering the duration of mating as well as the frequency, longer mating is proportional to a greater likelihood of success. Sexual cannibalism is uncommon in Nephila as a result of male mating behaviours. By copulating when females are immobile after molting or inactive due to feeding the males increase their chances of survival. Males also approach {{on the opposite side of}} the web to the female making it more difficult to be caught. Sexual cannibalism does still occur and generally is more common in larger males and from older females.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—This article {{asserts that}} the theory <b>of</b> emerg-ing <b>adulthood</b> is a useful way of conceptualizing {{the lives of people}} from their late teens to their mid- to late 20 s in industrialized societies. The place <b>of</b> {{emerging}} <b>adulthood</b> within the adult life course is discussed. The weaknesses of previous terms for this age period are examined, and emerging adulthood is argued to be preferable as a new term for a new phenomenon. With respect to the question <b>of</b> whether emerging <b>adulthood</b> is experienced positively or negatively by most people, it is argued that it is positive formost people but entails developmental challenges that may be difficult and there is great heterogeneity, with some emerging adults experiencing serious problems. With respect {{to the question of whether}} or not emerging adult-hood is good for society, it is argued that claims of th...|$|R
