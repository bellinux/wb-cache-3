40|$|Olive mill waste-waters (OMWW) are a {{by-product}} of <b>olive-oil</b> <b>production</b> and a major environmental problem in the Mediterranean area. The use of a polyphenol-oxidase from olive husk is proposed for the enzymatic removal of low-molecular phenolics in OMWW. For comparison purposes, a purified microbial polyphenol-oxidase (Trametes versicolor laccase) was also employed. Though both enzymatic systems show relevant activity towards phenol polymerization, olive husk is much more appealing in view of possible applications because of its availability and extremely low cost, associated with excellent enzymatic activity and specificity...|$|E
30|$|Extra-virgin {{olive oil}} (EVO) is an {{important}} element in the Mediterranean diet and a major agricultural crop for Southern European countries in terms of both farm income and cultivated area (De Graaff and Eppink 1999; Owen et al. 2000; Pupo D’Andrea, 2007; Marchini et al. 2010). Moreover, given the increased popularity of the Mediterranean diet among consumers in the US, Canada, Australia and large parts of Asia, EVO consumption has grown almost worldwide (Santosa and Guinard 2011; International Olive Oil Council 2012). Contextually, <b>olive-oil</b> <b>production</b> has switched from low yields and low-input cultivation to a capital-intensive farming system involving innovations in both agricultural practices and processing techniques. This has led to a considerable improvement in EVO nutritional characteristics accompanied by a profound change in sensory profile, turning a traditional food, with well known organoleptic features, into a brand new kind of dressing.|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} of smallholder olive-oil producers {{is a growing}} concern for the European Union. Despite subsidies (such as single farm payment), competition from intensive producers and increasing operating costs results in abandonment or a change to intensification which has long term negative environmental impacts. This dissertation explores ways to provide useful information to aid smallholder survival in Almería Province. Through interviews with smallholder producers, a review of relevant literature, and a case study of best practices in sustainable <b>olive-oil</b> <b>production</b> from Oro del Desierto, this research produced a useful finding; organic production is economically viable in the long term therefore is a potential adaptation option for survival over intensification of production. If smallholder growers produce high-quality extra virgin organic olive-oil, and employ effective marketing strategies and sustainable practices, their methods can be economically viable as they sell to a growing niche market. Additionally, organic production offers many environmental benefits such as increasing biodiversity...|$|E
40|$|The co-composting of {{the solid}} residue and wastewaters from the <b>olive-oil</b> <b>production</b> process has been studied as a new method for the {{treatment}} of wastewater containing high organic and toxic pollutants. The experimental results for a demostration plant using solid residue from olive extraction as bulking material and olive-oil-processing effluents as continuously fed wastewater are reported. Composting temperature was controlled between 45 and 65 degrees C by air supply and the wastewater addition was fed mainly {{in order to keep the}} moisture in the range of 45 to 60 % and secondly to replace the carbon substrate. During 23 days of operation in the thermophilic region, the system was fed with 263 m(3) wastewater in total, which means an average rate of 11. 4 m(3) /day wastewater or 2. 9 kg wastewater per kg solid residue. The total bioenergy production was estimated to be about 90 000 000 kcal. Then followed a 3 months stabilization period in the mesophilic region until the final product reached ambient temperature.

40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} {{and farm}} abandonment in Europe have induced dramatic social, economic, and ecological issues. Sustainable management may solve these issues {{by providing a}} viable economic margin and preserving biodiversity. Specifically, we propose herein monetary compensation for farmers maintaining or restoring lands as non-agricultural areas. The mechanism for funding this compensation is based upon spatial analysis of two olive-grove landscapes. These exhibited different land-use patterns, a simple landscape and a complex one presenting a 50 % higher diversity index and an 80 % higher complexity index. We estimated <b>olive-oil</b> <b>production</b> and profitability. Results showed that the complex landscape contains three times more protected habitats. Neither landscape was economically viable, with the simple one showing values of 43 % below the threshold, and the complex one 185 %. The mechanism proposed to fund farmer subsidies was developed {{by means of the}} spatial and economic data estimated. This conservation payment system considers a non-linear relationship between the subsidies paid and the preserved area of agricultural use. The farmers of the simple landscape would receive a subsidy of 299, 394, and 464 [*]€/ha for 10, 20, and 30 % of preserved area, respectively. Inversely, the farmers of the complex landscape would be granted a reduction of 38 and 80 [*]€/ha in their monetary incentives for the loss of 10 and 20 %, respectively, of natural areas. Using this funding mechanism, conservation of biodiversity in agricultural areas would no longer constitute a factor limiting profitability, but would rather complement earnings...|$|E
40|$|The Piraeus Bank Cultural Foundation (P. I. O. P) aims in rescuing, {{recording}} and promoting the heritage and cultural identity of Greece. Within this framework it organises and manages {{a network of}} thematic museums, which are continuously expanding in the regional parts of Greece. The three already existing museums (The Silk Museum in Soufli, The Open-Air Water Power Museum in Dimitsana, and the Museum of the Olive and the Greek Olive Oil in Sparta) have developed to become cultural centers in continuous contact and co-operation with the local societies. At the same time five new museums have been designed and are being created in accordance with contemporary museological specifications and are in their final stage of completion: the Museum of Marble Crafts in Tinos, the Museum of Industrial <b>olive-oil</b> <b>production</b> in Lesvos, the Rooftile and Brickworks Museum in Volos, the Museum of Technology of Paper and History of Greek Typography in Thessaloniki and the Museum of Traditional Crafts and Environment in Stymfalia. Within this framework P. I. O. P. has adopted a unique managerial model: the Network is staffed with experienced personnel, specialised in cultural management, which undertakes the scientific supervision, the managerial, accounting and secretarial coverage of the museums {{and at the same}} time, provides for their maintenance, impeccable operation and projection. This operational model is implemented with the unreserved co-operation of the local society and authorities. The paper aims to develop the relevant issue and to introduce the solutions that have been adopted in order to ensure the best results. ...|$|E
40|$|The self-potential (SP) {{method is}} one of the oldest {{geophysical}} method which measures the distribution of natural electric potential at the ground surface. Integrated electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and self-potential techniques are often used to identify groundwater flow direction and possible soil and groundwater contamination. In the present study, the results of ERT and SP measurements are analyzed to characterize a site in western Crete contaminated from olive oil mill waste (OOMW). The production of olive oil {{is one of}} the major economic importance in Mediterranean region, particularly in Greece which is the third country (worldwide) in <b>olive-oil</b> <b>production</b> with Island of Crete contributing more than 30 % of the total olive oil production in Greece. The production procedure of olive oil generates large volumes of OOMW, which pose serious environmental problems due to their high organic load and rich in inorganic constituents. The OOMWs are usually disposed in poorly constructed shallow evaporation ponds, which often results into overflow or leaking of wastewaters, hence, polluting soil and groundwater. The high electrical conductivity and the high concentration of phenolic compounds are the main features that make OOMWs detectable by means of geoelectric prospecting methods. In the study area, five self-potential surveys from May to July 2014 were carried out along an ERT profile by using the fixed base configuration. The SP field data have been analyzed by using the 2 D tomographic approach bas ed on the charge occurrence probability (COP) function and spectral methods. Taking into account the electrical resistivity distribution from the ERT tomography, COP maps are interpreted to provide temporal information about self-potential sources and their possible correlations with contamination from OOMW...|$|E
40|$|Aimed {{at finding}} a viable method of {{treating}} the <b>olive-oil</b> <b>production</b> effluents, anaerobic digestion of olive mill wastewater (OMW) combined with anaerobically digested and unmodified piggery effluents (PE) {{was performed in}} two upflow anaerobic filters, the F 3 and F 5, respectively, avoiding water dilution and chemical correction of OMW. Successive volumetric increases of this effluent ranging from 8 % to 91 % were used to promote gradual adaptation of the microbial consortium. The F 3 results suggest that 83 % OMW was the highest volume held by the process. Organic loading rates of 5. 0 - 5. 7 kg COD m"-" 3 d"-" 1 (hydraulic retention times of 8 d) provided a COD removal of 73 - 75 % and a biogas production of 1. 7 - 2. 1 m" 3 m"-" 3 d"-" 1 (66 - 68 % CH_ 4).
