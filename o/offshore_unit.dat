40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} captive {{offshoring}} of new product development (NPD), i. e., relocating projects or project phases to foreign-based, wholly-owned, multinational corporation (MNC) subsidiaries (captive <b>offshore</b> <b>units)</b> {{to benefit from}} cost and efficiency advantages and/or from access to complementary technological resources and capabilities. Adopting a host country perspective, we theorize why different forms of local collaboration may complement or conflict with efficiency-seeking or arbitrage strategies and may thus influence why captive <b>offshore</b> <b>units</b> receive new product development orders from other MNC units located abroad. Using a sample from Brazil and applying structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS), we find that local NPD outsourcing constitutes a complementary relationship, while local cooperation with clients creates a trade-off relationship with captive offshoring. That these relationships are moderated by the captive <b>offshore</b> <b>unit’s</b> cost position within the MNC suggests that arbitrage effects transcend the headquarter-subsidiary relationship into the sphere of MNC subsidiaries’ local collaborations. Our findings imply that arbitrage in multinational contexts affects the interdependence between resources and transaction costs. Dirk M. Boeh...|$|R

40|$|Capability {{development}} {{can be defined}} as deliberate firm-level investment involving a search and learning process aimed at modifying or enhancing existing capabilities. Increasingly, firms are relocating advanced services to offshore locations resulting in the challenge of capability development in the <b>offshore</b> <b>unit.</b> Guided by the research question – what drives or impedes capability development in an offshoring context – the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how an idiosyncratic offshoring context affects capability development. The thesis consists of three papers using various datasets and qualitative methods that investigate capability development in an offshoring context. The first paper investigates how capability development takes place for a service-provider firm at the activity level. The second paper examines the transition made by a captive <b>offshore</b> <b>unit,</b> from performing standardized activities to R&D activities. The third paper examines capability development at the cluster level, and examines how spillovers from firms contribute to the emergence and evolution of clusters. Overall, this thesis argues that capability development is a path dependent process, and the offshoring context complicates the identification of capabilities lacking, the resources required to develop these capabilities and the alignment of supporting organizational processes. Captive offshore units and local service providers often perform back-office or standardized tasks that have been disaggregated from the value chain. In these cases, capability development presents a challenge, as firms need to take deliberate actions in order to develop capabilities, and identify the external linkages they must form to aid the capability development process...|$|E
40|$|While {{much of the}} {{research}} on outsourcing and offshoring have been done with quantitative studies, where the respondents’ estimate what positive or negative effects measured by selected indicators on the Likert scale, offshoring has on the company (Freel M., 2000). Little {{attention has been paid to}} understand the deeper development of the companies’ offshoring in a qualitative study. The aim of this study is to explore the transaction costs’ the companies has by moving to low cost countries (LCC) and how they utilize and develop their resources in form of dynamic capabilities and all this in relationship to the companies’ offshoring performance. We attempt to contribute to literature with a quality research approach, including three interviews from three Swedish small or medium sized companies, offshoring to an LCC. In the study empirical evidence suggests that it is very important what type of product you intend to offshore. Secondly it was found that when offshoring to an LCC, long term planning enhances the performance. Furthermore, the empirical evidence suggests that there is a positive relationship between the offshore unit’s development of dynamic capabilities and performance improvement. We recommend that management from the start acquire knowledge of local culture and the way of doing business and develop capability of handling that knowledge. Corporate management is advised to provide the <b>offshore</b> <b>unit</b> with necessary capabilities so that the <b>offshore</b> <b>unit</b> may be able to develop necessary production capabilities. ...|$|E
