40|$|This is {{the second}} part of a 2 -part article that {{presents}} acritical and comprehensive update of the currentevidence for a cardiovascular disease (CVD) contin-uum based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> of <b>pathophysiological</b> studies and the outcome of a broad range of clinical trials that have been performed in the past 15 years. In part I, we reviewed the current understanding of CVD pathophysiology and dis-cussed data from clinical trials on subjects ranging from risk factors for disease through stable coronary artery disease (CAD). The present article continues the review of clinical trials, beginning with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and continuing through extension of the concept of the CVD continuum to include stroke and renal disease. The article concludes with a discussion of areas in which future research might further clarify our understanding of the CVD continuum. Acute Coronary Syndromes ACS represent a spectrum of events ranging from unstable angina (UA) and non–ST-segment elevation myocardial in-farction (NSTEMI) to ST-segment elevation myocardial in-farction (STEMI). ACS events are frequently the conse-quence of thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. Intervention {{at this point in the}} CVD continuum clearly interrupts disease progression by preventing cardiac muscle death, decreasing the risk of a recurrent ischemic event, slowing progression to heart failure, and reducing mortality. Patients presenting with an ACS must receive prompt treat-ment to prevent ischemic complications; optimal manage-ment includes anti-ischemic therapy (eg, supplemental oxy-gen, nitroglycerin, and -blocker), antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel, or platelet glycoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitor), antithrombotic therapy (unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH]), and the use of invasive reperfusion procedures (ie, percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI] or coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]). For STEMI patients, optimal therapy also includes fibrinolytic agents to restore blood flow in the occluded coronary artery...|$|R
40|$|Hypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} (HCM) is {{a complex}} cardiac condition characterized by variable degrees of asymmetric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, generally associated with mutations in sarcomere protein genes. While generally perceived as rare, HCM {{is the most common}} genetic heart disease with over one million affected individuals in Europe alone and represents a prevalent cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. To date, HCM remains an orphan disease, as recommended treatment strategies are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> empirical use of old drugs with little evidence supporting their clinical benefit in this context. In the six decades since the original description of the disease, less than fifty pharmacological studies have been performed in HCM patients, enrolling little over 2, 000 HCM patients, mostly comprising small non-randomized cohorts. No specific agent has been convincingly shown to affect outcome, and critical issues such as prevention of myocardial energy depletion, microvascular ischemia, progressive myocardial fibrosis and the peculiar mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in HCM still need to be addressed in a systematic fashion. However, there is increasing evidence that a variety of drugs may counter the effects of sarcomere protein mutations and <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>pathophysiological</b> abnormalities at <b>the</b> molecular, cellular and organ level.

40|$|BACKGROUND: 'Preventability' is {{a crucial}} concept in <b>the</b> {{literature}} <b>on</b> adverse drug effects. However, a systematic review of the definitions of preventability of adverse drug effects has suggested that none fits all circumstances. Furthermore, when the reliability of these definitions has been examined they {{have been found to}} be imperfect. OBJECTIVE: To propose and outline a method for determining the theoretical preventability of an adverse drug effect, based on frameworks for classifying adverse drug reactions - the EIDOS and DoTS methods. METHODS: EIDOS is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mechanism of action of the drug. It observes that a drug (an Extrinsic species) causes an adverse effect by interacting with an Intrinsic species that is its target when the two are Distributed together, and that <b>the</b> <b>resulting</b> <b>pathophysiological</b> Outcome (<b>the</b> adverse effect) causes the Sequela (the adverse reaction). DoTS observes that the Dose-relatedness of the adverse effect compared with the beneficial effect is relevant (determining toxic, collateral, or hypersusceptibility effects), that adverse effects have Time-courses (varying from immediate to delayed), and that there are individual Susceptibility factors. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We have elicited many published examples that show that each of these factors in the causation of an adverse drug effect can be adduced to assess its preventability. We have constructed a flowchart that illustrates how the processes can be logically analysed. CONCLUSIONS: This approach suggests methods for devising prospective preventive strategies and for deciding retrospectively whether an adverse reaction in an individual should have been prevented...|$|R

Analysis of symptoms past and present, and previous and actual lung function measurements (including variability) is the usual method of evaluation and classification of asthma disease severity and activity. However, symptoms and lung function alterations are <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>pathophysiological</b> processes including inflammation in the bronchial wall which, in chronic phases, precedes the clinical measurements, and are risk factors for disease progression and worsening. Tools for more precise determination of asthma disease processes in the airway wall would be of importance for prophylactic intervention to avoid chronic damage to the airways and acute worsenings to occur...|$|R

40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and AT 1 {{receptor}} blockers {{have long}} been considered as two classes of drugs with strictly comparable effect in cardiovascular diseases, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> assumption that both classes act <b>on</b> <b>the</b> renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> of large clinical intervention trials, which failed to demonstrate any {{significant difference between the}} effects of these two pharmacological classes in patients with essential hypertension, acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, supported this concept. The recent observation that a combination of ACE-inhibitors and AT 1 receptor blockers improves the prognosis of these pathological conditions better than monotherapy at higher doses focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> difference between their mechanisms of action. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> of <b>pathophysiological</b> studies have suggested that in the heart, {{as well as in the}} kidney, AT 1 receptor blockers act in the early stages of the disease, improving left ventricular dysfunction in hypertensive patients and preventing microalbuminuria in diabetic animals. It seems reliable to suggest that AT 1 receptor blockers are to be preferred to ACE-inhibitors for an early prevention of cardiovascular and renal disease. The new inhibitors of renin activity may further amplify our chances, also blocking the negative effects mediated by angiotensin II escape and by stimulation of the prorenin/renin receptors...|$|R
