50|$|When a pipe is welded or bent {{the most}} common method to inspect blockages, misalignment, <b>ovality,</b> and weld bead {{dimensional}} conformity is to pass a round ball through the pipe coil or circuit. If the inner pipe dimension is to be measured then the weld bead should be subtracted, if welding is applicable. Typically, the clearance tolerance for the ball must not exceed 1 mm. Allowable <b>ovality</b> of any pipe is measured on the inside dimension of the pipe, normally 5% to 10% <b>ovality</b> can be accepted. If no other test is conducted to verify <b>ovality,</b> or blockages, this test {{must be seen as}} a standard requirement. A flow test can not be used in lieu of a blockage or ball test.

40|$|Abstract. The deep-sea pipe is an {{important}} part of mining lifting projects in the ocean floor. The uniqueness of environment conditions and design needs to determine the unforeseeable risks and challenges during the laying of pipeline. Based on extensive studies of loads acted on the pipeline and corresponding possible limit states for each installation method, a series of investigations on load-carrying capacity and buckling response of pipes under different loading combinations and various types defects (such as uniform <b>ovalities)</b> were carried out. In these calculations, the collapse pressure has been associated with the pressure maximum of a uniformly deforming long pipe. In experiments in a stiff pressure lifting pipelines, collapse is always localized as shown in Figures 3 and 4. However,because pipe’s localization takes place after the pressure maximum, the collapse pressure yielded by the 2 -D analysis suffices for most cases. Exceptions are pipes with local imperfections, in the form of dents. The adequacy of this important conclusion will be demonstrated in the future application, where such predictions are compared to experiments...|$|R
40|$|Geometric {{anomalies}} {{in pipelines}} are mainly represented by dents, <b>ovalities</b> and buckles. Dents can occur either during pipeline construction or in-service. Buckles and wrinkles {{may result from}} cold bending or from loss of stability during offshore pipe-laying. The challenge to the pipeline operator is the identification of those defects that may threaten the future integrity of the pipeline from those defects that are dormant and require no further action. Codes and regulations contain limit state criteria to prevent buckles from happening during construction and in service; however, there is practically no acceptance guidance. In cases when buckles and wrinkles are identified, pipeline operators seek expert opinion. The current industry thinking and research supports the use of advanced assessment techniques (beyond the depth-based rules). These enhanced assessment techniques {{make use of the}} detailed profile of a geometry anomaly. Such information is obtained from high-resolution geometry tools and other supporting information on the presence and severity of stress risers from ILI tools. This paper describes how strain-based and stress-based assessment of geometric anomalies can be utilized to assess their significance and need for remediation. Examples are discussed to demonstrate application of the enhanced methods for the assessment of buckles...|$|R

5000|$|Progressive {{stamping}} {{can also}} be produced on transfer presses. These are presses that transfer the components from one station to the next {{with the use of}} mechanical [...] "fingers". For mass production of stamped parts which do require complicated in-press operations, it is always advisable to use a progressive press. One of the advantages of this type of press is the production cycle time. Depending upon the part, productions can easily run well over 800 parts/minute. One of the disadvantages of this type of press {{is that it is not}} suitable for high precision deep drawing which is when the depth of the stamping exceeds the diameter of the part. When necessary, this process is performed upon a transfer press, which run at slower speeds, and rely on the mechanical fingers to hold the component in place during the entire forming cycle. In the case of the progressive press, only part of the forming cycle can be guided by spring-loaded sleeves or similar, which result in concentricity and <b>ovality</b> issues and non uniform material thickness. Other disadvantages of progressive presses compared to transfer presses are: increased raw material input required to transfer parts, tools are much more expensive because they are made in blocks with very little independent regulation per station; impossibility to perform processes in the press that require the part leave the strip (example beading, necking, flange curling, thread rolling, rotary stamping etc.).|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Pipe bends are {{critical}} components in piping systems. In {{the manufacturing process}} of pipe bends {{it is difficult to}} avoid thickening on the inner radius of the pipe bend and thinning on the outer radius of the pipe bend. The cross section of the bend also becomes non circular due to bending process; this tends to cause <b>ovality</b> in pipe bends. The acceptability of pipe bends is based on the induced level of shape imperfections considered. <b>Ovality</b> is the shape imperfection considered for the analysis which varies from 0 to 8 %. This study is an attempt to analyze the <b>ovality</b> effect of inlet pigtail bend, INCOLOY 800 ASTM B 407 material which is used in hydrogen reformer application. The finite element method is used to model and analyze a stand-alone, long-radius pipe bend with 42. 2 mm nominal diameter and a 250 mm bend radius with specified length. A parametric study was performed in which the bend factor is taken as 1. 90 to 2. 07. Internal pressure is incremented for each model, until it reaches 27 x 108 N/mm 2. During this process, the bend undergoes plastic instability due to pressure and thermal effect.

40|$|Abstract: Deformation {{of round}} {{castings}} due to thermal and/or mechanical strain {{may lead to}} the occurrence of their <b>ovality</b> defects during continuous casting. Presently, <b>ovality</b> defect from thermal deformation have been effectively controlled in actual casting process with the application of more advanced equipments and more sophisticated control strategies. But the control of <b>ovality</b> defect from larger mechanical deformation still cannot satisfy the need of caster design or higher qualified rate of castings. It is shown that excessive hot pressure while strand passes through tension leveler, is the main reason to generate larger mechanical deformation. With consideration of the characteristics of round caster and the requirement of safety production, a theoretical calculated model based on mechanical deformation analysis has been developed in the paper to eliminate <b>ovality</b> defect specially from the over large hot pressure. Calculation analysis suggests that groove design of drive roller and range of round section sizes should be the important consideration for the determination of hot pressure, and there always exists an optimum value for hot pressure when the machine equipments of round caster have been designed and installed. The model can provide a useful guideline for casting engineers to design the groove of drive roller and to determine reasonable safe hot pressure.
