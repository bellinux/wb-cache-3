30|$|Miller et al. (2005) offered three {{hypotheses}} {{on why the}} CET replications {{failed to}} match the impressive impacts of CET in the original JOBSTART and MFSP demonstrations.

The team worked together to develop the Three-Lens Model, a teaching model that aimed both to provide a unification of subject delivery across the module whilst splitting subject delivery into three clear areas: subject-“ness” (subject identity), how to teach (pedagogy) and ideas of what to teach (toolbox). The paper presents a discussion of the perceived effectiveness of the Three-Lens Model. It gathers data from trainees across a variety of cohorts and programmes within the School of Education who were exposed to the model of delivery for one year and specifically questions how successful it was in providing a cohesive delivery structure and in raising the trainees’ perceptions of the pedagogical element of their training.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of pain education on opioid prescribing by early-career general practitioners. A brief training workshop was delivered to general practice registrars of a single regional <b>training</b> <b>provider.</b> The workshop significantly reduced “hypothetical” opioid prescribing (in response to paper-based vignettes) in an earlier evaluation. The effect of the training on “actual” prescribing was evaluated using a nonequivalent control group design nested within the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) cohort study: 4 <b>other</b> regional <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> were controls. In ReCEnT, registrars record detailed data (including prescribing) during 60 consecutive consultations, on 3 occasions. Analysis was {{at the level of}} individual problem managed, with the primary outcome factor being prescription of an opioid analgesic and the secondary outcome being opioid initiation. Between 2010 and 2015, 168, 528 problems were recorded by 849 registrars. Of these, 71 % were recorded by registrars in the nontraining group. Eighty-two percentages were before training. Opioid analgesics were prescribed in 4382 (2. 5 %, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2. 40 - 2. 63) problems, with 1665 of these (0. 97 %, 95 % CI: 0. 91 - 1. 04) representing a new prescription. There was no relationship between the training and total prescribing after training (interaction odds ratio: 1. 01; 95 % CI: 0. 75 - 1. 35; P value 0. 96). There was some evidence of a reduction in initial opioid prescriptions in the training group (interaction odds ratio: 0. 74; 95 % CI: 0. 48 - 1. 16; P value 0. 19). This brief training package failed to increase overall opioid cessation. The inconsistency of these actual prescribing results with “hypothetical” prescribing behavior suggests that reducing opioid prescribing in chronic noncancer pain requires more than changing knowledge and attitudes...|$|R

40|$|Foundation {{governors}} in Catholic {{schools are}} {{representatives of the}} trustee, normally the local bishop, and are appointed to be stewards of the school’s mission. For many years, this responsibility for maintaining the Catholic ethos of the school lay, in practice, with the head teacher and parish priest. However, the Education Reform Act of 1988 was a watershed which transformed the management of schools. Several sources studied during the literature review agreed that governing bodies turned to the local authority (LA) for training in {{the requirements of the}} new legislation; secular issues became the priority and dioceses stepped back, allowing <b>other</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> to take the initiative. During this unprecedented period of change in education, the number of practising Catholics fell dramatically.

This dissertation seeks to consider whether foundation governors today understand their responsibilities as stewards of the school’s mission. Governors from three Catholic primary schools in different dioceses were invited to complete a questionnaire; additional information was gathered from the diocesan websites and OfSTED reports.

40|$|Abstract]: The {{drive to}} {{understand}} and to improve the adoption of self-service, technology-based teaching and dynamic learning environments has created interest in recent years. Owing to the availability, flexibility and convenience of wireless devices, learning/training programs appear to be providing benefits to instructors and students alike. Over the years, wireless technologies have improved communication capabilities, videoconferencing, data management and live discussion forums. The reduction {{in the cost of}} hardware and Internet services and the increased capabilities of wireless devices in conjunction with the capabilities of the World Wide Web are popular among students and academics. While universities, Technical and Further Education colleges and <b>other</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> realise the potential role played by wireless technologies in dynamic learning environments, users of those technologies have indicated conflicting outcomes, claiming a failure of wireless technologies in learning environments. What appear to be consistent factors in {{the success or failure of}} such technologies is the context in which these applications are used, the specific applications for learning and teaching, infrastructure and change management. The literature indicates that sophisticated applications and features are constantly being developed for the wireless learning environment. Australian institutions are using wireless technologies for specific objectives in educational environments, but the adoption of those technologies is a complex and technical process. This exploratory research reports outcomes of a preliminary discussion with students about the influence of wireless technologies on learning purposes. The prime focus of the discussion was to extract themes that can identify factors that have an impact on the adoption of wireless technologies in learning environments in order to develop an initial conceptual model...|$|E
30|$|Since its establishment, ECDA has {{conducted}} {{a wide variety}} of PD initiatives in collaboration with <b>other</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and agencies such as SEED Institute and Science Centre Board. These PD initiatives (e.g., workshops, courses) have been varied with regard to content focus, duration, and delivery style. With regard to content focus, the courses and workshops offered by ECDA aim at developing preschool educators’ knowledge and skills in the learning areas outlined in the NEL framework. In 2016, for example, 22 courses and workshops were offered (ECDA 2016). A descriptive analysis carried out {{for the purposes of this}} paper identified that 17 of them (77 %) were directly related to one specific learning area, two (9 %) were related to several learning areas, and three (14 %) were related to other topics not covered explicitly in the NEL framework. More specifically, six workshops and courses (27 %) were related to Aesthetics and Creative Expression, followed by five (22 %) related to Discovery of the World, three (13 %) to Language and Literacy, three (13 %) to Numeracy, two (9 %) to Motor Skills Development, and two (9 %) to Social and Emotional Development. Examples of these courses and workshops are ‘Development of Numeracy in Early Childhood Education’ (Numeracy), ‘Fun Elements of Art’ (Aesthetics and Creative Expression) and ‘Discovery of the World through Inquiry-based Learning’ (Discovery of the World). We speculate that the strategy of privileging certain areas over others might be a measure purposefully adopted by the local PD providers to strengthen teachers’ knowledge and skills in areas that are rather secondary within pre-service preparation programs (e.g., Aesthetics and Creative Expression and Discovery of the World), and with which teachers tend to feel less confident (Berthelsen et al. 2011).|$|E

Various skills development legislation were introduced to meet international standards, redress skills imbalances, curb skills shortages and improve the general skills in the current workforce. <b>Training</b> <b>providers</b> were the drivers of workplace training, yet are now displaced by skills authorities, such as the SET As, the ETQAs and SAQA. While the custody of skills development {{is placed in the}} hands of employers and employees, <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> must become frontline soldiers in the skills battlefield. Rapid technological advancements, complex skills legislative requirements and ineffective internal management frameworks challenge workplace <b>training</b> <b>providers.</b> <b>Training</b> <b>providers</b> need to upgrade to OBE and NQF principles, provide and assess learnerships and skills programmes, and ensure that skills programmes allow employees to gain national qualifications and credits. Empirical research, undertaken {{in the midst of the}} skills battlefield, voices the opinions of managers, employees, <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and skills authorities on the effectiveness and improvement of <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> to improve skills development. This research employed the multimethod approach using quantitative survey questionnaires and qualitative interviews to gather data on the management factors essential to providing training and improving workplace skills. Action field researchers, the skills legislative framework and current successful workplace management frameworks directed this socio-educational research. Empirical evidence reveals that <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> are challenged by workplace and skills legislation. The skills levy-grant system burdens workplace managers and <b>training</b> <b>providers,</b> yet creates incentives for annual skills grant recoveries. <b>Training</b> <b>providers</b> must provide job relevant training, continuous assessment and SAQA/NQF accreditation to be effective and improve skills development. The empirical research concludes that <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> must 'identify each training programme as a project and manage it well'. Basic management of workplace training entails managing skills development holistically, initiating and sustaining various skills projects and developing workplace skills plans in annual cycles. Implementation of skills projects include seeping, scheduling, cost, HR, quality and risk management. Research conclusions recommend an internal skills management framework for improving <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> to improve workplace skills development.

The project, ‘Providing client-focussed education and training’, was funded by the FarmBis section of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The project also produced a self-assessment checklist for training providers to identify ways of improving the development and delivery of training. The key issues include continuous monitoring of client’s needs, and actively seeking opportunities to meet and work with industry organisations, <b>other</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and funding bodies.

Scanners are typically industry organisations, government agencies and researchers, but may include providers and participants. Scanners identify learning needs that are not yet being expressed by potential participants, with the occasional exception of leading primary producers. Expressed participant needs drive the development of other programs. Providers become aware of the need for a new or substantially revised program, for example as a result of feedback from an existing program, because of legislative change or from delivering a similar program in other industries or contexts (for example computer training).

40|$|Learning is an {{investment}} in capacity building that has {{and will continue to}} reap rewards for primary producers and government in terms of increased sustainable production, profitability, exports, jobs and sustainable rural communities. Primary production operates in a context of continual change and requires up to date, complex and varied skills of primary producers and land managers. A recent national research project funded by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Australia confirmed that application of best practice from the theory of adult education in designing and developing learning programs in primary industry results in learning activities that provide information that is relevant to farmers’ needs, delivered in an entertaining way, and that draws on examples directly relevant to the participants. As a result, the training often exceeds the expectations of the participants. The project produced a self-assessment checklist to identify ways of improving the development and delivery of training for extension practitioners and training providers. The key issues include continuous monitoring of client’s needs, and actively seeking opportunities to meet and work with industry organisations, <b>other</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> and funding bodies.

It is very important that farmers and farmer organisations {{contribute to the development of}} new learning programs. Without industry input and support, extension practitioners and training providers cannot be expected to ensure they meet client needs.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThis {{research}} {{was commissioned by}} Doras Luimní  {{with the aim of}} providing a micro and strategic analysis of ethnic entrepreneurs in the Midwest region of Ireland. A number of objectives were formed in order to answer this aim. The study examined two sets of entrepreneurs: those in the planning phase and those that have been established. Both established entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs in the planning phase were studied so as to provide a skill set analysis; a needs analysis and the identification of the barriers and/or challenges they faced in planning/establishing and/or operating their business. Furthermore, the study examined what assistance is currently being offered by support agencies/bodies in the region to ethnic entrepreneurs and to highlight any gaps that might exist. Additionally, the study examined support services outside of Ireland to identify best practice. Finally, the study will provide recommendations {{that can be used to}} inform agencies/support services in the region that provide support to entrepreneurs in terms of the needs of ethnic entrepreneurs that are currently not being provided by these agencies/service providers.  The methodology adopted for the study incorporated both primary and secondary research methods. The secondary research utilised key government, both national and international, reports that focused on entrepreneurs and ethnic entrepreneurs in particular. The websites of support agencies on the Island of Ireland were also examined to identify the support that is being offered to the unit of analysis. The primary research adopted was a questionnaire that was devised for three cohorts: ethnic entrepreneurs in the planning phase, ethnic entrepreneurs who have established their business and representatives of support agencies/ 3 rd level institutions/government agencies and training organisations who support entrepreneurs and ethnic entrepreneurs on the Island of Ireland. The questionnaire was administered online, via post and/or in person.  The response rate to the study was as follows: the response rate achieved for the entrepreneurs who were in the pre-planning phase was 57 % (n= 8). The response rate achieved for the established entrepreneurs was 49 % (n= 36). In relation to the government support agencies, third level education institutions and private support agencies that were surveyed, the response rate was 15 % (n= 61).  The key findings from the study are broken down into three sections: service providers; entrepreneurs in the pre-start-up phase and established entrepreneurs. On a European level, European service providers were examined using secondary research methods. The key findings from this analysis indicated that the typical services offered to ethnic entrepreneurs in Europe include the following: information services and advice; assistance in accessing financial supports; the provision of micro-credit; assistance in finding a business location; assistance with marketing; networking assistance and assistance on skills development. The key findings from the service providers on the Island of Ireland are: the majority provide general support to entrepreneurs; however, few provide targeted supports to ethnic entrepreneurs. Networking events are provided by all the service providers either on a formal basis or informal basis. Information is provided to ethnic entrepreneurs but the majority of service providers would not provide the information in the native language of the ethnic entrepreneur. Of the support agencies that do provide services to entrepreneurs, only a third of them have access to financial supports for ethnic entrepreneurs.  The key findings for the entrepreneurs in the planning phase highlighted the fact that they are well educated, have a desire to employ other people in the future; are more likely to provide a service than a product and will be most probably operating within the restaurant/food sector. Entrepreneurs in the planning phase highlighted more push factors than pull factors for the reason for considering establishing a business. This is due to the fact that in the majority of cases they have identified that they could not use their skills and/or qualifications elsewhere. Entrepreneurs in the planning phase have indicated a preference for a limited company as their business structure. The majority will apply for government grants and/or bank loans/overdrafts so as to fund their business start-up. The majority of pre-start-up entrepreneurs are confident in their current business skillset however they have highlighted some areas where they have gaps in, such as, branding; how to conduct market research, how to sell online; business planning and in a minority of cases: how to write a cash flow statement. The budding entrepreneurs did highlight their lack of awareness of training programmes offered by other support agencies, government bodies and <b>other</b> <b>training</b> <b>providers.</b> The key barrier and challenge the entrepreneurs in the planning phase stressed were that of a finance nature. Getting access to finance to start-up their businesses; getting a bank overdraft and availing of grants are barriers and challenges they believe they will face in the future.  The key findings for established entrepreneurs are: the majority were male, married, from Africa or Asia and resident in Ireland for 9 or more years. Entrepreneurs were educated to University level and this was their first venture ever established. The principle motivation for moving to Ireland was because relatives were already living here. The main reason why they established their business was because they saw an opportunity in the marketplace.  The majority of businesses were established between 2005 and 2010. The typical business structure took the form of a sole trader. The majority work in the business full-time with employees, who typically are not related to them. The majority of businesses were service orientated businesses within the food/restaurant, retail and personal services sector. Service, quality and price are the key differentiation factors entrepreneurs use. The key marketing activities they are engaged in are personal selling; advertising, the use of flyers and online marketing.  The sources of finance used to fund the start-up of the business was personal savings primarily with a small minority indicating bank loans and/or loans from family and friends augmenting the personal savings. Few established entrepreneurs at the pre-start-up phase met representatives from government agencies and/or support agencies. Few also attended training programmes at the pre-start-up phase, provided by these bodies. Awareness of these bodies was the key reason why they did not attend.  Established entrepreneurs indicated that they are capable of performing a variety of day-to-day business functions. However they did indicate that they will need assistance on the following: financial management issues (i. e. writing cash-flow statements; balancing the books]; conducting market research; designing a strategic plan for the business; and knowing how to brand a product/service. Some assistance on identifying potential sources of funding for investment was also highlighted.  Even though the established entrepreneurs were confident they could perform a variety of business tasks/functions they still highlighted the following areas as areas they would like some additional upskilling on: marketing and sales management; market research; computer skills; business planning; financial management and how to control costs. Additionally, the following are areas they foresee the need for training: understand how to sell/promote online; learn how to grow the business; learn how to balance work and life and understand how to write a business plan.  The key challenges and barriers they see for the future were financial and economic related. Pricing, currency fluctuations, getting access to finance and the availability of cash were the key financial challenges. Economic challenges included the recession; the impact of customers purchasing power being depleted and the wave of customers from their own ethnic community leaving the country due to the recession.  The key recommendations for this study are as follows. It is recommended that a review of EU policies on ethnic entrepreneurship and/or generic entrepreneurship policies is conducted on an annual basis by the support agencies so as to be aware of future developments within the area.  In relation to entrepreneurs in the planning phase training programmes on establishing a limited liability company and how to register your business name is recommended. Furthermore, training programmes on employment law (including the law on part-time employees) is also recommended.  Since the majority of entrepreneurs, either in the planning phase or those who have already established a business, are located within the food/restaurant sector, it is recommended that on an annual basis a HACCP, Health and Safety course and a Manual Handling course is offered to them.  Additional training programmes on how to conduct market research, how to brand a product and service and how to promote and sell a product/service online is also recommended.  Funding to start the business and/or operate the business was a key challenge for both sets of entrepreneurs. It is therefore recommended that the support agencies and/or government bodies in the region consider establishing a microcredit scheme. This is already operational in Dublin through the First Step initiative however no entrepreneurs in the Midwest region have availed of this. Support agencies and/or government bodies should review the microcredit schemes identified within the report so as to understand how such schemes are operated.  It is also recommended that a fact sheet or information sheet on the sources of funding that is available should be compiled and given to the entrepreneurs.  Communication between ethnic entrepreneurs and government bodies and/or support agencies is very poor. It is recommended that a concerted, targeted marketing campaign is devised to inform this cohort of entrepreneurs of their services and training initiatives. It is recommended to identify who the business leaders are in the ethnic communities and they should be communicated about such initiatives.    It is recommended that mentoring of entrepreneurs should be an integral part of the services offered by support agencies and all entrepreneurs associated with the support agencies and/or government bodies should be encouraged to participate.  Entrepreneurs of an ethnic origin should be encouraged to join local business associations like the Chambers of Commerce or the SMILE organisation. This can be facilitated by the support agencies in the region, through inviting representatives from these organisations to attend seminars being held by the support agencies.

MethodThis study is based on qualitative research methods, usingsemi-structured interviews with senior medical educationstaff of four regional general practice <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> inVictoria, Australia. ResultsIssues identified included language and cultural issues,applied knowledge and skills, attitude and professionalism,and health and family issues. The principal method that <b>training</b> <b>providers</b> identifiedissues was via the GP supervisor. This was predominantly byinformal communication, rather than formal evaluationsheets. Other methods included the external clinicalteaching visit and <b>other</b> <b>training</b> formative assessments. These more formalised procedures were more likely toidentify issues later than desired. They were also used as away of clarifying suspected problems. The selection processwas not felt to be helpful, and the examinations providedinformation too late. ConclusionAn increased awareness of the potential issues leading to aregistrar to require assistance enables identification andsubsequent action to occur in a more timely and moreuseful fashion. Informal communication between practicesand training programme staff should be encouraged toenable these issues to be dealt with early in training...|$|R
