5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} first {{advisory}} on the depression, the government <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> issued a tropical storm warning for the entire Pacific coast of the country. About four hours prior to landfall, when Alma was named, a tropical storm warning was in effect for the entire coastlines <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador. When it was realized the storm was much stronger than previously thought, a hurricane warning was issued for the coasts of Nicaragua and Honduras, and Alma was forecast to attain hurricane status. Prior to moving ashore, the NHC warned that the storm could produce up to 20inches (500mm) of rainfall, resulting in mudslides and flash flooding. The National Emergency Commission <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> activated emergency shelters prior {{to the arrival of}} the storm; 250people in Parrita evacuated from their homes. In Nicaragua, officials evacuated about 5,000people, while 3,000troops were mobilized to assist {{in the aftermath of the}} storm.|$|E

5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised the levels of many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.|$|E

The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} {{wave that}} would become John moved {{off the coast of}} Africa on August 17. It entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 24, and quickly showed signs of organization. That night, Dvorak classifications were initiated on the system while it was just west <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> and it moved west-northwestward at 10–15mph (15–25km/h). Conditions appeared favorable for further development, and convection increased late on August 26 over the area of low pressure. Early on August 27, the system became much better organized about 250miles (400km) south-southwest of Guatemala, although convection remained minimal. Early on August 28, banding increased within its organizing convection, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven-E.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Agatha {{was first}} {{identified}} as a trough of low pressure of the western coast <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> on May24, 2010. On May 29, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Agatha. Later that day, the system intensified slightly before making landfall near the Mexico-Guatemala border with winds of 45mph (75km/h). By the morning of May30, the center of Agatha moved over the highest terrain in Central America, resulting in the dissipation of the low-level circulation. Torrential rains from the storm widened the cavity, eventually causing {{the collapse of the}} sinkhole.|$|E

5|$|In Central America, Ida brought heavy {{rainfall}} to parts <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> Nicaragua and Honduras. Several people were reported missing in Nicaragua, however post-storm reports denied these claims. Thousands of buildings collapsed or sustained damage and roughly 40,000 people were left homeless. Damages from Ida in Nicaragua amounted {{to at least}} 46million córdoba ($2.12million US$). Aside from {{heavy rainfall}} in Mexico and Cuba, little impact from Ida was reported in either country. In the United States, the remnants caused substantial damage, mainly in the Mid-Atlantic States. One person was killed by Ida after drowning in rough seas, while six others {{lost their lives in}} various incidents related to the nor'easter. Widespread heavy rainfall led to numerous reports of flash flooding in areas from Mississippi to Maine. Overall, the two systems caused nearly $300million in damage throughout the country.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Alma of the 2008 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was the easternmost forming Pacific tropical cyclone on record. It formed within the monsoon trough {{just off the}} coast <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> on May 29. Initially forecast to remain a weak tropical storm, the cyclone rapidly strengthened and developed an eye before making landfall in Nicaragua near León with peak winds of 65mph (100km/h). Alma was the first tropical storm on record to strike the Pacific coast of Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, heavy rainfall caused flooding and landslides, killing two and causing $35million (USD) in damage. Three {{people were killed in}} Nicaragua, one from drowning and two others from electrocution. Five others died in Honduras from an aviation accident likely related to the storm and one other was swept away in floodwaters.|$|E
50|$|Talamanca is {{the fourth}} canton in the {{province}} <b>of</b> Limón in <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica.</b> It is the largest <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica's</b> 81 cantons, covering an area of 2809.93 km2, and {{has a population of}} 32,555. The county is composed of four districts (see graphic below), with its capital city, Bribrí, located in the Bratsi district. Talamanca houses the largest indigenous population in the country (at 11,062, or 34% of the county's population), which is composed principally of the Bribri and Cabécar groups (who in turn represent two <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica's</b> eight distinct indigenous groups).|$|R

5|$|Although it {{was once}} widely {{believed}} that coyotes are recent immigrants to southern Mexico and Central America, aided in their expansion by deforestation, Pleistocene and Early Holocene records, as well as records from the pre-Columbian period and early European colonization show that the animal was present in the area long before modern times. Nevertheless, range expansion did occur south <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> during the late 1970s and northern Panama in the early 1980s, following the expansion of cattle-grazing lands into tropical rainforests. The coyote is predicted to appear in northern Belize in the near future, as the habitat there is favorable to the species. Concerns have been raised of a possible expansion into South America through the Panamanian Isthmus, should the Darién Gap ever be closed by the Pan-American Highway. This fear was partially confirmed in January 2013, when the species was recorded in eastern Panama's Chepo District, beyond the Panama Canal.|$|E
5|$|Five Egyptian judoka {{qualified}} for the Olympics, all men, two of which advanced beyond the round of 32.

5|$|On June12, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed off {{the west coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica,</b> moved westward and entered the eastern Pacific after crossing Panama. The system became better organized as it tracked to the west-northwest as a westerly Kelvin wave provided favorable conditions for development. Convection increased around a developing low pressure area, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated a 50% chance of tropical cyclogenesis by late on June12. After further organization, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Three-E at 0300UTC on June14, while the system was located about 515mi (830km) south-southeast of Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca. At the time, the depression was located {{in an area of}} low wind shear and warm sea surface temperature conditions that were considered favorable for intensification. In addition, it had a small circulation, which increased the possibility for rapid deepening. The system moved northwestward after forming due to an extended ridge to the northeast. About six hours after forming, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Carlotta, after rainbands increased around the center.|$|E

5|$|Up to 1990, Nicaragua {{had lived}} with forty years of the Somoza dictatorship, through a decade of civil warfare and Sandinista rule, and five years of US imposed {{economic}} sanctions. On 25 February 1990, Chamorro won the election with a 54.7% share of the vote, ousting the incumbent Ortega and becoming the first elected woman president in the Americas. Because the election {{was held in the}} midst of a civil war, it was important both domestically and internationally that the vote was seen to be legitimate. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement which had been brokered by Arias, called for monitoring of elections by the Organization of American States and the United Nations, among other provisions. The election was the most strictly monitored of any in Latin America and involved 2,578 international observers among them former US President Jimmy Carter; Raul Alfonsín, former President of Argentina; Alfonso López Michelsen, former President of Colombia; Rodrigo Carazo Odio, former President <b>of</b> <b>Costa</b> <b>Rica</b> and many Caribbean and US dignitaries. Ortega and his supporters conceded defeat without argument and observers left only a skeleton staff to assist with the transition of power.|$|E
