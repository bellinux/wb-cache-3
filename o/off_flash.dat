6000|$|The public mind, {{following}} its own mysterious laws of selection, had chosen {{him as the}} one and only responsible Inventor and Promoter of this new wonder; it would hear nothing of Redwood, and without a protest it allowed Cossar to follow his natural impulse into a terribly prolific obscurity. Before he was aware of the drift of these things, Mr. Bensington was, so to speak, stark and dissected upon the hoardings. His baldness, his curious general pinkness, and his golden spectacles had become a national possession. Resolute young men with large expensive-looking cameras and a general air of complete authorisation took possession of the flat for brief but fruitful periods, let <b>off</b> <b>flash</b> lights in it that filled it for days with dense, intolerable vapour, and retired to fill the pages of the syndicated magazines with their admirable photographs of Mr. Bensington complete and at home in his second-best jacket and his slashed shoes. Other resolute-mannered persons of various ages and sexes dropped in and told him things about Boomfood--it was Punch first called the stuff [...] "Boomfood"--and afterwards reproduced what they had said as his own original contribution to the Interview. The thing became quite an obsession with Broadbeam, the Popular Humourist. He scented another confounded thing he could not understand, and he fretted dreadfully in his efforts to [...] "laugh the thing down." [...] One saw him in clubs, a great clumsy presence with the evidences of his midnight oil burning manifest upon his large unwholesome face, explaining to every one he could buttonhole: [...] "These Scientific chaps, you know, haven't a Sense of Humour, you know. That's what it is. This Science--kills it." [...] His jests at Bensington became malignant libels....|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{applications}} of electronics require non-volatile memories, which can keep stored information when the power supply is switched <b>off.</b> <b>Flash</b> memories (in which a single cell can be electrically programmed {{and a large number}} of cells are usually electrically erased at the same time) are the most versatile non-volatile memories. They are widely used to store the basic input-output system (BIOS) of personal computers, the software and personal data of cellular phones, identification codes in smart cards and many other applications. Flash memories allow software updates, change of passwords and codes, and reconfiguration of the system in the field. They can be designed and optimized to create large-size memories which can successfully substitute hard disks for specific applications, having lower power consumption and weight, shorter access times, and far better robustness. This book is devoted entirely to flash memories and has been designed to provide comprehensive information on basic memory cell structures, device physics and technology, simulation circuit architecture, system issues, testing and reliability. It also provides data on advanced subjects related to multi-level storage cells, embedded memories and system applications of flash memories...|$|E

40|$|Solid state {{memories}} {{are used in}} a variety of applications as data and code storages. A non-volatile memory is a memory that retains information when its power supply is <b>off.</b> <b>Flash</b> memory is a type of nonvolatile memory that can be erased and programmed by data called blocks. Flash memory is used to store system control codes in various applications. A recent representative example is Solid State Drive (SSD). A SSD is a type of computer storage that is composed of a number of flash memories. SSDs store data electronically unlike hard disk drives, which store data magnetically. The advantages of a solid-state drive are: no mechanical parts, less power and weight than hard disk drives. This thesis investigates existing technologies, markets, emerging technologies, and applications in the solid state memory market. It analyzes the current solid state memory industry structure using market data and frameworks. The emerging technologies and applications are researched in order to deliver technological innovations to the semiconductor memory market. It also studies and suggests how strategies of firms might influence technologies, value chains, and future evolutions using system dynamics models. The system dynamics models are based on a conventional commodity market model because of similarity between the semiconductor memory market and the commodity market. The simulation results provide insights into future market evolutions caused by new technologies. This research will lead to recommendations for companies currently struggling to survive in the industry, and for companies considering entry. by Tomohiko Nakamura. Thesis (S.

The flush of the morning was in her cheek, and its fire in her eyes, and she was aglow with youth and love.
