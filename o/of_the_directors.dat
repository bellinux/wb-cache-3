5|$|Continuing {{with this}} momentum, Hoffman {{appeared}} in five films in 1998. He had supporting {{roles in the}} crime thriller Montana and the romantic comedy Next Stop Wonderland, {{both of which were}} commercial failures, before working with the Coen brothers in their dark comedy The Big Lebowski. Hoffman had long been a fan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors,</b> and relished the experience of working with them. Appearing alongside Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, Hoffman played Brandt, the smug personal assistant of the titular character. Although it was only a small role, he claimed it was one for which he was most recognized, in a film that has achieved cult status and a large fan base. Between March and April 1998, Hoffman made 30 appearances on stage at the New York Theatre Workshop in a production of Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking, portraying an ex-heroin addict.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{practical}} limitations {{of meetings with}} 74 members {{on a regular basis}} (the total number of members from the five Chambers), the Charter called for a board of directors comprising nineteen members of the five Chambers. Van Rensselaer was chosen a member of this College of XIX, as it was called. It is said that care was exercised in the selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> of each chamber, and only men of wealth and the highest known integrity were eligible for the trust.

5|$|Euryalus, {{named after}} the Greek hero Euryalus, was laid down on 18 July 1899 by Vickers, Sons & Maxim at their Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. She was {{launched}} 20 May 1901 in front of 30,000 spectators, and christened by Mrs. Douglas Vickers, wife of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> of the company. On 11 June 1901, {{the south side of}} the Ramsden dock at Barrow caught fire, and was practically destroyed before the flames could be extinguished. The recently launched Euryalus was laying alongside this wharf, and the fire set ablaze the teak wood sheathing of the cruiser. Considerable damage was done to the ship before she was hauled from the pier into the middle of the dock, and her completion was severely delayed. Towed to Cammell Laird at Birkenhead for repairs, the ship slipped off the blocks supporting her in drydock and was severely damaged. While on sea trials, she collided with the auxiliary vessel Traveller on 27 June 1903 at Devonport. Euryalus was finally completed on 5 January 1904, nearly two years after her sister ships.|$|E

From Europe the ships brought objets d'art, corals from the Mediterranean Sea, expensive clocks and other mechanical automatons known to the Chinese as sing-songs.

5|$|In similar fashion, many leading {{directors}} {{made one}} or more films at RKO during this era, including Alfred Hitchcock once more, with Notorious, and Jean Renoir, with This Land Is Mine (1943), reuniting Laughton and O'Hara, and The Woman on the Beach (1947). John Ford's The Fugitive (1947) and Fort Apache (1948), which appeared right before studio ownership changed hands again, were followed by She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) and Wagon Master (1950); all four were co-productions between RKO and Argosy Pictures, the company run by Ford and RKO alumnus Merian C. Cooper. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> under long-term contract to RKO in the 1940s, the best known was Edward Dmytryk, who first came to notice with the remarkably profitable Hitler's Children (1943). Shot on a $205,000 budget placing it in the bottom quartile of Big Five studio productions, {{it was one of}} the ten biggest Hollywood hits of the year. Another low-cost war-themed film directed by Dmytryk, Behind the Rising Sun, released a few months later, was similarly profitable.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors,</b> said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. Viewers have noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E

It took place on 20 July 1899, and was reported at great length in the Epworth Bells newspaper. The ceremony was performed by Miss Bletcher, the daughter of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Directors,</b> after which a luncheon for {{a large number of}} people was held in a marquee. Following speeches, about 400 children were given a free tea in the Temperance Hall, while adults were catered for in the schoolrooms of four local chapels. Sports were then held, watched by a crowd of 1,500, and finally there was a fireworks display. Most of the children later received a commemorative medal.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{draft of}} the film's script was written by Sho Aikawa at a hundred pages long, making the film over three hours long. Mizushima and others had to cut {{a third of the}} script's scenes out {{in order to make the}} film an appropriate length. Some scenes and characters were removed from the final cut, including a character named Steiner who could see auras, having a role similar to Noah's. A scene which was cut involved characters Roy Mustang and Winry Rockbell meeting in front of the late Maes Hughes' grave. By October 2004, the script was completed and the pre-check storyboards were produced. The pre-check storyboards showed the movements of objects and characters in each shot along with the characters' lines. Production on the proper storyboards began in November of the same year, but the schedule in producing the film was immensely busy, so the directors of the film split the storyboards into six sections, one for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors</b> to create.|$|E
5|$|For 1924–25, the Midland League was reorganised because eight Football League clubs withdrew their reserve {{teams from}} the competition.

The club struggled financially in this period, and was only kept going by the enthusiasm and generosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>directors.</b> John Fisher, one of these benefactors, was elected chairman in 1925. The Midland League was restored to its previous size for 1925–26 and York finished in 16th place after a poor start to the season, from which they never recovered. York enjoyed their most successful Midland League season in 1926–27, when they finished in sixth place and scored 96 goals in 38 league matches. They surpassed the FA Cup's qualifying rounds {{for the first time}} this season, being beaten 2–1 by Second Division team Grimsby Town at Blundell Park in the second round. In 1927, the club made its first serious attempt for election to the Football League, but Barrow and Accrington Stanley were re-elected instead. Fisher resigned as chairman in August 1927 and Brown took the position for the second time. After ranking seventh in the Midland League in 1927–28, York appointed their first official manager in July 1928, with Jock Collier named as player-manager. York finished ninth in 1928–29, and Jimmy Cowie was the divisional top scorer with 49 goals. This was York's last season in the Midland League as the club won election to the Football League on 3 June 1929, taking the place of Ashington in the Third Division North.|$|E
