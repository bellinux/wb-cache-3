5|$|Now infected, Wesley uses {{a digital}} sample of Captain Picard's voice to lure key {{engineering}} crew-members {{away from the}} engineering deck. He erects a force field around the area with his tractor beam device and assumes control of the ship. He allows one of the engineers, Mr. Shimoda (Benjamin W.S. Lum), who is acting in a childlike manner, into the force field. Mr. Shimoda manages to remove all of the isolinear chips from the engine control station and plays with them like toys. As the supergiant star collapses, a fragment is blown into a direct impact course with the two Federation ships, and without the chips in place, they cannot move out <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>way.</b> Chief Engineer Sarah MacDougal (Brooke Bundy) manages to disable Wesley's force field, and Data is sent to replace the chips. He reports {{that he will not}} have enough time. Wesley reverses the ship's tractor beam, repelling the Enterprise off the Tsiolkovsky, giving themselves the necessary additional seconds for Data to replace the chips enabling the ship {{to move out of the}} way. The crew is cured of the ailment, and Picard partially credits Wesley for helping to prevent a disaster.|$|E

The full line opened July 3, 1839, extending the line further to Syracuse via Rome (and further to Auburn via the already-opened Auburn and Syracuse Railroad). This line was not direct, going out <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to stay near the Erie Canal and serve Rome, and so the Syracuse and Utica Direct Railroad was chartered January 26, 1853. Nothing of that line was ever built, though the later West Shore Railroad, acquired by the NYC in 1885, served the same purpose.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of 1941, Germany which was intent upon invading the Soviet Union went out <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to improve {{relations}} with Turkey as the Reich hoped for a benevolent Turkish neutrality when the German-Soviet war began. At the same time, the British had great hopes in the spring of 1941 when they dispatched an expeditionary force to Greece that İnönü could be persuaded to enter the war on the Allied side as the British leadership had high hopes of creating a Balkan front that would tie down German forces, and which thus led a major British diplomatic offensive with the Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden visiting Ankara several times to meet with İnönü. İnönü always told Eden that the Turks would not join the British forces in Greece, and the Turks would only enter the war if Germany attacked Turkey. For his part, Papen offered İnönü parts of Greece if Turkey were to enter the war on the Axis side, an offer İnönü declined. In May 1941 when the Germans dispatched an expeditionary force to Iraq to fight against the British, İnönü refused Papen's request that the German forces be allowed transit rights to Iraq.|$|E

That same year, a fictionalised film account of Vicious's relationship with Spungen was released: Sid and Nancy, directed by Alex Cox. In his autobiography, Lydon lambastes the film, saying that it [...] "celebrates heroin addiction", goes out <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to [...] "humiliate [...] life", and completely misrepresents the Sex Pistols' part in the London punk scene. Although he praised Gary Oldman's performance as Vicious, Lydon felt Oldman only captured [...] "the stage persona {{as opposed to the}} real person." ...|$|E

[...] Among those critical of the racial commentary was Duke player Grant Hill who was cited in an Associated Press story that ran in major national media outlets.

500|$|Commentators commended {{the first}} half of [...] "Space Race". The A.V. Club {{columnist}} Todd VanDerWerff approved of several aspects of the episode—mainly its animation, character development, and dialogue. In his A grade review, VanDerWerff felt that the producers were playful with the concepts of space. [...] "Archer, of course, takes place in a weird blend of past and present," [...] he professed, [...] "but 'Space Race' goes out <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to toss 'future' into the middle of that mix as well. There are so many jokes that come just from the characters hanging out in anti-gravity, for God's sake, including a ping pong paddle strategically covering Pam's breasts." [...] Commenting on the program's animation, The A.V. Club journalist thought that its emphasis on the convergence of various science fiction techniques resulted in aesthetically pleasing visuals. VanDerWerff stated, [...] "Everything about this one gleams, and it makes for an Archer that will almost certainly look great in HD." [...] Furthermore, he adulated the episode's dialogue, avouching that even the characters with very limited screen time were given opportunities to shine with humor. Although Marcos Canales of Screen Invasion opined that [...] "Space Race: Part I" [...] contained far too many one-liners and jokes, he praised the storyline and was keen to the character progression of Lana. [...] "Usually, she’s the best agent ISIS has and can do pretty much anything," [...] explained Canales, [...] "so putting her in a situation where she was not a bad ass gave the character some added depth which is something most animated shows don’t prioritize." [...] Cinema Blend's Jesse Carp—despite criticizing the show's [...] "nonsensical" [...] narrative—declared it to be hilarious.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{described}} {{the film as}} a [...] "flashback {{to a time when}} baggy basketball shorts, hip-hop music and black shoes were considered controversial and an affront to hoops purists". Washington Post columnist Jason Reid noted that the film went out <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to present the inappropriate racial commentary by Jalen Rose when he described Duke basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski's recruits as Uncle Toms. Among those critical of the racial commentary was Duke player Grant Hill, who was cited in an Associated Press story that ran in major national media outlets. Hill blogged on The New York Times with a response naming a litany of Dukies castigated by Rose's general aspersions. His response {{was at the top of}} The New York Times [...] "most-emailed list" [...] for several days and was shared on Facebook by nearly 100,000 people within its first few days. King responded to Hill in The Wall Street Journal. In the midst of the media exchange, the 2011 editions of the teams advanced to meet on March 20 at 2011NCAA Tournament West Regional in Charlotte, North Carolina, at the Time Warner Cable Arena with Duke ranked as a #1 seed and Michigan as an #8 seed. Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski did not respond until after both teams were eliminated from the tournament, but he noted that he felt the statements were insulting and gave specific reasons why each of the Fab Five members did not go to Duke. Duke player and Michigan native Shane Battier supported Hill's statements saying, [...] "Maya Angelou couldn’t have written it and expressed it better." ...|$|E
500|$|Famitsus reviewers each {{praised the}} gameplay, story, and the {{introduction}} of full-motion movies. One reviewer cited it as the series' new exemplar, while another pointed out rough edges in the graphical redesign and that the new 3D perspective made seeing some parts of the map difficult. 1UP.com's Shane Betternhausen was positive overall, saying [...] " [...] delivers a superbly paced and rewarding adventure". RPGamer's Chris Privitere said [...] "While Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance doesn't necessarily add anything new to the tactical genre, it does everything very well", recommending it to players while stressing the need for patience. Peer Schneider of IGN called the game [...] "yet another worthy installment in Intelligent Systems' venerable strategy RPG series". RPGFan reviewer Mark Tjan said that while not the best Fire Emblem game he had played, [...] "it's certainly a good game and worth picking up if you're searching for an SRPG worth your time and money". Nintendo World Report's Karl Castaneda was also highly positive, though commenting that its graphical quality were more suited to {{the early days of the}} GameCube's life and that it might have been a great success if released during that period. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell, despite feeling that the game was flawed by inherent problems in the Fire Emblem formula, enjoyed the game and was willing to replay once he had finished. Greg Kasavin, writing for GameSpot, saying that [...] "by replacing the traditional random battles that typify most Japanese role-playing games with a fun and exciting turn-based combat system, and by going out <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>way</b> to deliver a memorable and genuinely emotional story, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance accomplishes what all role-playing games attempt, but very few actually manage to do". The majority of praise went to the game's story and gameplay, while criticism was focused on the graphical quality.|$|E

The technical base of the U-Bahn is located at Fröttmaning, too. After passing Kieferngarten station, which has two island platforms as well, it crosses over a rail bridge to Freimann and Studentenstadt. Between these two stations is a connection to mainline railway tracks, {{which is used to}} bring new trains into the network.

Part of this enhanced cooperation is required by laws passed {{at the behest of the}} 9/11 Commission, while part is attributed to the difficulty that the Bush administration had with its own transition, which lasted only five weeks and was felt to have had a deleterious effect on Bush's ability to govern.

2500|$|Yang {{rejects the}} notion that constitutionalism [...] "is a good word", and rejects the {{introduction}} of a term [...] "socialist constitutional governance" [...] (or another formulation of it) into Chinese ideological discourse. Constitutionalism, Yang believes, has discourse hegemony since it is backed by the bourgeoisie. Similarly to Engels' (see bar on right) and Vladimir Lenin's conclusions (among others), Yang concludes that constitutional systems are ruled by property relations which gives the bourgeoisie considerable control. In The Condition of the Working Class in England Engels' states (a position which is still endorsed by the CPC);Free competition will suffer no limitation, no State supervision; the whole State is but a burden to it. It would reach its highest perfection in a wholly ungoverned anarchic society, where each might exploit the other to his hearts content.

2500|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, snow-removal {{vehicles and}} tow trucks are usually equipped with intense warning lights of particular colours. These may be motorised rotating beacons, xenon strobes, or arrays of LEDs. The prescribed colours differ by jurisdiction; in most countries, {{blue and red}} special warning lamps are used on police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles. In the United States and some other jurisdictions, amber lights are for tow trucks, private security personnel, construction vehicles, and other nonofficial special-service vehicles, while volunteer firefighters use red, blue, or green, depending on jurisdiction. In the U.S. it {{is a violation of}} the D.O.T. (Department of Transportation) Uniform Vehicle Code for any non-emergency vehicle (Police/Fire/Ambulance) to operate forward-facing red lights of any kind. Cars in the U.S. only have red tail-lights, and no blue lights; a vehicle displaying a red (forward-facing) light (flashing or not) coming towards a driver, or from behind the driver (in rear view mirror) indicates that an official emergency vehicle is coming, requiring the driver to yield, pull {{off to the side of}} the road, or otherwise get out <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>way.</b> [...] Some U.S. States allow emergency vehicles to have blue lights that can be turned on to warn drivers of an emergency vehicle in action; blue and red lights can be combined, forward- and/or rear-facing, also. [...] In the UK, doctors may use green warning lamps although these do not allow the user to claim any exemption from road traffic regulations compared to the blue lights used by statutory emergency services when responding to calls. Special warning lights, usually amber, are also sometimes mounted on slow and/or wide vehicles such as mobile cranes, excavators, tractors, and even mobility scooters in certain conditions.|$|E
