40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{structural}} {{performance of a}} non- traditional pier. The Modular Hybrid Pier (MHP) being investigated here is a structure that consists of two floating, reinforced-concrete, modular sections post- tensioned together. The three main objectives were: confirm that the operations deck could sustain a typical <b>outrigger</b> <b>crane</b> load without damage; verify the capacity of a bollard used to moor ships to the MHP; and model {{the behavior of the}} structure subjected to earthquake excitations. During the deck test, the load was applied at a position perceived to be the most vulnerable. The operations deck behaved linearly up to the maximum applied load. The deck performed in a satisfactory manner without structural damage during the test. Vessels are berthed at the MHP with mooring lines that are wrapped around a steel bollard which is fixed to the pier deck. The bollard performed according to the design requirements in terms of the load capacity and there was no observable damage in the deck of the MHP. A multi-degree-of-freedom analytical model of the MHP was created {{to determine the effects of}} the dynamic loading of seismic events on the fenders and the structure as a whole. The model incorporates the load rate dependent nature of the fender material and change in axial force with deformation. Ten earthquakes were used to find the seismic response of the structur...|$|E

For the plate design in simulation 2, the <b>outrigger</b> of a <b>crane</b> as shown in Figure 9 is selected, and the plate materials and allowable soil bearing force are checked {{for the design of}} the materials. The designed plate and the crane are saved in pairs within the scope that stability is secured. Simulation 2 is completed when all the candidate cranes deduced from simulation 1 are reviewed.|$|R
