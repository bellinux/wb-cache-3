40|$|Firms in the European {{countries}} {{today have}} the possibility of choosing {{from a range of}} control enhancing mechanisms giving the controlling owners an amount of influence which is disproportional to their share of cash flow. The list of control enhancing mechanisms includes dual class shares, pyramidal <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> and several others. The justification for these control enhancing mechanisms is currently the subject of much debate within the European Union. The opposing positions in the debate can be stated briefly as i) the control enhancing mechanisms are an impediment to takeovers and should therefore be removed to improve the market for corporate control. ii) Removing the control enhancing mechanisms reduces the contractual freedom to decide desirable <b>ownership</b> <b>structures.</b> This report investigates whether <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> affect firm performance. To do so this study provides a description of the current <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> in European countries and the economic outcomes for firms using different <b>ownership</b> <b>structures.</b> The results are presented in the tables below. na...|$|R

25|$|Another {{application}} of strong reciprocity is in allocating {{property rights and}} <b>ownership</b> <b>structure.</b> Joint ownership of property can be {{very similar to the}} public goods game, where owners can independently contribute to the common pool, which then returns on the investment and is evenly distributed to all parties. This <b>ownership</b> <b>structure</b> is subject to the tragedy of the commons, in which if all the parties are self-interested, no one will invest. Alternatively, property could be allocated in an owner and employee relationship, in which an employee is hired by the owner and paid a specific wage for a specific level of investment. Experimental studies show that participants generally prefer joint ownership, and do better under joint ownership than in the owner employee organization.|$|E

40|$|Weak {{governance}} conditions prevailing {{in emerging}} and developing economies tend to encourage concentrated over diffused <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> in firms. In this paper we investigate whether the <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> {{in the home}} market are also replicated in the foreign subsidiaries or are subject to other factors. We contend that firms with concentrated <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> in emerging economies tend to prefer partial over absolute ownership in the foreign subsidiaries. This preference is more pronounced in investing firms who are affiliated to business groups. An examination of 317 cross-border acquisitions by Brazilian acquiring firms in different host countries suggests that acquirer ownership concentration, business group affiliation {{as well as the}} joint effects of the two factors all appear to be correlated with lower equity ownership in the foreign target firm...|$|R

25|$|The present <b>ownership</b> <b>structure</b> {{emerged in}} 2012, after the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (the company's former {{principal}} owner) announced {{the sale of}} its 75 percent stake in MLSE to a partnership between Bell Canada and Rogers Communications, in a deal valued at $1.32 billion. As part of the sale, two numbered companies were created to jointly hold stock. This <b>ownership</b> <b>structure</b> ensures that, at the shareholder level, Rogers and Bell vote their overall 75 percent interest in the company together and thus decisions on {{the management of the}} company must be made by consensus between the two. The remaining 25 percent is owned by Larry Tanenbaum, who is also the chairman of MLSE. Bell's pension fund is involved in Bell's ownership stake, at least in part, intended to ensure they can retain its existing 18 percent interest in the Montreal Canadiens, as NHL rules prevent any shareholder that owns more than 30 percent of a team from holding an ownership position in any other team.|$|E

The study type {{used in this study}} is hypothesis testing.

Other results show that financial distress also has partially influence the tax avoidance, while tax loss carry forward has no influence on tax avoidance. However, all the independent variables has simultaneously influence the tax avoidance. The limitations of this study are focused in the manufacturing companies on IDX as samples and only used two variables as the proxy for <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> which are foreign ownership and institutional ownership. Therefore, this study suggests to adding new variables that expected have effect to tax avoidance with different sectors of company.

40|$|Do jurisdictions with {{concentrated}} <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> {{require less}} reliance on audits as corporate governance mechanisms and devices? Why do concentrated <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> still prevail in certain jurisdictions which {{are considered to}} be “market based corporate governance systems”? More importantly, if failures and causes of recent financial crises are principally attributable to the fact that market based corporate governance mechanisms, such as financial regulators, are not optimally performing their functions, why is the role of audits still paramount in such jurisdictions? These are amongst some of the questions which this paper attempts to address. The ever increasing growth of institutional investors in jurisdictions – particularly those jurisdictions with predominantly concentrated <b>ownership</b> <b>structures,</b> with their increased stakes in corporate equity, also raises the issue of accountability and the question as regards whether increased accountability is fostered where institutional investors assume a greater role – as opposed to position which exists where increased stake of family holdings (family controlled structures) arises. ...|$|R

40|$|Published by Elsevier Ltd. This paper {{examines}} {{the relations between}} financing institutions and more local <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> for energy provision. This research defines municipal and civil society structures involved in energy provision as the 'Civic Energy Sector'. It argues that the financial institutions of nations are key enabling institutions for this sector {{to contribute to a}} low carbon energy transition. The path of development of these financial institutions helps to shape the <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> and technology choices of energy systems and futures in different nations. This paper presents findings from case analysis comparing the United Kingdom's latent civic energy sector, with the expansion of this sector in Germany. Using an institutional economics framing, the paper demonstrates the importance of the German local banking sector in facilitating civic <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> in that country. In contrast, the neo-liberal, market-led financial institutions in the UK, reinforce energy pathways less reliant on civic ownership models. Hence, the forms of low carbon energy transition being pursued in these countries are constrained by path dependence of institutions both within and beyond the energy sector...|$|R

We base our analysis on a new and unique dataset of uniform ownership data of the largest 100 firms in the five major European economies. We quantify the differences in ownership by comparing three distinct <b>ownership</b> <b>structures</b> of firms and relating them to performance.
