50|$|<b>Process</b> <b>cameras</b> {{were still}} widely in use {{until the late}} 1980s and early 1990s. At that time, {{computer-to-plate}} technology became economically viable and had significant advantages over the analogue <b>process</b> <b>cameras.</b> There {{was no need for}} staff to operate the cameras or expose the negatives and this also meant that the chemicals and film and subsequent expense required for traditional methods were no longer necessary. In some industries, large production areas were replaced by one relatively compact machine - this also having {{a significant impact on the}} buildings used for graphic reproduction. As a result, the <b>process</b> <b>camera</b> has become obsolete very quickly indeed and very few remain in use.|$|R
50|$|Graphic arts <b>process</b> (copy) <b>cameras</b> {{generally}} use apochromatic lenses for sharpest possible imagery as well. Classically designed apochromatic <b>process</b> <b>camera</b> lenses {{generally have}} a maximum aperture limited to about 9. More recently, higher-speed apo lenses {{have been produced}} for medium format, digital and 35 mm cameras.|$|R

The algorithm needs to <b>process</b> <b>camera</b> images quickly to detect any human {{in the range}} of vision, and generate alerts, especially if the object under scrutiny is moving in certain directions.

Our approach involves modeling physically meaningful {{information that can be}} used to constrain the interpretation process, as well as modeling the actual scene content. In particular, we address the problems of modeling the imaging <b>process</b> (<b>camera</b> and illumination), the scene geometry (edge classification and surface reconstruction), and elements of scene content (material composition and skyline delineation). ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>process</b> <b>camera</b> is a {{specialised}} form {{of camera}} used for mass reproduction of graphic materials. The original document was photographed and the negatives (or positive films)produced {{were used to}} produce printing plates or other graphic media - usually via some kind of process where the negative was put in intimate contact with a printing plate in a vacuum frame(the printing plate having a U.V light-sensitive coating) and exposed to U.V. light. See offset lithography, silk screen printing, Photozincography and Heliozincography {{for more information on}} this process.|$|R
50|$|The camera (or 'camera obscura') is a {{dark room}} or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is {{excluded}} except the light that forms the image. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see <b>Process</b> <b>camera).</b>|$|R

2500|$|These times only {{include the}} actual optical writing {{pass over the}} disc. [...] For most disc {{recording}} operations, additional time is used for <b>overhead</b> <b>processes,</b> such as organizing the files and tracks, which adds to the theoretical minimum total time required to produce a disc. [...] (An exception might be making a disc from a prepared ISO image, for which the overhead would likely be trivial.) [...] At the lowest write speeds, this overhead takes so much less time than the actual disc writing pass {{that it may be}} negligible, but at higher write speeds, the overhead time becomes a larger proportion of the overall time taken to produce a finished disc and may add significantly to it.|$|R

It is able to detect suspicious or dangerous activity and identify its location, and now incorporates facial recognition. [...] Virtual Shield {{is also used to}} record activity at a potential crime scene before police arrive at a call. The cost of the program was $217 million, much of which came from Homeland Security grants.|$|R

30|$|While this hybrid parallelization method {{significantly}} {{improves the}} scalability of reconstruction process, {{it can also}} introduce some overhead. In particular, if the replicated reconstruction objects are large, the communication <b>overhead</b> between <b>processes</b> becomes more visible (mainly because of the process-level group combination operations). This overhead is extensively evaluated with different tomography datasets in “System evaluation” section.|$|R

The British handbook of printing technology, the Penrose Annual, Volume X, 1904-05, mentioned about him in an editorial note that, [...] "Mr. Ray is evidently possessed of a mathematical quality of mind and he has reasoned out for himself the problems of half-tone work in a remarkably successful manner ... (His printing developments) enable the operator to do uniform work with the fullest graduation and detail in it and with the minimum amount of manipulative skill in the negative-making and etching." [...] The Penrose Annual Volume XI of 1905-06 published his paper about the new technique of 60-degree screens in halftone blockmaking.|$|R

The method utilizes a physical model of the human eye, ad- vanced Bayesian computer vision algorithms, and Kalman filtering, resulting in high accuracy and low noise.

The performance {{of the system is}} validated in an exhaustive experimental setup with 19 participants, using a self-made device. Due to the used eye model and binocular cam- eras, the system is accurate for all distances and invariant to device movement. We also test our system against a best-in-class commercial device which is outperformed for spatial accuracy and precision.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary conceptual investigation into an environment representation that has constant space complexity {{with respect to}} the camera image space. This type of representation allows the planning algorithms of a mobile agent to bypass what are often complex and noisy transformations between camera image space and Euclidean space. The approach is to compute per-pixel potential values directly from <b>processed</b> <b>camera</b> data, which results in a discrete potential field that has constant space complexity {{with respect to the}} image plane. This can enable planning and control algorithms, whose complexity often depends {{on the size of the}} environment representation, to be defined with constant run-time. This type of approach can be particularly useful for platforms with strict resource constraints, such as embedded and real-time systems.

50|$|The technique, if {{used with}} a camera not {{specially}} designed for contact printing, {{runs the risk of}} jamming the camera, due to the double thickness of film in the gate, and damaging both the exposed and unexposed stock. On the other hand, because both strips of film are in contact and are handled by the same film transport mechanism at the same time, registration is kept very precise. Special cameras designed for the process were manufactured by Acme and Oxberry, amongst others, and these usually featured an extremely precise registration mechanism specially designed for the <b>process.</b> These <b>process</b> <b>cameras</b> are usually recognisable by their special film magazines, which look like two standard film magazines on top of each other. The magazines allow the separate loading of exposed and unexposed stock, as opposed to winding the two films onto the same reel.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{possibility}} to apply conventional watermarking methods in a print-cam process is discussed. In the print-cam process, the watermark is read from a printed image with a <b>camera</b> phone. The <b>process</b> inflicts serious attacks to the watermark and, especially geometrical distortions. If the distortions are not inverted, they may destroy the watermark. In this paper, the distortions are corrected from the captured image with invisible, and visible templates and the message is successfully extracted after the distortions have been corrected. The BER values obtained are beneath 1. 1 % with resolution of 1600 x 1200 and JPEG quality factors of 100 % and 80 %. The success ratios are above 98 % with respective settings, which shows that the inversion of the distortions was successful and the watermarking method is robust against the print-cam process.
