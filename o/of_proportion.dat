5|$|Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra) is based loosely on Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, {{in which the}} Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an {{alliance}} with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to The Coral Finder, Cleopatra is {{more closely related to}} the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are out <b>of</b> <b>proportion</b> to each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Persons with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have no detectable systemic {{symptoms or}} signs (i.e., outside the mouth).

Pain is worst in the days immediately following the initial formation of the ulcer, and then recedes as healing progresses. If there are lesions on the tongue, speaking and chewing can be uncomfortable, and ulcers on the soft palate, back of the throat, or esophagus can cause painful swallowing. Signs are limited to the lesions themselves.|$|E

The USGS then presented a moment magnitude of 7.2 that was calculated from 5–100-second surface waves, and Harvard University subsequently revealed that a moment magnitude of 7.7 had been resolved based on even longer 150-second surface waves.|$|E

40|$|Daniele Barbaro 2 ̆ 7 s {{commentary}} {{represents the}} culmination of the Renaissance efforts to understand the complex architectural theory of Vitruvius 2 ̆ 7 De architectura. The erudition of Barbaro, his personal contacts with the leading intellectuals and artists of his time, as well as collaboration with Palladio, make his commentary an exceptional document of Renaissance architectural theory. This dissertation analyzes the theory <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> expounded in the commentary. ^ The problems of the theory <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> in Barbaro 2 ̆ 7 s commentary on Vitruvius can be divided into two groups: those that pertain to the theoretical foundation of the theory <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> and those that relate to the application of the theory <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> to architecture. The former include the position of the theory <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> in the context of Barbaro 2 ̆ 7 s philosophical views {{as well as in the}} context of the Renaissance speculations about Harmonia Mundi. Particular attention has been paid to the relation of Barbaro 2 ̆ 7 s commentary on Vitruvius with respect to his philosophical works which have been neglected so far and to the reconstruction of the position of the architectural theory <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> in the context of the sixteenth century Paduan Aristotelianism. ^ There are three crucial problems regarding the application of the theory <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> to architecture in Barbaro 2 ̆ 7 s commentary on Vitruvius: the debate about symmetry (i. e. the commensurability versus the incommensurability of ratios); the applicability to architecture of the ratios from Vitruvius 2 ̆ 7 chapter on harmonics and the theory of classical orders. ^ A very important problem that arises from the separation of the theoretical foundation and the architectural application of the theory <b>of</b> <b>proportions</b> comes from the impression that the proportional rules whose application Barbaro suggests are not directly deduced from his general theoretical considerations. A careful analysis of Barbaro 2 ̆ 7 s philosophical writings and pneumatological debates of the time helps resolve this seeming contradiction. ...|$|R
