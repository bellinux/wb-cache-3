5|$|The Daleks in London, {{commissioned}} on 25 May 1971, {{was to be}} {{the final}} story of Season 9 in 1972, re-introducing the Daleks after a five-year absence. Little is known about the exact storyline of the six-part Robert Sloman serial, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it would have had some similarities to The Dalek Invasion of Earth, except set in contemporary London. This similarity caused the production team some concern, and producer Barry Letts eventually decided that he would rather start the series with a Dalek adventure instead of ending it with one. An unrelated submission by Louis Marks was therefore rewritten into Day of the Daleks, and The Time Monster was then written and commissioned to replace the original series finale.|$|E
25|$|The {{two plays}} are {{unrelated}} <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{they are both}} based on another play which is now lost. This is the Ur-Shrew theory (in reference to Ur-Hamlet).|$|E
25|$|O. Hashnu Hara. Although {{is hard to}} find {{concrete}} evidence, {{the first}} clue is always the impossibility to find information about the writer, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he wrote books published by Atkinson. Books under this name include: Practical Yoga; Concentration; and Mental Alchemy, all books with titles similar to other Atkinson's books.|$|E
50|$|At some point, ibn Habib {{was sent}} as an {{emissary}} to the Jewish community Turkey; however, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of his dispatch, nothing else {{is known about}} this period of his life.|$|R
5000|$|The {{title and}} {{introductory}} music {{are inspired by}} the 1942 film Yankee Doodle Dandy, a major hit and a Warner release. <b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of both films being about show business, they have no plot elements in common.|$|R
5000|$|Not much {{is known}} about Jusuf's early life <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he was a Bugis aristocrat as {{witnessed}} by the titular name [...] "Andi" [...] {{in front of his}} name. Jusuf would later denounce his aristocratic background by dropping Andi from his name.|$|R
25|$|Little is {{documented}} on the specifics {{and the basic}} model of the D.33, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it had a fixed undercarriage, and was a low-wing cantilever monoplane. There were three documented variations to the model, each of which {{was designed as a}} separate aircraft. This line of aircraft were regarded highly commercially before World War II, and they were influential in the establishment of the Dewoitine Company.|$|E
25|$|He is {{separated}} from his mother, who lives in Ohio, but they {{talk on the phone}} frequently and have a close relationship. (At the time the Achewood cookbook came out, she was in Iowa.) <b>Other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he is deceased, nothing is known about Philippe's father, although he appeared in one strip thus far in a dream. He is implied to be of French descent, and to have fought in a war as a youth. From time to time, Philippe's mother sends him unusual presents.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of baking Easter breads, {{also known as}} hot cross buns, have been documented to exist {{at least since the}} 1500s. Two cross-marked buns have also been found in the Roman city of Herculaneum in modern-day Italy dating back as early as 79 CE. The Irish in particular have been known to bake a key {{in the shape of a}} cross inside the bread during the Easter period. It is uncertain, however, how cross buns are similar to shlissel challah, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> people have always made signs or symbols on their bread.|$|E

25|$|February: Unidentified. Murdered {{sometime}} in February 1981. Nilsen recalled little about this victim, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he was originally from Belfast, was slim, approximately 5ft.9in. tall, and was aged {{in his early}} 20s. He had encountered this victim somewhere in the West End after the pubs had closed. He was strangled with a tie and his body subsequently placed beneath the floorboards.|$|R
50|$|Very {{little is}} known of Benton outside of his UNIT duties, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he has a younger sister and is {{apparently}} fond of ballroom dancing. In fact, his first name was never revealed in the television series. He flirted briefly with Jo Grant, the Third Doctor's assistant, and also Sarah Jane Smith, but neither appeared to get beyond good-natured bantering.|$|R
25|$|Besides the {{military}} Smith was elected treasurer in DeKalb County, {{little is known}} about him <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he designed his home in the 200 block of Sycamore's Somonauk Street. F.W. Partridge was an attorney who began his legal career in the DeKalb County city of Sandwich, Illinois. Later, when he moved to Sycamore, he achieved some notoriety in that profession. During the Civil War Partridge was a breveted Brigadier General. Toward {{the end of the war}} he served as DeKalb County Clerk and Recorder; from 1864-1867. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed him as ambassador to Siam.|$|E
25|$|In 1888 Roberts {{moved to}} Chicago {{where he worked}} as a site {{superintendent}} for S.S. Beman at Pullman, {{on the south side of}} the city. Roberts remained at that job until 1893. Roberts moved to the Chicago suburb of Oak Park in 1893 and established his own practice which eventually grew to become the largest architecture firm in the village of Oak Park, rivaling even architecture giant Frank Lloyd Wright's practice. In Oak Park he designed over 200 homes which span a multitude of architectural styles. Wright and Roberts were not, themselves, professionally associated, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they were competing architects.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, Vivendi {{announced}} a Game Boy Advance version of The Fellowship {{would also be}} released. Developed by Pocket Studios, the game was to be called Lord of the Rings, Part I, and was to feature the full plot of The Fellowship and roughly half of The Two Towers. This would be followed soon after by Lord of the Rings, Part II, featuring {{the second half of}} Two Towers and all of Return of the King. Vivendi revealed little about the games <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they were to be more RPG based than the Xbox Fellowship game, and would be played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view.|$|E

50|$|Like many grapes in Croatia, {{the history}} behind Babić is largely unknown <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{it has been}} {{actively}} grown in the Northern Dalmatian region for hundreds of years. One theory {{is that it is}} a localized clone of Dobričić. Another suggests that it is connected to Dobričić via a parent/offspring relationship. Until more genetic testing has concluded, it will not be known for certain.|$|R
50|$|To {{link the}} run with Sister Act <b>the</b> Musical (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{everyone}} is dressed as nuns), {{some of the}} cast as well as Barnardo's Children's Choir give performances at the start line. This not only helps to fuse the link between Barnardo's and the show, but makes it a fun event, as it is designed as a charity event rather than for competitive runners.|$|R
25|$|Ties That Bind {{was first}} {{referred}} to in late 2004, when Midway Games released an earnings statement in which it spoke of the financial success of the first game. No other information was revealed at the time, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a sequel was in development. On January 19, 2005, Midway revealed the game would be released for PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and was being developed by Surreal Software, the same team who had worked on the first game. They also announced the title, and revealed the game would begin moments {{after the end of}} the first game, but the intro sequence would depend on which ending the player received in the first game, assuming they still had a saved game file.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{among the}} Ghilji reveal strong links between tribal affiliation and {{membership in the}} larger ummah (Islamic community). Afghan historians believe that most Pashtuns are descendants of Qais Abdur Rashid, who is purported {{to have been an}} early convert to Islam and thus bequeathed the faith to the early Pashtun population. The legend says that after Qais heard of the new religion of Islam, he travelled to meet Muhammad in Medina and returned to Afghanistan as a Muslim. He purportedly had four children: Sarban, Batan, Ghourghusht and Karlan. Before the Islamization of their territory, the Pashtuns likely followed various religions. Some may have been Buddhists while others Zoroastians, worshippers of the sun, or worshippers of Nana, with some probably being animists, shamanists and Jews. However, there is no conclusive evidence to these theories <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> these were the religions practiced by the people in this region before the arrival of Islam in the 7th century.|$|E
500|$|Declan {{was raised}} by single mother, Rebecca. They moved around a lot as Rebecca was running away from her abusive partner, and Declan's father, Richard (Blair Venn). Declan knew nothing about Richard, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Rebecca {{referred}} {{to him as a}} [...] "monster". Rebecca often struggles to pay the bills and Declan turned to crime to raise money.|$|E
50|$|Father Mike (George DelHoyo) is a clergyman {{who serves}} as host of Religion on the Line at KACL. He appears or is {{referenced}} in various episodes throughout the first two seasons, before being fired by new station manager Kate Costas in the first episode of season 3, seemingly for no reason <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> Kate found his show boring - something which concerned Frasier, whose show had similar audience figures.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} of her {{subsequent}} service under <b>the</b> French flag <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> it was brief. A bit over three years later, she was carefully examined by a survey committee which found her damaged by dry rot beyond economical repair, probably caused by her wartime construction from green timber. She was accordingly scrapped and a much larger America with nearly twice her weight of shot was built to take her place.|$|R
50|$|Until 2014, {{not much}} {{was known about}} <b>the</b> galaxy, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> it was irregular. In early 2014, the galaxy was {{observed}} with a 2-foot telescope at the SARA remote observatory in Chile, revealing the galaxy in higher resolution. It appears the galaxy {{is in the process}} of forming stars at a high rate - primarily in the red areas in the image. Additionally, the galaxy has several small clumps of stars, implying an ongoing merger.|$|R
500|$|However, not all reviews were positive. The same review from The Plain Dealer [...] {{expressed}} displeasure at how, [...] "after 150 {{pages of}} romantic dithering, I was tapping my foot to move on." [...] A review from Entertainment Weekly opined {{that the book}} was weaker than the first and wrote, [...] "Katniss pretends {{to be in love}} with her sweet-natured Games teammate Peeta Mellark, but she secretly pines for brooding Gale, a childhood friend. Except— why? There's little distinction between the two thinly imagined guys, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Peeta has a dopier name. Collins conjures none of the erotic energy that makes Twilight, for instance, so creepily alluring." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankovic {{waited for}} almost two years for the next [...] "big thing" [...] to emerge. [...] "I don't have any really good reason why it took so long <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I was waiting for Michael Jackson's new album to come out," [...] Yankovic explained. Unfortunately for Yankovic, the new album hit several snags. On November 26, 1991, Michael Jackson's new album, Dangerous was released. After hearing the hit single [...] "Black or White," [...] Yankovic {{approached}} Jackson about a potential parody entitled [...] "Snack All Night." [...] Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic's work, he felt that a parody might damage the song's message. Jackson told Yankovic that he could, if he wanted to, parody another song off his album, but just not [...] "Black or White".|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, Ben Gibbard {{posted on}} his Twitter account {{that there are}} [...] "no plans" [...] to produce another Postal Service record, and did not cite any {{specific}} reason for this statement, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> multiple fans questioned if {{there was going to}} be a second album.|$|E
50|$|One of {{his final}} campaigns was against the {{practice}} of the City Council drawing its own district boundaries. He urged that instead the boundaries should be set by a special commission of retired Municipal Court judges. In a related comment, on his last day in office he issued a press release applauding the U.S. Supreme Court in its Shaw v. Reno decision invalidating the drawing of a serpentine-shaped Congressional district whose parts seemed to {{have nothing to do with}} each <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> they were inhabited mostly by black people.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with BVTV, featuring band members Devin Oliver and Brent Allen, Oliver stated: [...] "me, Brent, the drummer's my brother, and the bass player, Jeff, we all lived on the block from each other since we were kids, in elementary school." [...] In the same interview, it is also stated {{that there is no}} specific reason for the band's name, I See Stars, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> they needed a title and [...] "someone brought it to the table". The band was officially formed in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} used as the offices of Michael Hopkins and Partners for the next eight years (until the {{practice}} outgrew the space and moved to Marylebone). It served as an advertisement for the company's work and clients would be keen to visit. The Hopkins family also lived in the building and their three children grew up there. Defying convention, there was nothing to physically distinguish the work space from <b>the</b> living areas, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>the</b> family generally stayed on the ground floor and the work was carried out above. All the same, Patty Hopkins recalled having to hide the bed to make the work area look more professional. She also found it easier to reinforce the children's behavioural boundaries when business was regularly being conducted nearby. The couple continue to use the house as their London home.|$|R
2500|$|... "Hollywood forgives a {{lot when}} you have a hit," [...] said Hill. [...] "I don't know what to say about it, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it was just a gift in terms of getting it. The studio hated it, and didn't even want to release it. There was a lot of {{friction}} with management at the time. Some of it might have been my fault." ...|$|E
2500|$|On other occasions, {{causation}} is {{the only}} requirement for legal liability (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the outcome is proscribed). [...] For example, in the law of product liability, the courts have come to apply to principle of strict liability : {{the fact that the}} defendant's product caused the plaintiff harm {{is the only}} thing that matters. [...] The defendant need not also have been negligent.|$|E
2500|$|Dark Alliance {{was first}} {{revealed}} on November 7, 2000, when Interplay confirmed to IGN that a PlayStation 2 game based on [...] had entered production, following {{the cancellation of}} the Sega Dreamcast port of the original Baldur's Gate. Little was known at this time <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Interplay would publish, and BioWare, developers of the original Baldur's Gate, would not develop the game. Instead, the game was to be developed by Snowblind Studios. The game was officially confirmed on February 15, 2001. Black Isle Studios' division director Feargus Urquhart stated ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{applied to}} modern {{sentencing}} schemes, the Sixth Amendment demands that, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of a prior conviction, any <b>fact</b> that increases <b>the</b> defendant's punishment above the statutory maximum must {{be submitted to}} a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. [...] The [...] "statutory maximum" [...] is the greatest sentence the judge can impose based solely on <b>the</b> jury's <b>fact</b> finding. [...] In a guidelines sentencing scheme that requires judges to impose a sentence within the guideline range, the jury-trial and reasonable-doubt requirements apply to the determination of any <b>fact</b> that exposes <b>the</b> defendant to punishment above the guideline range.|$|R
50|$|He {{is first}} heard of as a royal clerk, but he {{rose in the}} public service to hold a number of royal commissions, and was granted a licence to export corn in 1360. He came to Ireland as Lord Chancellor in 1371 and held the office until 1374. O'Flanagan remarks that nothing is known of his career as Chancellor <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of his appointment. Elrington Ball however notes that he was {{entitled}} to a military guard while in Ireland, and was sufficiently knowledgeable about Irish affairs to {{be sent back to}} England to report on them in 1372.|$|R
50|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that Noguchi, seeing the girls in his village play with bubbles, {{was reminded of the}} brief existence of his daughter, and wrote this poem on that occasion. However, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> above <b>facts,</b> <b>the</b> direct inspiration for the song is unknown.|$|R
