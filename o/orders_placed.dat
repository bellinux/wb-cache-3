5|$|The Apollo 1 cabin fire in January 1967 put manned spaceflight on hold. The crew of Apollo 7, {{designated}} to be {{the return}} to manned spaceflight, began working with the Robbins Company later in 1967 to produce commemorative mission medallions. Commissioned by the NASA Astronaut Flight Office (AFO), the medallions were financed entirely through the <b>orders</b> <b>placed</b> by astronauts and support crew personnel. Only those directly affiliated with the AFO were eligible as purchasers, and they were bound by their employment contract not to commercialize the medallions, as NASA was concerned about any appearance that the astronauts might profit from the flown medallions.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Protestant historiography {{tended to}} stress the {{corruption}} and unpopularity of the late Medieval Scottish church, but more recent research has indicated {{the ways in which}} it met the spiritual needs of different social groups. Historians have discerned a decline of monastic life in this period, with many religious houses keeping smaller numbers of monks, and those remaining often abandoning communal living for a more individual and secular lifestyle. The rate of new monastic endowments from the nobility also declined in the fifteenth century. In contrast, the burghs saw the flourishing of mendicant orders of friars in the later fifteenth century, who, unlike the older monastic <b>orders,</b> <b>placed</b> an emphasis on preaching and ministering to the population. The order of Observant Friars were organised as a Scottish province from 1467 and the older Franciscans and the Dominicans were recognised as separate provinces in the 1480s.|$|E

25|$|Corporations {{manage their}} supply chain to take {{advantage}} of cheaper costs of production. A supply chain is a system of organizations, people, activities, information, and resources involved in moving a product or service from supplier to customer. Supply chain activities involve the transformation of natural resources, raw materials, and components into a finished product that is delivered to the end customer. In sophisticated supply chain systems, used products may re-enter the supply chain at any point where residual value is recyclable. Supply chains link value chains. Supply and demand can be very fickle, depending on factors such as the weather, consumer demand, and large <b>orders</b> <b>placed</b> by multinational corporations.|$|E
25|$|The D.V {{version was}} a less radical {{departure}} from the earlier D.II version and mostly differed from the D.II, in having its four-member cabane strut structure supporting a central panel for the upper wing, rather than both upper wing panel's wing roots meeting along the centreline of the aircraft, for better forward pilot vision. It also used the D.III version's Argus As.II engine and changed the mounting position of the aircraft's 7.92mm (.312in) lMG 08 machine gun from the right {{to the left side}} of the nose. A total of 57 D.V aircraft were built, from <b>orders</b> <b>placed</b> in October 1916 and January–June 1917, with 31 of these being sent to Germany's ally in the Central Powers, the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to a stockbroker, a {{professional}} who arranges transactions between a buyer and a seller, {{and gets a}} guaranteed commission for every deal executed, {{a professional}} trader may have a steep learning curve and his/her ultra-competitive performance based career may be cut short, especially during generalized stock market crashes. Stock market trading operations have a considerably high level of risk, uncertainty and complexity, especially for unwise and inexperienced stock traders/investors seeking {{an easy way to}} make money quickly. In addition, trading activities are not free. Stock speculators/investors face several costs such as commissions, taxes and fees to be paid for the brokerage and other services, like the buying/selling <b>orders</b> <b>placed</b> at the stock exchange. Depending on the nature of each national or state legislation involved, a large array of fiscal obligations must be respected, and taxes are charged by jurisdictions over those transactions, dividends and capital gains that fall within their scope. However, these fiscal obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Among other reasons, there could be some instances where taxation is already incorporated into the stock price through the differing legislation that companies have to comply with in their respective jurisdictions; or that tax free stock market operations are useful to boost economic growth. Beyond these costs are the opportunity costs of money and time, currency risk, financial risk, and Internet, data and news agency services and electricity consumption expenses—all of which must be accounted for.|$|E
500|$|Groves {{met with}} Major General Wilhelm D. Styer {{in his office}} at the Pentagon to discuss the details. They agreed that in order to avoid suspicion, Groves would {{continue}} to supervise the Pentagon project.

Groves therefore waited until his promotion came through on 23 September 1942 before assuming his new command. His <b>orders</b> <b>placed</b> him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Marshall now answerable to Groves. Groves was given authority to sign contracts for the project from September 1, 1942.|$|E
500|$|The 767-300ER, the extended-range {{version of}} the 767-300, entered service with American Airlines in 1988.

Power is provided by Pratt & Whitney PW4000, General Electric CF6, or Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. Typical routes for the type include Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The combination of increased capacity and range offered by the 767-300ER has been particularly attractive to both new and existing 767 operators. It is the most successful {{version of the}} aircraft, with more <b>orders</b> <b>placed</b> than all other variants combined. As of September 2017, 767-300ER deliveries stand at 583 with no unfilled orders. There were 441 examples in service as of July 2016. The type's main competitor is the Airbus A330-200.|$|E
