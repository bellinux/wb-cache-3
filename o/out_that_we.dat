According to Peter Oyston: over those years my sister and I worked <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had 82 callers a week, not counting those who came more than once. It was constant open house. My stepfather would start a party with his muso friends while my mother was at the theatre. And then my mother would bring back the cast and any {{people who came to}} see the shows. And the taxi drivers and, if the police called to quieten us up, then the police would be invited in and they'd join the party too. It really was an extraordinary time.|$|E

When you see and hear Jada with her band it's {{apparent}} that she has nothing but love and respect for this genre of music". In May 2005 organizers announced Wicked Wisdom would perform on {{the second stage of}} 2005's Ozzfest. Fans of the festival were outraged, claiming the band did not have the credibility to perform at the music festival. Aware of the questions about the band's addition to Ozzfest, Pinkett Smith said, [...] "I'm not here asking for any favors. You've got to show and prove. And not every audience is going to go for it." [...] Wicked Wisdom's guitarist Pocket Honore said while early dates of the tour were rocky, [...] "once word got <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> weren't a joke, people started coming out and by the sixth or seventh gig we were on fire". Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, [...] "After seven dates within the Ozzfest tour, the whole attitude of it started to turn around once the word of mouth started getting out." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole {{spoke about}} the refugee {{population}} in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to get the idea <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. But we also need to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E
500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to raise the bar for Pixar." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

2500|$|In Consciousness Explained (1991) and [...] "Quining Qualia" [...] (1988), Daniel Dennett {{offers an}} {{argument}} against qualia that {{demonstrates that the}} above definition breaks down when one tries to make a practical application of it. In a series of thought experiments, which he calls [...] "intuition pumps", he brings qualia {{into the world of}} neurosurgery, clinical psychology, and psychological experimentation. His argument shows that, once the concept of qualia is so imported, it turns <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can either make no use of it in the situation in question, or that the questions posed by the introduction of qualia are unanswerable precisely because of the special properties defined for qualia.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1978, the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) had {{prepared}} {{a draft of}} its final report, concluding that Lee Harvey Oswald had acted as the lone assassin. However, after evidence from the Dictabelt recording was made available, the HSCA quickly reversed its conclusion and declared that a second gunman had fired the third of four shots heard. HSCA chef counsel G. Robert Blakey later said, [...] "If the acoustics come <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> made a mistake somewhere, I think that would end it." [...] Despite serious criticism of the scientific evidence and the HSCA's conclusions, speculation regarding the Dictabelt {{and the possibility of}} a second gunman persisted.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually Clifford moved very close, with Johnson's tacit support, to {{the views}} McNamara held on Vietnam {{just before he}} left office—no further {{increases}} in U.S. troop levels, support for the bombing halt, and gradual disengagement from the conflict. By this time Clifford clearly disagreed with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who believed, according to The Washington Post, [...] "that the war was being won by the allies" [...] and that it [...] "would be won if America had the will to win it." [...] He later recalled how he turned against the war: [...] "I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> couldn’t win the war with the limitations that we had, which I thought were correct limitations, and I thought all {{we were going to}} do was just waste the lives of our men and our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 2006, {{asked whether}} {{negotiations}} with Russians are possible, the top separatist commander Doku Umarov answered: [...] "We offered them many times. But it turned <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> constantly press for negotiations and it's {{as if we}} are always standing with an extended hand and this is taken as a sign of our weakness. Therefore we don't plan to do this any more." [...] In the same month, the new separatist spokesman Movladi Udugov said that attacks should be expected anywhere in Russia: [...] "Today, we have a different task on our hands – total war, war everywhere our enemy can be reached. (...) And this means mounting attacks at any place, not just in the Caucasus but in all Russia." [...] Reflecting growing radicalization of the Chechen-led militants, Udugov said their goal was no longer Western-style democracy and independence, but the Islamist [...] "North Caucasian Emirate".|$|E

2500|$|Mainstream biblical {{scholars}} {{point out}} {{that much of the}} writings of antiquity have been lost and that there was little written about any Jew or Christian in this period. Ehrman points <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not have archaeological or textual evidence for the existence of most people in the ancient world, even famous people like Pontius Pilate, whom the myth theorists agree to have existed. Robert Hutchinson notes that this is also true of Josephus, {{despite the fact that he}} was"a personal favorite of the Roman Emperor Vespasian". Hutchinson quotes Ehrman, who notes that Josephus is never mentioned in 1st century Greek and Roman sources, despite being [...] "a personal friend of the emperor". According to Classical historian and popular author Michael Grant, if the same criterium is applied to others: [...] "We can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned".|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, British Prime Minister Edward Heath {{decided to}} {{negotiate}} with the hijackers, ultimately agreeing to release Khaled and others in exchange for hostages.

'I think your government would want to weigh very, very carefully the kind of outcry that would occur in this country against your taking this kind of action.' Greenhill replied: 'Well, they do, Joe, but there is also an outcry in this country,' expressing concern that 'Israel won't lift a bloody finger and ... our people get killed. You could imagine how bad that would look, and if it all comes <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> could have got our people out but for the obduracy of you and other people so to speak. ...

2500|$|During the 2012 Lithuanian {{parliamentary}} election campaign, the Social Democrats {{were reported to}} prefer delaying the euro adoption, from the previous 2014 target until 1 January 2015. When {{the second round of}} the elections were concluded in October, the Social Democrats and two coalition parties won a majority and formed the new government, and the coalition parties were expected to accept the proposed delay in adoption of the euro. When Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius presented his new government in December, eurozone accession as soon as possible was mentioned as one of the key priorities for the government. The Prime Minister said: [...] "January 2015 is a feasible date. But things can also turn <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may try to adopt the euro together with Latvia in January 2014. Let the first quarter (of 2013) pass, and we'll give it a thought." [...] However, in January 2013 the Prime Minister announced that the government and the Bank of Lithuania had agreed on a target date of 2015.

2500|$|The men of {{the convoy}} then began {{launching}} boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the Shinyō Maru were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; [...] "Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught {{all three of us}} and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were out in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth." [...] Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.|$|E
