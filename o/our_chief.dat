25|$|It was {{impossible}} to foresee, {{in the spring of}} 1944, the present cult of the English country house. It seemed then that the ancestral seats which were <b>our</b> <b>chief</b> national artistic achievement were doomed to decay and spoilation like the monasteries in the sixteenth century. So I piled it on rather, with passionate sincerity. Brideshead today would be open to trippers, its treasures rearranged by expert hands and the fabric better maintained than it was by Lord Marchmain.|$|E

25|$|The declining {{state of}} Shaftesbury's health {{rendered}} {{it necessary for}} him to seek a warmer climate and in July 1711 he set out for Italy. He settled at Naples in November, and lived there {{for more than a}} year. His principal occupation at this time must have consisted in preparing for the press a second edition of the Characteristics, which appeared in 1713, soon after his death. The copy, carefully corrected in his own handwriting, is preserved in the British Library. He was also engaged, during his stay at Naples, in writing the little treatise (afterwards included in the Characteristics) entitled A Notion of the Historical Draught or Tablature of the Judgment of Hercules, and the letter concerning Design. A little before his death he had also formed a scheme of writing a Discourse on the Arts of Painting, Sculpture, Etching, , but when he died he had made but little progress with it. Medals, and pictures, and antiquities, he writes to Furly, are <b>our</b> <b>chief</b> entertainments here. His conversation was with men of art and science, the virtuosi of this place.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} inform you that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of <b>our</b> <b>chief</b> directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E
25|$|Next in {{importance}} is the speech Against Agoratus (388 BC), one of <b>our</b> <b>chief</b> authorities for the internal history of Athens {{during the months}} which immediately followed; the defeat at Aegospotami. The Olympiacus (388 BC) is a brilliant fragment, expressing {{the spirit of the}} festival at Olympia, and exhorting Greeks to unite against their common foes. The Plea for the Constitution (403 BC) is interesting for {{the manner in which it}} argues that the well-being of Athens—now stripped of empire—is bound up with the maintenance of democratic principles. The speech For Mantitheus (392 BC) is a graceful and animated portrait, of a young Athenian hippeus, making a spirited defence of his honor against the charge of disloyalty. The defence For the Invalid is a humorous character-sketch. The speech Against Pancleon illustrates the intimate relations between Athens and Plataea, while it gives us some picturesque glimpses of Athenian town life. The defence of the person who had, been charged with destroying a mona, or sacred olive, places us amidst the country life of Attica. And the speech Against Theomnestus deserves attention for its curious evidence of the way in which the ordinary vocabulary of Athens had changed between 600 and 400 BC.|$|E

500|$|With no pension {{or other}} {{compensation}} {{to expect from}} the government after leaving the White House, Taft contemplated {{a return to the}} practice of law, from which he had long been absent. [...] Given that Taft had appointed many federal judges, including a majority of the Supreme Court, this would raise questions of conflict of interest at every federal court appearance and he was saved from this by an offer for him to become Kent Professor of Law and Legal History at Yale Law School. He accepted, and after a month's vacation in Georgia, arrived in New Haven on April 1, 1913 to a rapturous reception. [...] As it was too late in the semester for him to give an academic course, he instead prepared eight lectures on [...] "Questions of Modern Government", which he delivered in May. He earned money with paid speeches and with articles for magazines, and would end his eight years out of office having increased his savings. While at Yale, he wrote the treatise, <b>Our</b> <b>Chief</b> Magistrate and His Powers (1916).|$|E

2500|$|The New York Times {{described}} the monument as an [...] "example of academic mediocrity, worthy of erection, but {{not worthy of}} erection as <b>our</b> <b>chief</b> municipal ornament". Due to the large opposition to the monument in Grand Army Plaza, alternate places to put the monument were considered, such as Brooklyn and Queens in New York City, or even in Baltimore, Maryland. On March 10, 1896, members of the [...] Democratic Party brought the project directly to the New York City Council without specifying a precise location. Simultaneously, {{at the suggestion of}} Republican Party, New York State had created an art commission on March 4, 1896, which decided to place the monument in the Bronx.
