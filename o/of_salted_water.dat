This reef displays from surface to 100 mbgl a carbonate sequence composed of three distinct units. It offers the {{unique opportunity to}} study through surface geology, laboratory measurements, and extensive shallow wells drilling and coring, the intrusion <b>of</b> <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> in a coastal environment and a natural laboratory of analogue oil or gas reservoirs. Twelve shallow boreholes have been drilled in this site. In one of these wells, MC 2, a continuous coring has provided 116 carbonate plugs on which extensive non- destructive laboratory measurements of petrophysical properties were performed, using equilibrium water. Simultaneously, more than 150 log runs were recorded in MC 2 and the other boreholes of the site in a five years series of campaigns. In a first part, this document presents porosity and grain density measurements by laboratory triple weighting method performed on MC 2 plugs; several zones of mineralization and dolomitization are identified. The total open porosity ΦT thus obtained, is then used for porosity calibration of the acoustic compressional velocity Vp and conductivity laborator...|$|E

In order to prove the reliability of this process in real conditions, a three effects evaporator was recently built in La Spezia Italy (see Fig. 1). This unit is composed of three effects in series and five cells in parallel and is heated by hot water at about 75 °C. 3 m 3 /d of high quality distillate with a conductivity lower than 20 μS/cm was obtained. The evaporation ratio ranged between 8 and 13 %. To avoid large consumption of energy to preheat seawater up to its boiling point, about 80 % of the brine is recycled to the evaporator inlet. The overall heat transfer coefficients between heating water and seawater falling film reached 1400 W·m- 2 ·K- 1 whereas the coefficient between condensing vapour and evaporating seawater is about 4000 W·m- 2 ·K- 1. Temperature difference between the heating cells and the first evaporation cells is around 11 °C. For {{the rest of the}} unit, the temperature difference between condensation cells and evaporation cells of the next effect is between 3 and 6 °C. The first results concerning the influence of the heating fluid temperature and the heating fluid flowrate are presented...|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} pseudoternary systems made <b>of</b> <b>salted</b> <b>water,</b> pentanol and SDS is presented for salt concentrations ranging from 20 to 80 g/l of NaCl. In the dilute {{part of the}} phase diagram, the system with the lowest salt concentration is known to present a continuous phase transition between phases of randomly interconnected membranes, namely a sponge (symmetric) and an asymmetric phase. The same topology is found as the salt concentration is increased {{and the evolution of}} the characteristics of the symmetric-asymmetric phase transition is studied. Light scattering experiments are first described. We show that the scattered intensity should be analysed in terms of a product of a structure and a form factor. The latter contribution gives directly the geometrical size of the phase (the mean distance between the membranes) without using any thermodynamical model and therefore gives an unambiguous location of the symmetric-asymmetric phase transition. The structure factor gives the critical behaviour at the phase transition. Electrical conductivity {{as a function of the}} frequency (in the range 100  Hz- 15  MHz) has also been measured for the first time in this kind of systems. These phases can be considered as composites of a conducting solvent and a dielectric membrane and the data are analysed in terms of a low frequency (DC) conductivity leading to an “ obstruction ” factor and a dielectric constant strongly dependent on the frequency. Far from the S/A phase transition, the obstruction factor is constant and the dielectric constant shows a single Debye-like relaxation. Simple scaling laws are found for the variation of the intensity and of the frequency as a function of dilution. This indicates that the mode probes the “ local structure ” of the sponge phase. Near the S/A phase transition, in addition to this mode, another dielectric relaxation is observed at lower frequencies. At the same time, a departure from the scaling laws of the Debye mode and an increase of the obstruction factor can be interpreted as evidence for defects (holes ?) on the membrane. We show that the role of these defects increases as the salt concentration decreases...|$|E

In the past the primary problems with underwater wet weldments on steels utilizing SMAW with ferritic electrodes, were underbead cracking in the heat affected zone (HAZ), slag inclusions, oxide inclusions, and porosity. To avoid underbead cracking three weld samples were made using an austenitic nickel weld metal with an Oxylance coating at 10 feet <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> 25 feet <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water,</b> and 33 feet <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> A final sample was made using austenitic nickel weld metal with a Broco coating at 33 feet <b>of</b> <b>salt</b> <b>water.</b> Because <b>of</b> the ductility of the austenitic nickel weld metal no underbead cracking occurred, however porosity and high inclusion counts were found in all four samples. The average size of the inclusion increased with increasing depth. The Broco sample exhibited far greater porosity than did the 0 xylance samples. This work addresses quality of the welds, mechanisms for the formation of the inclusions, and analysis of the difference between the Oxylance and Broco weld rods[URL]...|$|R
