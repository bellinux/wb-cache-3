5|$|In Martinsburg, West Virginia, several {{government}} buildings were evacuated, and multiple citizens reported feeling their homes shaking violently enough to rattle picture frames <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> In Charleston, the Kanawha County Courthouse, the West Virginia State Capitol campus, {{and several other}} downtown buildings were evacuated; Kanawha County dispatchers received more than 350 telephone calls in 45 minutes, but there were not any reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure other than minor plaster cracking in the old courthouse. In Philippi, part of a chimney collapsed at the Barbour County courthouse. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors. A roof collapse in Patriot Coal Company's Big Mountain Complex forced {{the closure of the}} mine.|$|E
5|$|Ramsay {{retreats to}} Winterfell, {{followed}} by Jon, Wun Wun and Tormund. Wun Wun breaks down Winterfell's gates and the Stark loyalists overwhelm {{the remnants of}} the Bolton garrison. A mortally wounded Wun Wun is finished off by Ramsay, who tells Jon that he has reconsidered the offer of single combat. Jon blocks Ramsay's arrows with a shield, overpowers and attempts to beat Ramsay to death, stopping when he sees Sansa and ordering him imprisoned, leaving Winterfell once more in the hands of House Stark. Bolton banners are shown falling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and battlements of Winterfell to be replaced by the Stark direwolf. Sansa visits Ramsay after he is placed in the kennels with his hounds and despite Ramsay's insistence that his hounds will not turn on him, they devour him face-first as Sansa walks away, smiling.|$|E

25|$|A lull in {{the siege}} took place as they English and French needed {{rearming}} with new powder which had to come from Brest and the English ships.

25|$|Those British on the {{barricades}} — including Dalton and Bromhead — were soon engaged in fierce hand-to-hand fighting. The British wall {{was too high}} for the Zulus to scale, so they resorted to crouching under the wall, trying {{to get hold of}} the defenders' Martini–Henry rifles, slashing at British soldiers with assegais or firing their weapons through the wall. At places, they clambered over each other's bodies to drive the British <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> but were driven back.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failed}} {{attack by the}} defenders, the Christian commanders ordered four galleys to patrol the area during the night to prevent further attacks. Several others were also sent to Sicily {{carrying}} the wounded and ill soldiers and requests for replacements and ammunition, which were provided from Milan, Florence, Lucca and Genoa. Pending to receive them, the siege engineers remained looking for the weakest points of Mahdia's defenses. It was García Álvarez de Toledo, 4th Marquis of Villafranca, who had the idea of bombing the walls from the sea, forming a gun battery on two galleys previously deforested and united to each other with hangers and planks. Nine pieces of artillery were settled on the platform, which was protected by shields and parapet, prior to anchor the galleys <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E

25|$|Winmar {{donated the}} jumper {{he was wearing}} in the {{photograph}} to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in 1998. Prior to the commission's disbanding in 2005, Geoff Clark, the chairman of ATSIC at the time, removed the framed jumper from the commission's offices in Canberra {{to his home in}} Warrnambool, Victoria. Clark was forced to return the jumper to Winmar, which was later donated to the National Museum of Australia, where it featured in <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Walls,</b> an exhibit of Indigenous Australian art. In May 2012, the jumper was auctioned by Sotheby's, but was passed in after the bidding reached A$95,000. In September of the same year, Museum Victoria purchased the jumper for $100,000, with the intention to display it at the First Peoples exhibition at Melbourne Museum in July 2013. However, the authenticity of the jumper has been questioned, with the St Kilda Football Club published a statement in March 2005 suggesting that the jumper given to ATSIC {{may not have been the}} actual jumper worn during the game, citing differences between sponsors' logos present on the jumper. Similar questions were raised prior to the jumper's auction in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The stations' {{placement}} in the Empire State Building {{became a major}} issue {{with the construction of}} the World Trade Center's Twin Towers during the late 1960s and early 1970s. As the towers were taller than the Empire State Building, this would cause waves from the Empire State Building to sometimes bounce <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the taller Twin Towers. As a result, some broadcasters decided that {{it would be easier to}} move to the Twin Towers instead, rather than suing the complex's developer, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, to stop construction. Even though the nine stations who were broadcasting from the Empire State Building were leasing their broadcast space until 1984, most of these stations moved to the World Trade Center as soon as it was completed in 1971. The broadcasters obtained a court order stipulating that the Port Authority had to build a mast and transmission equipment in the North Tower, as well as pay the broadcasters' leases in the Empire State Building until 1984. After the leases expired, there were very few broadcasters remaining in the Empire State Building.|$|E

500|$|Taraborrelli stated, [...] "Fans and {{industry}} peers alike {{were left with}} their mouths agape when Off the Wall was issued to the public.

500|$|The {{atmosphere}} of the hotel was meant {{to connect with the}} character of Charlie. As Joel explained: [...] "Our intention, moreover, was that the hotel function as an exteriorization of the character played by John Goodman. The sweat drips off his forehead like the paper peels <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> At the end, when Goodman says that he is a prisoner of his own mental state, that this is like some kind of hell, it was necessary for the hotel to have already suggested something infernal." [...] The peeling wallpaper and the paste which seeps through it also mirror Charlie's chronic ear infection and the resultant pus.|$|E
500|$|Richard Harrington of The Washington Post {{felt that}} while the album could {{not live up to}} post-Thriller expectations, it would be [...] "considerably fairer to compare" [...] Bad with Off the Wall.

Richard Cromelin of the Los Angeles Times called Bad [...] "a fair-to-strong array of soul and rock blends", commenting that the record was [...] "not bad" [...] and was more [...] "reminiscent of <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Walls</b> uniform strength than Thrillers peaks and valleys." [...] Cromelin felt that it would be [...] "disappointing" [...] if this album's [...] "creative level" [...] is where Jackson wants to stay.|$|E

500|$|Steven Spielberg and John Williams {{had worked}} {{together}} on fifteen films before Saving Private Ryan (1998). The score was recorded at Symphony Hall in Boston, Massachusetts {{with the assistance of}} the Boston Symphony Orchestra. After having recorded the re-edited version Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and some Schindler's List (1993) at Symphony Hall previously, this was the third time Spielberg and Williams worked on a soundtrack at this location. Spielberg chose Symphony Hall as the site for the recording because the hall gives [...] "rich, warm sound <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> and ceiling" [...] and allows you to [...] "hear the air," [...] which some soundstages do not allow you to do. Spielberg stated he chose to work with the Boston Symphony Orchestra because the film deals with a [...] "company of soldiers" [...] and the orchestra was an [...] "experienced company of musicians." [...] Over the course of a three-day period in February 1998, the score for the film was recorded at a rate of around $100,000 an hour.|$|E

2500|$|South Carolina patriots {{began to}} build a fort to guard Charleston, South Carolina, harbor in 1776. British Admiral Sir Peter Parker with nine British {{warships}} attacked the fort—known as Fort Sullivan and incomplete—on June 28, 1776, {{near the beginning of}} the American Revolutionary War. The soft palmetto logs did not crack under bombardment but rather absorbed the shot; cannonballs reportedly even bounced <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> of the structure. William Moultrie, commander of the 2nd South Carolina Regiment, and his four hundred men fought a day-long battle that ended with the heavily damaged British ships being driven from the area. This victory galvanized the Patriots' cause for independence. The fort hence took its name, as Fort Moultrie, in his honor.

2500|$|Lawler has photographed {{pictures}} and objects in collectors’ homes, in galleries, {{on the walls}} of auction houses, and <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls,</b> in museum storage. Along with photography, she has created conceptual and installation art. Some of her works, such as the [...] "Book of Matches", are ephemeral and explore the passing of time, while others, such as Helms Amendment (963) (1989), are expressly political. Lawler's work, in its diverse manifestations (installations, events, publications, souvenirs...) addresses or confronts prevailing systems of establishing art, taste and style. She is, however, less interested in the original process of creating a work of art than in the context lying beyond the artist's sphere of influence and in which the work is subsequently situated. Often framed as “appropriation art” or “institutional critique”, Lawler’s photographic work lays bare the day-to-day operations of the art world and its circulation and presentation of art works. Her work is interested in the intersection of art and commerce.|$|E
