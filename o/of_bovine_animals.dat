50|$|Tabanus bovinus, {{sometimes}} called the pale giant horse-fly, is a species of biting horse-fly. As the name suggests, it prefers bovine animals {{as the source of}} blood, although it may bite other kind of mammals as well. The insect is relatively large for a horse-fly, adults usually being 25-30 mm long. Like most other horseflies, its compound eyes are very colorful with stripe-like patterns. Its body and wings are mostly colored brownish gray. It is quite fast and an able flier, being capable of evading most attempts to swat it with ease. It bites humans infrequently, because of its preference <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals.</b> This loud-buzzing horse-fly can be a nuisance, as it circles around its target and occasionally lands to deliver a bite (in the case of humans, the fly usually takes off again instead). However, to humans it is considerably less harmful than deer flies (Chrysops), which bite much more vigorously.|$|E

Hazard identification: Artificial insemination <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> is a recognized route of transmission of BVD virus (BVDV). The possible contamination by BVDV of bovine semen imported from North America constitutes a hazard for the favourable BDV situation among Finnish cattle. 2 Release assessment: The lots of semen imported from North America may contain annually a few contaminated by BVDV. The risk of release through these lots is a remote but not wholly insignificant possibility. 3. Exposure assessment: The contaminated lots of semen are considered to be able to transmit the infection to {{at least half of the}} dams inseminated with them. Contraction of BVDV infection this way is annually a rare event with low but not zero probability. 4.

40|$|I {{am writing}} to clarify a comment I {{submitted}} to the above mentioned docket on May 7, 2004. I had previously written that {{the entire length of}} the intestine should be excluded as SRM. I still hold this opinion and submit the same recommendation, however one of the reasons behind this opinion needs to be further clarified. I had misunderstood comments made by Dr. Danny Matthews in that immunostaining (of PrP bse) was not found throughout {{the entire length of the}} intestine. There was however immunostaining in the myenteric plexus of the distal ileum in both naturally infected and experimentally challenged cattle with BSE. (Terry et al., 2003) Given that the myenteric plexus exists throughout the intestine one cannot eliminate the possibility of infectivity being in other sections. In fact this was some of the thought behind the designation of the entire intestine as SRM in the EU: In its opinion of 7 - 8 December 2000 (EC 2000), the SSC concluded that the entire bovine intestine is a risk issue and Commission Regulation (EC) No. 270 / 2002 (14 th February 2002) ANNEX II designates “the entire intestines from the duodenum to the rectum and the mesentery <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> of all ages; ” as SRM.

40|$|A risk ranking process {{identified}} Salmonella spp. and pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) {{as current}} high-priority biological hazards for meat inspection <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals.</b> As these hazards are not detected by traditional meat inspection, a meat safety assurance {{system for the}} farm-to-chilled carcass continuum using a risk-based approach was proposed. Key elements of the system are risk-categorisation of slaughter animals for high-priority biological hazards based on improved food chain information, as well as risk-categorisation of slaughterhouses according to their capability to control those hazards. Omission of palpation and incision during post-mortem inspection for animals subjected to routine slaughter may decrease spreading and cross-contamination with the high-priority biological hazards. For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were ranked as being of high potential concern; all other substances were ranked as of medium or lower concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible {{and based on the}} risk of occurrence, taking into account the completeness and quality of the food chain information supplied and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated to include new hazards. Control programmes across the food chain, national residue control programmes, feed control and monitoring of environmental contaminants should be better integrated. Meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. Omission of palpation and incision would reduce detection effectiveness for bovine tuberculosis and would {{have a negative impact on}} the overall surveillance system especially in officially tuberculosis free countries. The detection effectiveness for bovine cysticercosis, already low with the current meat inspection system, would result in a further decrease, if palpation and incision are removed.

40|$|Abstract Subcutaneous and perirenal {{adipose tissue}} from bovine animals that had {{different}} fat deposition patterns were characterized {{in terms of}} the weight of the adipose tissue organ and adipose cell number and mean cell size as determined by electronic counting of osmium-fixed adipose cells. Similar parameters were also measured in the interfascicular adipose tissue dissected from four muscles. Adipose tissue from animals of the leaner Holstein breed contained smaller cells than the respective tissues from the fatter Hereford X Angus animals. The small subcutaneous deposit in the Holstein animals was due to a small number of adipose cells that were small in size. During growth of the bovine animal, an increase in adipose tissue mass was accompanied by cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. However, by 14 months of life hyperplasia was complete in all but the interfascicular adipose tissue. In the 14 -month-old Hereford X Angus steers, interfascicular adipose tissue had an appreciable number of small cells and a bimodal distribution for cell diameter. The {{results of this study suggest}} that interfascicular adipose tissue is a late developing depot and that hyperplasia is still an active process in this depot at 14 months of life, whereas hyperplasia appears to be nearly complete in the subcutaneous and perirenal depots <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> by about 8 months of life or shortly thereafter. Correlation coefficients indicated that intramuscular lipid content was positively related to the number of interfascicular adipose cells per 100 g of muscle in four different muscles.

40|$|Abstract Background Animal {{identification}} is pivotal in governmental agricultural policy, enabling {{the management of}} subsidy payments, movement of livestock, test scheduling and control of disease. Advances in bovine genomics {{have made it possible}} to utilise inherent genetic variability to uniquely identify individual animals by DNA profiling, much as has been achieved with humans over the past 20 years. A DNA profiling test based on bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers would offer considerable advantages over current short tandem repeat (STR) based industry standard tests, in that {{it would be easier to}} analyse and interpret. In this study, a panel of 51 genome-wide SNPs were genotyped across panels of semen DNA from 6 common breeds for the purposes of ascertaining allelic frequency. For SNPs on the same chromosome, the extent of linkage disequilbrium was determined from genotype data by Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. Minimum probabilities of unique identification were determined for each breed panel. The usefulness of this SNP panel was ascertained by comparison to the current bovine STR Stockmarks II assay. A statistically representative random sampling <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> <b>animals</b> from across Northern Ireland was assembled for the purposes of determining the population allele frequency for these STR loci and subsequently, the minimal probability of unique identification they conferred in sampled bovine animals from Northern Ireland. Results 6 SNPs exhibiting a minor allele frequency of less than 0. 2 in more than 3 of the breed panels were excluded. 2 Further SNPs were found to reside in coding areas of the cattle genome and were excluded from the final panel. The remaining 43 SNPs exhibited genotype frequencies which were in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. SNPs on the same chromosome were observed to have no significant linkage disequilibrium/allelic association. Minimal probabilities of uniquely identifying individual animals from each of the breeds were obtained and were observed to be superior to those conferred by the industry standard STR assay. Conclusions The 43 SNPs characterised herein may constitute a starting point for the development of a SNP based DNA identification test for European cattle. </p...|$|E

40|$|Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10), {{produced}} by Th 2 helper T cells, B cells, and macrophages, can inhibit cytokine production by Th 1 cells and enhance B-cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, {{we show that}} {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from <b>bovine</b> leukemia virus-infected <b>animals</b> with late-stage disease express considerably more IL- 10 mRNA than animals that are not infected or that are {{in the early stages of}} disease. In contrast, the quantities of type 1 cytokines, IL- 2 and gamma interferon, decrease with disease progression. In addition, we observed that IL- 10 is expressed principally by monocytes/macrophages, not B lymphocytes, in persistently lymphocytotic animals. This observation supports a role for monocytes/macrophages in progression <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> leukemia virus infection and, of importance, indicates that proliferating B cells are not the source of IL- 10 expression. These findings suggest that IL- 10 {{produced by}} monocytes/macrophages may influence the progression <b>of</b> <b>bovine</b> leukosis in <b>animals</b> that develop persistent lymphocytosis of B cells or B-cell lymphosarcoma...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{estrogen}} receptor modulators (SERMs), anti-estrogens and aromatase inhibitors {{are prohibited}} in human sports doping. However, they also present {{a risk of}} being used illegally in animal husbandry for fattening purposes. A method was developed and validated using UHPLC-MS/MS for the determination and confirmation of SERMs, anti-estrogens and aromatase inhibiters in bovine and porcine urine. This method was used {{in a survey of}} more than 200 bovine and porcine urine samples from Dutch farms. In 18 out of 103 porcine urine samples (17 %) and two out <b>of</b> 114 <b>bovine</b> samples (2 %) formestane, an aromatase inhibitor, was detected. None of the other compounds was detected. From human doping control it is known that formestane can, in some cases, be of natural origin. Analyses of reference samples from untreated <b>bovine</b> and porcine <b>animals</b> demonstrated the presence <b>of</b> formestane in <b>bovine</b> <b>animals,</b> but not yet in porcine animals. Future research will focus on whether the detected formestane in porcine and bovine urine is from endogenous or exogenous origin, using GC-c-IRMS...|$|R
