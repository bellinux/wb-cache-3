50|$|Back at the apartment, Carl helps Molly {{clear out}} some of Sam's old things; clearly, she's {{hesitant}} to let go, totally unbeknownst {{to the fact that}} Sam is very close by, unable to move on himself. When she's alone, the man that killed Sam sneaks in and begins to ransack the place while Molly is upstairs, forcing Sam into a panic that he'll hurt her, too. Sam manages to spook the man and he flees. Needing to know who he is, Sam pushes himself through the front door with great effort, and follows the man {{all the way back to}} his own apartment. He finds out that the man's name is Willie Lopez, and that he'd eventually go back for what he was looking for. Desperate, Sam then seeks out a psychic, <b>Oda</b> <b>Mae</b> Brown, who seems to be a total fraud ("Are You a Believer?"). By some miracle, she actually hears Sam, and he convinces her to go talk to Molly on his behalf - by singing '10,000 Bottles of Beer on the Wall' obnoxiously, no less. In the meantime, Molly is grieving and not taking the loss very well ("With You"). She gets a visit from <b>Oda</b> <b>Mae,</b> but Molly is hesitant to believe, until <b>Oda</b> <b>Mae</b> starts parroting things that only Sam would know. Eventually, she comes around, and agrees to listen. Through <b>Oda</b> <b>Mae,</b> Sam tells her that he was set up, murdered, and that she needs to go to the police; <b>Oda</b> <b>Mae</b> bails as soon as she hears the word. Molly takes this information to Carl, who tells her that it's crazy, but promises to check it out. She goes to the police and Carl goes straight to Willie's place where a distraught Sam discovers the truth, in that his murder was at Carl's own error. As Molly swears to suspend all disbelief, a drunken Carl wanders the streets trying to convince himself it was not his fault ("Suspend My Disbelief/I Had a Life").|$|E
