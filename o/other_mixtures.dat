Mixtures of argon, carbon dioxide and oxygen are marketed for welding steels. <b>Other</b> <b>mixtures</b> add {{a small amount of}} helium to argon-oxygen combinations, these mixtures are claimed to allow higher arc voltages and welding speed. Helium also sometimes serves as the base gas, with small amounts of argon and carbon dioxide added. However, because it is less dense than air, helium is less effective at shielding the weld than argonwhich is denser than air. It also can lead to arc stability and penetration issues, and increased spatter, due to its much more energetic arc plasma. Helium is also substantially more expensive than other shielding gases. Other specialized and often proprietary gas mixtures claim even greater benefits for specific applications.|$|E

25|$|According to {{historian}} Shaye J. D. Cohen, in the Bible, {{the status}} of the offspring of mixed marriages was determined patrilineally. He brings two likely explanations for the change in Mishnaic times: first, the Mishnah may have been applying the same logic to mixed marriages as it had applied to <b>other</b> <b>mixtures</b> (kilayim). Thus, a mixed marriage is forbidden as is the union of a horse and a donkey, and in both unions the offspring are judged matrilineally. Second, the Tannaim may have been influenced by Roman law, which dictated that when a parent could not contract a legal marriage, offspring would follow the mother.|$|E

25|$|If, for {{environmental}} or other reasons, a solvent or solvent blend {{is required to}} replace another of equivalent solvency, the substitution can {{be made on the}} basis of the Hansen solubility parameters of each. The values for mixtures are taken as the weighted averages of the values for the neat solvents. This can be calculated by trial-and-error, a spreadsheet of values, or HSP software. A 1:1 mixture of toluene and 1,4 dioxane has δD, δP and δH values of 17.8, 1.6 and 5.5, comparable to those of chloroform at 17.8, 3.1 and 5.7 respectively.

25|$|The {{similarity}} in ionic radius between adjacent lanthanide elements {{makes it difficult}} to separate them from each other in naturally occurring ores and <b>other</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Historically, the very laborious processes of cascading and fractional crystallization were used. Because the lanthanide ions have slightly different radii, the lattice energy of their salts and hydration energies of the ions will be slightly different, leading to a small difference in solubility. Salts of the formula Ln(NO3)3·2NH4NO3·4H2O can be used. Industrially, the elements are separated from each other by solvent extraction. Typically an aqueous solution of nitrates is extracted into kerosene containing tri-n-butylphosphate. The strength of the complexes formed increases as the ionic radius decreases, so solubility in the organic phase increases. Complete separation can be achieved continuously by use of countercurrent exchange methods. The elements can also be separated by ion-exchange chromatography, making use {{of the fact that the}} stability constant for formation of EDTA complexes increases for log K ≈ 15.5 for − to log K ≈ 19.8 for −.|$|E

By following the arguments of Rufibach (2006), we show that the NPMLE is uniformly consistent with respect to the supremum norm on compact subsets of the interior of the support. To fit the mixture model, we propose a semiparametric EM (SEM) algorithm, which can be adapted to <b>other</b> semiparametric <b>mixture</b> models.

40|$|A {{change in}} the {{relative}} proportions of the constituents of a porous material like soil will cause a change in its electrical permittivity. The measured permittivity reflects {{the impact of the}} permittivities of the individual material constituents. Numerous dielectric mixture equations are published, but none of these equations are generally applicable. A new theoretical mixture equation is derived, using the principle of superposition of electric (E) fields. This mixture equation relates the measured permittivity to a weighted sum of the permittivities of the individual material constituents and includes depolarization factors to account for electric field refractions at the interfaces of the constituents. The depolarization factors are related to physical properties of the material. Most <b>other</b> <b>mixture</b> equations contain one or more empirical factors. The concept of the depolarization factor is comparable with that of the 'shape factor' of particles as described by other authors. A special case of the new mixture equation, for which the depolarization factors equals one (no depolarizations), appeared equal to a mixture equation for fluids derived from using thermodynamics. The new mixture equation is compared with <b>other</b> <b>mixture</b> equations. Comparison of the new mixture equation with measured data for glass beads and fine sand was promising. Concluding, depolarization factors in the new mixture equation relate the microstructural and compositional material properties to the measured bulk permittivity of a material.
