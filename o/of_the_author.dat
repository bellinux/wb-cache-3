5|$|Another {{range of}} {{extensions}} came {{in relation to}} what could be copyrighted. The Statute only referred to books, and being an Act of Parliament, {{it was necessary to}} pass further legislation to include various other types of intellectual property. The Engraving Copyright Act 1734 extended copyright to cover engravings, statutes in 1789 and 1792 involved cloth, sculptures were copyrighted in 1814 and the performance of plays and music were covered by copyright in 1833 and 1842 respectively. The length of copyright was also altered; the Copyright Act 1814 set a copyright term of either 28 years, or the natural life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author</b> if this was longer. Despite these expansions, some still felt copyright was not a strong enough regime. In 1837, Thomas Noon Talfourd introduced a bill into Parliament to expand the scope of copyright. A friend of many men of letters, Talfourd aimed to provide adequate rewards for authors and artists. He campaigned for copyright to exist for the life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> with an additional 60 years after that. He also proposed that existing statutes be codified under the bill, so that the case law that had arisen around the Statute of Anne was clarified.|$|E
5|$|Biographers {{and critics}} agree that Louis Lambert is a thinly veiled version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> {{evidenced}} by numerous similarities between them. As {{a student at}} the Collège de Vendôme, Balzac was friends with a boy named Louis-Lambert Tinant. Like the title character, Balzac's faith was shaken {{at the time of his}} first communion. Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like Lambert – was often punished for misbehaving in class. The precise details of the school also reflect Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were allowed to keep pigeons and tend gardens, and holidays were spent in the dormitories.|$|E

5|$|In the Life of Tacitus, {{the emperor}} is {{acclaimed}} by the Senate, {{meeting in the}} Curia Pompiliana, which never existed.

Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom are assumed to be fictitious.

It is difficult to determine the original year of publication for these works, for although Joehana's books generally included a year of publication, the printing number was not recorded.

5|$|Lutetium, {{derived from}} the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was {{independently}} discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. They found it as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium. The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium, whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium (after Aldebaran and Cassiopeia). Both of these articles accused the other man of publishing results based on those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author.</b>|$|E
5|$|Motte was a London {{publisher}} {{who took}} over Benjamin Tooke's publishing business, which printed many of Swift's earlier works.

In 1727, Motte formed his first direct contract with Swift in order to publish Swift's Miscellanies. As part of the contract, Motte paid Tooke for the original copyright to the work.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, it is {{unwise to}} dismiss it {{altogether}} {{as it is}} also the principal Latin source regarding a century of Roman history. For example, scholars had assumed that Veturius Macrinus mentioned in the Life of Didius Julianus was an invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>author,</b> like so many other names. However, an inscription was uncovered which confirmed his existence and his post as Praetorian Prefect in 193. Likewise, the information that Hadrian's Wall was constructed during Hadrian's reign and that the Antonine Wall was built during the reign of Antoninus Pius are recorded by no other extant ancient writer apart from the Historia Augusta, the veracity of which has been confirmed by inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Several {{teaching}} {{guides and}} books of study notes {{have been published}} to help teachers and students gain the most from the book.

This tension can help introduce readers to readerly and writerly interpretations, to tenets of New Criticism, and critical tools from Freudian analysis, such as sublimation, in approaching literary works.|$|E
