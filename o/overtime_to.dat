5|$|Following the merger, the Jets {{fell into}} mediocrity; Namath was dogged by {{injuries}} {{through much of}} his later career. In 1981, New York qualified for {{the playoffs for the}} first time in the post-Namath era.

Beginning with the 1984 season, the team played in New Jersey's Giants Stadium.

5|$|The 1978–79 season capped Montreal's run of four {{consecutive}} championships in dramatic fashion. Facing the Bruins {{in the seventh}} game of the league semi-finals, Montreal trailed 4–3 with {{less than two minutes}} to play when Boston head coach Don Cherry accidentally sent too many players onto the ice during a line change, drawing what would {{become one of the most}} famous penalties in NHL history, and eventually costing Cherry his job. During the subsequent power play, Lafleur scored the game-tying goal with 74 seconds remaining in regulation time, and Yvon Lambert scored in <b>overtime</b> <b>to</b> win the game and series. The Canadiens proceeded to defeat the Rangers for the Cup in five games.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 NFC Championship Game was a National Football League (NFL) {{game played}} on January 17, 1999, to {{determine}} the National Football Conference (NFC) champion for the 1998 NFL season. The visiting Atlanta Falcons defeated the heavily favored Minnesota Vikings 30–27 in sudden death <b>overtime</b> <b>to</b> win their first conference championship and advance to the franchise's first Super Bowl appearance.

5|$|The Falcons lost 34–19 to the Denver Broncos {{two weeks}} later in Super Bowl XXXIII. Neither the Falcons nor the Vikings reached the Super Bowl again until the 2016 NFL season, when the Falcons lost in <b>overtime</b> <b>to</b> the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. Although the game long stood as the proudest {{moment in the history}} of the Falcons franchise, the 1998 NFC Championship Game has been remembered for the effect it had on the Vikings players and their fan base, as it is seen by some sportswriters as one of the most devastating losses in NFL history.|$|E

The {{highlight}} of the game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass. After catching the ball, Anderson made a long run to the end zone, silencing the crowd in attendance. In 1989, free-agent acquisition Ottis Anderson ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Rookie Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third downs and special teams, catching 34 passes for 531 yards, and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley Cup final between Montreal and Toronto went five games, but is {{remarkable}} as each game required <b>overtime</b> <b>to</b> be decided. In the third game, with the series tied at one game a piece, Kennedy both saved {{the game for}} the Leafs and won it. First, he prevented a goal by clearing a puck that was heading into the Toronto net, then, just fifty seconds later {{at the other end}} of the rink, he intercepted a clear-out pass from Montreal's Calum MacKay and scored to win the game. The fourth game was won by Toronto to lead the series 3–1.|$|E
5|$|With 72 {{points over}} 45 games in 1995–96, Morrison {{received}} his first of back-to-back CCHA Player of the Year awards.

Advancing to the 1996 NCAA Tournament, Michigan {{advanced to the}} final against the Colorado College Tigers. Morrison scored the championship-winning goal 3:35 into <b>overtime</b> <b>to</b> win the game 3–2. It was the Wolverines' first national title in 32 years.

40|$|After nearly 75 {{years of}} {{exclusion}} from {{federal and state}} labor protections, domestic workers have finally scored two important victories in their fight for equal treatment. Late last week, Governor Brown signed AB 241, extending California <b>overtime</b> protections <b>to</b> domestic workers who spend {{a significant amount of}} time caring for children, elderly and people with disabilities. One week earlier the federal Department of Labor finalized new rules that significantly extend federal minimum wage and <b>overtime</b> protections <b>to</b> domestic workers who care for the elderly and people with disabilities. Together, these actions extend <b>overtime</b> coverage <b>to</b> all domestic workers in California...|$|R
