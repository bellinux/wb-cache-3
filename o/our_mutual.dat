500|$|Morrissey {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in a Tony Marchant drama playing Michael Ride in Into the Fire (1996), and the following year played the lead role of Shaun Southerns in Marchant's BBC series Holding On (1997). Southerns, a crooked tax inspector, {{was the first of}} many [...] "men in turmoil" [...] roles for Morrissey, and it earned him a nomination for the Royal Television Society (RTS) Programme Award for Best Male Actor the next year. In 1998, he appeared in <b>Our</b> <b>Mutual</b> Friend alongside Paul McGann. As he was a fan of the book, Morrissey asked director Julian Farino if he could play Eugene Wrayburn, but the role went to McGann. Farino had Morrissey in mind to play schoolmaster Bradley Headstone, a part Morrissey was reluctant to take until he read the script. He studied the role and decided to take it on the basis that the character was unloved and that his motivation by social class causes his mental health problems. His performance was described by a Guardian writer as bringing [...] "unprecedented depth to a character [...] who is more commonly portrayed as just another horrible Dickens git." [...] In the same year, he played Christopher [...] "Kiffer" [...] Finzi in Anand Tucker's Hilary and Jackie. His roles in <b>Our</b> <b>Mutual</b> Friend and Hilary and Jackie were described as his breakthrough roles by Zoe Williams of The Guardian.|$|E

500|$|Waugh joined Hertford College on a scholarship, in January 1922. He had {{received}} a congratulatory letter from Cruttwell welcoming him to the college and complimenting him on his English prose: [...] "about the best {{of any of the}} Candidates in the group". Despite this warmth, Waugh's initial impressions of his tutor were unfavourable—"not at all the kind of don for whom I had been prepared by stories of Jowett." [...] The first recorded clash between them came early in Waugh's first term; {{in a letter to his}} school friend Dudley Carew, Waugh reports that his tutor verbally abused him for a Latin mistranslation with the words [...] "Damn you, you're a scholar!" [...] The main basis for the rift that rapidly developed was Waugh's increasingly casual attitude towards his scholarship. Whereas Cruttwell saw the scholarship as a commitment to hard and devoted study, Waugh considered it a reward for his successful school studies and a passport to a life of pleasure. To the detriment of his work, Waugh involved himself in a range of university activities: the Oxford Union, the Hertford debating society, journalism and drawings for the undergraduate papers Isis and Cherwell, and a hectic social life. In his third term, he was brusquely advised by Cruttwell that he should take his studies more seriously, a warning which Waugh chose to interpret as an insult. [...] "I think it was from then on that <b>our</b> <b>mutual</b> dislike became incurable", he later wrote.|$|E
