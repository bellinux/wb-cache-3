5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before <b>outputting</b> the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what would represent a breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is described which allowed {{the measurement of}} the oxygen consumption of the isolated heart of Octopus vulgaris. Contraction of the heart resulted in an aortic <b>output</b> and a flow through the heart muscle into coronary veins (the coronary <b>output).</b> The flow and oxygen content of the aortic <b>output</b> and the coronary <b>output</b> were measured with variable input pressures and constant <b>output</b> back pressure (volume loaded), variable <b>output</b> back pressure and constant aortic <b>output</b> (pressure loaded), and during hypoxia. Volume loading of the heart resulted {{in an increase in}} aortic <b>output,</b> power <b>output</b> and total oxygen consumption. Pressure loading increased power <b>output</b> and total oxygen consumption of the heart. Exposure to hypoxia decreased the aortic <b>output,</b> power <b>output</b> and total cardiac oxygen consumption. In the response of the heart to reduced work, brought about either by a reduced input pressure or by hypoxic perfusate, the power <b>output</b> was linearly related to the total oxygen consumption of the heart. The oxygen extracted from the coronary <b>output</b> accounted for 80 - 100 % of the total oxygen consumption of the heart. Coronary <b>output</b> amounted to 30 % of the total cardiac <b>output</b> at maximum power <b>output.</b> In volume-loaded hearts the volume of the coronary <b>output</b> increased as aortic <b>output</b> increased; in pressure-loaded hearts coronary <b>output</b> increased as power <b>output</b> increased, but aortic <b>output</b> remained constant. In hypoxia, the coronary <b>output</b> increased as the aortic <b>output</b> fell. At a perfusate Po 2 of around 50 Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa), the aortic <b>output</b> ceased although the heart continued to beat and the coronary <b>output</b> continued, accounting for all of the oxygen consumption of the heart. The coronary <b>output</b> flow in vitro therefore has the capacity to be varied independently of the aortic <b>output</b> flow to maintain the oxygen supply to the perfused cardiac muscle...|$|R

Samsung has a similar proprietary thirty-pin port for their Galaxy Tab 10.1 that can adapt to HDMI as well as USB drives. The Dell Streak 5 smartphone/tablet hybrid is capable of <b>outputting</b> over HDMI. While the Streak uses a PDMI port, a separate cradle is available which adds HDMI compatibility.

5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers <b>outputting</b> at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E
