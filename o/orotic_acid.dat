25|$|Diagnostic {{testing for}} OTC deficiency, or any {{individual}} with hyperammonemia involves plasma and urine amino acid analysis, urine organic acid analysis (to identify {{the presence or}} absence of <b>orotic</b> <b>acid,</b> as well as rule out an organic acidemia) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased citrulline and arginine concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased <b>orotic</b> <b>acid.</b> The increased <b>orotic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations result from the buildup of carbamoyl phosphate. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low citrulline and increased <b>orotic</b> <b>acid)</b> is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate this classic biochemical phenotype.|$|E
25|$|Heterozygous females can be {{difficult}} to diagnose. With the rise of sequencing techniques, molecular testing has become preferred, particularly when the disease causing mutations in the family are known. Historically, heterozygous females were often diagnosed using an allopurinol challenge. In a female with reduced enzyme activity, an oral dose of allopurinol would be metabolized to oxypurinol ribonucleotide, which blocks the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. When this induced enzymatic block is combined with reduced physiologic enzyme activity as seen in heterozygotes, the elevation of <b>orotic</b> <b>acid</b> could be used to differentiate heterozygotes from unaffected individuals. This test was not universally effective, as it had both false negative and false positive results.|$|E
5000|$|A {{buildup of}} <b>orotic</b> <b>acid</b> {{can lead to}} orotic aciduria and acidemia. It may be a symptom of an {{increased}} ammonia load due to a metabolic disorder, such as a urea cycle disorder. [...] In ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency, an X-linked inherited and the most common urea cycle disorder, excess carbamoyl phosphate is converted into <b>orotic</b> <b>acid.</b> This leads to an increased serum ammonia level, increased serum and urinary <b>orotic</b> <b>acid</b> levels and a decreased serum blood urea nitrogen level. This also leads to an increased urinary <b>orotic</b> <b>acid</b> excretion, because the <b>orotic</b> <b>acid</b> is not being properly utilized and must be eliminated. The hyperammonemia depletes alpha-ketoglutarate leading to the inhibition of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) decreasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production.|$|E

40|$|Giardia lamblia is an {{anaerobic}} flagellated protozoa and {{a common}} inhabitant of human intestine. It is transmitted mainly by ingestion of the cysts in contaminated food or drinking water, and is present in at least 10 % {{of the population in}} the United States (1). The infection causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and retarded growth in children. Tbe infectious dose of cysts appears to be quite low, whereas a large number of cysts can be shed from infected individuals. Metronidazole (Flagyl) and atabrine are the only two drugs available for treating the infection; both having undesirable side effects (2). No chemoprophylactic drugs are yet available for giardiasis. Recent success in establishing axenic cultures of G. lamblia trophozoites (3) has made it possible to study the metabolisms in this organism. In one recent report (4), G. lamblia was found incapable of incorporating <b>orotic</b> and aspartic <b>acid</b> into nucleic acids, and no activities of de novo pyrimidine-synthesis enzymes were detected in the crude extracts of G. lamblia.

40|$|Comprehensive {{two-dimensional}} {{gas chromatography}} (GC × GC) time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ToFMS) {{was applied to}} the analysis of urinary organic acids from patients with inborn errors of metabolism. Abnormal profiles were obtained from all five patients studied. Methylmalonic academia and deficiencies of 3 -methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase gave diagnostic profiles while deficiencies of very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and mitochondrial 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl CoA synthase gave profiles with significant increases in dicarboxylic acids suggestive of these disorders. The superior resolving power of GC × GC with ToFMS detection was useful in separating isomeric organic acids that were not resolved using one-dimensional GC. A novel urinary metabolite, crotonyl glycine, was also discovered in the mitochondrial 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl CoA synthase sample which may be a useful specific diagnostic marker for this disorder. The quantitative aspects of GC × GC were investigated using stable isotope dilution analyses of glutaric, glyceric, <b>orotic,</b> 4 -hydroxybutyric <b>acids</b> and 3 -methylcrotonylglycine. Correlation coefficients for linear calibrations of the analytes ranged from 0. 9805 to 0. 9993 (R 2) and analytical recoveries from 77 % to 99 %. This study illustrates the potential of GC × GC-ToFMS for the diagnosis of organic acidurias and detailed analysis of the complex profiles that are often associated with these disorders...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{composition}} of the dairy matrix used in yogurt manufacture could influence the metabolic activity of yogurt starter and the compounds produced during fermentation. In this way, the lactose hydrolysis with a β-galactosidase enzyme and the supplementation with dairy powders to obtain different types of delactosed yogurts for lactose-intolerant people modifies the milk base composition. In this work, we studied {{the influence of the}} addition of different doses of β-galactosidase and levels of dairy powders on organic acids profile during the manufacture and storage of two varieties of yogurt (natural and sweetened). Lactose, glucose, galactose, titratable acidity, fermentation time, and microbiological counts were also evaluated. The mean proportions of lactose/glucose/galactose in relation to the total sugars were 18 : 36 : 46 in hydrolyzed yogurts, while they were 81 : 4 : 15 in unhydrolyzed ones. In supplemented yogurts, the content of lactose, citric, <b>orotic,</b> and hippuric <b>acids</b> were significantly increased. The starter population was similar in all yogurts, but some changes in their activity were evidenced due to both factors studied. The fermentation time was slightly increased, and the lactic acid content and the titratable acidity were significantly increased due to fortification while they were decreased by enzyme addition. These results are probably due to the increase in the buffer properties of the milk base by the dairy powder addition and due to an inhibition of the starter activity caused by changes in the carbohydrate profile. The results demonstrated that the changes in the matrix {{composition of}} the yogurt affected the organic acids profile, above all the lactic acid content...|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} {{underlying}} this thesis, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic (GCxGC) {{methods have been}} developed {{which can be used}} to compare metabolic profiles from both human and plant metabolic samples. GCxGC was used to extend the GC approach in this area by using 2 DGC methods, which provide greater separation power, lower detection limits (greater sensitivity, and therefore cleaner MS spectra), smaller sample amounts and less overall analysis times. A reliable microwave derivatization protocol for metabolomic analysis has been developed through the analysis of a set of standards which included a wide range of metabolites of interest to metabolic profiling. The method presented is rapid (significant decrease in derivatization time, therefore overall decreasing the total analysis time), sensitive and produces less side reactions (a more complete derivatization reaction). It has been successfully applied to two main application areas: human (urine) and plant (ginseng) metabolite profiling. In the infant urine metabolite profiling of organic acids for the diagnosis of organic acidurias, abnormal profiles were obtained from five &lsquo;diseased&rsquo; patient samples and compared to five &lsquo;normal&rsquo; patient samples. GCxGC with ToFMS detection was useful in separating isomeric organic acids that were otherwise not resolved using 1 DGC. Crotonyl glycine was also discovered in the mitochondrial 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl CoA synthase sample as a possible biomarker for the specific disorder. Quantification was investigated using stable isotope dilution analyses of glutaric, glyceric, <b>orotic,</b> 4 -hydroxybutyric <b>acids</b> and 3 -methylcrotonylglycine. Correlation coefficients for linear calibrations of the analytes ranged from 0. 9805 to 0. 9993 (R 2) and analytical recoveries from 77 and 99 %. The work undertaken in the plant metabolic profiling area comprised of the comparison of four, five and six year aged panax ginseng samples through the detection, identification and quantification of volatiles using HS-SPME-GCxGC/TOFMS, and full-metabolite screens for the study of primary and secondary active metabolites using GC&times;GC/ToFMS. In the SPME study, major compounds identified in the samples analyzed were sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and sesquiterpene alcohols, with most of the previously known active compounds present in the five followed by the six year aged samples (examples include&nbsp;&alpha;-panasinene,&nbsp;&szlig;-panasinene,&nbsp;&alpha;-humulene and&nbsp;&alpha;-neoclovene). In the full-metabolite screen, primary active compounds identified and quantified included&nbsp;&alpha;-galactopyranosyl-galactopyranose (a trisaccharide) and protopanaxadiol and protopanaxatriol (two glycosides); these primary active compounds were only found in the five and six year aged samples. Secondary active compounds included monosaccharide and disaccharide sugars. Quantification was performed using a 10 metabolite standard mixture with concentration levels of standards ranging from 0. 01 to 100 &nbsp;&micro;g/ml. R 2 values obtained were mainly higher than 0. 980, with RSD (%) usually less than 5 %. Concentration levels found for the primary active compounds ranged from 0. 07 - 0. 17 &nbsp;&micro;g/ml for protopanaxadiol, with protopanaxatriol concentrations ranging from 0. 10 - 0. 15 &nbsp;&micro;g/ml in the six year aged samples...|$|R
