5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old should know and insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E

5|$|The {{spelling}} system, or orthography, of English is multi-layered, {{with elements}} of French, Latin, and Greek spelling {{on top of}} the native Germanic system. Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace. Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation and standard spellings <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced. There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the first law for closed systems, energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another, changing the internal energies of each. Transfer, between bodies, of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies. Though it is not logically rigorous {{from the viewpoint of}} strict physical concepts, a common form <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> expresses this is to say that heat and work are interconvertible.|$|E
5000|$|In linguistics, an inflected {{preposition}} {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>that</b> {{occurs in}} some languages, that corresponds to {{the combination of a}} preposition and a personal pronoun.

The displaced constituent takes on a word as its head that is not its governor. The words in red mark the catena (=chain) <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> extends from {{the root of the}} displaced constituent to the governor of that constituent. Discontinuities are then explored in terms of these catenae. The limitations on topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, and extraposition can be explored and identified by examining the nature of the catenae involved.|$|E
25|$|Language {{documentation}} combines anthropological inquiry (into {{the history}} and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. Lexicography involves the documentation <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a dictionary. Computational linguistics {{is concerned with the}} statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of translation and interpretation, as well as in language education – the teaching of a second or foreign language. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.|$|E
25|$|The Scandinavian {{languages}} are (as a language family) entirely unrelated to Finnish, Estonian, and Sami languages, which as Uralic {{languages are}} distantly related to Hungarian. Owing to the close proximity, {{there is still}} a great deal of borrowing from the Swedish and Norwegian languages in the Finnish and Sami languages. The long history of linguistic influence of Swedish on Finnish is also {{due to the fact that}} Finnish, the language of the majority in Finland, was treated as a minority language while Finland was part of Sweden. Finnish-speakers had to learn Swedish in order to advance to higher positions. Swedish spoken in today's Finland includes a lot <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> are borrowed from Finnish, whereas the written language remains closer to that of Sweden.|$|E

We undertook the exercise to back-translate the current Chinese translation and it showed a number of differences compared to the original English SDQ. The differences and concerns include: (1) the flow and grammar of Chinese translation as well as wrongly written Chinese characters; (2) translated <b>words</b> <b>that</b> have deviated from the original meaning; (3) significant numbers <b>of</b> <b>wording</b> <b>that</b> are somewhat different from the original English version; (4) addition of auxiliary verbs that do not exist in original English version; and (5) the current Chinese SDQ is a general questionnaire for all age groups that does not observe the differences <b>of</b> <b>wording</b> <b>that</b> exist in the English versions...|$|R
25|$|The lexicon is a {{catalogue}} of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of words and bound morphemes, which are parts <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> can't stand alone, like affixes. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered {{to be part of}} the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. Lexicography, closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an encyclopedia or a dictionary. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization, and the new words are called neologisms.|$|E
25|$|Dutch {{uses the}} diaeresis. For example, in ruïne {{it means that}} the u and the i are {{separately}} pronounced in their usual way, and not {{in the way that the}} combination ui is normally pronounced. Thus it works as a separation sign and not as an indication for an alternative version of the i. Diacritics can be used for emphasis (érg koud for very cold) or for disambiguation between a number <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> are spelled the same when context doesn't indicate the correct meaning (één appel = one apple, een appel = an apple; vóórkomen = to occur, voorkómen = to prevent). Grave and acute accents are used on a very small number of words, mostly loanwords. The ç also appears in some loanwords.|$|E
25|$|Human's {{attention}} on words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary. Negative and positive words are better recalled than neutral {{words that are}} spoken. Many different ways that {{attention is focused on}} hearing what the speaker has to say is the inflection of the presenter's voice in a sad, content, frustrated sound or in the use <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>that</b> are close to the hear. A study was conducted to observe if the use of emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory. The groups were put into the same lecture halls and given the same speakers, but the results came back to determine that the inflection and word choice recalled by the listeners concluded that emotional words, phrases, and sounds are more memorable than neutral speakers.|$|E
