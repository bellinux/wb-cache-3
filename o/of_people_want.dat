There is a significant number of Chinese and British Chinese. In 2007, 22% of primary school children in England were from ethnic minority families, and in 2011 that figure was 26.5%. About half of the population increase between 1991 and 2001 was due to immigration.

500|$|At {{approximately}} 7:20 pm on Friday, September 19, 2014, Gonzalez scaled {{the iron}} perimeter fence of the White House. Several agents pursued him, {{as he ran}} directly towards the North Portico doors, which were unlocked. President Barack Obama and his daughters had just left the White House and were heading to Camp David {{at the time of}} the incident. Michelle Obama was also not home, having travelled to the retreat earlier. Agents stated they chose not to shoot at Gonzalez as he did not have a weapon in his hands, and was not wearing clothing that could conceal a significant amount of explosives; the possibility of accidentally hitting civilians beyond the fence was also cited. A senior official stated: [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to judge the Secret Service for not shooting, but [...] number of things have to be considered in this situation, including whether or not the principal is in the residence" [...] adding, [...] "given what's emerged about [...] since the arrest, maybe we'll look back and say the Secret Service played a role in saving his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Central to Colbert's {{personality}} is his rigid belief that [...] "what I say is right, and [...] anyone else says {{could possibly be}} true", regardless of any evidence to the contrary. He discussed this in the Reports first Wørd segment, using the term [...] "truthiness" [...] as he explained what he perceives to {{be the difference between}} [...] "those who think with their head and those who know with their heart". He has further gone on to ascribe [...] "truthiness" [...] to other institutions including Wikipedia, which he believes upholds his view that reality can be determined by consensus opinion, and often encourages viewers to use Wikipedia to [...] "change reality". Colbert believes that if a majority <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> something to be true, that thing therefore must become the truth. For instance, after months of scoffing at global warming, Colbert suddenly reversed his position, conceding its existence only due to the box office success of An Inconvenient Truth, a sign that [...] "the free market has spoken".|$|E

500|$|On {{the tour}} in {{promotion}} of the album, Green Day aimed for simplicity and decided not to bring new instrumentalists {{to play for the}} new songs. [...] Armstrong commented, [...] "Right now we're refraining from pulling out a lot of that 'Nimrod' stuff. We want to make things small. We don't want to bring a horn section or a violin player out with us. A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to hear the old stuff, and that stuff is still just as significant to us." [...] The band also decided to play small theaters instead of stadiums and festivals, as Armstrong explained that they felt better to [...] "go to a place like The Fillmore and The Warfield and know it's actually going to sell out" [...] instead of playing to half-empty large venues. The Nimrod tour marked the first time the band performed its now-routine ritual of inviting audience members onstage to play instruments. [...] During the tour, Armstrong felt that he became a better performer, noting, [...] "I think some people walk away from a Green Day concert with the emotions you would get from some kind of theater performance where the crowd feels involved — where it's not just about the singer. It's not just about the band." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Give It Away" [...] is {{performed}} in the time signature of 4/4 time. The track begins with a distinctively [...] "dry" [...] guitar tone that is similar in style {{to the rest of}} the record. Producer Rick Rubin had a considerable influence on the sound of Blood Sugar Sex Magik by removing much of the reverb and guitar layering that epitomized the band's previous album Mother's Milk. This caused the record to contain simpler and dryer guitar and bass chords that were not filtered through guitar effects—those that did, however, were made with vintage electronics from the 1960s and 70s. For [...] "Give It Away", along with the rest of the album, Rubin sought to achieve a sense of atmosphere that was similar to 60s records that were made without commercialism or viability in mind and to downplay on [...] "big" [...] sounds: [...] "What you hear is what you get—there's not a lot of trickery. A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> the biggest sound, with walls of guitar and huge drums. But I don't think those things matter." [...] The song follows a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure; when Kiedis begins singing, Frusciante jumps into a funk-oriented riff that is repeated throughout the verse while Flea plays a complex bass-line that makes use of virtually the entire fretboard.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the major}} film studios {{approached}} Hepburn to produce the movie version of Barry's play. She chose to sell the rights to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), Hollywood's number one studio, {{on the condition that}} she be the star. As part of the deal she also received the director of her choice, George Cukor, and picked James Stewart and Cary Grant (to whom she ceded top-billing) as co-stars. Before filming began, Hepburn shrewdly noted, [...] "I don't want to make a grand entrance in this picture. Moviegoers... think I'm too la-di-da or something. A lot <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>want</b> to see me fall flat on my face." [...] Thus the film began with Grant knocking the actress flat on her backside. Berg describes how the character was crafted to have audiences [...] "laugh at her enough that they would ultimately sympathize with her", which Hepburn felt was crucial in [...] "recreating" [...] her public image. The Philadelphia Story {{was one of the biggest}} hits of 1940, breaking records at Radio City Music Hall. The review in Time declared, [...] "Come on back, Katie, all is forgiven." [...] Herb Golden of Variety stated, [...] "It's Katharine Hepburn's picture... The perfect conception of all flighty but characterful Main Line socialite gals rolled into one, the story without her is almost inconceivable." [...] Hepburn was nominated for her third Academy Award for Best Actress, and won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.|$|E
