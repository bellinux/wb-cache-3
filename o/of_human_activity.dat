40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>activities</b> {{and climate}} change are {{important}} factors that affect grassland ecosystems. A new optimization approach, the approach of conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) related to initial and parameter perturbations, is employed to explore the nonlinearly combined impacts <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> {{and climate change}} on a grassland ecosystem using a theoretical grassland model. In our study, {{it is assumed that}} the initial perturbations and parameter perturbations are regarded as <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and climate change, respectively. Numerical results indicate that the climate changes causing the maximum effect in the grassland ecosystem are different under disparate intensities <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> This implies the pattern of climate change is very critical to the maintenance or degradation of grassland ecosystem in light of high intensity <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and that the grassland ecosystem should be rationally managed when the moisture index decreases. The grassland ecosystem influenced by the nonlinear combination <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and climate change undergoes abrupt change, while the grassland ecosystem affected by other types <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> and climate change fails to show the abrupt change under a certain range of perturbations with the theoretical model. The further numerical analyses also indicate that the growth of living biomass and the evaporation from soil surface shaded by the wilted biomass may be crucial factors contributing to the abrupt change of the grassland equilibrium state within the theoretical model...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMolecular fossils are {{becoming}} increasingly important tools in paleoenvironmental research, and over recent years, some were shown to be useful indicators <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> Common indicators <b>of</b> <b>human</b> impacts include pollen, charcoal, sedimentation rates, and magnetic susceptibility, {{each of which has}} its limitations. Thus the advent of novel molecular markers <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> provides an additional set of tools to make the difficult distinction between anthropogenic and natural factors that have influenced the environment in the past. The fossil biomarkers record preserved in natural archives provides valuable temporal and spatial insights on land use such as cultivation practices and pastoral activities, post-harvesting activities (e. g. retting), and their consequences on the environments and ecosystems. Here we will present a review of the progress that has been made in developing novel biomarkers <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities,</b> differentiating those indicating environmental changes that can be related to <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> from those unambiguously attributable to <b>human</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Efforts at the {{restoration}} of river ecosystems are needed not only in local habitats but are also important in terrestrial regions. Large-scale assessment <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> {{can be useful in}} integrated watershed management. In this study, we modified the Ecological Risk Index (ERI) by considering the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> in China's Haihe River Basin (HRB). The stressor factors <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities</b> included population, impervious surface, cattle, agricultural land use, industry, fertilizers, pesticides, water conservation facilities, and roads. A total of 423 assessment units in the HRB were created by combining watershed and administrative boundaries to analyze the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activities.</b> Two index options, the ERI (including all stressors) and the ERI-D (excluding reservoirs and sluices), were examined for different management objectives. All the stressors and both ecological risk indices (ERI and ERI-D) were ranked in four levels: low, moderate, high, and very high. Our study demonstrated that the ERI and ERI-D can provide an overview of the spatial pattern <b>of</b> <b>human</b> stressors related to river ecosystems across a large geographic region.

Dated to the fourth century was a hut that had been erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>activity</b> at this hut was found in the form of 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E
