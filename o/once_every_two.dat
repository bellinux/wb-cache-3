5|$|M. spinosissima {{thrive in}} well-drained soils that are sandy or loam, with a pH ranging from acidic to neutral. They prefer low {{humidity}} and full, filtered sun. Plants are typically watered <b>once</b> <b>every</b> <b>two</b> or three weeks, and kept nearly dry {{during the winter}} months. They require no pruning and make good patio and container plants. They are relatively disease resistant, but susceptible to pests such as mealworms. Synonyms of M. spinosissima include Mammillaria centraliplumosa, Mammillaria haasii, and Mammillaria virginis.|$|E
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only <b>once</b> <b>every</b> <b>two</b> to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E

5|$|The {{guns were}} {{controlled}} from a Battery Commander's Post on the roof, from where commands {{to the gun}} detachments could be relayed via voice pipes. Three depression range finders were installed on the roof by the late 1890s to aid the guns' targeting. A well-trained crew could fire each gun <b>once</b> <b>every</b> <b>two</b> minutes. Rather than firing all the guns at once, the guns were positioned {{so that they could}} be fired in sequence as an enemy ship passed by. When combined with the fire from Shornemead and Cliffe Forts on the Kent shore, this would ensure that constant fire could be maintained from three different sides.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, the Presbyterian Church in Milton, Pennsylvania {{requested}} Waller's service, but he instead began preaching in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. He also preached in Wilkes-Barre and Lancaster in late 1838 and in Danville and Milton {{in early}} 1839. On May 1, 1839, he was ordained in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. His Presbyterian ministry began on a church on Third Street in Bloomsburg. When he began preaching, his ministry covered all of Columbia County, {{as well as}} an area from Danville to the Wyoming Valley. In 1840, he stopped preaching at Briar Creek and Berwick, as they became part of a separate ministry. In 1842, he began preaching in Orangeville and New Columbia. he preached in Espy since at least 1857. Due to the size of his ministry, he was never able to preach at a given church more than <b>once</b> <b>every</b> <b>two</b> weeks and only preached at most churches once a month. He typically traveled approximately 5000 miles per year to preach or conduct funerals. Initially his salary was $600.|$|E

5|$|The {{frilled shark}} is aplacental viviparous; the {{developing}} embryos are mainly nourished by yolk, though {{the difference in}} weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional ovaries and one functional uterus, on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which {{there is little to}} no seasonal influence. A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a seamount on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six. Females ovulate eggs into the uterus about <b>once</b> <b>every</b> <b>two</b> weeks; vitellogenesis (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the body cavity.|$|E
5|$|Excavations of {{the tomb}} of Nikau-Isesi under the {{direction}} of Naguib Kanawati at Saqqara have yielded evidence in support of a shorter reign. Nikau-Isesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi, lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of Upper-Egypt under Unas' successor Teti. Nikau-Isesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh cattle count during Teti's reign, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom and every year during the later Middle Kingdom (c.2055–c.1650 BC). Thus Nikau-Isesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas, would have died past 70 years old. However, forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 45 years old. This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than <b>once</b> <b>every</b> <b>two</b> years during Unas and Teti's time, possibly irregularly. If so, Unas' 30-year figure on the Turin canon, understood to mean 15 cattle counts, could translate into as little as 15 years, which together with just 11 years during Teti's reign would account for Nikau-Isesi's death at around 40 to 45 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The lay {{attendees}} at Tinh Xa Trung Tam {{are predominantly}} female by {{a ratio of}} around 5 to 1, {{and most of the}} temple-goers are over 40. Most of the younger lay disciples are relatives of regular, older attendees. In addition to local residents, who make up the bulk of the disciples, some are from other parts of Vietnam, as well as overseas Vietnamese who are temporarily in the country. According to the American professor of Vietnamese history and religion Mark W. McLeod, who did fieldwork at Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm, he did not survey the laypeople about their income, for fear of embarrassing them, but conjectured that most had an above average income as they were able to devote a considerable amount of time to organized religious activity instead of working longer hours. A regular occurrence at the temple is the weekly Bát Quan Trai Giới (Eight Precepts Ritual). As part of this, the participants take on three additional vows apart from the Five Precepts and stay at the temple for a 24-hour period. These vows prohibit adornments such as makeup and jewellery, the use of comfortable beds and chairs, and eating impurely. During the retreat day, meals are taken in silence and talking is avoided, apart from during dharma talks, sutra chanting and religious debate. Meditation is also a part of the routine. Tinh Xa Trung Tam holds the Eight Precepts Ritual more often than any other institution in the city; the next most frequent temple holds the retreat <b>once</b> <b>every</b> <b>two</b> weeks. Dharma talks are held weekly by the resident monks and nuns, which is generally more frequent than at other places in the city. The disciples and monks at the temple told McLeod that they chose Tinh Xa Trung Tam because of what they regarded as a higher level of discipline, rigor and scholarship at the institution. The monks are transported by their disciples as they are forbidden to drive.|$|E

5|$|According to the Nice model, {{after the}} {{formation}} of the Solar System, the orbits of all the giant planets continued to change slowly, influenced by their interaction with the large number of remaining planetesimals.
