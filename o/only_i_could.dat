If <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get rid of this}} dead weight, so that I could use all my {{strength}} to struggle for my own survival, and only worry about myself. Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever.|$|E
500|$|Night (1960) {{is a work}} by Elie Wiesel {{about his}} {{experience}} with his father in the Nazi German concentration camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald in 1944–1945, {{at the height of}} the Holocaust toward the end of the Second World War. In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about the death of God and his own increasing disgust with humanity, reflected in the inversion of the parent–child relationship, as his father declines to a helpless state and Wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver. [...] "If <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get rid of this dead weight...Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever." [...] In Night everything is inverted, every value destroyed. [...] "Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends," [...] a kapo tells him. [...] "Everyone lives and dies for himself alone." ...|$|E
500|$|A mutant, {{who is one}} of Xavier's earlier {{students}} and the leader of the X-Men in Cyclops' absence. Storm is a woman with the ability to manipulate the weather. [...] Berry had stated during interviews for X2 that she would not return unless the character had a significant presence comparable to the comic book version, leading to a larger role in The Last Stands script. Berry declared that her ethnicity made the actress identify with the cure plot: [...] "When I was a child, I felt that if <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> change myself, my life would be better. As I've gotten older, I've come to terms with what utter nonsense that is." [...] The character was given a more modern haircut, and costume designer Judianna Makovsky opted to give Storm more black clothes, a color she only wore in the leather costume for previous films, to make her [...] "tougher and sexier".|$|E

500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it is a return to the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, because {{you want to have a}} good time. I hate having to skip a track. I wanted to make an album you can just play." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Ghost & Mrs. Muir (1969 TV Series) acted {{and sang}} – He {{appeared}} in the episode [...] "The Music Maker", and his character name was Tim Seagirt. He sang [...] "Without Her" [...] and [...] "If <b>Only</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> Touch Your Hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} following, the disability caused him some psychological pain. Dayan wrote in his autobiography: [...] "I reflected with considerable misgivings on my future as a cripple without a skill, trade, or profession to provide for my family." [...] He added that he was [...] "ready to make any effort and stand any suffering, if <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get rid of my black eyepatch. The attention it drew was intolerable to me. I preferred to shut myself up at home, doing anything, rather than encounter the reactions of people wherever I went." ...|$|E

2500|$|The story {{tells of}} a Sadaijin (high-ranking courtier) who has two similar-looking {{children}} by different mothers, a boy called Wakagimi and a girl called Himegimi, but their mannerisms {{are those of the}} opposite sex. [...] The title, [...] "Torikaebaya", literally means [...] "If <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> exchange them!", a cry by the father. [...] The Sadaijin plans to have them join religious orders, but the news of the talents of the [...] "son" [...] spreads to the court. The children go through the coming of age ceremonies for the opposite sex, and the Sadaijin presents his daughter as a man to the court, and his son as a woman.|$|E
2500|$|While McCudden {{watched the}} triplane crash, Rhys-Davids spotted the Albatross and {{dispatched}} it, firing from 100 to 30 yards and severely damaging the [...] machine, belonging to Karl Menckhoff, which force-landed. Rhys-Davids {{then returned to}} base at 18:35–18:40. That evening there was much speculation about {{the identity of the}} German pilot. The Germans soon announced that an ace pilot named Werner Voss had not returned from a sortie and was posted as missing in action. Rhys-Davids came in for a shower of congratulations from the Squadron upon learning the identity of his victory. Rhys-Davids was less sanguine; he lamented to McCudden; [...] "if <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have brought him down alive".|$|E
2500|$|While Meyerbeer's {{popularity}} has faded, {{the fortunes of}} another French composer of the era have risen steeply {{over the past few}} decades. Yet the operas of Hector Berlioz were failures in their day. Berlioz was a unique mixture of an innovative modernist and a backward-looking conservative. His taste in opera had been formed in the 1820s, when the works of Gluck and his followers were being pushed aside in favour of Rossinian bel canto. Though Berlioz grudgingly admired some works by Rossini, he despised what he saw as the showy effects of the Italian style and longed to return opera to the dramatic truth of Gluck. He was also a fully-fledged Romantic, keen to find new ways of musical expression. His first and only work for the Paris Opéra, Benvenuto Cellini (1838), was a notorious failure. Audiences could not understand the opera's originality and musicians found its unconventional rhythms impossible to play. Twenty years later, Berlioz began writing his operatic masterpiece Les Troyens with himself rather than audiences of the day in mind. Les Troyens was to be the culmination of the French Classical tradition of Gluck and Spontini. Predictably, it failed to make the stage, at least in its complete, four-hour form. For that, it would {{have to wait until the}} second half of the twentieth century, fulfilling the composer's prophecy, [...] "If <b>only</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> live till I am a hundred and forty, my life would become decidedly interesting". Berlioz's third and final opera, the Shakespearean comedy Béatrice et Bénédict (1862), was written for a theatre in Germany, where audiences were far more appreciative of his musical innovation.|$|E
