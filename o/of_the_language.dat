5|$|Harris {{was born}} into a middle-class African-American family on January 17, 1899, in Richmond, Virginia. His father was a butcher at a German American owned meat shop, and his mother was a schoolteacher. As a result of his {{frequent}} contact with the meat shop's owner, Harris learned German and became a fluent speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language.</b> Harris' mastery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> would help him later in life, when he examined the writings of German economists and social reformers like Karl Marx.|$|E

5|$|PHP has {{received}} criticism due to lacking native Unicode support {{at the core}} language level, instead only supporting byte strings. In 2005, a project headed by Andrei Zmievski was initiated to bring native Unicode support throughout PHP, by embedding the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library, and representing text strings as UTF-16 internally. Since this would cause major changes both to the internals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> and to user code, it was planned to release this as version 6.0 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language,</b> along with other major features then in development.|$|E

5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them to adopt the literal meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language.</b> The courts now adopt a purposive approach which seeks {{to give effect to}} the true purpose of legislation and are prepared to look at much extraneous material that bears upon the background against which the legislation was enacted.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew as {{preserved}} in the Hebrew Bible is composed of multiple linguistic layers.

5000|$|Here, {{diglossia}} {{is seen as}} a kind of bilingualism in {{a society}} in which one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> has high prestige (henceforth referred to as [...] "H"), and another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> has low prestige ("L").

50|$|As {{important}} was <b>the</b> deciphering <b>of</b> Old Persian, <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> dozens of inscriptions which still stand in Iran. Sir Henry Rawlinson first discovered that <b>the</b> <b>language</b> <b>of</b> these inscriptions was an ancient form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persian <b>language.</b> Since these inscriptions often included inscriptions in other Cuneiform scripts, this decipherment became like a Rosetta Stone for <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> <b>of</b> ancient Mesopotamia. All {{that we know}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>languages</b> and histories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empires <b>of</b> Babylonia, Assyria, Sumer, Elam, and so on is indirectly indebted to knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persian <b>language.</b>|$|R

5|$|Initially, the Māori {{language}} (te reo Māori) {{was permitted}} in native schools to facilitate English instruction, {{but as time}} went on official attitudes hardened against any use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language.</b> Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language in schools and work places and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas. The language underwent a revival beginning in the 1970s, and now more people speak Māori. The future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>language</b> {{was the subject of a}} claim before the Waitangi Tribunal in 1985. As a result, Māori was declared an official language in 1987. In the 2013 census, 21.3percent of Māori people—and 3.7percent of all respondents, including some non-Māori people—reported conversational fluency in the language. There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels, the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime-time content delivered in Māori. Many places have officially been given dual Māori and English names in recent years.|$|E
