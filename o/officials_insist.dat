2500|$|... "The Bahá'í faith {{imposes a}} system of {{in-house}} censorship on all Bahá'ís just as most Middle Eastern governments have practiced censorship since the rise of printing in the nineteenth century. Within the Bahá'í religion, any piece of writing by a Bahá'í author about the religion intended for publication is to be vetted by elected Bahá'í officials at the appropriate level (local, national, international). This requirement has provoked many conflicts between Bahá'í officials and writers over the years. Critics charge that {{it has led to}} a paucity of intellectually acute Bahá'í literature, to a lack of independent magazines and to the withdrawal of a number of Bahá'í writers. The innovative research findings of the new generation of Bahá'í academics has in particular brought them into conflict with the conservatives in charge of the censorship apparatus. Although Bahá'í <b>officials</b> <b>insist</b> that the censorship requirement ("literature review") is [...] "temporary," [...] it has already lasted nearly a century, and the House of Justice {{has made it clear that}} it intends to keep it in effect for a very long time. And although it is sometimes alleged that [...] "review" [...] protects Bahá'í authors, in practice even work submitted for review, such as the Dialogue [...] "Modest Proposal," [...] can attract sanctions. Prepublication censorship has been among the primary techniques by which Bahá'í authors have been prevented from publishing on the controversies of contemporary Bahá'í history, and it is notable that the history of the community since about 1950 has not been written about in any detail. Contemporary history is off-limits as a subject because it would involve making value judgments on present office-holders. It is often alleged by Bahá'í conservatives that [...] "literature review" [...] does not actually impede the publication of research findings. But in 1988 the all-male House of Justice permanently suppressed an academic paper arguing that women could serve on the UHJ, insisting that only men could serve." ...|$|E

5000|$|In its {{reassessment}} of Soviet history that began during perestroika in 1989, the USSR condemned the 1939 secret protocol between Germany and itself.

The Russian government and its state <b>officials</b> <b>insist</b> that incorporation of the Baltic states was in accordance with international law and gained de jure recognition by the agreements made in the Yalta and Potsdam conferences and by the Helsinki Accords, whereas the Accords only committed existing frontiers would not be violated. However, Russia agreed to Europe's demand to [...] "assist persons deported from the occupied Baltic states" [...] upon joining the Council of Europe.

5000|$|For {{more than}} 30 {{years since the}} {{cancellation}} of the Hartford-Providence leg of I-84, elected officials in Connecticut proposed to extend I-384 from Bolton to Willimantic along the US-6 corridor, connecting the existing I-384 with the US-6 Windham Bypass, which would have likely included {{an extension of the}} I-384 designation to include the new freeway and the Windham Bypass. The corresponding stretch of US-6 is known as [...] "Suicide 6" [...] because of sharp turns and intersections had been the site of numerous fatal accidents, and was the main reason supporting construction of the bypass. It is unlikely the 11-mile freeway between I-384 and the Windham Bypass will ever be built because of irresolvable disagreements over the routing of the freeway: State and local officials prefer more northerly alignment that minimizes disruption to developed areas along US-6, while federal <b>officials</b> <b>insist</b> on a more southerly alignment that minimizes environmental impacts to the Hop River ecosystem. After studying more than 200 potential alignments with no agreement among stakeholders, the Connecticut Department of Transportation abandoned further study of the US-6 freeway in 2005, and instead focused on completing safety upgrades on the existing US-6 corridor between Bolton and Willimantic to reduce congestion and accidents.|$|E

40|$|Beijing's {{policy of}} {{draining}} surrounding regions to ease water shortages {{in the ancient}} capital is akin to "quenching thirst by drinking poison," {{according to a new}} report by Probe International's Beijing-based researchers. To keep water flowing to Beijing's "green" Olympics this August, the water-strapped city is pumping water from four newly-built reservoirs in nearby Hebei province, depriving poor farmers of water for their crops. City <b>officials</b> <b>insist</b> the water is needed for supplying Olympic venues and providing the Olympic Village with drinkable tapwater. And they say more water transfers will be needed from the Yangtze River by 2010 and beyond, to meet Beijing's rapidly growing demand for water. But large-scale water transfers won't solve the fundamental problems facing Beijing, says the report, Beijing's Water Crisis: 1949 to 2008 Olympics. Nine consecutive years of below-average rainfall combined with rapid urban expansion, dumping of wastewater and sewage into Beijing's waterways, and overpumping of groundwater mean the city of 17 million people is fast exhausting its water supply. Rather than endless expansion of the city's water supply by expropriating water from other jurisdictions, the report recommends better governance of water resources and the water industry [...] including restrictions on urban development and water-guzzling industries, enforcement of anti-pollution laws, tradable water rights, and UK-style regulation of water utilities...|$|E
