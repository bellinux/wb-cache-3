40|$|AbstractThe {{combustion}} of shale, a porous sedimentary rock, {{has been}} reported at times in <b>outcrop</b> <b>deposits</b> and mining piles.

Because shale has high inert content, novel diagnostics such as mass loss measurements and visual observation of charring are introduced to detect self-heating ignition in respect to other self-heating materials with lower inter content. Using field samples collected from the outcrop at Kimmeridge Bay (UK) and the Frank-Kamenetskii theory of ignition, we determine the effective kinetic parameters for two particle-size distributions of shale.

40|$|The current {{understanding}} of sedimentary processes that produce ice sheet grounding-zone wedges (GZWs) is limited because most observations derive from marine geophysical techniques, including seismic and multibeam instruments, {{as well as}} isolated cores from these sediment deposits. Collectively, these data may provide measurements of large-scale morphology and internal stratigraphy, but are typically of inadequate resolution to identify the range of sediment transport processes that produce GZWs. Herein, newly acquired high-resolution seismic and multibeam data from the western Ross Sea, Antarctica, are used to document GZW planform geometries, which are compared to interpreted GZW outcrops exposed on Whidbey Island, Washington (U. S. A.), in order to link planform morphology and sedimentary transport processes at ice grounding lines to internal stratigraphy. These efforts document that GZWs possess self-similar planform geometries, and that the size range of GZWs may be adjusted to include deposits that are less than ten meters thick and hundreds of meters in length. For the Whidbey Island <b>outcrop</b> <b>deposits,</b> prograding successions are bounded by glacial unconformities, whereby the upper unconformity indicates glacial over-ridding during episodes of grounding line stability. The dominant mode of GZW construction is determined to be sediment mass movement {{in the form of}} debris flows, and delivery of deformation till by ice to the grounding line by ice. The role of meltwater discharge in terms of sediment dispersal and accumulation is found to vary, and both channelized flows and sediment-laden plumes are interpreted. Rhythmic beds of silt and sand provide evidence of tidal pumping. Collectively, these observations indicate a punctuated style of ice sheet retreat, with stability lending to the growth of GZW, during overall grounding line back-stepping during deglaciation. Based on evidence from the Puget Lowlands, including radiocarbon ages, the timescale of stability between retreat events is on the order of decades to centuries...|$|R

[...] 18 pages, 9 figures, 4 tablesFive main Pleistocene–Holocene lithofacies are defined in three different sedimentary environments (fault scarp, sedimentary lobe and inter-lobe channel) of the SW Galicia Bank: (1) turbidites (biogenous and terrigenous), (2) hemipelagites, (3) pelagites, (4) debrites, and (5) Heinrich sediments. In the sedimentary lobe and inter-lobe channel, the stratigraphic record consists mainly of turbidites interbedded with debrites and Heinrich sediments and hemipelagites that are covered by hemipelagites or pelagites. In the fault scarp, the stratigraphy comprises hemipelagites and turbidites covered by pelagites. Frequency of turbidite events has varied between 1 / 1. 2 ka and 1 / 3. 1 ka, since 31. 3 ka BP. At least four turbidite events (1 to 4) between 9. 1 and 31. 3 ka BP, have been correlated between the different sedimentary environments. The downslope of turbidity flows prevailed until 9. 1 ka; after which, vertical settling and slow lateral advection have controlled sedimentation. The source area of turbidites and debrites is the fault scarp. Erosion of the slope near-surface pelagites/hemipelagites and ancient <b>outcropping</b> <b>deposits</b> could explain the presence of biogenous turbidites and terrigenous turbidites respectively.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{geological}} and stratigraphic knowledge of the Metaponto coastal area a detailed geological survey has been performed between Marina di Ginosa (Taranto) and Cavone river (Matera). Furthermore, a facies analysis either along stratigraphic sections or on cores obtained from five continuously-cored boreholes, drilling in the Holocene and middle – upper Pleistocene deposits up to 120 m of depth, has been carried out. The <b>outcropping</b> <b>deposits</b> have been distinguished in: upper Pleistocene “sandy-conglomeratic deposits of the regressive coastal prisms” and Holocene “Metaponto plain deposits”. The first deposits are subdivided into three lithostratigraphic units. The first two units have a thickness variable up to 15 m, and are represented by sandy-conglomeratic prisms resulting from the interplay between sea-level fluctuations and regional uplift; they are referred to “sabbie e conglomerati di Policoro” and “sabbie e conglomerati di Masseria Ricotta”, showing facies features of shoreface passing upward to continental environments. The third unit, up to 2 m thick, is an “eluvial product”, made up of reddish sands with gravelly layers unconformably and discontinuously overlaying the previous deposits. The Holocene “Metaponto plain deposits” have been distinguished in: “continental deposits” and “transitional deposits”. Continental deposits are represented by mainly some meters thick fine- to coarse-grained sediments of eluvial, fluvial, lacustrine and palustrine environments. Transitional deposits are represented by some meters thick sandy and silty Holocene beach-dune systems (modern and ancient) and sandy and clayey-silty deltaic systems (modern and ancient). The buried deposits of the Metaponto coastal area have been distinguished in three units thanks to the facies analysis and mainly to the recognition of two important erosional surfaces. The lower unit (called substratum), found beginning from a depth variable from 13 m to 44 m moving seaward, is at least 76 m thick and made up of clayey-silty deposits, with interbedded sandy beds passing landward and upward to sandy and/or sandy-gravelly deposits. The lower boundary was not found, whilst the upper boundary is represented by an erosional surface (SE) highlighted by a lag deposit. The facies features of these deposits {{can be referred to}} offshore passing upward to shallow marine environments. The age is middle - late Pleistocene. The intermediate unit is bounded both on bottom and on top by erosional surfaces (SE and ST). This intermediate upper Pleistocene wedge-shaped unit, called “Metaponto buried plain deposits”, pinches out landward, passing from about 7 m to 0 m in thickness. It is made up of sandy-gravelly deposits of continental to shallow marine environments. The third upper unit erosionally overlies both the previous unit and the substratum by the ST surface. This unit is made up of sands and gravelly sands, and its thickness varies from 13 m to 48 moving seaward, and has been attributed to the progradation of a beach system, laterally linked to a deltaic system, and passing seaward to an offshore system. A lamellibranch shell yielded a not calibrated 14 C age of 7. 572 ± 50 yr BP for these deposits. The overall collected data allow us to draw a geological map on 1 : 25. 000 scale that provides a new stratigraphic framework of the <b>outcropping</b> Metaponto plain <b>deposits.</b> Furthermore, the geological sections obtained also utilizing the boreholes allow us both to reconstruct the geometry of the buried deposits and to outline the evolutionary history of the Holocene transgressive prism along the coastal study area...|$|R

The genesis of these deposits is dependent on several constraints, namely lithology, tectonics and morphology. A multidisciplinary approach was applied to the systematization of residual kaolin deposits located on the South of Porto city, as well on the vicinities of Aveiro region.

Four different depositional environments have been recognized: fluvial, lagoon, foreshore and shoreface. Fluvial deposits, occurring in the Flumeri section, consist of clast-supported conglomerates, horizontal laminated sands and muddy silts with freshwater ostracod assemblages, indicating deposition in braided river low-sinuosity channels. In the Flumeri section lagoonal deposits are generally represented by structureless layers of dark clay including ostracods of brackish coastal lagoon connected with shallow-marine waters. In the Vallesaccarda section lagoonal sediments only occur as muddy clasts. Foreshore deposits are represented by well sorted yellow sands with low-angle cross lamination; a horizontal layer of stratified gravels outcrops in Vallesaccarda section. The shoreface deposits consist of poorly sorted sands with trough cross stratification formed in a bar and trough system, of symmetric ripples layers, and of abundant mollusc shell debris; in the Vallesaccarda section a tempestite interval generated by storm activity has been found. In Flumeri section littoral and lagoonal facies assemblages alternate; in Vallesaccarda section only nearshore sediments <b>outcrop.</b> Nearshore <b>deposits</b> denote a wave-dominated coastal marine environments.
