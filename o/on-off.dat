5|$|Several {{dopamine}} agonists {{that bind}} to dopamine receptors {{in the brain}} have similar effects to levodopa. These were initially used as a complementary therapy to levodopa for individuals experiencing levodopa complications (<b>on-off</b> fluctuations and dyskinesias); they are now mainly used on their own as first therapy for the motor symptoms of PD with the aim of delaying the initiation of levodopa therapy and so delaying the onset of levodopa's complications. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine and lisuride.|$|E
5|$|Jacqui accuses Myra {{of being}} a bad mother and {{suggests}} {{it would have been}} better if Myra had aborted her. Jacqui and Tony reconcile again. Jacqui plans to adopt because of her criminal record. Tony discovers he has a secret child called Harry. Jacqui forces Tony to make a choice: Harry or her. Tony chooses Harry and she ends their relationship and leaves. An intoxicated Tony and Mercedes betray Jacqui by sleeping together. Jacqui fails to resist Tony again and they restart their <b>on-off</b> relationship. She then changes her surname back to McQueen from Malota and Mercedes reveals that she is pregnant and Jacqui asks Mercedes to let her and Tony raise the baby, unaware it's Tony's baby but Mercedes has an abortion, infuriating Jacqui so Myra offers to be her surrogate but she refuses. Tina sees how desperate her sister is for a child and offers to be the surrogate, leaving Jacqui and Tony ecstatic about having a future child.|$|E
5|$|Justin and Diodorus {{both say}} that Philip also invaded Thessaly in 358 BC. In the years up to 370 BC, Thessaly had enjoyed a brief {{ascendancy}} in the Greek world, after being unified under Jason of Pherae, {{who was appointed}} Tagus (chief magistrate) of Thessaly. However, Jason was assassinated in 370 BC, and his son Alexander became Tagus. Alexander ruled harshly, and other states of the Thessalian League therefore withdrew their support for him, resulting in a desultory conflict in which both Macedon (under Alexander II) and eventually Thebes became embroiled. This conflict eventually ended in 364 BC when the Thebans were victorious over Alexander, and imposed a peace settlement on Thessaly. However, with the weakening of Thebes {{in the aftermath of}} Mantinea, <b>on-off</b> conflict within Thessaly continued. Alexander was himself assassinated in 358 BC, by his wife's brothers Lycophron and Tisiphonus, who became tyrants in his place. According to Diodorus, the Aleuadae, the noble family which dominated politics in the northern Thessalian city of Larissa, were opposed to these new tyrants, and requested aid from Philip.|$|E

25|$|Controllers, {{which were}} able to make {{calculated}} changes in response to deviations from a set point rather than <b>on-off</b> control, began being introduced the 1930s. Controllers allowed manufacturing to continue showing productivity gains to offset the declining influence of factory electrification.|$|E
25|$|Morse Code, when {{transmitted}} essentially, {{creates an}} AM signal (even in on/off keying mode), assumptions about signal {{can be made}} with respect to similarly timed RTTY signalling. Because Morse code transmissions employ an <b>on-off</b> keyed radio signal, it requires less complex transmission equipment than other forms of radio communication.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{long-term goal}} of future technology for a portable device for treating diabetes is to: a) eliminate all dependent peripheral devices, for example, calibration meter, injection syringes/pens, glucagon, etc.; b) manage very complex life situations with fully automated protocols, for example, respond to DKA, sickness, extreme exercise/eating; and c) single <b>on-off</b> button control. This is absolutely not an impossible goal.|$|E
25|$|This {{turned out}} to be true when he turned down a central {{contract}} the following month, opting to look for a more settled career overseas, although he again changed his mind, returning to play for Zimbabwe three months later. Dogged by injuries, the <b>on-off</b> farrago resurfaced in 2008 when he again quit for a contract in South Africa, only to return weeks later.|$|E

Cliff Clavin wants to be promoted by the Post Office.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{feedback control}} mechanism was the water clock invented by Greek engineer Ctesibius (285–222 BC). In the modern era, the thermostat invented in 1620 by the Dutch scientist Cornelius Drebbel. (Note: Early thermostats were temperature regulators or controllers {{rather than the}} <b>on-off</b> mechanisms common in household appliances.) Another control mechanism was used to tent the sails of windmills. It was patented by Edmund Lee in 1745. Also in 1745, Jacques de Vaucanson invented the first automated loom.|$|E
25|$|The Orfordness Beacon did not {{broadcast}} continuously, but on {{a five-minute}} <b>on-off</b> pattern. This allowed {{for the construction of}} a second Beacon at RAE Farnborough, south-west of London. The Farnborough station broadcast on the same frequency as Orford, using the letters G and W for north and east. Orfordness broadcast on the first five minutes of every ten-minute period, and Farnborough on the second five minutes. Operation started in early 1930, but was first used only experimentally, for short periods on weekdays.|$|E
25|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} in {{the brain}} have a similar effect to levodopa since they bind to dopaminergic postsynaptic receptors. Dopamine agonists were initially used for patients experiencing <b>on-off</b> fluctuations and dyskinesias as a complementary therapy to levodopa, but they are now mainly used on their own as an initial therapy for motor symptoms {{with the aim of}} delaying motor complications. When used in late PD, they are useful at reducing the off periods. Dopamine agonists include bromocriptine, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, piribedil, cabergoline, apomorphine, and lisuride.|$|E
25|$|Doherty has had {{a tumultuous}} {{relationship}} with Kate Moss, frequently covered by the press. They met in January 2005 at Moss' 31st birthday party and had an <b>on-off</b> relationship for several years. Moss had also taken to singing at some of Doherty's shows. On 11 April 2007, Doherty announced Moss as his fiancée during {{the first of his}} solo gigs at the Hackney Empire, London, at which Moss also performed. Doherty planned to marry Moss during the summer 2007. Since July 2007, Moss and Doherty have broken up.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{their close}} {{relationship}} growing up, Harry did show some disdain for Al's success over the years. Even during their time with Jack Palmer, Al was rising in popularity while Harry was fading. After separating from Al and Jack, Harry's career in show business, however, sank greatly. On one occasion—which was another {{factor in his}} <b>on-off</b> relationship with Al—Harry offered to be Al's agent, but Al rejected the offer, worried about the pressure {{that he would have}} faced from his producers for hiring his brother as his agent. Shortly after Harry's wife Lillian died in 1948, Harry and Al became close once again.|$|E
25|$|In 1588, {{hoping to}} put a stop to Elizabeth's intervention, Philip sent the Spanish Armada to invade England. Unfavourable weather, plus heavily armed and manœuvrable English ships, and the fact that the English had been warned by their spies in the Netherlands and were ready for the attack {{resulted}} in a defeat for the Armada. However, the failure of the Drake–Norris Expedition to Portugal and the Azores in 1589 marked a turning point in the <b>on-off</b> 1585–1604 Anglo–Spanish War. The Spanish fleets became more effective in transporting greatly increased quantities of silver and gold from the Americas, while English attacks suffered costly failures.|$|E
25|$|CFLs are {{extremely}} cost-effective in commercial buildings when used to replace incandescent lamps. Using average U.S. commercial {{electricity and gas}} rates for 2006, a 2008 article found that replacing each 75 W incandescent lamp with a CFL resulted in yearly savings of $22 in energy usage, reduced HVAC cost, and reduced labour to change lamps. The incremental capital investment of $2 per fixture is typically paid back in about one month. Savings are greater and payback periods shorter in regions with higher electric rates and, to a lesser extent, also in regions with higher than U.S. average cooling requirements. However, frequent <b>on-off</b> cycling (turning on and off) of CFLs greatly reduces their lifespan.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 she {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} feisty Bianca Jackson in BBC's {{flagship}} soap opera, EastEnders. A popular character, Bianca's <b>on-off</b> romance with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) captivated millions of fans and their on-screen marriage in 1997 drew one of the biggest soap audiences ever — more than 22 million. She remained in the role for six years, but quit in 1999 {{to spend more time with}} her family and to concentrate on other projects. She reprised the role in May 2002 in a special spin-off entitled, EastEnders: Ricky and Bianca. The two-part, hour-long special was filmed in Manchester and reunited Bianca and Ricky for the first time in over two years.|$|E
25|$|Rajesh, who is {{normally}} called Raj or just by his surname Koothrappali, is from New Delhi, India. He despises Indian food, and {{his lack of}} knowledge about Indian culture and Hinduism are often rebuked by Sheldon. He was born into a wealthy family and has five siblings, one of whom is Priya, a former <b>on-off</b> girlfriend of Leonard. Raj {{is normally}} seen wearing a layered combination of a shirt and sweater vest, khakis or cargo pants with skate shoes and a fleece or nylon track top-style windbreaker. Raj wore a red cap in the pilot episode, but has not worn any headgear on a regular basis {{for the rest of the}} series' run.|$|E
25|$|Relay logic was {{introduced}} with factory electrification, which underwent rapid adaption from 1900 though the 1920s. Central electric power stations were also undergoing rapid growth {{and operation of}} new high pressure boilers, steam turbines and electrical substations created a large demand for instruments and controls. Central control rooms became common in the 1920s, but {{as late as the}} early 1930s, most process control was <b>on-off.</b> Operators typically monitored charts drawn by recorders that plotted data from instruments. To make corrections, operators manually opened or closed valves or turned switches on or off. Control rooms also used color coded lights to send signals to workers in the plant to manually make certain changes.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie {{goes into}} {{partnership}} with businessman Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), purchasing a nightclub, R, together, and begin an <b>on-off</b> relationship. During {{a period of}} separation, Roxy becomes pregnant by Jack after a one-night stand. Ronnie, unaware of who the father is, offers to support her sister and they briefly return to Ibiza. After an argument, Roxy visits their father, Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb), to Ronnie's horror. She is relieved when Roxy returns to the Square but horrified when Peggy announces that she and Archie are engaged. Roxy gives birth to a daughter, Amy Mitchell, named after the daughter Ronnie had who died. Ronnie is hurt when she learns of Amy's paternity but eventually forgives them both.|$|E
25|$|The <b>on-off</b> {{phenomenon}} {{is an almost}} invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction {{and the use of}} selegiline hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cylinder}} valves {{are currently}} of the K-valve type, {{which is a}} simple manually operated screw-down <b>on-off</b> valve. In the mid-1960s, J-valves were widespread. J-valves contain a spring-operated valve that is restricts or shuts off flow when tank pressure falls to 300-500 psi, causing breathing resistance and warning the diver {{that he or she}} is dangerously low on air. The reserve air is released by pulling a reserve lever on the valve. J-valves fell out of favor with the introduction of pressure gauges, which allow divers to keep track of their air underwater, especially as the valve-type is vulnerable to accidental release of reserve air and increases the cost and servicing of the valve. J-valves are occasionally still used when work is done in visibility so poor that the pressure gauge cannot be seen, even with a light.|$|E
25|$|The heater's {{failure mode}} is {{typically}} a stress-related fracture of the tungsten wire or {{at a weld}} point and generally occurs after accruing many thermal (power <b>on-off)</b> cycles. Tungsten wire has a very low resistance when at room temperature. A negative temperature coefficient device, such as a thermistor, may be incorporated in the equipment's heater supply or a ramp-up circuit may be employed to allow the heater or filaments to reach operating temperature more gradually than if powered-up in a step-function. Low-cost radios had tubes with heaters connected in series, with a total voltage {{equal to that of}} the line (mains). Some receivers made before World War II had series-string heaters with total voltage less than that of the mains. Some had a resistance wire running the length of the power cord to drop the voltage to the tubes. Others had series resistors made like regular tubes; they were called ballast tubes.|$|E
25|$|Around 1966 AMT {{obtained}} the plastic model rights to Star Trek {{and developed a}} model kit of the Starship Enterprise, beginning a long association between AMT, science fiction and television. The original model of the Enterprise was equipped with battery-operated lights, but even after the lights were deleted, a number of features from the lighted model persisted in the kit, including a removable main deflector assembly which had covered the battery compartment and served as an <b>on-off</b> switch for the lighted model. There were also little indentations in the saucer section where the light bulbs were to be placed. By the 1980s an ongoing series of revisions to the tooling to correct various inaccuracies, which unfortunately created a few new inaccuracies, such as a deflector dish that is far too small and nacelle caps which are shaped incorrectly. There was also a kit of the Klingon D-7 Battlecruiser ship seen on the TV show. It too was lighted in its first couple of issues.|$|E
