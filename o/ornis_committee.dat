40|$|BirdLife International {{has so far}} {{developed}} Action Plans for 37 bird species. The plans, {{although not}} legally binding, have {{been approved by the}} <b>Ornis</b> <b>Committee</b> (EU DG Environment) and most of them have also been endorsed by the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention. Three of the species covered by the SAPs are Mediterranean seabirds: AudouinÂ´s gull (Larus audouinii), Balearic shearwater (Puffinus mauretanicus) and Mediterranean shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis desmarestii). The documents, which have been produced through a participatory process involving tens of experts across the range of the taxa, provide information on the biology, ecology and threats, but the most important feature is the list of specific objectives and actions which are ranked according to their priority and urgency. Alongside actions addressing species-specific conservation needs, such as site protection and management, a number of activities aimed at the conservation of these species are common and refer to wide policies such as land-use planning, fishery, tourist development and pollution control. The documents represent the most up-to-date and scientifically-based source of information for planning and implementing conservation activities across the Mediterranean, to be implemented by both governmental and non governmental organisations...|$|E
50|$|Tschusi {{participated in}} the First International Congress of Ornithologists, held in April 1884 in Vienna by Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, and {{was among the first}} members of the International Ornithological Committee. At the request of Prince Rudolf, Tschusi {{directed}} the ornithological observation stations in Austria-Hungary for eight years, editing the results of the work, and publishing them in the journal of the International Ornithological <b>Committee,</b> <b>Ornis,</b> and in six separate yearbooks. The studies undertaken at the ornithological observation stations, first proposed by R. Blasius and G. von Hayek, had led to the First International Congress of Ornithologists, and greatly influenced the progress of ornithology throughout the world.|$|R
