40|$|In most countries, {{the central}} bank is {{required}} to hold <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> {{as a means of}} providing credibility for the value of the fiat currency. These assets can be in the form of gold, foreign exchange or some <b>other</b> internationally recognised <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> and are held to permit the country to engage in international transactions. Within recent years, cryptocurrencies have been increasingly utilised for international transactions, and {{it is possible that the}} use of these cryptocurrencies might expand in the future. This paper therefore examines the potential role of digital currency balances as part of the portfolio of external assets held by a central bank.

2500|$|In {{the context}} of BoP and {{international}} monetary systems, [...] the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> is the currency or other store of value that is primarily used by nations for their foreign reserves. [...] BoP imbalances tend to manifest as hoards of the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> being amassed by surplus countries, [...] with deficit countries building debts denominated in the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> or at least depleting their supply. Under a gold standard, the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> for {{all members of the}} standard is gold. [...] In the Bretton Woods system, either gold or the U.S. dollar could serve as the <b>reserve</b> <b>asset,</b> though its smooth operation depended on countries apart from the US choosing to keep most of their holdings in dollars.|$|R
50|$|Foreign-exchange {{reserves}} are called <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> {{in the balance}} of payments and are located in the capital account.

In terms of financial <b>assets</b> classifications, the <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> can be classified as Gold bullion, Unallocated gold accounts, Special drawing rights, currency, Reserve position in the IMF, interbank position, other transferable deposits, other deposits, debt securities, loans, equity (listed and unlisted), investment fund shares and financial derivatives, such as forward contracts and options. There is no counterpart for <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> in liabilities of the International Investment Position. Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments.

40|$|This paper reassesses the {{literature}} on international reserves and liquidity from the dual perspectives of micro financial aggregation theory and recent international financial developments. The traditional simple- sum aggregates approach to defining, measuring and estimating demand for international reserves is contrasted with more recent research derived from financial aggregation theory. As in domestic monetary theory, {{it is argued that}} aggregation theory is necessary to identify <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> with different degrees of liquidity and <b>other</b> <b>reserve</b> services. The main conclusion reached is that the financial aggregation is warranted on theoretical, empirical and practical policy grounds because the liquidity problem of adequacy and distribution remains relevant even in the altered international environment of flexible exchange rates and growth of private capital markets. 37 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|Special Drawing Rights (ISO 4217 {{currency}} code XDR,also abbreviated SDR) are supplementary foreign-exchange <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> defined and {{maintained by the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF). The XDR is the unit of account for the IMF, {{and is not a}} currency per se. XDRs instead represent a claim to currency held by IMF member countries for which they may be exchanged. The XDR was created in 1969 to supplement a shortfall of preferred foreign-exchange <b>reserve</b> <b>assets,</b> namely gold and the U.S. dollar.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{reason they}} may see little use {{is that the}} number of XDRs in {{existence}} is relatively few. As of January 2011, XDRs represented less than 4% of global foreign exchange <b>reserve</b> <b>assets.</b> To function well a foreign exchange <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> must have sufficient liquidity, but XDRs, because of their small number, may be perceived to be an illiquid asset. The IMF says, [...] "expanding the volume of official XDRs is a prerequisite for them to play a more meaningful role as a substitute reserve asset." ...|$|R

50|$|The XDR resurfaced in 1978 {{when many}} {{countries}} were wary {{of taking on}} more foreign exchange <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> denominated in U.S. dollars. This suspicion of the dollar precipitated an allocation of 12 billion XDRs {{over a period of}} four years.|$|R
40|$|The global reserve {{system has}} {{returned}} {{to the top of the}} agenda in debates about international monetary reform. Much of the contemporary discussion draws on familiar issues but it has been given a new relevance in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 / 09. One particular focus relates to the composition of international <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> and the role of the dollar. Will the dollar’s preeminent position be eroded and will the dollar be replaced by other international currencies? This paper examines the factors that determine a currency’s international status and assesses various candidate currencies including the euro and the Chinese renminbi. It also analyses the Special Drawing Right (SDR) as an international <b>reserve</b> <b>asset.</b> It concludes that, while there may be advantages in enhancing the SDR ’s role and endeavouring to implement the commitment made in the Second Amendment to the IMF’s Articles of Agreement to encourage it to become the world’s principal international <b>reserve</b> <b>asset,</b> the more likely outcome is that the dollar will retain its status as the main international currency, although it may be joined by other currencies in a multiple currency system. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} reserve regime based {{mainly on}} the US dollar has served the world well for decades, but it faces an uncertain future as the economic hegemony of the United States is increasingly challenged {{by the emergence of}} new economic powers. The regime is flawed fundamentally, moreover, because additions to the supply of the main <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> require the United States to run balance-of-payments deficits, which tend to undermine confidence in the dollar. This paper proposes a transformation of the reserve regime that would cause Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) issued by the International Monetary Fund to become the main <b>reserve</b> <b>asset.</b> An orderly transition would be achieved by creating a Substitution Account into which official holders of dollars could deposit them in exchange for SDRs.

40|$|This paper explores some {{implications}} {{of the use of}} national currencies as international reserves. First, a closed economy overlapping-generations model is developed to derive time-consistent tax and inflation policies for a government that is financing a given stream of expenditures. Second, the effects of allowing a government to hold a foreign currency as a <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> and to have its currency held as a <b>reserve</b> <b>asset</b> abroad are considered. The use of national currencies as currencies of denomination for international lending creates an incentive for the governments whose currencies are used to alter their inflation rates to extract resources {{from the rest of the}} world. When reserves are constrained to be nonnegative the use of national currencies as international reserves raises the inflation rate in reserve issuing countries but does not effect theiInflation rate in reserve holders. The opposite result arises when loans are denominated in the borrowers' currencies. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper explores {{links between}} global {{financial}} imbalances and tensions around reserve currency along with climate change. Currently, risky levels {{of private and}} public debts coexist with vast amounts of savings that "do not know where to go. " Long-term climate-oriented financial products could enhance investors' confidence in low-carbon projects (LCP) and channel to them large amounts of private savings. The paper outlines a financial architecture, the cornerstone of which is an agreement on the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) integrated into a project's appraisal and acting as a surrogate for a carbon price. This SCC would be the value of carbon certificates issued {{by the government and}} delivered to banks to issue credit facilities reducing the risk-adjusted costs of LCPs. These carbon certificates could be gradually transformed into legal <b>reserve</b> <b>assets</b> of the banks after verification of the reality of the projects. Finally, the paper considers whether such certificates would be recognized as genuine international <b>reserve</b> <b>assets,</b> backed by the rising value of carbon over time.
