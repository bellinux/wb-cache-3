40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{a theoretical framework}} of imaging the solidification of molten metal inside a pipe by eddy currents. A complete mathematical model is developed which reveals {{the relationship between the}} solidification inside the pipe and the scattered field measurable outside the pipe. This model is then exploited to develop a numerical algorithm which is able to quickly reconstruct the geometry of the solidification based on the measured scattered field intensity. This framework not only appears to be the first <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>kinds</b> from the metallurgical point of view, but also involves some novel development {{from the point of view}} of electromagnetic computations, which includes in particular the Green functions in multiple layered media...|$|R
