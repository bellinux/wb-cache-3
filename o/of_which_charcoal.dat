40|$|The {{surfaces}} of natural beidellite clay were modified with cationic surfactant, tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide, at different concentrations. The organo-beidellites were analysed using thermogravimetric analysis which shows four thermal oxidation/decomposition steps.

The second step of mass loss between 130 and 400 °C is attributed to the oxidation step of the intercalated organic surfactant {{with the formation of}} charcoal. The third mass loss happens between 400 and 500 °C which is assigned to the loss of hydroxyl groups on the edge of clays and the further oxidation step of charcoal.

40|$|The fate of {{residues}} of five insecticides (chlorpyrifos methyl, fenthion, methidathion, parathion methyl, and quinalphos) {{from the}} treatment on vine {{to the production}} of wine was studied. The influence of clarifying agents (bentonite, charcoal, potassium caseinate, gelatin, polyvinylpolypyrrolidone, and colloidal silicon dioxide) on residue concentrations in wine was also studied. The insecticide residues on grapes showed high decay rates after treatment, with first-order kinetics and half-lives ranging from 0. 97 to 3. 27 days. Grape processing into wine caused considerable residue reduction (> 80 %) for chlorpyrifos methyl, parathion methyl, and quinalphos, moderate reduction (ca. 50 %) for methidathion, and almost no reduction for fenthion. The wine-making technique (with or without maceration) had the same influence on the residue concentrations in wine.

In present paper, a new concept of gas clean technology by bamboo charcoal and TiO 2 with UV light irradiation was proposed. Its system is composed of TiO 2 -coated bamboo charcoal, TiO 2 -coated silica gel and UV lamp. Water vapor is adsorbed by bamboo charcoal and fine particles and airborne bacterium are trapped on the surface of it. Trapped contaminant is degraded by TiO 2 and UV light. In addition, the degradation is promoted by •OH produced by adsorbed water vapor. The air purification sanitization possibility in high efficiency for this system was clarified...|$|R
40|$|Surface archaeological {{deposits}} are {{widespread in}} arid Australia, but have received relatively little attention by researchers owing {{in part to}} the difficulty of providing chronological constraint. Heat-retainer hearths, or earth ovens, are most often found in association with stone artefact deposits, and radiocarbon determinations on charcoal from the hearths are beginning to provide a powerful means for developing a chronology of Holocene occupation of the locations in which they are found. We report on recent archaeological survey results where 865 hearths were identified along a 10 km section of Rutherfords Creek in the Paroo Darling National Park in western New South Wales, Australia. In some areas erosion has exposed clusters of hearths, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> preserve <b>charcoal</b> suitable for radiocarbon age determinations. However, partial excavation of the hearths is required to obtain charcoal and is of concern to Aboriginal custodians and heritage managers charged with protecting the remains of cultural activity. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating provides an alternative method which may be applied in these contexts. We present preliminary OSL dating results for heat-retainer hearth stones, providing age estimates of the last heating event. These results are compared to radiocarbon determinations on charcoal from the same hearths, and provide powerful evidence of the potential of OSL for directly dating the hearths. Analysis of the results from four spatially separated clusters of hearths allow us to determine whether space and time are correlated, that is, whether hearths that are close to one another have similar ages. These results provide an insight into the types of behavioural inferences that can be derived from the surface archaeological record in Australia. 1 page(s...|$|R
