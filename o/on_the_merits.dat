5|$|The High Court has {{dispensed}} with the two-stage process {{and dealt with}} applications <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> at the first stage in cases that involved only pure questions of law and {{where there were no}} factual disputes.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Simms (1803), the Court heard a writ of error, {{brought by}} the United States, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> from a {{criminal}} case in the D.C. circuit court. Simms was the first such case, and after Simms, the next criminal writ of error heard by the Court was More. U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia John T. Mason argued both Simms and More.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2008, U.S. District Court judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York {{dismissed}} the families' suits {{against all the}} U.S. based defendants under the premise of forum non-conveniens. Without ruling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of the cases, and while allowing discovery to continue, Cogan recommended the Brazilian court system as a more appropriate jurisdiction for the dispute.|$|E

5|$|On this basis, an anti-drug {{campaign}} was initiated by Baba lovers in the United States, Europe and Australia. Although the {{campaign was}} largely unsuccessful, it created a wave of new followers, and some of Baba's views {{found their way into}} academic debate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> and dangers of hallucinogens.|$|E
5|$|Scholars today remain divided <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of the {{electronic}} barrier system and {{the efficacy of the}} bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word spread in the form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E

25|$|The Corrie family {{appealed to}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. In September 2007 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the {{dismissal}} on the political question grounds and thus did not rule <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of the suit. The Court found that as the bulldozers were {{paid for by the}} U.S. Government as part of its aid to Israel, the Judicial Branch could not rule <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> of the case without ruling on whether or not the government's financing of such bulldozers was appropriate and that this was a matter not entrusted to the Judicial Branch.|$|E

Cases docketed for argument <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> include those discretionary appeals for which a petition for appeal was granted, appeals of right for which no petition was necessary, and cases within the court's original jurisdiction.|$|E
