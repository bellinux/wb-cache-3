5|$|The {{achievement}} of {{a convoy of}} merchants not only escaping without loss from a French squadron, but {{going so far as}} to attack, drive <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> pursue their would-be predators, was widely hailed as a signal victory.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale of this process varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E
5|$|Nancy decides {{the only}} way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and {{explains}} that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would {{no longer be able to}} wake up. Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's gloved hand <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.|$|E

5|$|Terrified of Santa Anna's {{retribution}} if {{he discovers}} {{that he is}} being paid with his own gold, Montero, at Love's urging, decides to destroy the mine and kill the workers. De La Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so that De La Vega can reclaim Elena. Alejandro sets off, feeling betrayed by Diego's vendetta. De La Vega corners Montero at the hacienda and reveals his identity, but Montero captures him by threatening Elena. As he is taken away, De La Vega tells Elena {{the name of the}} flowers she recognized upon her arrival in California, convincing her that he is her father. She releases De La Vega from his cell and they proceed to the mine, where Alejandro and De La Vega respectively defeat and slay Love and Montero. Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> find the mortally wounded De La Vega. He makes peace with Alejandro before dying, passing the mantle of Zorro to him, and gives his blessings for his marriage to Elena. In a closing sequence they are shown to be living together after rebuilding the De La Vega family señorío with a son named Joaquín, in honor of Alejandro's brother.|$|E
5|$|John Cena and Chris Jericho were {{involved}} in the main rivalry on the Raw brand over the World Heavyweight Championship. At WWE's November Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a legitimate neck injury (that he sustained at SummerSlam) and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of Raw, Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista in a Triple Threat match to earn a title match against Cena at Armageddon. Later that night, Chris Jericho attempted to steal Cena's thunder, claiming that he plans on winning back the title at Armageddon. When World Champion, John Cena could even make his much anticipated return to Raw, he then gave Jericho an opportunity to confront him face-to-face, Cena explained the difference between himself and Jericho, stating that he actually cares about the many members of the WWE Universe. After Jericho once again stated his intention to beat Cena at Armageddon and continued to belittle the WWE Universe, Cena snapped. He proceeded to brutalize Jericho, throwing him against the announce table, bludgeoning him with the steel stairs and locking him into an STFU. On the following week's episode of Raw, Jericho made his presence known {{in much the same way}} as Cena did the week before, addressing the audience as he made his way through the crowd down to the ring. The difference however, was that while Cena welcomed his fans, Jericho made pains to ignore them. He then went on to explain his resentment toward Cena, stating that while away from the WWE since August 2005, Jericho's son grew to be a fan, not of his father, but of John Cena. Now, Jericho hopes to show his son and all of the WWE what a real hero is, by beating Cena for the World Heavyweight Title at Armageddon. Later that night, Cena fought Kane in Raw's main event. Though Jericho attempted to become involved, Cena managed to fight <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> go on to defeat Kane. After the match, Cena chased Jericho, who was attempting to escape. The tables turned, however, when Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Manu emerged to attack Cena, allowing Jericho to lock Cena in the Walls of Jericho.|$|E

25|$|By January 1862, {{with about}} one {{thousand}} Chinese soldiers trained and ready, Ward stated that his unit {{was ready for}} the field – much to the relief of his Shanghai backers, particularly Yang Fang, who had significantly invested both government and private funds into the force's recruitment, arms and supplies. This was timely, as within the same month, the Chung Wang's forces reentered that region with over 120,000 troops, in an attempt to first cut <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> enter and occupy Shanghai.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the church}} shooting, many {{commentators}} questioned the continued {{display of the}} flag at the memorial on the State House grounds. The flag had first been erected in 1962 by the state's Democratic governor in a protest against desegregation. Opposition and attempts to remove the flag began almost immediately. In 1996, then-governor David Beasley pushed to have it removed from the Capitol dome, only to back <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> be driven from office two years later in the political blowback.|$|E

Wearing the mask pushed up onto the forehead while {{out of the water}} or on the surface increases the risk of the mask falling or being knocked off.|$|E

25|$|Greensome (also {{known as}} Scotch Foursomes): also called {{modified}} alternate shot, this is played in pairs; both players tee <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> pick {{the best shot}} as in a scramble. The player who did not shoot the best first shot plays the second shot. The play then alternates as in a foursome. A variant of greensome is sometimes played where the opposing team chooses which of their opponent's tee shots the opponents should use. The player who did not shoot the chosen first shot plays the second shot. Play then continues as a greensome.|$|E

In 1991, the Wusong Floodgate Bridge, a new concrete road bridge was constructed {{to the west of}} Waibaidu Bridge, and the river crossing traffic was mainly diverted onto the new bridge. After the completion of the Bund reconfiguration project, the Wusong Floodgate Bridge will be rendered obsolete by a new tunnel and will be demolished.|$|E
25|$|Care {{needs to}} be taken when {{handling}} hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the hook out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it.

25|$|Since {{most cases}} of AF are {{secondary}} to other medical problems, {{the presence of}} chest pain or angina, {{signs and symptoms of}} hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland) such as weight loss and diarrhea, and symptoms suggestive of lung disease can indicate an underlying cause.

The risk of a blood clot forming in the left atrium, breaking <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> traveling in the bloodstream can be assessed using the CHADS2 score or CHA2DS2-VASc score.|$|E
25|$|The caliph al-Mutawakkil (847-861) {{had created}} a plan of {{succession}} that would allow his sons to inherit the caliphate after his death; he would be succeeded first by his eldest son, al-Muntasir, then by al-Mu'tazz and third by al-Mu'ayyad. In 861 al-Mutawakkil was assassinated {{by a group of}} Turkish military officers, likely with the support of al-Muntasir. During al-Muntasir's short reign (861-862), the Turks pressured him into removing al-Mu'tazz and al-Mu'ayyad from the succession. When al-Muntasir died, the Turkish officers gathered together and decided to install the dead caliph's cousin al-Musta'in on the throne. The new caliph was almost immediately faced with a large riot in Samarra in support of the disenfranchised al-Mu'tazz; the rioters were put down by the military but casualties on both sides were heavy. Al-Musta'in, worried that al-Mu'tazz or al-Mua'yyad could press their claims to the caliphate, first attempted to buy them <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> threw them in prison.|$|E
25|$|Two rival teenage gangs, the Jets (White) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican immigrants), {{struggle}} {{for control of}} the neighborhood somewhere in the Upper West Side of New York City amidst the police (Prologue).

The police chase the Sharks <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them ("Jet Song"). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner ("Something's Coming").|$|E
