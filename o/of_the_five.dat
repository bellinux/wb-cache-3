40|$|ABSTRACT Multitrait-multimethod {{analyses}} {{were used to}} examine <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> convergent and discriminant validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big <b>Five.</b> Phase 1 examined self-reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big <b>Five</b> across three measurement occa-sions. Self-reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big <b>Five</b> traits were stable, but were moderately intercorrelated. Phase 2 examined assessments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big <b>Five</b> across dif-ferent types of informants (self, peer, and parent). Assessments converged across types of informants and, importantly, {{there was no evidence}} <b>of</b> correlation between <b>the</b> Big <b>Five</b> traits across <b>the</b> perspectives <b>of</b> different types <b>of</b> informants. <b>The</b> present results suggest that <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> or-thogonality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big <b>Five</b> traits depends on <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data. A single informant produces Big Five traits that are intercorrelated, whereas diverse informants tend to produce a much more orthogonal structure. Discussion focuses on methodological considerations in examining levels of convergent and discriminant validity and the theoretical implication...|$|R
