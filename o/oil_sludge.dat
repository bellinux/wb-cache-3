40|$|The present {{work has}} two dimensions: {{analytical}} and environmental. On {{the one hand}} we proved that thermogravimetric analysis {{can be used to}} perform fast characterization of <b>oil</b> refinery <b>sludge.</b> To this end, thermogravimetric curves were deconvoluted by using autocatalytic kinetics to take into account acceleratory phases in a thermal degradation performed in oxygen-containing atmosphere or at high heating rates. Based on thermogravimetric results, <b>oil</b> refinery <b>sludge</b> was modeled in terms of various fractions (pseudo-components) which degrade as major oil cuts. On the other hand, as an alternative to landfill, we have seen that Soxhlet extraction allows recovery almost half of the weight of sludge as a mixture of hydrocarbons, similar to gas–oil, which burns without residue. This ensures both, waste inerting and significant reduction in sludge volume. This work was funded by Junta de Andalucía, Spain (Project TEP– 6688) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{affected}} by an <b>oil</b> <b>sludge</b> problem and premature timing chain tensioner failure, which were fixed around 2002-2004. The <b>oil</b> <b>sludge</b> issue {{appears to have been}} caused by issues with the crankcase ventilation system, and while it affected a minority of engines, it could cause complete failure In some cases, neglected maintenance aided in premature failure (missed oil changes or increased intervals between oil changes). Also this engine was plagued with issues regarding the water pump gasket leaking coolant internally and diluting the oil. Such coolant leaks must be addressed instantly or engine failure is imminent.|$|E

40|$|The {{very short}} chain fatty acid has been {{recovered}} from palm <b>sludge</b> <b>oils,</b> {{a by-product of}} palm oil mills using vacuum distillation method. The recovered very short chain fatty acid contains mainly C 6 fatty acid which is a valuable fine chemical in perfume industry. The very short chain fatty acid perfume esters were then synthesised using ethanol with sulphuric acid as catalyst. The reaction conditions were alcohol- very short chain fatty acid volume ratio of 2 : 1, 1. 5 % wt of sulphuric acid at temperature of 120 °C for 20 min. The yield of very short chain fatty acid esters after distillation and purification processes was 50 to 60 % wt. The treated palm <b>sludge</b> <b>oils,</b> after recovering of very short chain fatty acid was subjected to esterification using solid acid catalyst followed by conventional transesterification for biodiesel production.

40|$|In this study, {{biological}} methods (biostimulation and bioaugmentation) {{were used to}} treat <b>oil</b> tank bottom <b>sludge</b> contaminated soils to total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) levels suitable for landfill disposal. The sludge&# 039;s hydrocarbon-degrading microbial capacities were initially compared to those from other contaminated environments using culture-based methods. Results indicated that a fungus, Scedosporium dominated the sludge microbial community. Its application in a nutrient formulation resulted in greater reduction in <b>oil</b> tank bottom <b>sludge</b> viscosity (44 %) and residual soil hydrocarbon compared to hydrocarbonoclastic microorganisms from other sources (26. 7 % reduction in viscosity). Subsequent field-based experiments showed greater TPH reduction (54 %) in fungal-nutrient-treated sludge-waste soils than in naturally attenuated controls (22 %) over 49 days. 16 S ribosomal ribonucleic acid and internal transcribed spacer regionbased polymerase chain reactions and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} analyses showed minimal effects on the microbial communities during this time. TPH reduction to landfill disposal levels occurred at a slower rate after this, falling below the 10, 000 mg kg- 1 legislated TPH disposal threshold earlier in amended samples (91. 2 %; 9, 500 mg kg- 1) compared to the control (82 %; 17, 000 mg kg- 1) in 182 days. The results show that the intrinsic hydrocarbon-degrading microbial capacities in sludge are better suited for sludge degradation than those from other sources. The substantial TPH reduction observed in control samples demonstrates the beneficial effects of natural attenuation with waste soils for <b>oil</b> tank <b>sludge</b> treatment. Microbial capacities in sludge and treated waste soils can therefore be successfully employed for treating <b>oil</b> tank bottom <b>sludge...</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{critical}} that {{the parts of the}} PCV system be kept clean and open, otherwise air flow will be insufficient. A plugged or malfunctioning PCV valve by itself cannot damage an engine; however the blowby will flow up in a reverse fashion up through the crankcase air inlet and if there isn't a separate catch can or oil separator at that inlet, then the blowby will contaminate the air intake manifold. On boosted engines this can be a real problem. A poorly maintained engine's PCV system will eventually contaminate the air intake manifold with <b>oil</b> <b>sludge</b> and if both the pcv valve and the crankcase air inlet are blocked then the crankcase pressure will build to a level that will damage seals and eventually the motor.|$|E

30|$|Studies on {{sandstone}} acidizing using mud acid {{have shown}} that the presence of HCl acid is effective in maintaining the acidic environment and solubility of reaction products. However, use of HCl can cause damage such as corrosion, crude <b>oil</b> <b>sludging</b> and unpredictability of formation minerals. These problems become more severe at high temperatures. Therefore, Shuchart and Gdanski (1996), Shuchart (1997), Shuchart and Buster (1995), Al-Harbi et al. (2011) and Yang et al. (2012) applied organic-HF in sandstone matrix acidizing to overcome the problems. Due to less corrosion rate and retarded nature of organic acids, these acids provide better results especially at elevated temperatures and considered as an excellent alternative compared to mud acid in sandstone acidizing. These acids proved to be very useful when HCl sensitive clay (can cause damage to the formation when reacts with HCl), such as illite, is present in the formation. The two organic acids used commonly are acetic acid and formic acid, combination of HF with HCOOH also known as organic mud acid (Blake and Walter 1999). These acids also possessed some problems similar to mud acid like fast reaction rates and formation of precipitates.|$|R

50|$|The B205 & B235-based 9-5 {{models have}} {{suffered}} {{a high rate of}} engine failures due to engine <b>oil</b> <b>sludge.</b> This primarily affected the 1999-2003 models. Saab refined the engine's positive crankcase ventilation system (PCV) for the 2004 and later model years and required use of fully synthetic oil, virtually eliminating the problem. Additionally, SAAB created update kits to retrofit to the 1999-2003 cars since they cannot be easily modified to accept the 2004 and later system. Mounting complaints by 9-5 owners forced GM to offer an eight-year warranty on the engine in 4-cylinder models for original owners, provided the owner can produce proof that they followed the manufacturer's oil change intervals. Saab recommends the use of Full Synthetic or Synthetic blend oil as a preventative measure.|$|E
