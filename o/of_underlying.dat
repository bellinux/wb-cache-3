5|$|The first {{style of}} Hachijō-daiko {{is thought to}} descend {{directly}} from the style reported by Kizan. This style is called Kumaoji-daiko, named after its creator Okuyama Kumaoji, a central performer of the style. Kumaoji-daiko has two players on a single drum, one of whom, called the , provides the underlying beat. The other player, called the , builds on this rhythmical foundation with unique and typically improvised rhythms. While there are specific types <b>of</b> <b>underlying</b> rhythms, the accompanying player is free to express an original musical beat. Kumaoji-daiko also features an unusual positioning for taiko: the drums are sometimes suspended from ropes, and historically, sometimes drums were suspended from trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} <b>of</b> <b>underlying</b> causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1–2), it indicates that a liver transplant may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised. Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, if a {{position}} is delta neutral (or, instantaneously delta-hedged) its instantaneous change in value, for an infinitesimal {{change in the}} value <b>of</b> the <b>underlying</b> security, will be zero; see Hedge (finance).

That is, its overall value will not change for small changes in the price <b>of</b> its <b>underlying</b> instrument.|$|R

5|$|The {{treatment}} of pneumothorax {{depends on a}} number of factors, and may vary from discharge with early follow-up to immediate needle decompression or insertion of a chest tube.

Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{bit error rate}} (BER) {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>underlay</b> relay cognitive networks with decode-and-forward (DF) relays in arbitrary number of hops over Rayleigh fading with channel estimation errors. In order to facilitate the performance evaluation analytically we derive a novel exact closed-form representation for the corresponding BER which is validated through extensive comparisons with results from Monte-Carlo simulations. The proposed expression involved well known elementary and special functions which render its computational realization rather simple and straightforward. As a result, the need for laborious, energy exhaustive and time-consuming computer simulations can be ultimately omitted. Numerous results illustrate that the performance <b>of</b> <b>underlay</b> relay cognitive networks is, as expected, significantly degraded by channel estimation errors and that is highly dependent upon of both the network topology {{and the number of}} hops.
