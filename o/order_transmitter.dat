The outage probability {{of such a}} system {{is strongly dependent on}} two choices: the order in which the layers are detected, and the rate-allocation strategy at the transmitter. We propose the rate-normalized ordering algorithm, a generalization of the BLAST ordering algorithm that is shown to minimize outage probability.

30|$|The {{communication}} {{security is a}} crucial problem to the wireless communication [18 – 21]. Two classes of methods for wireless {{communication security}} have been exploited. First, the transmitter and receiver have the different secret key and cannot be obtained by each other [21, 22]. Second, we also enhance the physical security in the wireless transmission [20]. In the multi-WFRFT scheme, we can design the communication system with the secrete key of the modulation order α. According to Theorem 1, the transmitter and receiver may exploit different secrete keys to guarantee the wireless communication security. In this case, the order using at the transmitter {{is not necessary to}} be transmitted under wireless channels, it only transmits the encrypted signal and the order employing at the receiver. What is more, we can also employ the antenna array redundancy [19] to enhance the physical security due to the multi-antenna transmitting characteristics of multi-WFRFT. The advantage of the multi-WFRFT is that, {{it is not necessary to}} transmit the <b>order</b> of <b>transmitter</b> under wireless channels. Even if the illegitimate receiver intercepts the signal encrypted by m-WFRFT at the transmitter, the signal cannot be correctly recovered without the order of m-WFRFT.

30|$|Single-carrier {{frequency}} domain equalization (SC-FDE) {{has been shown}} to be an attractive transmission scheme for broadband wireless channels. However, its performance would degrade a lot if the channel is fast time-varying. In this paper, we analyzed the single-carrier fractional Fourier domain equalization (SC-FrFDE) system and applied it to the fast time-varying channel. It can solve the time-varying problem by selecting the optimal fractional Fourier transform order. To this SC-FrFDE system, its transmitter uses chirp-periodic circular prefix to eliminate ISI and this has an evident disadvantage that the receiver need to feedback the optimal fractional Fourier transform <b>order</b> to the <b>transmitter</b> through a feedback channel. To simplify the system, we propose to use zero padding (ZP) at the transmitter. There is already the overlap-add method as ZP in SC-FDE system.

This implementation made it possible to produce an offset 16 -PSK signal constellation whose members were all of equal amplitude and possessed the desired phase relationships to within one tenth of a degree. The signal constellation was highly stable and displayed an average phase drift amongst its members of less than three tenths of a degree after five and one half hours of operation.

40|$|The {{brainstem}} {{nucleus of}} the solitary tract (NTS) holds the first central neurons in major homeostatic reflex pathways. These homeostatic reflexes regulate and coordinate multiple organ systems from gastrointestinal to cardiopulmonary functions. The core {{of many of these}} pathways arise from cranial visceral afferent neurons that enter the brain as the solitary tract (ST) with more than two-thirds arising from the gastrointestinal system. About one quarter of ST afferents have myelinated axons but the majority are classed as unmyelinated C-fibers. All ST afferents release the fast neurotransmitter glutamate with remarkably similar, high-probability release characteristics. Second order NTS neurons receive surprisingly limited primary afferent information with one or two individual inputs converging on single second order NTS neurons. A- and C-fiber afferents never mix at NTS second <b>order</b> neurons. Many <b>transmitters</b> modify the basic glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) often by reducing glutamate release or interrupting terminal depolarization. Thus, a distinguishing feature of ST transmission is presynaptic expression of G-protein coupled receptors for peptides common to peripheral or forebrain (e. g. hypothalamus) neuron sources. Presynaptic receptors for angiotensin (AT 1), vasopressin (V 1 a), oxytocin (OT), opioid (MOR), ghrelin (GHSR 1) and cholecystokinin (CCK) differentially control glutamate release on particular subsets of neurons with most other ST afferents unaffected. Lastly, lipid-like signals are transduced by two key ST presynaptic receptors, the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV 1) and the cannabinoid receptor (CB 1) that oppositely control glutamate release.

The newly developed tablet computer system was also used for load measurement collection during the most recent in vivo study. In <b>order</b> to insure <b>transmitter</b> function in vivo it was necessary to characterize the factors affecting transmission in vivo and develop transmitter and power coil designs that operated reliably. In the past implantable transmitters were noted to operate properly during bench top testing, but often failed after being placed in vivo.

In many species, including man, small arteries such as pial arteries frequently respond to electrical field stimulation with a dilatation which is TTX-resistant. Such dilatations occur even with stimulus parameters of 7 · 5 V/ 60 mA at 0 · 1 ms, 6 Hz. The stimulation parameters required to induce the TTX-resistant response are just above those needed to obtain a purely neurogenic contractile or dilatory response in vessels equipped with a dense net of adrenergic nerves, such as rabbit central ear artery, and, in addition, highly sensitive postsynaptic agr- or beta-adrenergic receptors, such as the buccal segment of the facial vein. This prompted us to characterize further {{the nature of the}} response. It was tested whether the relaxation, despite being TTX-resistant, might be neurogenic in origin. 4 -Aminopyridine, in doses that usually enhance the transmitter release from nerves, did not affect the response. Blockade by a variety of dilator antagonists, the presence of excess amounts of known dilators or removal or emptying of known vasodilator nerves did not inhibit the response. Removal of extracellular calcium did not abolish the response. Therefore, {{it is highly unlikely that}} neuronal release is involved to any measurable extent in this response. The relaxation was not significantly affected by removal of endothelium, blockade of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, or interference with mast cells. At modest stimulatory parameters (12 - 13 V/ 96 - 104 mA at 0 · 1 ms, 7 - 8 V/ 56 - 64 mA at 0 · 3 ms, at 6 Hz) chlorine gas bubbles could be seen forming at the electrode or mounting hook; this gas is toxic to the musculature and relaxes a pre-contracted vessel. At stronger stimulation (rang 12 V/ 96 mA, rang 0 · 3 ms at 6 Hz) a relaxation supervened that was almost prevented by scavengers of oxygen free-radical metabolites. This relaxation was partly irreversible, indicating damage to the contractile elements. We conclude that when studying electrically induced release of vasodilator transmitters in vessels not equipped with an highly effective transmitter/receptor function, even a small rise in stimulatory parameters - in <b>order</b> to enhance <b>transmitter</b> release - causes relaxations that are non-neurogenic. At these and higher parameters the electrical field starts generating chlorine gas, as well as free radicals, which causes relaxation of the vessels. Therefore, stimulation at supramaximal voltage, commonly utilized in such studies to assure an effective neuronal activation, is not suitable when changes in vascular tone are used as a parameter...|$|R
