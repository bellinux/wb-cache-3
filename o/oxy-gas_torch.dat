5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or <b>oxy-gas</b> <b>torch,</b> or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
25|$|The {{oxygen and}} the {{hydrogen}} are led off the electrolysis cell separately and are {{fed into the}} two gas connections of an ordinary <b>oxy-gas</b> <b>torch.</b> This happens in the water torch, which is sometimes used in small torches used in making jewelry and electronics.|$|E

50|$|The bag tube unscrews {{from the}} {{canister}} pack. The diagonal strap clips onto {{a corner of}} the side-pack. The cylinder has a constant-flow valve and a bypass. The thread on top of the cylinder is the same as on an <b>oxy-gas</b> <b>torch</b> oxygen cylinder but the opposite gender, for easy refilling by decanting.|$|E
50|$|Flame {{hardening}} {{is often}} used to harden only a portion of an object, by quickly heating it with a very hot flame in a localized area, and then quenching the steel. This turns the heated portion into very hard martensite, but leaves the rest unchanged. Usually, an <b>oxy-gas</b> <b>torch</b> is used to provide such high temperatures. Flame hardening is a very common surface hardening technique, which {{is often used}} to provide a very wear-resistant surface. A common use is for hardening the surface of gears, making the teeth more resistant to erosion. The gear will usually be quenched and tempered to a specific hardness first, making a majority of the gear tough, and then the teeth are quickly heated and immediately quenched, hardening only the surface. Afterward, {{it may or may not}} be tempered again to achieve the final differential hardness.|$|E
50|$|Gold ore is {{processed}} informally using simple technologies. Ore is first crushed by hand on open rock surface and hammerstones. This work is often done {{by women and}} children. The pulverised ore is concentrated using visual sorting, sieving, gold panning, and by washing on riffle tables made of plastic sheets on heaps of sand. Final gold extraction is accomplished using mercury amalgamation. Mercury is typically burned off using an <b>oxy-gas</b> <b>torch.</b> The gold is sold to local agents, or may be exported directly to major markets for raw gold including India, China, Israel and Lebanon. Gold is also taken across borders into Zimbabwe and Botswana where legislation {{makes it easier to}} sell the gold to small refineries and small mining operations, where it may be incorporated into their own output for reporting purposes. Artisanal mining in South Africa appears to be increasing despite the legal and practical difficulties.|$|E

40|$|Fluor Fernald, Inc. {{has been}} {{progressively}} improving Decontamination and Dismantlement (D&D) at the Department of Energy's Fernald Environmental Management Project by applying {{new technologies and}} better methodologies to the work. Demolition issues existed {{in the past that}} necessitated new or improved solutions to maintain worker safety, protect the environment and accomplish the work in a cost effective manner. Lessons learned from D&D of 80 structures has led to a systematic approach, which can be implemented in various D&D arenas. When facility production was halted, hold-up material and process residues remained in the process piping and components. Over 500, 000 pounds of material was removed by workers who completed the tasks two years ahead of schedule, $ 7 million under budget and with an excellent safety record. This success was the result of detailed planning and irdision of lessons learned as work progressed from facility to facility. Work sequences were developed that reduced airborne contamination. Demolition of structures has been performed at Fernald by carefully selected and qualified subcontractors. Asbestos and lead abatement, equipment, piping and conduit removal, and structural demolition have been completed to progressively higher performance specifications developed by Fluor Fernald based on lessons learned during execution. Safety continues to be the primary consideration in performing potentially hazardous work. Technologies such as hydraulic shears have been developed and used to keep workers away from danger. A new technology, ''Cool Suits,'' has been demonstrated to help prevent heat stress when anti-contamination clothing is required in elevated temperature working conditions. For tall structures, implosion technologies have been employed with progressively improved results, Several other new technologies have been evaluated by Fluor Fernald and applied by subcontractors. The improved technologies included the <b>oxy-gas</b> <b>torch,</b> which uses gasoline instead of acetylene gas, and a vacuum system for asbestos removal of wall insulation. These new methods proved effective and beneficial. Fluor Fernald has integrated demolition activities with waste disposal requirements to enhance overall efficiency. The relatively straight steel configurations required for recycling, and waste acceptance criteria that dictate waste sizes are typically included in the subcontract specifications The progressive improvements by Fluor Fernald have led to cost savings and schedule acceleration without increased risk to workers or the environment. When Fluor Fernald came to the site in 1992, the remediation baseline reflected a completion schedule of 2020 and a cost of $ 7. 2 billion. The current projection is 2008 and $ 4. 2 billion...|$|E
