40|$|Many {{scenes in}} recent TV {{programs}} display rich text {{information on the}} screen as Television <b>Opaque</b> <b>Projectors</b> or telops. Such telops are useful for obtaining information about the scene, or in searching for scenes using keywords. However, the quality of recognized results for telops, especially in Japanese or Chinese, is still poor even using the latest image recognition techniques. In this paper, we propose a method of integrating web search into the recognition process, {{to improve the quality}} of telop recognition results, focusing on Japanese news TV programs. At first, the proposed method recognizes telops in the news scenes by a current image recognition method. Next, it searches news web sites for related articles based on search keywords derived from the intermediate image recognition results. Then, the searched articles are used to build a context-based dictionary for correcting errors in recognized characters. We evaluate the proposed method with actual news TV programs and news web sites. The experimental results demonstrate that retrieved web articles are sufficiently related and effective for correcting the incorrectly recognized characters, even though these search keywords are derived from poor quality image recognition results. It indicates that the integration approach is effective in improving the precision of telop recognition results which is applicable for providing searched or summarized TV scenes along with web text as integrated information. 1...|$|R
50|$|The <b>opaque</b> <b>projector,</b> epidioscope, {{epidiascope}} or episcope is {{a device}} which displays opaque materials by shining a bright lamp onto the object from above. A system of mirrors, prisms and/or imaging lenses {{is used to}} focus {{an image of the}} material onto a viewing screen. Because they must project the reflected light, opaque projectors require brighter bulbs and larger lenses than overhead projectors. Care must be taken that the materials are not damaged by the heat generated by the light source. Opaque projectors are not as common as the overhead projector.|$|E

50|$|Document cameras, {{also known}} as visual presenters, visualisers (in the United Kingdom), digital overheads, or docucams, are {{real-time}} image capture devices for displaying an object to a large audience. Like an <b>opaque</b> <b>projector,</b> a document camera is able to magnify and project the images of actual, three-dimensional objects, as well as transparencies. They are, in essence, high resolution web cams, mounted on arms so as to facilitate their placement over a page. This allows a teacher, lecturer or presenter to write {{on a sheet of}} paper or to display a two or three-dimensional object while the audience watches. Theoretically, all objects can be displayed by a document camera. Most objects are simply placed under the camera. The camera takes the picture which in turn produces a live picture using a projector or monitor. Different types of document camera/visualizer allow great flexibility in terms of placement of objects. Larger objects, for example, can simply be placed {{in front of the camera}} and the camera rotated as necessary,or a ceiling mounted document camera can also be used to allow a larger working area to be used.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{multimedia}} in industries has been extensive, {{as it has}} been effective in increasing productivity and retention rates, where research has shown that people remember 20 % of what they see, 40 % of what they see and hear, but about 75 % of what they see and hear and do simultaneously (Lindstrom, 1994). Multimedia is now permeating the educational system as a tool for effective teaching and learning. With multimedia, the communication of information can be done in a more effective manner and it can be an effective instructional medium for delivering information. Multimedia access to knowledge is one of the possibilities of information and communication technology that has tremendous impact on learning. The instructional media have emerged in a variety of resources, and equipment, which can be used to supplement or complement the teachers efforts in ensuring effective learning by students. It is recognized that conventional media technologies can no longer meet the needs of our teaching and learning processes; as a result they are being replaced by multimedia technology. This technology provides a learning environment that is self-paced, learner-controlled and individualized. Literature Review Multimedia is defined as the combination of various digital media types such as text, images, sound and video, into an integrated multi-sensory interactive application or presentation to convey a message or information to an audience. In other words, multimedia means “an individual or a small group using a computer to interact with information that is represented in several media, by repeatedly selecting what to see and hear next” (Agnew, Kellerman and Meyer, 1996). Reisman (1994) described multimedia as a ray of “computer-driven interactive communication system, which create, store, transmit and retrieve, textual, graphic and auditory networks of information. Multimedia could be interpreted as a combination of data carriers, for example video, CD-ROM, floppy disks, Internet and software in which the possibility for an interactive approach is offered (Smeets, 1996; Jager and Lokman, 1996). Fetterman (1997) also viewed multimedia as those resources used for instruction that include one or more media such as graphics, video, animation, image and sound in addition to textual information. He identified four important characteristics {{of multimedia}} as: Multimedia systems are computer controlled Multimedia systems are integrated The information content must be represented digitally The interface to the final presentation of media. The power of multimedia {{lies in the fact that}} it is multi-sensory, stimulating the many senses of the audience. It is also interactive, enabling the end users of the application to control the content and flow of information. This has introduced important changes in the educational system and impact the way we communicate information to the learners (Neo and Neo, 2000). Ogunbote and Adesoye (2006) expressed that multimedia technology adds new dimension to learning experiences because concepts were easier to present and comprehend when the words are complemented with images and animations. Stating further that it has been established that learners retain more when a variety of senses are engaged in impacting knowledge; and the intensity of the experience aids retention and recall by engaging social, emotional and intellectual senses. The evolution of multimedia has made it very possible for learners to become more involved in their work. With multimedia technologies, they can create multimedia applications as part of their project requirements. This would make them active participant in their own learning process, instead of just being passive learners of the educational content. Reinsman (1994) expressed that multimedia involves processing, storage, generation, manipulation and retention of multimedia system, and the resources could include text files, pictures, video, audio, databases, archives, library catalogs, course notes, relevant links to various websites and easy access to search engines available on the Internet (Shuell and Ferber, 2001). A study by Ubogu (2006) supports the view that multimedia resources facilitate access to all human knowledge, anytime, and anywhere in a friendly, multi-modal, efficient and effective way, by overcoming barriers of distance, language and culture, and by using multiple Internet-connect devices. It is important to say that the use of multimedia technology has great significance in colleges, universities and research institutions in the Western countries. In these countries, the technology is being seen as a key player to development in all ramifications and essential component of education. However, Babajide (2003) identified different types of multimedia communication, some of which include computer hardwares, computer softwares, public address systems, slides, overhead <b>projectors,</b> <b>opaque</b> <b>projectors,</b> videos, cassettes, audiotapes, cassette recorders, flip, time sequence, streamcharts, Diorama still motion pictures among others...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{discover}} what the present trends, practices and beliefs of home economics educators were concerning the teaching of the undergraduate special home economics methods courses. In order to accomplish this purpose it was believed desirable to discover what was being done and what home economics educators believed should be done in these courses if there were no limiting factors. The following were the five areas of concern. 1. What facilities and equipment were available to teachers and students in the special methods courses. 2. What assignments were required in the special methods courses. 3. What content was included in the special methods courses. 4. What instructional materials were used and taught to students in the special methods courses. 5. What methods were used and taught to students in the special methods courses. To obtain the information that this study was based on, a survey questionnaire was constructed, validated and sent to the head of the home economics department in 210 colleges or universities in the United States. The 111 that were returned in usable form were divided into five groups on the basis of the division of the academic year and the number of special methods courses offered. The results obtained from the analysis of these data indicated, in most instances, what the present practices and beliefs of home economics educators were but the responses to the trends and beliefs of these educators regarding what they thought should be done if there were no limiting factors was poor, so any statements concerning trends had to be of a general nature. The facilities and equipment which were available a majority of the time to the home economics education teachers and students included projectors, resource materials and subject-matter files, and the seminar-library room. The respondents desired more access to the instructional materials center, multipurpose laboratory, seminar-library room and the <b>opaque</b> and overhead <b>projectors.</b> A similar group of assignments were believed desirable and were required by the 111 respondents. These included the development of plans, evaluative and illustrative materials and the study of guides, journals, resource materials, textbooks and topics of special interest to the students. Content believed desirable and included by the teacher educators were similar. This content included philosophy, trends, curriculum, evaluation, understanding and working with students, management of and interpreting the department, teaching of special areas and professional obligations. The instructional materials the respondents used and taught students to use included bulletin boards, charts, chalk boards, exhibits, films and filmstrips, flannel boards and posters. The home economics educators believed it was desirable to use the <b>opaque</b> and overhead <b>projectors,</b> photographs and tape recorders more than they were at the time of this study. The methods used by teacher educators which they also taught students to use included development of concepts and generalizations, cooperative planning, discussion methods, demonstrations, evaluation and grading, family centered teaching, field trips, laboratory, lecture, problem solving, reports and role playing. In addition to these, the students were taught to use case studies, home and extended experiences, home visits, sociograms and supervised study. Also included in the methods used by teachers and students were taught to use was learning experiences to develop an understanding of how to develop creativity. It appeared desirable to use some methods more than they were used at the time of this study. These methods included activities to develop creativity, case studies, home and extended experiences, home visits, interviews, problem solving, programmed learning, puppets, supervised study and team teaching...|$|R
