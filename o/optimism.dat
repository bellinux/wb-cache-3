5|$|The Bröste <b>Optimism</b> Award was a Danish prize {{given to}} {{artists who have}} been thought to stand out for their <b>optimism.</b> Björk was awarded in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{economist}} Harry Johnson {{wrote that}} the <b>optimism</b> imparted by Keynes's early life {{is a key to}} understanding his later thinking.|$|E
5|$|Candide, the impressionable and incompetent {{student of}} Pangloss, often tries to justify evil, fails, invokes his mentor and {{eventually}} despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire would see it) of his <b>optimism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{operations}} {{to repair the}} damage to Regehr's legs, doctors gained <b>optimism,</b> but expected he would be unable to skate {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Mourinho {{expressed}} {{delight in}} winning another trophy in his career, while Terry spoke of <b>optimism</b> for Chelsea's future prospects. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino declared {{pride in his}} side despite their defeat.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{folklore}} {{held that}} the bird {{was the last to}} seek shelter before a hurricane, and the first to emerge afterwards. The bird was thus a symbol for danger and <b>optimism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{had been}} granted {{first-class}} status {{in advance of the}} 1882 season. Their maiden season at the top level was described by Wisden as disastrous, but the publication qualified this statement with mild <b>optimism</b> for 1883. The county {{failed to live up to}} this <b>optimism,</b> and although there were a few wins, performances on the whole were poor. Twice between 1882 and 1884 Somerset's opponents scored over 500 runs in an innings against them, and against Lancashire in 1884 they fielded only ten players. Stephen Newton, who had captained the side since 1882, left the club at the end of the 1884 season, and thereafter played all his cricket in London.|$|E
5|$|There is some <b>optimism</b> {{about the}} {{possibility}} of future developments in, for example, renewable energy generation, tourism, and education, and after declines in the 20th century the population has stabilised since 2003, although it is ageing.|$|E
5|$|American Patriots {{reacted to}} {{news of the}} battle with <b>optimism.</b> Especially after Burgoyne's Indian screen left him, small groups of local Patriots began to emerge to harass the fringes of British positions. Interestingly, a {{significant}} portion of Stark's force returned home and did not again become influential in the campaign until appearing at Saratoga on October 13 to complete the encirclement of Burgoyne's army.|$|E
5|$|Everything ThatHappens WillHappen Today is {{the second}} album made in {{collaboration}} between DavidByrne and BrianEno, released on August 18, 2008, by TodoMundo. The album explores themes of humanity versus technology and <b>optimism</b> in spite of bleak circumstance through the blending of electronic and gospelmusic. Critical reception was largely positive and the album received awards for both the musical content {{as well as the}} packaging and technical production.|$|E
5|$|Hinman {{announced}} on April 20, 2009 {{his intention to}} step down as leader. He remained the party's leader in an interim capacity until the leadership convention. Former Canadian Federation of Independent Business provincial director Danielle Smith and Mark Dyrholm, a chiropractor in Calgary, announced their candidacy at the June convention. The party viewed the leadership campaign with <b>optimism,</b> announcing that its membership was growing rapidly as Albertans grew increasingly frustrated with the Stelmach government's performance.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016 {{there was}} a rare {{sighting}} of a Sumatran Rhino in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of Borneo. The last time {{there was a}} Sumatran Rhino in the Kalimantan area was approximately 40 years ago. This <b>optimism</b> was met with despair as that very specific Sumatran Rhino was found dead several weeks later after the sighting. The reason of the death is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|In the 70s, AI {{was subject}} to critiques and {{financial}} setbacks. AI researchers had failed to appreciate {{the difficulty of the}} problems they faced. Their tremendous <b>optimism</b> had raised expectations impossibly high, and when the promised results failed to materialize, funding for AI disappeared. At the same time, the field of connectionism (or neural nets) was shut down almost completely for 10 years by Marvin Minsky's devastating criticism of perceptrons.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 2007, Maturi made a {{move that}} {{surprised}} many when he hired Tubby Smith after he resigned from the University of Kentucky {{to be the next}} head Gopher basketball coach. Smith's name recognition and winning reputation gave the program a new <b>optimism,</b> something it badly needed to counter its dwindling fan interest.|$|E
5|$|Other {{elements}} of the Filipino value system are <b>optimism</b> about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.|$|E
5|$|Scandal erupted when Teller (and his {{associate}} Lowell Wood) {{were accused}} of deliberately overselling the program and perhaps had encouraged the dismissal of a laboratory director (Roy Woodruff) who had attempted to correct the error. His claims led to a joke which circulated in the scientific community, that a new unit of unfounded <b>optimism</b> was designated as the teller; one teller was so large that most events had to be measured in nanotellers or picotellers.|$|E
5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the novella, in which Candide finally dismisses his tutor's <b>optimism,</b> leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead. This element of Candide {{has been written about}} voluminously, perhaps above all others. The conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is contentious.|$|E
5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws. Thus Candide derides <b>optimism,</b> for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events {{with no apparent}} redeeming qualities.|$|E
5|$|The myth was created, with Rommel's participation, as a {{component}} of Nazi propaganda to praise the Wehrmacht and instill <b>optimism</b> in the German public. Starting in 1941, it was picked up and disseminated in the West by the British war-time press as the Allies sought to explain their continued inability to defeat the Axis forces in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Where would {{science fiction}} be without the Statue of Liberty? For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted arth—giants have uprooted it, aliens {{have found it}} curious... the symbol of Liberty, of <b>optimism,</b> {{has become a symbol}} of science fiction's pessimistic view of the future.|$|E
5|$|After the {{six years}} of absolutism that {{followed}} Ferdinand's return to the throne on 1 January 1820, Rafael del Riego initiated an army revolt {{with the intent of}} restoring the 1812 Constitution. By March, the king was forced to agree, but by September 1823, after an unstable period, a French invasion supported by an alliance of the major powers had removed the constitutional government. The last prints were probably not completed until after the Constitution was restored, though certainly before Goya left Spain in May 1824. Their balance of <b>optimism</b> and cynicism makes it difficult to relate them directly to particular moments in these rapidly moving events.|$|E
5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed <b>optimism</b> that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having lost}} 5–0 to the West Indies {{in each of}} the two most recent series, England had grounds for <b>optimism</b> leading up to the Test series: the West Indian team was ageing and lacked a leg-spinner; and the England team had home advantage. England's morale was also surging {{following}} good performances in the shorter form of the game: the team had reached the World Cup Final the previous year, losing to Australia, and were expected to do well in One Day International cricket, even against the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 the Thai government’s {{department}} of irrigation met {{the demands of}} Living River Siam and the Assembly of the Poor with a promise to halt all future dam projects, which was accepted with cautious <b>optimism.</b> To circumvent the issue of domestic damming, in 2007 the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) announced {{plans to build a}} series of dams on Burma's Salween River along its border with Thailand. Living River Siam opposed this plan, citing the threat of environmental destruction in Burma's Shan, Karenni, and Karen states as well as Mae Hong Son Province.|$|E
5|$|Keynes's <b>optimism</b> {{was also}} cultural, in two senses: {{he was of}} the last {{generation}} raised by an empire still {{at the height of}} its power, and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation {{to each other and to}} life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.|$|E
5|$|Living Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus {{micro-organisms}} {{have been}} found in Lake Vostok's deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species. This suggests the presence of a deep biosphere utilizing a geothermal system of the bedrock encircling the subglacial lake. There is <b>optimism</b> that microbial life in the lake may be possible despite high pressure, constant cold, low nutrient input, potentially high oxygen concentration and an absence of sunlight. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may also harbor lakes or oceans below a thick crust of ice. Any confirmation of life in Lake Vostok could strengthen the prospect for the presence of life on icy moons.|$|E
5|$|On {{the kickoff}} {{following}} the field goal, Georgia head coach Mark Richt ordered an unorthodox onside kick. Surprised by the unexpected play, the Virginia Tech coverage team {{was unable to}} recover the ball, which was leapt upon by the kicker, Brian Mimbs. With a new chance at offense {{and a sense of}} <b>optimism</b> triggered by the successful onside kick, Georgia drove down the field. Aided by 20yards in penalties against Virginia Tech, the drive resulted in a six-yard touchdown pass to Martrez Milner. The touchdown and extra point boosted Georgia's morale and cut the score to 21–13, Virginia Tech leading by eight.|$|E
5|$|Peugeot's {{final year}} as Prost's engine {{supplier}} in 2000 saw some <b>optimism,</b> Prost hiring his 1991 Ferrari teammate Jean Alesi {{to drive the}} lead car and German Nick Heidfeld, who had won the 1999 Formula 3000 championship, to partner him. The season proved to be yet another disastrous one, with the AP03 proving to be unreliable and ill handling. Things weren't helped when both drivers collided {{with each other in}} the Austrian Grand Prix. Newly hired technical director Alan Jenkins was fired midway through the year. Prost restructured the team, hiring Joan Villadelprat as the managing director and replacing Jenkins with Henri Durand as the team's new technical director.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Öhlund began {{experiencing}} inflammation in his right knee. The Lightning placed him on injured reserve on October 4, 2011; a week later, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees. After there was <b>optimism</b> he was close to returning to the lineup in December, he suffered a setback with his left knee and underwent further surgery in February 2012. During his recovery, he told reporters with Swedish newspaper Expressen that he was unsure whether he could continue playing.|$|E
5|$|Reagan {{ran against}} Democratic {{incumbent}} Jimmy Carter and independent candidate John B. Anderson. He was praised by supporters {{for running a}} campaign of upbeat <b>optimism.</b> Aided by the Iran hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation, Reagan won the election in a massive landslide. The 1980 presidential election {{marked the beginning of}} the Reagan Era, and signified a conservative realignment in national politics. At 69 years old, Reagan became the oldest person ever elected U.S. president until 2017, when President Donald Trump was sworn in at the age of 70.|$|E
5|$|Some {{essential}} {{features of}} Modernisme were: an anticlassical language inherited from Romanticism with {{a tendency to}} lyricism and subjectivity; the determined connection of architecture with the applied arts and artistic work that produced an overtly ornamental style; the use of new materials from which emerged a mixed constructional language, rich in contrasts, that sought a plastic effect for the whole; {{a strong sense of}} <b>optimism</b> and faith in progress that produced an emphatic art that reflected the atmosphere of prosperity of the time, above all of the esthetic of the bourgeoisie.|$|E
5|$|Stieger, Voracek, and Formann {{recommend}} that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest {{it may be useful}} to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic <b>optimism,</b> feedback sensitivity, self-regulation, and defensiveness.|$|E
5|$|The mid-1970s saw the {{beginning}} of a new wave of Canadian comics, one in which the creators chose to remain in Canada, rather than seeking their fortunes south of the border. Richard Comely's Captain Canuck appeared in July 1975, the first appearance of a non-satirical superhero in Canada since the 1940s. During the 1950s and 1960s, the idea of native comics seemed unattainable to Canadian kids, and the appearance of Captain Canuck gave these kids the <b>optimism</b> to make their own. This was followed up with James Waley's more professional, newsstand-distributed Orb, which featured a number of talents that would later take part in the North American comics scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} about Dylan, a {{depressed}} college student who attempts suicide. He survives due to unlikely events, but is soon visited by a demon who explains he spared Dylan's life. In exchange, Dylan {{will be allowed to}} live one more month for every person he kills. Brubaker said he chose to make the character young because he wanted to include the <b>optimism</b> of youth. The comic examines the consequences of vigilante violence and its effects on Dylan’s loved ones. The story debuted to mostly positive reviews. Some reviewers felt it was too similar to Brubaker and Phillips' previous collaborations.|$|E
5|$|Voltaire {{develops}} no formal, systematic philosophy for {{the characters}} to adopt. The {{conclusion of the}} novel may be thought of not as a philosophical alternative to <b>optimism,</b> but as a prescribed practical outlook (though what it prescribes is in dispute). Many critics have concluded that one minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy. For instance, a number believe that Martin is treated sympathetically, and that his character holds Voltaire's ideal philosophy—pessimism. Others disagree, citing Voltaire's negative descriptions of Martin's principles and {{the conclusion of the}} work in which Martin plays little part.|$|E
5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for <b>optimism</b> as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
