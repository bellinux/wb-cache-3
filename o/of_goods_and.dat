40|$|Understanding {{the nuances}} <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil in {{literary}} representation {{has been a}} trend in the neo-academic circle. Within the framework of Leadership Studies, the present paper locates Shakespeare’s Macbeth (1606) central {{to the understanding of}} the concepts <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil in leading. The first section critically introduces the concepts <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil and their place in leading and Kant’s view on <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil. The second section gives a short summary of the plot of the play Macbeth. In the third and fourth section I argue that Macbeth is a potential text for an emphatic understanding <b>of</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> evil in leading; I highlight the ethical dimension in leading and leadership. It not only argue that the character of Macbeth can be represented as prototypes of understanding the dynamics of righteous and evil leaders, I also suggest that teaching ethical issues of leadership can be strengthened by an analysis of the character of Macbeth. The last section draws parallels with real-life case bringing out the consequences of unethical leading. ...|$|R
