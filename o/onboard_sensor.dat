25|$|The IIR sensor has a stabilised mount {{so that it}} can {{maintain}} a target within its field of view. Up to 200 targets can be simultaneously tracked using one of several different modes; Multiple Target Track (MTT), Single Target Track (STT), Single Target Track Ident (STTI), Sector Acquisition and Slaved Acquisition. In MTT mode the system will scan a designated volume space looking for potential targets. In STT mode PIRATE will provide high precision tracking of a single designated target. An addition to this mode, STT Ident allows for visual identification of the target, the resolution being superior to CAPTOR's. Both Sector and Slave Acquisition demonstrate the level of sensor fusion present in the Typhoon. When in Sector Acquisition mode PIRATE will scan a volume of space under direction of another <b>onboard</b> <b>sensor</b> such as CAPTOR. In Slave Acquisition, off-board sensors are used with PIRATE being commanded by data obtained from an AWACS for example. When a target is found in either of these modes, PIRATE will automatically designate it and switch to STT.|$|E

2500|$|The author Renato Vesco {{revived the}} wartime {{theory that the}} foo fighters were a Nazi secret weapon in his work Intercept UFO, reprinted in a revised English edition as Man-Made UFOs: 50 Years Of Suppression in 1994. Vesco claims that the foo fighters were in fact a form of ground-launched, {{automatically}} guided, jet-propelled flak mine called the Feuerball (Fireball). This device, supposedly operated by special SS units, [...] resembled a tortoise shell in shape, and it flew by means of gas jets that spun like a Catherine wheel around the fuselage. Miniature klystron tubes inside the device, {{in combination with the}} gas jets, created the characteristic glowing spheroid appearance of the foo fighters. A crude form of collision avoidance radar ensured the craft would not crash into another airborne object, and an <b>onboard</b> <b>sensor</b> mechanism would even instruct the machine to depart swiftly if it was fired upon. The purpose of the Feuerball, according to Vesco, was twofold. The appearance of this weird device inside a bomber stream would (and indeed did) have a distracting and disruptive effect on the bomber pilots. Also, Vesco alleges that the devices were also intended to have an [...] "offensive" [...] capability. Electrostatic discharges from the klystron tubes would, he stated, interfere with the ignition systems of the engines of the bombers, causing the planes to crash. Although there is no hard evidence to support the reality of the Feuerball drone, this theory has been taken up by other aviation/ufology authors, and it has even been cited by some as the most likely explanation for the phenomena -- in at least one recent TV [...] "documentary" [...] on Nazi Secret Weapons.|$|E

The Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking System (PAEB) can utilize <b>onboard</b> <b>sensors</b> to detect pedestrians and make safety related actions so it benefits the individual vehicle and the pedestrians detected by its PAEB. To further improve pedestrian safety, the idea for integrating the capabilities of V 2 V and PAEB (V 2 V-PAEB) has been proposed, which allows the information of pedestrians detected by <b>onboard</b> <b>sensors</b> of a vehicle to be shared in the V 2 V network. A V 2 V-PAEB enabled vehicle uses not only its <b>onboard</b> <b>sensors,</b> but also received V 2 V messages from others to detect potential collisions with pedestrians and make better safety related decisions. In this paper, a Matlab/Simulink based simulation model of V 2 V-PAEB system is presented for demonstrating the proper architecture and information processing processes, and for providing the quick start of developing a better simulation model of V 2 V-PAEB.
