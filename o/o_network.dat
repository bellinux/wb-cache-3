40|$|Density {{functional}} modeling {{is used to}} show that germanium oxidation occurs by the diffusion of network oxygens across the film as peroxyl bridges, not by molecular O₂ interstitials (O₂*). The smaller O bond angle of GeO₂ leads to lower order rings in the amorphous GeO₂ network than in SiO₂. This leads to narrower interstitial diffusion channels, and less dilation of the interstitial volume around the transition state. This raises the migration barrier of O₂∗ in GeO₂, so that the overall diffusion energy of O₂∗ in GeO₂ is now {{higher than that of}} a network O interstitial.

40|$|Abstract. A BN 2 <b>O</b> <b>network</b> is a Bayesian network {{having the}} {{structure}} of a bipartite graph with all edges directed from one part (the top level) toward the other (the bottom level) and where all conditional probability tables are noisy-or gates. In order to perform efficient inference, graphical transformations of these networks are performed. The efficiency of inference is proportional to the total table size of tables corresponding to the cliques of the triangulated graph. Therefore in order to get efficient inference it is desirable to have small cliques in the triangulated graph. We analyze existing heuristic triangulation methods applicable to BN 20 networks after transformations using parent divorcing and tensor rank-one decomposition and suggest several modifications. Both theoretical and experimental results confirm that tensor rank-one decomposition yields better results than parent divorcing in randomly generated BN 2 O networks that we tested. ...|$|E

The dimethyl phosphate anion, {{which is the}} simplest model for the nucleic acid phosphodiester moiety, exhibits many of the spectral complexities of DNA and RNA and has previously resisted a complete and consistent vibrational analysis.

Long term monitoring of reefs across the Fiji Islands {{for nine years}} included mass temperature-related coral bleaching events, cyclones, and Crown-of-thorns seastar(COTS) outbreaks. Survey protocols used variants of Point-Intercept Transects for coral cover, and Belt Transects for indicator fish and invertebrate populations. Percentage hard coral cover was used for regional and time-line comparisons. More detailed protocols allowed comparisons by coral life-form category. Data was compiled through the Coral Reef Initiative for the South Pacific (CRISP). Coral cover fell dramatically in 2000 – 2002 after two mass bleaching events, plus regional COTS outbreaks, but recovered to pre-bleaching levels by 2005. Cyclones affected localised coral health in shallow waters, but caused no large scale or permanent damage, {{and in some cases}} served coral recovery by lowering water temperatures and clearing new substrate for settlement.

O modelo {{consiste}} em duas regiões com (n/ 2) bancos em cada, onde a interligação entre eles ocorre através e depósitos interbancários. Cada banco está sujeito a corrida bancária, ou devido a um choque negativo de agentes impacientes, ou devido a contaminação da corrida de um banco pertencente a infraestrutura bancária. Os bancos podem tentar eliminar a possibilidade de contágio ao fazer um número alto de inter-ligações. Para isso, é necessário uma coordenação entre todos os bancos. Se um banco não se prevenir de um contágio, ele impõe a todos os outros a possibilidade de contágio no pior cenário. Há duas regiões bem deﬁnidas de equilíbrio de nash simétrico com network estável, uma na qual todos os bancos se previnem do cenário de contágio no pior cenário e a outra na qual nenhum banco se previne. Devido ao problema de coordenação, o equilíbrio com contágio no pior cenário pode ocorrer mesmo sendo pareto dominado pelo equilíbrio sem contágio. Sob certas condições, o equilíbrio com contágio ocorre com um network pareto eﬁciente. Neste caso <b>o</b> <b>network</b> eﬁciente é diferente do network mais resiliente ao contágio.
