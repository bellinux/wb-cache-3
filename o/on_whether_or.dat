5|$|Contraceptive sponges {{combine a}} barrier with a spermicide. Like diaphragms, they are {{inserted}} vaginally before intercourse {{and must be}} placed over the cervix to be effective.

The sponge can be inserted up to 24hours before intercourse and must be left in place for at least six hours afterward.

Versions of the story differ based <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the character of the helper is included. The helper, in some cases, tells the princess to pretend as though she slept badly. In other versions, the helper does not appear at all, and the princess decides to lie all on her own.|$|E
5|$|Set during autumn, Through the Looking-Glass {{begins with}} Alice indoors as she {{plays with the}} kittens of her pet cat, Dinah.

Grabbing and shaking the Red Queen, Alice awakens back indoors, holding one of the kittens. The novel concludes with Alice's speculation <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not it was her dream or the Red King's.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spectral}} {{classification of}} these distant supernovae {{was performed by}} Rudolph Minkowski in 1941.

Zwicky later proposed additional types III, IV, and V, although these are no longer used and now appear {{to be associated with}} single peculiar supernova types. Further sub-division of the spectra categories resulted in the modern supernova classification scheme.|$|E

5|$|Transportation {{within the}} city, {{as well as}} the rest of Hampton Roads is served by a {{regional}} bus service, Hampton Roads Transit. An extension of The Tide light rail system from Norfolk to the oceanfront is currently being studied. For years, Virginia Beach residents have debated <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not to extend The Tide from Norfolk into its borders with the apparent divide falling between younger and older residents and the potential cost to Virginia Beach taxpayers. In November 2016, residents voted on a referendum proposing that would extend the light rail from Norfolk to Virginia Beach with 57% against the rail extension and 43% for the extension.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{was born}} and raised in Crystal City, Missouri, a small town 45 miles south of St. Louis where he excelled at {{basketball}} from an early age. He did well academically and was an all-county and all-state basketball player in high school. He was offered 75 college scholarships, but declined them all to attend Princeton University. He earned a gold medal as a member of the 1964 Olympic basketball team and was the NCAA Player of the Year in 1965, when Princeton finished third in the NCAA Tournament. After graduating in 1965, he attended Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship, delaying a decision for two years <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not to play in the National Basketball Association (NBA).|$|E

5|$|By late 1962 a {{decision}} <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not to deploy Zeus was looming. Bell began considering {{a replacement for}} the Zeus missile that would operate at much shorter ranges, and in October, sent out study contracts to three contractors to be returned in February. Even before these were returned, in January 1963 McNamara announced that the construction funds allocated for Zeus would not be released, and the funding would instead be used for {{development of a new}} system using the latest technologies. The name Nike-X was apparently an ad hoc suggestion by Jack Ruina, the director of ARPA, who was tasked with presenting the options to the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). With the ending of Zeus, the ZMAR radar effort was renamed MAR, and plans for an even more powerful version, MAR-II, became {{the central part of the}} Nike-X concept.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Ettelson became locally {{famous for}} a debate {{he had at}} Nashville's Ellis Auditorium with Scopes Trial lawyer Clarence Darrow <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not {{religion}} was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against. Friction between Ettelson and some board members {{came to a head}} in 1937, when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{signed the}} Reichskonkordat (Reich Concordat), a {{treaty with the}} Vatican that {{required}} the regime to honour the independence of Catholic institutions and prohibited clergy from involvement in politics. However, the regime continued to target the Christian churches {{and to try to}} weaken their influence. Throughout 1935 and 1936, hundreds of clergy and nuns were arrested, often on trumped up charges of currency smuggling or sexual offenses. Goebbels widely publicised the trials in his propaganda campaigns, showing the cases in the worst possible light. Restrictions were placed on public meetings, and Catholic publications faced censorship. Catholic schools were required to reduce religious instruction and crucifixes were removed from state buildings. Hitler often vacillated <b>on</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> not the Kirchenkampf (church struggle) should be a priority, but his frequent inflammatory comments on the issue were enough to convince Goebbels to intensify his work on the issue; in February 1937 he stated he wanted to eliminate the Protestant church.|$|E
