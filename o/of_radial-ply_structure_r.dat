40|$|Abstract: Tire {{deflection}} {{is a key}} parameter {{and many}} equations have been developed based on it to evaluate the tractive performance <b>of</b> bias-ply and <b>radial-ply</b> tires. As deflections for a given tire size, inflation pressure and vertical load are significantly different between bias-ply and radial-ply tires, {{this study was conducted}} to predict deflection () <b>of</b> <b>radial-ply</b> tire based on section width (b), overall unloaded diameter (d), inflation pressure (P) and vertical load (W). For this purpose, deflection <b>of</b> four <b>radial-ply</b> tires with different section width and/or overall unloaded diameter were measured at five levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load. Results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tires No. 1, 2 and 3 were utilized to determine multiple variables regression model and results of deflection measurement for radial-ply tire No. 4 were used to verify selected model. The paired samples t-test results showed that the difference between the deflection values predicted by model and measured by test apparatus were not statistically significant and to predict deflection <b>of</b> <b>radial-ply</b> tire based on section width, overall unloaded diameter, inflation pressure and vertical 2 load the multiple variables regression model = 75. 67 + 0. 104 b- 0. 107 d- 0. 758 P + 3. 519 W with R = 0. 986 can be strongly recommended.

5000|$|Criticism of the {{handling}} of early examples in the UK led to the fitting as standard <b>of</b> <b>radial-ply</b> tyres on the larger-engined version {{in place of the}} more conventional (in the UK at that time) cross-ply tyres with which all versions were shod at the 1966 launch, and the retro-fitting <b>of</b> <b>radial-ply</b> tyres to early examples addressed the tendency of the rear wheels to slide uncontrollably in wet weather, justifying in the process Ford's investment in a new and relatively sophisticated rear suspension arrangement for the Mark IVs. [...] Even after that a contemporary nevertheless opined that the ride involved a certain amount of 'float', and reported that the nose-heavy handling called for a 'strong driver', a problem which the more expensive Zodiac and Executive versions mitigated through the fitting as a standard feature of power assisted steering. Cost constraints precluded adding power assisted steering for the Zephyr, but during its production run the steering ratio was lowered which reduced the strength needed to change direction by increasing the number of turns between locks from 5.5 to an even higher 6.4. [...] Another production modification for the 4-cylinder Zephyr involved redesigning the valve gear in order to eliminate the need on the early Mk IVs for frequent tappet adjustments.|$|R
