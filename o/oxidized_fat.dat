40|$|Purpose of review: Lipid {{oxidation}} is {{the cause}} of important deteriorative changes in chemical, sensory and nutritional food properties. In particular, the question of whether <b>oxidized</b> <b>fats</b> in the diet may be detrimental to health is nowadays of the upmost concern, but finding an answer is not easy and requires careful consideration of different aspects of lipid oxidation. Recent findings: In this review, the most recent works on the formation, nature and evaluation of oxidized dietary lipids are addressed; important issues such as the difficulties encountered in estimating their intake and the relationships between oxidants and antioxidants in the diet are discussed, and the latest studies on health implications of oxidized lipids are summarized. Summary: The current literature reflects various important points. At present, there is no information on the intake of <b>oxidized</b> <b>fats,</b> which is essential to know if the amount of oxidized lipids in normal diets is sufficient to cause the physiological effects claimed. Recently, relevant advances in analytical methodologies for quantitation of specific oxidation compounds have been reported, although their application to improve the analytical definition of the oxidized substrate used in nutritional studies is still a goal to be reached. Alternatively, {{one of the most promising}} current tendencies in this field is the study of the molecular targets by which dietary oxidized lipids can influence health.

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{administration}} of oxidized oils increases gene expression and activities of various enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and stress response in the liver of rats and guinea pigs. As these genes are controlled by nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 -like 2 (Nrf 2), we investigated the hypothesis that feeding of oxidized fats causes an activation of that transcription factor in the liver which in turn activates the expression of antioxidant, cytoprotective and detoxifying genes. Methods: Twenty four crossbred pigs were allocated to two groups of 12 pigs each and fed nutritionally adequate diets with either fresh rapeseed oil (fresh fat group) or oxidized rapeseed oil prepared by heating at a temperature of 175 °C for 72 h (<b>oxidized</b> <b>fat</b> group). Results: After 29 days of feeding, pigs of the <b>oxidized</b> <b>fat</b> group had a markedly increased nuclear concentration of the transcription factor Nrf 2 and a higher activity of cellular superoxide dismutase and T 4 -UDP glucuronosyltransferase in liver than the fresh fat group (P < 0. 05). In addition, transcript levels of antioxidant and phase II genes in liver, like superoxide dismutase 1, heme oxygenase 1, glutathione peroxidase 1, thioredoxin reductase 1, microsomal glutathione-S-transferase 1, UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 A 1 and NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 in the liver were higher in the <b>oxidized</b> <b>fat</b> group than in the fresh fat group (P < 0. 05).

40|$|Over {{the past}} quarter century obesity has reached {{epidemic}} proportions in many developed countries. Exercise is one of the behavioral approaches to curbing weight gain or losing body fat. We reviewed the data on (1) magnitude of weight and fat loss when exercise is implemented without any changes in food intake, (2) necessary volumes and intensities of exercise to accomplish and sustain weight and fat loss, (3) effects of obesity on spontaneous physical activity and other forms of energy expenditure, (4) effects of obesity and aerobic fitness on the capacity to <b>oxidize</b> <b>fat,</b> and (5) the effects of exercise on the appetite. When ex-ercise is implemented without any changes in food intake, a daily expenditure of 400 Kcal produces a fat loss that is about one third of that expected on the basis of caloric deficit incurred by exercise. Oxidation of fat is negatively influenced by exercise intensity so that for an appreciable fat loss it would be necessary to exercise for long periods of time. Genetics and low aerobic fitness can also play a negative role. Obesity is associated with low levels of spontaneous physical activity and reduced capacity to <b>oxidize</b> <b>fat.</b> Aerobic training can enhance the capacity to <b>oxidize</b> <b>fat</b> by increasing the volume and function of mitochondria in skeletal muscles. Exercise is associated with short-term suppression of hunger and a failure to compensate for exercise energy expenditure during the hours to several days following exercise.

40|$|The most {{important}} form of fat spoilage is oxidative rancidity, {{produced by the}} action of atmospheric oxygen upon the fat. The effects of oxidation on edible fats include loss of palatability, destruction of contained vitamins (the fat-soluble A, D and E), and bleaching of the natural pigments, which are often of a carotenoid nature. In addition, <b>oxidized</b> <b>fats</b> may exhibit toxic properties. It is therefore evident that the prevention and detection of oxidative rancidity are problems of considerable practical significance. An oil or fat consists of a complex mixture of glycerides, these being combinations of glycerol with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. Saturated fatty acids are ordinarily stable in air but may oxidize to some extent under extreme conditions, as, for instance, {{under the influence of the}} peroxides present in <b>oxidizing</b> <b>fat</b> mixtures. Fatty acids react more readily with oxygen as the number of double bonds in the molecule increases. For example, linoleic acid oxidizes more rapidly than oleic acid under the same conditions. Ease of oxidation is governed in some measure by molecular structure; thus oleic acid is less resistant than its geometric isomer, elaidic. The insertion of a hydroxyl group into oleic acid to form ricinolelc acid likewise results in a decrease in susceptibility. It is also probable that the position of a double bond in the chain relative to other unsaturated centres and to the carboxyl group will influence its rate of oxidation. [ [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} often related to {{metabolic}} alterations occurring in diverse tissues upon obesity development {{and its associated}} disorders. The liver {{plays a key role}} in the maintenance of the body’s lipid and glucose homeostasis and is particularly sensitive to changes in the oxidative balance. Such changes might contribute to the occurrence of inflammatory processes and metabolic stresses in affected living organisms. Coenzyme Q is an effective lipid soluble antioxidant, which counteracts lipid peroxidation, directly or through the restoration of vitamin E. It also interacts with superoxide anions or other reactive oxygen species. The aim of this work was to analyze the inflammatory, oxidative and metabolic stresses in diverse models of obesity and its associated disorders in order to better understand the potential role of lipid peroxidation in that context. The relevance of a nutritional supplementation with coenzyme Q was assessed in the control of certain metabolic alterations occurring upon obesity. Experimental work was first conducted in normal mice fed a control diet, and thereafter, in several models of diabetes, inflammation and obesity, including models associated with a high-fat diet feeding of the animals, with a main focus on the liver. One of the key conclusions of this work is that lipid peroxidation is not a prerequisite for the development of obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. Indeed, protection of tissue lipid peroxidation with high vitamin E levels does not interfere with the development of obesity or glucose intolerance upon a high-fat diet feeding of mice. Modulation of the high-fat diet by decreasing the vitamin E levels, by supplementing it with fructose or with thermally <b>oxidized</b> <b>fat</b> lead to diverse metabolic alterations such as increased lipid peroxidation (upon decreased vitamin E levels in the high-fat diet), increased inflammatory stresses (upon fructose supplementation) or modulated hepatic lipid content and metabolism that could be associated with the activation of the liver X receptor pathway (upon thermally <b>oxidized</b> <b>fat</b> supplementation). Another interesting finding of this work is the potential anti-inflammatory properties of coenzyme Q. A trend of decreased inflammatory score and similar tendencies in several pro-inflammatory genes expression were highlighted following coenzyme Q supplementation in a model of obesity associated with chronic low grade inflammation induced by high-fat feeding and fructose consumption. An activation of NADPH oxidase could be a key point in the development of the chronic low-grade inflammation, being at the cross-roads between oxidative stress and inflammation. Modulation of gut microbiota upon coenzyme Q supplementation has been highlighted in two different studies (increased Bacteroides in ob/ob mice and decreased Lactobacillus in high-fat fed mice supplemented with thermally <b>oxidized</b> <b>fat).</b> This could serve as a proof of concept that CoQ could modulate gut microbiota. In conclusion, our data suggest that CoQ is really efficient in counteracting lipid peroxidation in the diet, but is not able to improve most of the metabolic alterations occurring upon high-fat diet feeding. However, its anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its mitochondrial-related effects, would be interesting to study in diverse patho-physiological contexts. (FARM 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that fats and oils develop rancidity when exposed to the air.

We investigated these protein changes, applying accelerated shelf-life principles to UHT milk samples with different fat levels and using native- and sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. Samples of UHT skim and whole milk were stored at 20, 30, 40, and 50 °C for 28 d. Irrespective of fat content, UHT treatment had a similar effect on the electrophoretic patterns of milk proteins. At the start of testing, proteins were bonded mainly through disulfide and noncovalent interactions. However, storage at and above 30 °C enhanced protein aggregation via covalent interactions. The extent of aggregation appeared to be influenced by fat content; whole milk contained more fat than skim milk, implying aggregation via melted or <b>oxidized</b> <b>fat,</b> or both. Based on reduction in loss in absolute quantity of individual proteins, covalent crosslinking in whole milk was facilitated mainly by products of lipid oxidation and increased access to caseins for crosslinking reactions. Maillard and dehydroalanine products were the main contributors involved in protein changes in skim milk. Protein crosslinking appeared to follow a different pathway at higher temperatures (≥ 40 °C) than at lower temperatures, making it very difficult to extrapolate these changes to protein interactions at lower temperatures...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine effects of Santoquin ® (ethoxyquin) and <b>oxidized</b> <b>fat</b> on liver and intestinal reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, and pulmonary hypertension syndrome (PHS) mortality. Male broilers were randomly assigned in a 2 × 2 factorial consisting of 3. 5 % normal (NF) or oxidized (OxF) fat with or without ethoxyquin (E). Body weights and feed intake were monitored weekly, and tissues obtained at 3 and 7 wk for GSH and GSSG analysis. Compared to the NF group, NF/E gained more weight during the starter (0 to 3 wk), but not the grower (4 to 7 wk) period. Birds fed NF/E or NF exhibited greater feed efficiency in the starter period and greater gains during the starter and grower periods than birds fed OxF or OxF/E. No differences in PHS mortality between treatments were observed. Birds fed OxF exhibited lower liver GSSG at 3 wk than the other groups, {{but there were no}} differences in liver GSH. Duodenal GSH was higher in birds fed OxF/E than in birds of NF group at 3 and 7 wk. Ileal GSH was higher at 3 wk in OxF/E birds than in OxF birds, but no differences were observed at 7 wk. All tissues exhibited higher GSH levels at 7 wk than at 3 wk. Birds fed ethoxyquin, regardless of fat source, exhibited higher duodenal GSH at 3 and 7 wk and higher ileal GSH at 3 wk than birds that did not receive ethoxyquin. Higher GSH would be beneficial by enhancing protection of intestinal cells to deleterious effects of toxins or other forms of oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Paraoxonase is {{an enzyme}} {{associated}} with HDL in human serum that hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids and inhibits LDL oxidation, {{which is an}} important step in atherogenesis. In animals, addition of oxidized lipids to the circulation reduces paraoxonase activity, and diets rich in <b>oxidized</b> <b>fat</b> accelerate the development of atherosclerosis. The current randomized, crossover study was designed to compare the effect of a meal rich in oxidized lipids in the form of fat that had been used for deep-frying in a fast food restaurant and a control meal rich in the corresponding unused fat on postprandial serum paraoxonase (arylesterase) activity and peroxide content of LDL and its susceptibility to copper ion catalyzed oxidation in 12 healthy men. Four hours into the postprandial period, serum paraoxonase activity had decreased significantly after the used fat meal (217 %, P 50. 005) and had increased significantly after the meal rich in unused fat (14 %, P 50. 005). These changes were significantly (P 50. 003) different. A time-course study indicated that serum paraoxonase activity remained lower than baseline for up to 8 hours after the used fat meal. Serum apoA 1 concentration tended to decrease after the unused fat meal and tended to increase after the used fat meal. These changes were different at a marginal level of significance (P 50. 07). Also, a significantly (P 50. 03) greater decrease in apoA 1 content of postprandial HDL was recorded after the unused fat meal. The peroxide content of LDL tended to decrease after the used fat meal and tended to increase after the control meal. These changes were significantly (P 50. 04) different. Susceptibility of isolated LDL to copper ion oxidation and plasma levels of malondialdehyde were unchange...|$|E
50|$|During {{periods of}} {{prolonged}} exercise, animals {{are dependent on}} a combination of two sources of fuel: glycogen stored in the muscles and liver, and fat. Because glycogen is more easily <b>oxidized</b> than <b>fat,</b> it is depleted first. However, over longer periods of time, energy demands require that fat stores be utilized as fuel. This is true for all mammals, but hominins, and later modern humans, have an advantage of being able to alter their diet to meet these prolonged energy demands.|$|R
40|$|Obese {{individuals}} are {{less able to}} <b>oxidize</b> <b>fat</b> than non-obese individuals. Caloric reduction or fasting can detect ketonuria. We investigated the differences of metabolic parameters {{in the presence of}} ketonuria after a minimum 8 hr fast in a cross-sectional analysis of 16, 523 Koreans (6, 512 women and 10, 011 men). The relationship between the presence of ketonuria of all subjects and prevalence of obesity, central obesity, metabolic syndrome, and obesity-related metabolic parameters were assessed. The ketonuria group had lower prevalence of obesity, central obesity, and metabolic syndrome than the non-ketonuria group. In addition, all metabolic parameters (including body weight, waist circumference, blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, blood pressure, and insulin) were favorable in the ketonuria group than in the non-ketonuria group, even after adjustment for age, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption. The odds ratios of having obesity (odds ratio [OR]= 1. 427 in women, OR= 1. 582 in men, P< 0. 05), central obesity (OR= 1. 675 in women, OR= 1. 889 in men, P< 0. 05), and metabolic syndrome (OR= 3. 505 in women, OR= 1. 356 in men, P< 0. 05) were increased in the non-ketonuria group compared to the ketonuria group. The presence of ketonuria after at least an 8 hr fast may be indicative of metabolic superiority...|$|R
40|$|Metabolic {{flexibility}} of skeletal muscle, that is, {{the preference for}} fat oxidation (FOx) during fasting and for carbohydrate oxidation in response to insulin, is decreased during insulin resistance. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that the capacity of myotubes to <b>oxidize</b> <b>fat</b> in vitro reflects the donor’s metabolic characteristics. Insulin sensitivity (IS) and metabolic {{flexibility of}} 16 healthy, young male subjects was determined by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp. Muscle samples were obtained from vastus lateralis, cultured, and differentiated into myotubes. In human myotubes in vitro, we measured suppressibility (glucose suppression of FOx) and adaptability (an increase in FOx in the presence of high palmitate concentration). We termed these dynamic changes in FOx metabolic switching. In vivo, metabolic flexibility was positively correlated with IS and maximal oxygen uptake and inversely correlated with percent body fat. In vitro suppressibility was inversely correlated with IS and metabolic flexibility and positively correlated with body fat and fasting FFA levels. Adaptability was negatively associated with percent body fat and fasting insulin and positively correlated with IS and metabolic flexibility. The interindividual variability in metabolic phenotypes was preserved in human myotubes separated from their neuroendocrine environment, which supports the hypothesis that metabolic switching is an intrinsic property of skeletal muscle...|$|R
