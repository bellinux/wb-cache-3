5|$|Late on September 12, while {{approaching}} the northern Lesser Antilles, convection increased and became better organized around {{an area of}} increased cyclonic turning. Environmental conditions became more favorable, allowing {{for the development of}} a low pressure area and for banding features to increase. Late on September 13, with the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven about 70mi (110km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on August13. With a large swirl of low clouds and little convection, the system tracked westward for two weeks across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, before crossing Central America on August22. On August29, the system became better organized, consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> low pressure area and thunderstorm activity. The convection persisted and organized further, and at 0000UTC on August30 it developed into Tropical Depression Twelve-E about 600mi (970km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula.|$|E
5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on March24 to the east-southeast of the Marshall Islands. Initially {{it consisted}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> but consolidating circulation, with outflow {{to the north}} offsetting moderate wind shear to aid in development. It gradually became better organized, with a curved area of convection wrapping into the center. On March26, the JMA classified {{the system as a}} tropical depression just east of Pohnpei. On March27, the JTWC started tracking the system as a Tropical Depression 04W. Moving west-northwestward, the system's center became more consolidated with convective banding becoming wrapped into it. The JTWC upgraded 04W to a tropical storm the same day, and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Maysak.|$|E

5|$|Bruno Alfred Döblin {{was born}} on 10 August 1878 at the house at Bollwerk 37 in Stettin (Szczecin), a port city {{in what was then}} the Province of Pomerania. He was the fourth of five {{children}} born to Max Döblin (1846–1921), a master tailor from Posen (Poznań), and Sophie Döblin (1844–1920), née Freudenheim, the daughter of a merchant. Their marriage was characterized by a tension between Max's multifaceted artistic interests—to which Döblin would later attribute his and his siblings' artistic inclinations—and Sophie's cool pragmatism. The Döblins were assimilated Jews, and Alfred became aware <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad,</b> societal anti-Semitism early on.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{authority}} {{would have}} {{rested on the}} control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas tentatively suggests that {{the scope of this}} economic power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were at the center <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> regional trade network centered on these resources.|$|E

5|$|On November9, {{an area of}} disorganized convection, or thunderstorms, persisted about 1175km (730mi) {{southeast}} of Palau. The system consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> circulation, affected to its detriment by moderate wind shear. Moving west-northwestward, the convection persisted and organized into the circulation, indicative of an increased potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Late on November10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), meaning the agency anticipated a tropical depression would develop within 24hours. Shortly thereafter, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Zoraida after the system entered its area of responsibility of the agency. At 1200UTC on November11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed about halfway between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao, although operationally the agency had classified the system two days prior.|$|E
5|$|On October11, 2015, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather traversed Central America {{and emerged}} over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly {{over the next few}} days, later merging with a tropical wave on October15. The merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> area of low pressure. This feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00UTC on October20; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205mi (335km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. A mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Dora {{can be traced}} back to a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off the western African coast on July7. The disturbance tracked into the Caribbean Sea seven days later without any signs of development. However, the system encountered an enhanced flow of moisture in the southwestern Caribbean, allowing for organization and the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> low-pressure area on July15. Upon tracking into the eastern Pacific, the National Hurricane Center(NHC) judged the storm to have had a low chance developing into a tropical cyclone. The next day, thunderstorm activity erupted around the system, and at 1500UTC on July18, the NHC declared the vigorous disturbance to have reached tropical depression status; in post-season analysis, the NHC found that Dora was already a tropical storm by this point after developing six hours earlier.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Katrina was a short-lived, weak {{tropical}} cyclone that produced minor damage across areas previously devastated by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Forming out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> area of low {{pressure in the}} southwestern Caribbean Sea on October28, 1999, the disorganized tropical storm made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 40mph (65km/h) on October30 before weakening to a tropical depression. The remnants of the storm persisted until November1, at which time it was absorbed by a cold front on the northern end of the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} week of December, a westward-moving upper-level low led to the {{formation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> surface trough well to the east of the northern Lesser Antilles. With a strong ridge to its northeast, the trough tracked slowly westward, producing scattered convection and some cyclonic turning. On December 8 convection began to persist in association with the trough and an upper-level low. Early on December 9, officials at the Tropical Prediction Center began classifying the system using the Hebert-Poteat technique, and several tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated its development of tropical characteristics. The system, which consisted of a sharp trough with an area of gale force winds to its north, continued westward through an area of moderately warm sea surface temperatures. On December 10 a low-level circulation developed within the system, though its convection had become disorganized and well-removed from the center. Southerly wind shear left the structure asymmetric, and convection steadily increased closer to the center. With an upper-level low situated just south of the center, the National Hurricane Center classified it as Subtropical Storm Olga at 0300UTC on December 11 while located about 55miles (85km) east of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southeast}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> and deep tropospheric trough and {{to the west of}} a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October14. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2mi (18.5 to 27.7km) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75mph (120km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well-defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features.|$|E

5|$|On August 1, 2007, {{an area of}} {{convection}} developed {{just south}} of Jamaica in association with a trough of low pressure. The system tracked west-northwestward, and by August 10 consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> surface trough with minimal shower activity. Convection increased on August 11, and by August 12 the interaction between a tropical wave and an upper-level low in the area resulted in a large area of disorganized thunderstorms extending from the western Caribbean Sea into the central Bahamas. Upper-level winds gradually became more beneficial for development, and on August 13 a broad low pressure area formed about 90miles (145km) north-northeast of Cancún, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Late on August 14, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system reported a small circulation center, {{but at the time}} was not well-defined enough to result in the initiation of tropical cyclone advisories. However, deep convection was maintained near the increasingly organizing center, and at 0300UTC on August 15 the National Hurricane Center classified it as Tropical Depression Five about 425miles (685km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas.|$|E
5|$|On August3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} depression located {{to the southeast}} of Minami Torishima Island. The depression slowly developed as it moved towards the west-northwest. At 1630UTC on August5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the developing system while it was located about 740km (460mi) east-northeast of the northern Mariana Islands. Deep convection was present around the center of circulation but the overall structure of the storm resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, the storm was likely to intensify as it was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear with favorable diffulence aloft. Later that day, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Maria; a name submitted by the United States and a common Chamorro feminine name. Maria continued towards the west-northwest along the edge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> subtropical ridge located east of Japan.|$|E
5|$|On June18, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off the western coastline of Africa {{and into the}} eastern Atlantic. Tracking steadily westward, it maintained a small but organized area of convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—along its axis {{for the next several}} days. The wave crossed the Lesser Antilles on June24 and Central America on June29, emerging into the eastern Pacific shortly thereafter. During the evening of July1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system, noting that environmental conditions were expected to become favorable for slow development. The wave interacted with a larger area of low pressure on July2, leading to an increase in convective coverage and the formation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> low-pressure area. Continuing slowly westward, the system acquired enough organization to be declared {{a tropical}} depression at 1200UTC on July4, while centered 205mi (330km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Despite the initially exposed center of circulation, a byproduct of moderate wind shear, the depression soon began to organize as convective banding increased and gained more curvature. This led to the classification of Tropical Storm Erick at 0000UTC on July5.|$|E
