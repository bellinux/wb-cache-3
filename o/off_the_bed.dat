5|$|After getting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> the Hero is {{then given}} a task {{to get a}} crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E
25|$|Early {{ambulation}} also prevents venous stasis {{and physicians}} order OOB {{activities on the}} same day of surgery. This is accomplished in increments. The progression of increasing mobility proceeds by: raising the head of the bed, sitting up in bed, moving {{to the edge of the}} bed, dangling the legs <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and then ambulating to a close chair.|$|E
25|$|Although {{trampoline}} {{competitors are}} highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> They also have padded end decks, which are the locations that athletes are most likely to fall off the trampoline. The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling {{off the side of the}} trampoline bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting.|$|E

500|$|... "Under Your Spell" [...] {{received}} attention from Buffy studies writers because {{it presents a}} frank and unflinching expression of lesbian romance. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the first show in U.S. television history to portray a long-term lesbian relationship among the core cast of characters. Previous televised depictions of lesbian relations were primarily limited to single [...] "coming out" [...] or [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episodes, showing lesbian-identified characters as affectionate but not erotic. Tara and Willow demonstrate throughout the series, and specifically in [...] "Once More, with Feeling", that they are [...] "intensely sexual", according to Buffy essayist Justine Larbalestier. Near the end of Tara's song, she sings, [...] "Lost in ecstasy / Spread beneath my Willow tree / You make me / Com — plete", as Tara levitates <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> while Willow tacitly performs cunnilingus on her. Lorna Jowett called the song [...] "the most erotic scene" [...] of the series. Whedon admitted on the DVD commentary for the episode that the song is [...] "pornography" [...] and [...] "probably the dirtiest lyric I've ever written, but also very, very beautiful".|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} police, Taylor {{eventually}} admitted kidnapping Tiernan. His explanation {{was that he}} had not visited Haughley Gill for many years, but by chance had been there on the afternoon that Tiernan went missing. He said that she had walked past him and on impulse he had seized her from behind, tied her hands behind her back with a dog leash, covered her head with his jacket and forced her to walk to his home in nearby Cockshott Drive. He then forced her into his bedroom and onto the bed where, during a struggle, she had fallen <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> striking her head on the floor. He said that he had then picked her up by the scarf around her neck, at which point she had died, and claimed that her death was an accident. He said he had panicked and hidden her body in Lindley Woods.|$|E

2500|$|Raymond v. Raymond mirrors Usher's 2004 Confessions, as a self-confessional album, {{with several}} {{recordings}} from the album inferring to Usher's marriage. Jive Records urban music president and album executive producer Mark Pitts also conceived the album as {{a return to}} the themes of the latter album; [...] "based on what happened with Confessions", Pitts wanted to reproduce its success. Pitts told The New York Times that [...] "Usher had a rough couple years", elaborating: [...] "The scrutiny of everything going on, he was worrying too much about what people were thinking. We felt like we had to get his swagger back. Dust <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and get it popping and young again." [...] Pitts noted that it was important Raymond v. Raymond addressed the rumors that circulated around Usher's marriage. The latter reiterated that the album is not specifically about his marriage, and that it is [...] "about the tug-of-war between man and woman, and the honesty a man has to have." ...|$|E

50|$|In 2009 Greg had a lucky escape {{while playing}} with Morzine when the sleeper coach {{carrying}} {{the team was}} involved in a crash on mountain roads. He recalls that while asleep in a <b>bed</b> above <b>the</b> driver, the coach slid on a patch of ice and <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> he was asleep in dislodged and fell on the driver causing the coach to crash <b>off</b> <b>the</b> road. <b>The</b> <b>bed</b> containing Greg was ejected from the coach windscreen and Greg in his bed slid down part of the mountain. Luckily Greg had no lasting injuries.|$|R

60|$|Throwing {{the things}} that he had taken <b>off</b> under <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> he went out, closed the door behind him, locked it, and took the key. He had with him the short sword carried by the warder, and he relied upon this to silence the sentry, at the passage leading to the outer court, should he attempt to stop him.|$|R
50|$|It was {{postulated}} that small rafts of ice form around {{the rocks and}} the rocks are buoyantly floated <b>off</b> <b>the</b> soft <b>bed,</b> thus reducing <b>the</b> reaction and friction forces at <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Since this effect depends on reducing friction, and not on increasing the wind drag, these ice cakes need not have a particularly large surface area if the ice is adequately thick, as the minimal friction allows the rocks to be moved by arbitrarily light winds.|$|R
50|$|Hong-guan {{switched}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> lights for <b>bed</b> {{and ignored}} his brother {{who was still}} sleeping. Hong-shee, who saw {{stars in the sky}} as he wandered his eyes around the room, jumped into bed hugged his brother.|$|R
6000|$|He hurled himself <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> to find her, in {{that cold}} darkness. He stood {{wavering}} under the gas-jet. [...] "Why--oh, yes, we {{turned on the}} gas!" [...] he realized.|$|E

60|$|This, however, did {{not satisfy}} the captain, and orders were {{forthwith}} {{given that the}} fire should be taken away, <b>the</b> curtains stripped <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> feather <b>beds</b> removed, and everything reduced to {{pretty much the same}} state in which it had usually been left for Harry Norman's accommodation. So much for all the feminine care which had been thrown away upon the consideration of Uncle Bat's infirmities.|$|R
5|$|For {{transportation}} on the bay, steamboats were commonplace between Corpus Christi and Ingleside {{during the}} 1930s. Native Americans used a route {{made up of}} a series of shallow oyster beds, dubbed Reef Road. The passage, which was about 18 to 24inches in depth, could be navigated on foot or horseback during low tides to travel across the opening of Nueces Bay into Corpus Christi Bay. White settlers discovered the road in the 1860s, and it became a common way to pass from Portland to Corpus Christi via buggy, although its jagged course had to be marked with posts and horses would sometimes fall <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> and drown. A wooden causeway connecting Portland and Corpus Christi was first constructed in 1915, but was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed by several storms. A permanent concrete bridge was erected in the 1950s, and a double lane was added in 1988. The approximately mile long structure is today known as the Nueces Bay Causeway.|$|R
50|$|For {{protection}} against <b>bed</b> bugs, <b>the</b> mattress and box spring must both be fully enclosed with no possible openings. Zippered cases {{are commonly used}} for this purpose. This prevents new bed bugs from getting into the mattress and box spring, and traps any bed bugs that are already inside. Mattress protectors must be left on {{for at least a}} full year to make sure that <b>the</b> trapped <b>bed</b> bugs and their eggs die. If the cover is taken <b>off</b> early, <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> bug infestation may relapse.|$|R
