5|$|Agriculture {{accounts}} for just under 1% of GDP, yet the United States is the world's top producer {{of corn and}} soybeans. The National Agricultural Statistics Service maintains agricultural statistics for products that include peanuts, oats, rye, wheat, rice, cotton, corn, barley, hay, sunflowers, and oilseeds. In addition, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides livestock statistics regarding beef, poultry, pork, and dairy products. The country is the primary developer and grower <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food, representing half of the world's biotech crops.|$|E
5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal gene transfer, causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops.|$|E

5|$|Under the UPA {{government}} that preceded Modi's administration, field trials <b>of</b> <b>Genetically</b> <b>Modified</b> (GM) crops had essentially {{been put on}} hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted. The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze {{had to do with}} Greenpeace's opposition to GM crops.|$|E
5|$|Animals used by {{laboratories}} {{are largely}} supplied by specialist dealers. Sources differ for vertebrate and invertebrate animals. Most laboratories breed and raise flies and worms themselves, using strains and mutants supplied {{from a few}} main stock centers. For vertebrates, sources include breeders and dealers like Covance and Charles River Laboratories who supply purpose-bred and wild-caught animals; businesses that trade in wild animals such as Nafovanny; and dealers who supply animals sourced from pounds, auctions, and newspaper ads. Animal shelters also supply the laboratories directly. Large centers also exist to distribute strains <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> animals; the International Knockout Mouse Consortium, for example, aims to provide knockout mice for every gene in the mouse genome.|$|E
5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin {{has been shown to}} be toxic to some insects.|$|E

Canola is Australia's third biggest crop, and is used often by wheat farmers as a break crop to improve soil quality. As of 2008, the only <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops in Australia were canola, cotton, and carnations.|$|R

5|$|The film {{shows how}} the demand for cotton in India {{has led to the}} {{planting}} <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> (GM) cotton, and how the monopoly inherent in its use by seed companies causes an increase in the price of cotton, leading to suicides among farmers who lose their land to these companies because they cannot pay the higher seed prices. GM crops need more pesticides, causing environmental damage, birth defects leading to mental and physical disabilities among the Punjab people, and an increased rate of cancer. The film claims that sometimes the companies that produce the pesticides are the same ones that produce the needed medications. A similar scenario occurs in contaminated cotton fields in Texas, where pesticides are causing brain tumors. The garment industry is the second-most-polluting industry the world, according to the film, which is illustrated by leather tanneries pouring chromium into the Ganges River in Kanpur, India.|$|E
5|$|Virotherapy {{involves}} the use <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> viruses to treat diseases. Viruses have been modified by scientists to reproduce in cancer cells and destroy them but not infect healthy cells. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), for example, is a modified herpes simplex virus that has had a gene, which is required for viruses to replicate in healthy cells, deleted and replaced with a human gene (GM-CSF) that stimulates immunity. When this virus infects cancer cells, it destroys them {{and in doing so}} the presence the GM-CSF gene attracts dendritic cells from the surrounding tissues of the body. The dendritic cells process the dead cancer cells and present components of them to other cells of the immune system. Having completed successful clinical trials, this virus is expected to gain approval for the treatment of a skin cancer called melanoma in late 2015. Viruses that have been reprogrammed to kill cancer cells are called oncolytic viruses.|$|E
5|$|Confusion reigned {{over just}} what {{experiments}} had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned two lines <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, {{and this was}} reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media {{was talking about a}} second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.|$|E

50|$|In genetics, {{gene drive}} is the {{phenomenon}} {{in which the}} inheritance of a particular gene or set of genes is favorably biased.

5|$|The governments led by Patel and Modi {{supported}} NGOs {{and communities}} {{in the creation of}} groundwater-conservation projects. By December 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. Sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. As a result, the state's production <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> cotton increased to become the largest in India. The boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to Gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. Public irrigation measures in central and southern Gujarat, such as the Sardar Sarovar Dam, were less successful. The Sardar Sarovar project only irrigated 4–6% of the area intended. Nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 Gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent – the highest of any state. However, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992–97 INC government was 12.9 percent. In 2008 Modi offered land in Gujarat to Tata Motors to set up a plant manufacturing the Nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of West Bengal. Several other companies followed the Tata's to Gujarat.|$|E

25|$|Recently, chloroplasts {{have caught}} {{attention}} by developers <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> crops. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not {{inherited from the}} male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation <b>of</b> <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism {{has not yet been}} studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.|$|E
