5|$|As {{a result}} of his trap-shooting career, Bain {{developed}} an appreciation for nature. He bought an ownership share of the Portage Country Club, on the Delta Marsh near the south shore of Lake Manitoba, and later donated the land to Ducks Unlimited. Bain built the Mallard Lodge as a personal retreat on land adjacent to the club. He strictly enforced his privacy, even building a road to his lodge that he allowed no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> use; members of the Portage Country Club were required to take a different route. Bain intended to donate his lodge to the government of Manitoba for preservation, though he died before he could do so. The lodge passed into the control of the government regardless, and was donated to the University of Manitoba as a research facility in 1966 that remains active today. Bain was {{also a member of the}} Manitoba Game and Fish Association and the Winnipeg Humane Society.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E

25|$|Jones {{encouraged}} {{the women to}} bring their babies and small children {{with them when they}} were sentenced by the court in Greensburg. The presiding judge sentenced the women to pay a $30 fine or serve 30 days in jail. Unable to pay, the women were jailed. As there was no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> care for the children, the judge was forced to jail the children along with their mothers.|$|E
25|$|The {{wife of a}} local lodging-house deputy, Caroline Maxwell, {{claimed to}} have seen Kelly alive at about 8:30 {{on the morning of}} the murder, though she {{admitted}} to only meeting her once or twice before; moreover, her description did not match that of those who knew Kelly more closely. Maurice Lewis, a tailor, reported seeing Kelly at about 10:00 that same morning in a pub. Both statements were dismissed by the police since they did not fit the accepted time of death; moreover, they could find no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> confirm the reports. Maxwell may have either mistaken someone else for Kelly, or mixed up the day she had seen her. Such confusion was used as a plot device in the graphic novel From Hell (and subsequent movie adaptation).|$|E
25|$|The fallout was swift. Gardiner, Higgs and Russell {{resigned}} from Cabinet {{and issued a}} press statement giving {{their views on the}} situation, which cleared the usually pro-government censors because Higgs temporarily held the Defence portfolio, due to George Pearce's absence in Western Australia, so Hughes was unable to prevent its publication. The government was threatened with collapse, with four of the nine members of the First Hughes Ministry having quit. The publicity about Hughes' peremptory move and its consequences was a disaster, coming {{on the eve of the}} poll, and the veneer of a unified and strong government under Hughes was destroyed. Hughes, distraught and overwrought, called the Governor-General at midnight, saying he had no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> talk to, and the two men in the wee-hours of the morning, with Lord Novar offering sympathy and support to his old colleague, but ultimately both understood that the cause was probably lost.|$|E

25|$|Eventually, Conrad {{appears to}} Nicholas and apologizes, {{claiming}} that he, too, {{has come under}} attack by CRS. With no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> turn to, Nicholas finds Christine's home. He soon discovers {{that she is a}} CRS employee and that her apartment was staged. Christine tells Nicholas that they are being watched. Nicholas attacks a camera, and armed CRS troops begin to swarm the house and fire upon them. Nicholas and Christine are forced to flee. Christine tells Nicholas that CRS has drained his financial accounts by using the psychological tests to guess his passwords. In a panic, Nicholas calls his bank and gives a verification code to check his account balanceâ€”zero. Just as he begins to trust Christine, he realizes she has drugged him. As he loses consciousness, she admits that she is actually part of the scam and that he made a fatal mistake by giving up his verification code.|$|E
25|$|Belize informs Louis about Joe's {{connection}} with Cohn, whom Louis despises for his hypocritical anti-gay rhetoric. Louis goes to confront Joe directly, and Joe physically assaults him, after which Louis leaves him for good. Now abandoned {{by his wife}} and his lover, and with no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> turn to, Joe goes to Cohn for guidance. Cohn, meanwhile, has just learned that his political enemies have moved to have him disbarred. Enraged, he vows to remain a lawyer until the day he dies. Rather than comforting Joe, Cohn viciously berates him for leaving his wife for another man, forcing Joe to realize that Louis's opinion of Cohn was true. He rebukes Cohn and leaves the man to die alone. Ethel Rosenberg watches Cohn's last supporter abandon him before delivering the final blow: Cohn has been disbarred after all. Cohn dies shortly thereafter. Belize forces Louis to visit Cohn's room, where Louis recites the Kaddish for Cohn. Unseen by the living, Ethel joins Louis in the prayer, symbolically forgiving Cohn before she departs for the hereafter. Belize and Louis then steal Cohn's hoarded AZT for Prior.|$|E

500|$|Asian {{women are}} rarely given {{prominent}} roles on American television. In 1994 Margaret Cho {{had a brief}} prime-time show called All American Girl, which was not popular with audiences and did not last a full season. [...] When the show aired, {{there had not been}} another Asian-American-centered show or an Asian main character at the time the Ling character was created. Unlike the 1970s depictions of docile East Asian women on TV, Ling's character was the opposite, but still a classic stereotype, that of the Dragon Lady. At the time, she was the only significant representative of Asian women on television in the United States (besides news anchors and reporters), leaving no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> counteract this prominent stereotype. [...] She remains the most memorable Asian TV character of the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Carl Hanratty, an FBI bank fraud agent, begins {{tracking}} Frank.

Frank leaves, Carl angrily realizing a minute too late that he has been fooled. Later, at Christmas, Carl is still at work when Frank calls him, attempting to apologize for duping Carl. Carl rejects his apology and tells him he will soon be caught, but laughs when he realizes Frank actually called him because he has no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> talk to. Frank hangs up, and Carl continues to investigate, suddenly realizing (thanks to a waiter) that the name [...] "Barry Allen" [...] is from the Flash comic books and that Frank is actually a teenager.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling {{down the stairs and}} have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

500|$|The Japanese and English {{portrayals of}} Spike have also drawn praise individually. While praising the Japanese cast as [...] "perfectly {{complementing}} the characters", Kenneth Lee of EX.org argued that [...] "there {{could be no}} <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> fill the role of Spike Spiegel except Yamadera". Meanwhile, IGN's Ramsey Isler stated that [...] "Steve Blum launched his career into new heights when he gave {{the performance of a}} lifetime in the English dub of the series, giving Spike a sense of smooth, effortless cool that many argue surpassed the original Japanese version." [...] Commending the principal American cast's work {{as one of the best}} English dubs, Serdar Yegulalp of About.com highlighted Blum as Spike as the standout performance of the series, stating that [...] "Cynicism never sounded this suave or self-assured". However, AnimeNation's John Oppliger felt Spike's character was mishandled in the English dub, where he was depicted as a [...] "carefree playboy" [...] whose ambivalent taunts [...] "come across as casual off-the-cuff bluffs, unlike his weighty, solemn statements in the Japanese version". Blum himself has called Spike a [...] "gigantic benchmark" [...] in his career and life, saying that [...] "Spike changed everything" [...] for him. He stated that his role as Spike opened up new opportunities for voicing characters, including T.O.M. on Toonami and Jamie on Megas XLR.|$|E

[...] "Is She the Reason" [...] is an R ballad which was noted to have a similar chord progression to materials by The Beatles, which lyrically speaks on being in competition with another woman for her mans love & attention. It contains a trumpet-laden sample from Melba Moore's song [...] "I Don't Know No <b>One</b> <b>Else</b> <b>to</b> Turn To". The next song, [...] "Girl" [...] was noted for its Motown influence and a theme talking about friendship. [...] "If", complete with strings, lyrically talks about men who don't appreciate their female lovers until their relationship ends and they realize their mistakes. [...] "Free" [...] {{was described as a}} [...] "soul classic from 1975" [...] with critics also noting elements of 1970s funk music, as the trio speaks on being [...] "set free" [...] after being in a relationship where her lover never tending to her desires like she does for him. The midtempo number [...] "Through with Love" [...] was noted for having an [...] "angry" [...] nature as it talks about a break-up. It contains an undulating piano line as the members of the group sing with restrained vocals and later religious redemption with elements of gospel. In [...] "Love", [...] "capital L kicks the daylights out of the forces of fear, doubt and disappointment", as the group [...] "thank God for love".

2500|$|The {{king had}} {{employed}} an artist called Anders MÃ¥lare {{to lead the}} works at the castles in Stockholm and at SvartsjÃ¶, but in letters in 1573 the king complained MÃ¥lare failed to accomplish his duties due to age and poor health. Having no <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> choose from, he appointed his chamberlain Phillipe Kern to replace the Swedish artist. Kern, however, proved to be untrustworthy {{and within a few}} years had provided himself with sufficient materials to build his private house. To hide his deed, Kern added the names of his subordinates to material specifications and Boy's name appears among them. This situation did not last, however, and in a letter June 25, 1576, the king mentions Boy as the man leading the works, and on July 10, Boy is addressed [...] "Master Wilhelm, architect at the Stockholm Palace".|$|E
