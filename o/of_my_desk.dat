60|$|I {{began to}} keep a scrap-book, though I locked {{it up in the}} drawer <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> In it are to be found many {{clippings}} of a similarly gratifying tenor....|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I can, Frankie. I had {{something}} in hand towards my own possible flitting. Here is the key <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Bring me my banker's book and my cheque book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Among {{the other}} offenses," [...] {{continued}} the little man, [...] "of which I now find my scoundrel of an apprentice {{to have been}} guilty, was the enormity of picking the lock <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and prying into my private papers." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{caught up}} a bundle <b>of</b> papers from <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and stole softly from the room. Ray was close at hand, and I called to him.|$|R
60|$|Though we all {{pretended to}} be glad when Primus went, we spoke of him briefly at times, and I read his letters aloud at our evening meetings. Here is a series <b>of</b> them from <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Primus was now {{a year and a}} half older and his {{spelling}} had improved.|$|R
60|$|I {{can still}} recall the feeling <b>of</b> sitting at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> {{that night in}} that large study of mine in Radnor Square, waiting for Margaret to come home. It was oddly like {{the feeling of a}} dentist's reception-room; only it was for me to do the {{dentistry}} with clumsy, cruel hands. I had left the door open so that she would come in to me.|$|R
60|$|Once, {{upon his}} preferring such an accusation, I turned upon him--I rose against him. Gathering {{an armful of}} his books out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> I filled my apron and poured them in a heap upon his estrade, at his feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{opened the}} box, and tilted out the {{contents}} upon the corner <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> My hair rose and my flesh grew cold as I looked. There were twelve magnificent square stones engraved with mystical characters. There {{could be no}} doubt that they were the jewels of the urim and thummim.|$|E
60|$|One Sunday afternoon, having {{walked the}} {{distance}} of half a league to the Protestant church, I came back weary and exhausted; and taking refuge in my solitary sanctuary, the first classe, I was glad to sit down, and to make <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> a pillow for my arms and head.|$|E
40|$|This is serious. Turtles live {{in every}} nook and cranny <b>of</b> <b>my</b> house–on shelves, in bookcases, on the mantle over the fireplace, in a special cabinet with glass doors that’s filled to overcrawling, in the cubbies <b>of</b> <b>my</b> rolltop <b>desk.</b> It all started when I became {{director}} of the Cognitive Sciences Center at the University of Minnesota in the late 1970 s, and my family discovered that the turtle is the logo of the Center. The first carved turtle, a gift from my wife, came into my life innocently enough, but they have multiplied beyond imagination and the situation has gotten out of control...|$|R
40|$|When I was five, {{my parents}} walked {{my older brother}} and me into what would become our bedroom. It had walls of bare cement, and they told us we could choose to paint it {{whatever}} color we wanted. My brother, the seven-year-old self-declared animal and nature expert, and I, his loyal follower, chose forest-green walls for trees, a gold-yellow ceiling for the sun, and dirt-brown carpeting for earth—mimicking the environment in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from which we had just moved to Amman, Jordan. That room, with its colored reminiscence of the world <b>of</b> <b>my</b> early childhood, would serve as the backdrop to the stories my father and I would create together with the characters he adopted; Andy the raccoon, Otty the otter, and Supercamel the, well, camel were both my childhood friends and the earliest figures <b>of</b> <b>my</b> imaginative realm, linkages to my earliest memories—albeit broken—in Philadelphia. Later, as a teenager, the room served as a canvas to my solitary expression. My brother having moved out years before, I adorned its walls with black marker and white chalk. Delicate filigree flora soon grew out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bookcases, <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> <b>my</b> closet and my windows like field bindweed. I called it doodling. The room remained like that, green walls and floral doodles, until I left to complete my Master’s Degree in English in Logan, Utah. I was twenty one...|$|R
60|$|They drifted {{towards the}} kitchen garden--it {{was the time}} of strawberries--and the {{remainder}} of the talk I lost. I noticed that for some days afterwards Veronica displayed a tendency to shutting herself up in the schoolroom with a copybook, and that lead pencils had a way <b>of</b> disappearing from <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> One in particular that had suited me I determined if possible to recover. A subtle instinct guided me to Veronica's sanctum. I found her thoughtfully sucking it. She explained to me that she was writing a little play.|$|R
6000|$|... "They use none. There is a stove. The bell-rope {{hangs from}} the wire just to the right <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Whoever rang it must have come {{right up to the}} desk to do it. But why should any {{criminal}} wish to ring the bell? It is a most insoluble mystery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I assure you, Mr Nickleby, however, that it is,' {{returned}} Madame Mantalini. 'It {{makes me}} miserable! I am under constant apprehensions, and in constant difficulty. And even this,' said Madame Mantalini, wiping her eyes, 'is not the worst. He took some papers of value out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> this morning without asking my permission.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr. Burns, I did," [...] I cut him short. He was {{beginning}} to make gestures of despair when I stopped that, too, by giving him the key <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and desiring him, in a tone which admitted of no argument, to go below at once, pay Mr. Jacobus's bill, and send {{him out of the}} ship.|$|E
60|$|I HAD {{sent the}} {{housekeeper}} out <b>of</b> <b>my</b> study. I was alone, with {{the photograph of}} the Frenchwoman on <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|R
5000|$|She {{also read}} dozens of books about Louisiana, French trappers and explorers, the {{treatment}} of slaves, and other documents about the early 1800s. Details she found in court documents were incorporated into Moinette's story. For example, in 2001, she read an account of a woman named Manon, a free woman of color who traded a slave she owned to buy her own son {{because he could not}} be legally freed until he was 21 years old. Straight became obsessed with the story, [...] "I couldn't show daughter the piece <b>of</b> paper in <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> the copy <b>of</b> the sale of Manon. I could only write about a woman like her with a child I imagine who looked like mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{does not}} approve of the luxury <b>of</b> <b>my</b> surroundings," [...] he answered. [...] "He {{declined}} to write at <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> or to sit in my room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Ford. [...] "Now, {{perhaps you}} {{will tell me}} {{which one of you}} gentlemen broke into the school-house, forced the lock <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and stole my papers. If he is here I wish to tell him he is not only a thief, but a cur and a coward, for the letters are a woman's--whom he neither knows nor has the right to know." ...|$|E
60|$|That was {{forty years}} ago, and I can still sing those songs and imitate the whoop of the {{shouting}} tenor, but I {{have never been}} able to put that woman into verse or fiction although I have tried. In a story called Love or the Law I once made a laborious attempt to account for her, but I did not succeed, and the manuscript remains in the bottom <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. In London I {{trusted him}} with money--with the happiest results. I quieted his mind by {{an appeal to}} his sense of trust and self-respect, which he {{thoroughly}} appreciated. As yet I have not given him the key <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> here, because I reserve it as a special reward for good conduct. In a few days more I have no doubt he will {{add it to the}} collection in his bag." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{described}} {{not only}} the summer-house, but {{the view of the}} waterfall from the door. She knew the size, she knew the binding, <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sketch-book--locked up in <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> at that moment, at home in Perthshire! ...|$|R
60|$|Isabel {{came after}} dinner one evening and talked in the office. She made a white-robed, dusky figure against the deep blues <b>of</b> <b>my</b> big window. I sat at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and tore a quill pen to pieces as I talked.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't; it was Stumpy. He let the boy {{get hold}} of Nick Weaver's statement, and that started the thing. Then the boy stole some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> papers that were in <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and how much {{information}} he has now I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] I said finally. [...] "I'll {{tell you}} what I'll do. I'll take as many of your confounded {{potatoes}} as my money will buy, on condition that you go off at once down to the wharf to see them loaded in the lighter and sent alongside the ship straight away. Take the invoice and a signed receipt with you. Here's the key <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Give it to Burns. He will pay you.|$|E
6000|$|... "A thief?" [...] Mrs. Wagner repeated. [...] "Haven't {{you seen}} me examine everything? And mind, {{if there had}} been any dishonest person about the house last night, the key <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> is the only key that a thief would have thought worth stealing. I happen to be sure of that. Come! come! don't be down-hearted. You know I never deceive you--and I say you are quite wrong in suspecting that your bag was stolen last night." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh! hypocrite! hypocrite! If {{he could}} only have seen {{me a few minutes}} before, {{stealing}} along {{in the shadow of the}} shrubs outside looking about in the darkness till I had found them, and holding them passionately to my lips. They were in my pocket then, wrapped in a lace handkerchief. They are in a secret drawer <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> now, and there will they remain forever. I do not mind confessing that they are very precious to me. But he does not know that.|$|E
30|$|John Bell is {{described}} as an entrepreneur at heart. In Bell’s own words, he started his first business after being fired from another. “I never wanted the humiliation <b>of</b> cleaning out <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> drawer – that’s the day I became an entrepreneur.” He started Shred-Tech with $ 10, 000 he borrowed from his mother. The first year it had sales of $ 70, 000. Sales reached $ 15 M {{by the time he}} sold it in 1995. He could have retired but chose to buy a local factory—Polymer Technologies—that was poised to put 90 people out of work. In 1995 he founded Onbelay Investments. Since then, he has been scouting opportunities in many industries and investing along the way. He believes it is not just about the products but about the people. Some describe him as showing others the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} could see some of their {{compositions}} [...] . so much do I wish it that I'll send you copies of some written recently. Last week I told the fourth class I wanted them to write me letters about anything they pleased, adding by way of suggestion that they might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting thing or person they had seen. They were to write the letters on real note paper, seal them in an envelope, and address them to me, all without any assistance from other people. Last Friday morning I found a pile <b>of</b> letters on <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> and that evening I realized afresh that teaching has its pleasures {{as well as its}} pains. Those compositions would atone for much. Here is Ned Clay's, address, spelling, and grammar as originally penned.|$|R
6000|$|It is the 20th of September, 1850. I {{know these}} figures I have just written, {{as if they}} were a long {{familiar}} inscription. I have seen them on this pace in <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> unnumbered times, when the scene <b>of</b> <b>my</b> dying struggle has opened upon me [...] .|$|R
6000|$|... "Chelsford's methods {{seem to me}} to savour {{a little}} of opera bouffe," [...] he remarked drily. [...] "For my own part I believe that these marvellous {{documents}} would be perfectly safe in the unlocked drawer <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> I do not believe any of these stories which come from Paris about copies of our work being in existence. I do not wish you to be careless, of course, but don't overdo your precautions. This place is scarcely so much a nest of conspirators as faddists like Chelsford and Ray would have us believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] said she, rising. There was {{gratitude}} both in {{her voice}} and in the look with which she accompanied it. It was time, indeed, for our conference to terminate; for, when I glanced around, behold all the boarders (the day-scholars had departed) were congregated within a yard or two <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and stood staring with eyes and mouths wide open; the three maitresses formed a whispering knot in one corner, and, close at my elbow, was the directress, sitting on a low chair, calmly clipping the tassels of her finished purse.|$|E
6000|$|... "What did she say?" [...] asked Lord Marshmoreton, interested. [...] "Something about {{somebody}} laughing at a locksmith? I don't understand. Why should anyone laugh at locksmiths? Most respectable men. Had one up here only {{the day before}} yesterday, forcing open the drawer <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Watched him do it. Most interesting. He smelt rather strongly of a damned bad brand of tobacco. Fellow must have a throat of leather {{to be able to}} smoke the stuff. But he didn't strike me as an object of derision. From first to last, I was never tempted to laugh once." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{programme}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> ranch {{life was}} as follows: Each morning, at eight-thirty, having been reading or correcting proofs in bed since four or five, I went to <b>my</b> <b>desk.</b> Odds and ends of correspondence and notes occupied me till nine, and at nine sharp, invariably, I began my writing. By eleven, sometimes {{a few minutes}} earlier or later, my thousand words were finished. Another half-hour at cleaning up <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> and <b>my</b> day's work was done, so that at eleven-thirty I got into a hammock under the trees with my mail-bag and the morning newspaper. At twelve-thirty I ate dinner and in the afternoon I swam and rode.|$|R
60|$|Something--either in my {{continued}} silence or in {{the movement}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> hand, stitching--transported M. Emanuel beyond the last boundary of patience; he actually sprang from his estrade. The stove stood near <b>my</b> <b>desk,</b> he attacked it; the little iron door was nearly dashed from its hinges, the fuel was made to fly.|$|R
60|$|One morning, at eleven-thirty, before I {{got into}} the hammock, I took a cocktail. I {{repeated}} this on subsequent mornings, of course, taking another cocktail just before I ate at twelve-thirty. Soon I found myself, seated at <b>my</b> <b>desk</b> in the midst <b>of</b> <b>my</b> thousand words, {{looking forward to that}} eleven-thirty cocktail.|$|R
