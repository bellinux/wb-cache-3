50|$|In 2011, WAYV/WAIV, {{along with}} sister station WZXL, were named {{official}} stations of <b>the</b> Wildwoods <b>boardwalk.</b> Because <b>the</b> WAIV frequency is much stronger near Wildwood {{than in other}} towns in the listening area, the 102.3 frequency was advertised slightly more during this time than it is closer to Atlantic City. This included signs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk's</b> famous tram cars advertising both frequencies.|$|R

While bikes are allowed on all pathways and trails in the park, please walk your bikes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boardwalks.</b> <b>The</b> launch ramp provides {{one of the few}} clear routes in the San Jose area through the salt marshes out to the open waters of the San Francisco Bay.|$|R

The anchor, which is 2 ½ tons, was {{recovered}} from the Sailboat Wreck in 1870 by the commercial clam vessel Star Light. It is now located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk</b> for people to admire the history of it. The Atlantic Hotel, located at 401 S Baltimore Ave, is another historical site that is also still open for business. After a fire that destroyed the original and first ever hotel in Ocean City, Maryland, the Atlantic Hotel was rebuilt in 1926 {{and is one of the}} oldest and most historic hotels in Ocean City. The Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum is another historical site originally called the Ocean City Life-Saving Station.

It was built in 1891, and after much debate over having it demolished, the station was saved and eventually dedicated as a museum in 1978. The museum attracts people due to the interesting facts and exhibits of ocean life, nature, and life-saving services.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the crowds}} onto the boardwalks were gamblers, pickpockets and {{confidence}} men, so Paragon Park was {{built as a}} safe place for those seeking amusement. [...] Called a [...] "marvel of fantasy," [...] it once featured a ride based on the Johnstown Flood. [...] The complex closed in 1984 when the property was sold for condominium development. [...] Today, the only surviving remnants of Paragon Park <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk</b> are the historic carousel and clock tower.|$|E

[...] Sabina is present, also, {{in the guise of a}} scheming beauty queen, who tries to steal George's affection from his wife and family. [...] Although the conventioneers are rowdy and partying furiously, there is an undercurrent of foreboding, since the weather signals change from summery sunshine to hurricane to deluge. (A fortune teller had previously attempted to warn them about this but had been ignored). Gladys and George each attempt their individual rebellions, and are brought back into line by the family. [...] The act ends with the family members reconciled and, paralleling the Bibilical story of Noah's Ark, directing pairs of animals to safety on a large boat where they survive the storm and/or the end of the world.|$|E
2500|$|During the Summer of 1888, Herbert became Seidl's {{assistant}} {{conductor of}} the New York Philharmonic's ten-week summer concert seasons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boardwalk</b> at Brighton Beach, a prestigious post. Seidl's concert seasons made Brighton Beach an important New York musical venue each summer. Herbert conducted the 80-piece orchestra in lighter works paired with more serious repertoire at summer concerts and festivals {{over the next few}} years. Herbert's association with the New York Philharmonic ended in 1898, after eleven seasons, serving variously as an assistant conductor, guest conductor and solo cellist. In Fall 1888, soprano Emma Juchs hired Herbert to music direct a [...] "concert party" [...] tour of cities and towns in the midwest that had seen little art music, presenting a quartet of singers in varied programs of songs, operatic scenes and arias to new audiences. The accompaniment was usually pianist Adele Aus de Ohe and Herbert at the cello. The group presented their concerts to wealthy patrons at fashionable private parties and at mostly smaller venues to local audiences, educating them about opera, art songs and contemporary music.|$|E

2500|$|Tourism in the {{off-season}} has picked up pace over the past decade. Today, Ocean City, Maryland {{has become one of}} the most popular vacation areas of the East Coast. Warmer months like June, July, and August attract the most tourists due to the opening of the beaches as well as the many different activities available to do. A [...] "shoulder-season" [...] has been established that ranges in the spring from St. Patrick's Day until Memorial Day Weekend and in the fall from Labor Day Weekend until late October. [...] Many establishments stay open into November and December depending on local events and weather. [...] Numerous special events take place within the town during this shoulder-season, including Sunfest, Springfest, Bike Week, Cruisin' Weekend, Winterfest of Lights and Reach the Beach, which take place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boardwalk</b> and/or in the Roland E. Powell Convention Center. Increased traffic from golfers and these special events have convinced many seasonal restaurants and hotels to open sooner and close down later in the year.|$|E
2500|$|After the king's {{death and}} {{transfer}} {{of his private}} colony to Belgium, there occurred a [...] "Great Forgetting". Many Belgians in the 20th and 21st centuries remember Leopold II as the [...] "Builder King" [...] for his extensive public works projects, and many remain unaware of {{his role in the}} atrocities in the Congo. In the 1990s, the colonial Royal Museum for Central Africa made no mention of the atrocities committed in the Congo Free State, despite the museum's large collection of colonial objects. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk</b> of Blankenberge, a popular coastal resort, a monument shows a pair of colonists as heroes protecting a desperate Congolese woman and child with [...] "civilization". In Ostend, the beach promenade has a 1931 sculptural monument to Leopold II, showing Leopold and grateful Ostend fishermen and Congolese. The inscription accompanying the Congolese group notes: [...] "De dank der Congolezen aan Leopold II om hen te hebben bevrijd van de slavernij onder de Arabieren" [...] ("The gratitude of the Congolese to Leopold II for having liberated them from slavery under the Arabs"). In 2004, an activist group cut off the hand of the leftmost Congolese bronze figure, in protest against the atrocities committed in the Congo. The city council decided to keep the statue in its new form, without the hand.|$|E
2500|$|The Asbury Park {{music scene}} gained {{prominence}} in the 1960s with bands such as the Jaywalkers and many others, who combined rock and roll, rhythm and blues, soul and doo-wop to create {{what became known as}} the Sound of Asbury Park (S.O.A.P.). On December 9, 2006, founding members of S.O.A.P. reunited for the [...] "Creators of S.O.A.P.: Live, Raw, and Unplugged" [...] concert at The Stone Pony and to witness the dedication of a S.O.A.P. plaque <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boardwalk</b> outside of Convention Hall.

5000|$|You {{will see}} it everywhere, on Broadway of every city and Main Street of every town, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boardwalks</b> and beaches of coast resorts, and even in remote farming villages.

Such progressive styles may not reflect the international tastes or etiquette.|$|R
