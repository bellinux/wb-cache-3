30|$|There are {{practical}} advantages to using {{a range of}} entry tests at laparoscopic entry. The usefulness of the aspiration test in outruling insertion of the Veres needle into the bowel or a blood vessel cannot be disputed. Moreover, insufflation of gas through a Veres needle into a blood vessel without any prior checks would be indefensible. This study has shown that multiple non-confirmatory entry tests are {{significantly more likely to}} be associated with multiple Veres entries, not a surprising finding as a surgeon will attempt another entry if multiple tests are non-confirmatory on the first entry attempt. Multiple non-confirmatory test findings were however linked with abnormal entry findings (<b>omental</b> <b>emphysema,</b> anterior retroperitoneal gas or subcutaneous emphysema), although results did not reach significance. We suggest that surgeons using Veres entry continue to use a range of entry tests to confirm correct Veres needle placement.|$|E
30|$|Creation of a {{pneumoperitoneum}} {{with the}} Veres needle at closed laparoscopy {{is not always}} straightforward. There is a potential to insert the needle too superficially causing subcutaneous emphysema or an anterior retroperitoneal gas collection. Insertion of the Veres needle too deeply in the abdominal cavity may cause <b>omental</b> <b>emphysema</b> (a collection of gas within the omentum) or complications such as visceral or vascular injury. A number of tests exists which aim to determine correct placement of the Veres needle. These include the double-click test, aspiration test, saline injection test, falling column and hanging drop tests and the observed intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) following placement of the Veres needle. These tests have not however until recently come under scientific scrutiny and the predictive value {{of some of these}} tests for correct Veres needle placement {{has been shown to be}} poor [8]. Low initial intra-abdominal pressure following Veres needle insertion has been declared a good indicator of correct Veres needle placement by several authors [8, 9].|$|E
40|$|Cryptorchidism is {{the most}} {{frequent}} anomaly in sexual development in male children. The ideal diagnostic method to investigate patients with nonpalpable testes has not been found to date, but many methods have been described. Between 1983 and 1991, 45 patients 2 to 35 years old underwent laparoscopy as a diagnostic method in investigation of nonpalpable testis, and our first laparoscopic pediatric orchiectomy was performed. Of 45 patients studied, 37 (82 %) underwent exploration, and a complete correlation between laparoscopic and operative findings was observed. There were four complications such as subperitoneal or <b>omental</b> <b>emphysema</b> in three patients; however, these conditions did not preclude the complete examination. In one patient, bleeding aroused suspicion of visceral or vascular injury, but laparotomy revealed that the blood came from the abdominal wall. Laparoscopic orchiectomy was indicated in a 5 -year-old child evaluated for ambiguous external genitalia. Based on our experience, we may conclude that in 37 % of nonpalpable testes, a confirmatory operation is not necessary, and laparoscopic orchiectomy is a minimally invasive technique that {{should be used in}} cases in which orchiectomy is indicated...|$|E
30|$|Surgeons {{generally}} used multiple {{tests for}} verification of correct {{placement of the}} Veres needle; the median number of tests used in our study was five. In one in five cases (21 %), at least one entry verification test was non-confirmatory. The entry tests confirmed correct placement of the Veres needle in at least 90 % of cases, when visualisation of anterior retroperitoneal gas, subcutaneous emphysema or <b>omental</b> <b>emphysema</b> were used as visual confirmation of misplacement. However, when all entry tests used were noted to be confirmatory for correct placement, an abnormal entry finding was still seen in 11.7 %. This unexpected finding {{could be explained by}} a Veres needle initially misplaced in the omentum being quickly pushed out of its incorrect location by injected saline or insufflated CO 2 gas. It may also be explained by the surgeon elevating the anterior abdominal wall by the surgeon after display of an initial high pressure, with subsequent normal pressures. High intra-abdominal pressure occasionally also results from too-light anaesthesia, which, if noted, should be addressed prior to the next Veres needle insertion. We omitted loss of liver dullness, a very useful and commonly used sign of correct Veres needle placement. This was an oversight related to focussing on the utility of the various tests pertaining to use of the Veres needle.|$|E
30|$|This {{study was}} a {{prospective}} audit of laparoscopic entry conducted over the 1 -year period August 2005 –July 2006 in a tertiary referral university teaching hospital in Western Australia. A datasheet was developed and circulated to all consultants practising gynaecology in our unit. Comments and suggestions were incorporated into the datasheet before commencement of the study. All gynaecology trainees and consultants performing laparoscopy at our unit {{were asked to complete}} the datasheet following each laparoscopy performed by them. In the theatre holding bay a datasheet was attached to the patient file of women about to undergo a laparoscopic procedure of any type. Information was obtained on patient characteristics, entry details and intra-abdominal findings. Indication for the current laparoscopy was noted and the number and type of prior abdominal surgeries was documented. The surgeon was required to record the following operative details: abdominal wall thickness (“thin”, “normal” or “obese”), entry technique used (Veres, Hasson, optical trocar or a combination), direction of umbilical incision (transverse or longitudinal), site of placement of the Veres needle (umbilical, suprapubic or Palmer’s point), number of attempts at insertion of the Veres needle and primary trocar, entry verification tests used (double click, aspiration, saline injection, falling water column, hanging drop, IAP[*]<[*] 10  mmHg after attachment of the insufflator), presence and number of non-confirmatory entry tests at first attempt at Veres needle insertion, IAP reading prior to insertion of the primary trocar, patient position on the table prior to primary trocar insertion (flat or Trendelenburg), presence of <b>omental</b> <b>emphysema</b> or anterior retroperitoneal gas following entry, occurrence of visceral or vascular injury and presence of abdominopelvic adhesions and their type (omentum, bowel). The surgeon was identified only by her or his level of training, from resident medical officer (equivalent to senior house officer) through to consultant. No post-operative follow-up was undertaken on patients. Following completion, the datasheet was placed in a sealed box in the operating room. Datasheets were collected weekly. The study was conducted over 12  months. Data were analysed upon completion of the study.|$|E
