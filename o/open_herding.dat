40|$|Farms that {{purchase}} replacement {{breeding cattle}} are {{at increased risk}} of introducing many economically important diseases. The objectives of this analysis were to determine whether the total number of replacement breeding cattle purchased by individual farms could be reduced by improving herd performance and to quantify the effects of such reductions on the industry-level transmission dynamics of infectious cattle diseases. Detailed information on the performance and contact patterns of British cattle herds was extracted from the national cattle movement database as a case example. Approximately 69 % of beef herds and 59 % of dairy herds with an average of at least 20 recorded calvings per year purchased at least one replacement breeding animal. Results from zero-inflated negative binomial regression models revealed that herds with high average ages at first calving, prolonged calving intervals, abnormally high or low culling rates, and high calf mortality rates were generally more likely to be <b>open</b> <b>herds</b> and to purchase greater numbers of replacement breeding cattle. If all herds achieved the same level of performance as the top 20 % of herds, the total number of replacement beef and dairy cattle purchased could be reduced by an estimated 34 % and 51 %, respectively. Although these purchases accounted for only 13 % of between-herd contacts in the industry trade network, they were found to have a disproportionately strong influence on disease transmission dynamics. These findings suggest that targeting extension services at herds with suboptimal performance may be an effective strategy for controlling endemic cattle diseases whil...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence and pattern of bovine par atuberculosis occurrence in indigenous and exotic cattle breeds in Wakiso and Masaka districts, Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was carried in these districts with a well-established small-holder commercial dairy system supplying livestock products to major urban centers. Questionnaires were administered to farmers prior to blood sampling. Results revealed farmers operated <b>open</b> <b>herds</b> and were acquiring replacement stock from fellow farmers, cattle traders or donations. Most cattle in Wakiso were zero-grazed with a few grazed on pastures; communally, in paddocks or tethered. In contrast most cattle in Masaka were fed on pastures as opposed to zero grazing. Of 436 adult cattle sero-tested in Wakiso, par atuberculosis was highest in indigenous cattle (15 %), was 8. 3 % in cross-breeds and 5. 8 % in exotic breeds. Individual cow prevalence in Wakiso was 7. 8 % whilst herd prevalence was 36. 23 %. Screening of 384 adult cattle in Masaka revealed prevalence of par atuberculosis of 3. 26, 4. 48 and 4. 9 % in the indigenous breeds, exotic dairy and cross breeds, respectively, with individual cow prevalence of 3. 91 % and herd prevalence of 24. 44 %. The prevalence of par atuberculosis was significantly higher in Wakiso compared to Masaka (p< 0. 05, χ 2 = 5. 5043). The factors associated with increased risk of herd infection included; “where adult cattle were housed”, “adult cattle fed on pasture”, “calves allowed to suckle their mothers” and “calves not separated from their mothers”.

40|$|Abstract Background Porcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome (PRRS) is of major {{concern to the}} swine industry; infection with the virus can lead to production losses, morbidity, and mortality within swine operations. Biosecurity practices related to the management of replacement animals are important for the prevention {{and control of the}} PRRS virus, as well as other diseases. The objectives of this study were: (i) to describe individual biosecurity practices related to the introduction and transportation of replacement gilts on southern Ontario sow farms, and (ii) to understand patterns in the implementation of these practices. The second objective was accomplished using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), which allows visualization of the relationships between individual practices and provides information about which practices frequently occur together, and which practices rarely occur together. These patterns constitute strategies for the implementation of biosecurity practices related to the introduction and transportation of replacement gilts. Data were collected using version 2 of the Production Animal Disease Risk Assessment Program’s survey for the breeding herd. Two subsets of variables were retained for analysis; one subset pertained to how replacements were managed upon arrival to the farm, and the other pertained to the transportation of genetic animals. Results For both subsets of variables, the results of the MCA procedure were similar; in both solutions the 1 st dimension separated herds that were closed with respect to replacement animals from <b>herds</b> that were <b>open,</b> and the 2 nd dimension described how <b>open</b> <b>herds</b> managed replacements. The most interesting finding of this study was that, in some cases where a risky practice was being implemented, it was closely associated with other biosecurity practices that may mitigate that risk. Conclusions The findings from this approach suggest that one cannot always examine biosecurity on a variable-by-variable basis. Even if a practice that is generally considered high-risk is being implemented, it may be balanced by other practices that mitigate that risk. Thus, the overall biosecurity strategy on a farm must be considered instead of only examining the implementation of individual practices. </p...|$|R

Forty- two herds with current DHI information and whose owners or managers completed and returned the questionnaire were used to estimate economic losses due to reproductive problems, especially excessive days open, in Utah and Southeastern Idaho. Average days <b>open</b> for <b>herds</b> surveyed were 122. 4 days {{with a standard deviation}} of 22. 6 days, and a range of 89 to 177 days. Several factors were significantly correlated with days open including services per conception, previous calving interval, and missed heats. Missed heats accounted for most of the variability in days open with an r 2 of. 82. Surveyed dairymen were losing an average $ 1. 22 per cow per day due to excessive days open beyond 90 days. In addition they were losing approximately $ 22. 87 per cow per year due to reproductive levels inferior to the top expected levels and veterinary costs associated with reproductive problems other than excessive days open. Although this is the estimated average loss in Utah and Southeastern Idaho, dairymen should try to determine losses in their own herds due to reproductive problems because of the extreme variability which exists among herds.

Even with the decrease in manufactured items produced with lead, contaminants persist in the landscape and may enter the food supply through animal products. Changing patterns of <b>open</b> range <b>herds</b> moving to new pasture and the increased popularity of urban/suburban backyard chickens or other livestock necessitates public awareness about the clinical signs of lead intoxication, the potential for subclinical animals, public health concerns, particularly for exposure in children, and testing options available. Cases of lead intoxication in livestock demand a thorough case work-up to identify all sources of lead, address subclinical cases, evaluate risk to consumers, and make management suggestions for future prevention. We discuss four recent cases of confirmed lead poisoning in backyard chickens and open range cattle and assess the public health implications therein. Taken {{as a whole and}} considering the potential of the remaining herd or flock to be affected without necessarily showing signs, public health officials and veterinarians should be prepared to advise clients on case work-up and management and prevention considerations. Backyard chickens and cattle may not present for suspected lead poisoning as in several of the cases discussed herein yet may still contain concerning tissue or blood levels.

40|$|The overall {{aim of the}} {{research}} reported in this thesis was to investigate ways to mitigate deterioration in functional traits and reduce the environmental impact of milk production. The more specific objectives were to obtain new information about the selection of bull dams for functional traits in an <b>open</b> nucleus <b>herd,</b> to monitor ongoing genetic trends in functional traits, and to examine a breeding program with genomic selection and contractor herds that records specific indicator traits correlated with environmental impact. A breeding scheme with expanded recording of functional traits in potential bull dams in a nucleus herd was simulated. The genetic trend in functional traits was found to be unfavourable in all scenarios. Improved recording of functional traits did not limit the unfavourable genetic response in fertility and udder health traits unless more economic weight was placed on functional traits in the breeding goal. Genetic trends in fertility and udder health traits were estimated in Swedish Red dairy cattle. The estimated genetic trend for number of inseminations in lactating cows was unfavorable. The choice of model to be used for genetic evaluation influences the estimate of genetic trend, indicating that unfavorable genetic trends may not be discovered unless the traits are evaluated in a multiple-trait model including both functional and production traits. Substantial genetic progress in breeding for environmentally friendly cows can be achieved by including environmental impact in the breeding goal, and by using phenotype records and genomic information on correlated indicator traits. The most valuable indicator traits are those with a strong genetic correlation with environmental impact that also have a high accuracy of direct genomic values. Breakeven prices for recording the indicator trait were calculated for all scenarios. They varied considerably from one scenario to another, depending on the number of phenotype records on indicator traits. Recording an indicator trait could be both genetically and economically advantageous where the genetic correlation between the trait in question and environmental impact is strong, the trait has an optimal number of phenotype records, and the reliability of direct genomic values is moderately high. ...|$|R

2500|$|The end of {{the bison}} <b>herds</b> <b>opened</b> up {{millions}} of acres for cattle ranching. Spanish cattlemen had introduced cattle ranching and longhorn cattle to the Southwest in the 17th century, {{and the men who}} worked the ranches, called [...] "vaqueros", were the first [...] "cowboys" [...] in the West. After the Civil War, Texas ranchers raised large herds of longhorn cattle. The nearest railheads were 800 or more miles (130+ km) north in Kansas (Abilene, Kansas City, Dodge City, and Wichita). So once fattened the ranchers and their cowboys drove the herds north along the Western, Chisholm, and Shawnee trails. The cattle were shipped to Chicago, St. Louis, and points east for slaughter and consumption in the fast-growing cities. The Chisholm Trail, laid out by cattleman Joseph McCoy along an old trail marked by Jesse Chisholm, was the major artery of cattle commerce, carrying over 1.5 million head of cattle between 1867 and 1871 over the [...] from south Texas to Abilene, Kansas. The long drives were treacherous, especially crossing water such as the Brazos and the Red River and when they had to fend off Indians and rustlers looking to make off with their cattle. A typical drive would take three to four months and contained two miles (3km) of cattle six abreast. Despite the risks, a successful drive proved very profitable to everyone involved, as the price of one steer was $4 in Texas and $40 back East.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 For {{centuries in}} what is now {{southern}} Kenya and northern Tanzania, nomadic, Maasai livestock herders have coexisted with vast populations of wildlife. Today, both wildlife and the Maasai herding lifestyle, a vital component of Maasai culture, are threatened by changes to the landscape and losses in mobility, including the policy of privatization and subdivision of communally owned Maasai Group ranches in Kenya. Based on the claims and practices of Maasai livestock herders living in southern Kenya as well as observations and conversations with key informants, this study describes the relationships between traditional livestock <b>herding,</b> <b>open</b> space, and wildlife and how subdivision as affected traditional livestock herding as a land use. Key findings were that the subdivision presents both challenges and opportunities for conservation Maasai communities. This study provides new insights into how livestock herders are adapting to privatization and how subdivision is affecting traditional decision-making and social interactions regarding natural resource management and the ability to adapt to a changing climate. Subdivision has fragmented the social and biological landscapes that the Maasai have traditionally relied on for subsistence. Subdivision has made it difficult for livestock to access water and to negotiate dry seasons and survive droughts. Elders no longer have jurisdiction over livestock herding, and migrating to seasonal pastures is no longer feasible for many livestock herders as subdivision has brought an end to communal reserves. Traditional resource management and sharing mechanisms are threatened by subdivision and the selling of land to outsiders. Many landowners are sharing access to grazing land and water resources in order to continue keeping livestock. Because of subdivision wildlife/human interactions have increased and, in some cases, wildlife are no longer present in great numbers. Other factors contributing to the difficulties brought about by subdivision include climate change and human population growth...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Biosecurity {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of the fight against infectious diseases in animal populations. Few research studies have attempted to identify and quantify the effectiveness of biosecurity against disease introduction or presence in cattle farms and, when done, they have relied on the collection of on-farm data. Data on environmental, animal movement, demographic/husbandry systems and density disease determinants can be collated without requiring additional specific on-farm data collection activities, since they have already been collected for some other purposes. The aim of this study was to classify cattle herds according to their risk of disease presence as a proxy for compromised biosecurity in the cattle population of Wales in 2004 for risk-based surveillance purposes. Results Three data mining methods have been applied: logistic regression, classification trees and factor analysis. Using the cattle holding population in Wales, a holding was considered positive if at least bovine TB or one of the ten most frequently diagnosed infectious or transmissible non-notifiable diseases in England and Wales, according to the Veterinary Investigation Surveillance Report (VIDA) had been diagnosed in 2004. High-risk holdings can be described as <b>open</b> large cattle <b>herds</b> located in high-density cattle areas with frequent movements off to many locations within Wales. Additional risks are associated with the holding being a dairy enterprise and with a large farming area. Conclusion This work has demonstrated the potential of mining various livestock-relevant databases to obtain generic criteria for individual cattle herd biosecurity risk classification. Despite the data and analytical constraints the described risk profiles are highly specific and present variable sensitivity depending on the model specifications. Risk profiling of farms provides a tool for designing targeted surveillance activities for endemic or emerging diseases, regardless of the prior amount of information available on biosecurity at farm level. As the delivery of practical evidence-based information and advice is one of the priorities of Defra's new Animal Health and Welfare Strategy (AHWS), data-driven models, derived from existing databases, need to be developed that can then be used to inform activities during outbreaks of endemic diseases and to help design surveillance activities. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the field}} study was to {{investigate}} factors influencing udder health and fertility in fifteen commercial dairy farms in Schleswig-Holstein (Northern Germany). From January 1997 to December 1998 sterile quarter foremilk samples of 960 +- 49 lactating cows were collected once monthly for cytobacteriological analysis. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested in 791 strains of mastitis pathogens. A clinical examination of the udders was carried out between the 14 th and the 80 th day of lactation. Data concerning management, milking routine, disease frequency and treatments, drying off, calving and culling were recorded every month. Prevalence of quarters infected with mastitis pathogens was 16. 0 % in 1997, slightly increasing to 18. 5 % in 1998. Somatic cell count decreased from 78, 462 (geometric mean) in 1997 to 70, 272 in 1998. Staphylococcus spp. were the predominant mastitis pathogens with a quarter prevalence of 12. 9 % in 1997 and 15. 7 % in 1998, resp., followed by Streptococcus spp. with 2. 6 % and 2. 9 %, resp. In both years less than 1 % of quarters were infected with other mastitis pathogens including Sc. agalactiae. The percentage of ß-lactamase producing staphylococci strains decreased from 59. 6 % in 1997 to 44. 7 % in 1998. The incidence of clinical mastitis decreased from 4. 8 +- 1. 4 % per 100 cows and month to 4. 4 +- 1. 1 % in 1998. During the study 673 of all recorded 1990 cows (33. 8 %) suffered at least once from clinical mastitis, 34. 4 % of these cows had at least two episodes of clinical mastitis. Throughout lactation 38. 9 % of clinical cases of mastitis were observed during the first 50 days post partum. Somatic cell count of quarters was significantly influenced by herd x season, calving season, parity, stage of lactation, bacteriological status and milk yield. Udder and teat conformation had little influence on somatic cell count. Factors with a significant influence on milk yield throughout lactation were herd x season, calving season, breed, parity, stage of lactation, subclinical and clinical mastitis. Clinical mastitis was detected in 11. 2 % of multiparous and 7. 4 % of primiparous cows during the first month of lactation. The risk of multiparous cows to develop clinical mastitis post partum was increased with higher parity, with subclinical mastitis before drying off, high prevalence of mastitis pathogens of the herd in the calving month, high milk yield before drying off and with placenta retention. Primiparous cows had an increased risk to develop clinical mastitis in the first month of lactation when calving occurred during winter. Greater teat diameters, diseases during the early puerperium and high mean milk yields in the herd and deep udders were also associated with an increased risk. The risk for placenta retention in multiparous cows was higher in cows infected with Streptococcus spp. before drying off than in cows without infection. Calving during winter, dry periods less than 40 days and high mean milk yields in the herd were associated with an increased risk for retained placenta. Mean calving to first insemination interval was 81. 1 ? 31. 3 days and was significantly influenced by herd x season, parity, fat and protein corrected milk yield, placenta retention, reproductive and metabolic disorders. In cows with subclinical mastitis the interval was prolonged by 11. 7 days. Mean days open were 104. 6.
