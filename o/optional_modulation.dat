30|$|The {{physical}} layer specification of the IEEE 802.15. 4 standard is reported in[10]. It defines {{the characteristics of}} the {{physical layer}} such as spreading, despreading, modulation, and demodulation of the signal. It uses the DSSS as a spreading technique to reduce the effect of noise and interference from other networks. The IEEE 802.15. 4 operates in three different frequency bands: 868 MHz in Europe, 915 MHz in the USA, and 2.4 GHz globally. In the 868 - and 915 -MHz bands, there are three <b>optional</b> <b>modulation</b> schemes: binary phase shift keying (BPSK), offset quadrature phase shift keying (O-QPSK), and parallel sequence spread spectrum. Depending on the modulation scheme, a data rate of 250 kbps at 2.4 GHz, from 20 to 250 kbps at 868 MHz, and from 40 to 250 kbps at 915 MHz can be supported.|$|E
40|$|This descriptive-qualitative {{research}} {{investigated the}} modulation phenomena and measured the accuracy {{level of the}} phenomena occurring in the translated text. It involved 40 students at the fifth semester of English education program in STAIN Jurai Siwo Metro. The data were taken from each participant‟s translated texts using observation and documentation. The kinds of text are scientific and literary texts. Both texts contain 20 modulation phenomena. All of the phenomena were analyzed by comparing the proper translation text with the translated text produced by the students and then measured in the term of accuracy level. The researcher found 11 Fixed Modulation (FM) and 9 <b>Optional</b> <b>Modulation</b> (OM). In the term of accuracy, the FM is more accurate than OM but OM has a lower inaccurate level than FM has. Related to the accuracy percentage of all phenomena, there are 16 % categorized as accurate, 39 % as less accurate, and 45 % as inaccurate. In conclusion, the students are still lack of the accuracy in modulation so {{that they should be}} able to let themselves free from influential factors of the source language structure and to express natural and equivalent translation in target language...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this essay}} {{is to find out}} what kinds of {{adaption}} are necessary when translating an English text from a specialist book into a text that will suit Swedish students in upper secondary school. In order to obtain the data needed for the study I translated a part of a chapter from the book North American Indian Wars by Richard H. Dillon. The analysis focuses on how to make the target text as clear and unambiguous as possible for the intended readers and what methods can be used to reach this aim. The analysis shows that one kind of adaption that had to be made during the translation process mainly consisted of additions and omissions. The additions were made in order to clarify certain passages in the source text that otherwise could have been difficult for the target readers to understand. The omissions, on the other hand, were often made {{due to the fact that}} some of the words or phrases in the source text are very specific and may refer to things that may be unknown to the target readers. In some cases such words or phrases could be omitted without making the target text lose any vital information, and in some cases they had to be exchanged with an explanation or a word that would be easier for the intended readers to understand. Apart from addition and omission of information, Vinay and Darbelnet’s procedures of modulation and equivalence were used in order to make the target text accessible to the target readers. The analysis shows that obligatory modulation had to be used due to differences in point of view between English and Swedish, whereas <b>optional</b> <b>modulation</b> was used to suit the target readers’ level of attainment. The analysis also shows that Vinay and Darbelnet’s procedure of equivalence was very useful when translating idioms, metaphors and similes in order to make the target text easy to understand for the target readers...|$|E
