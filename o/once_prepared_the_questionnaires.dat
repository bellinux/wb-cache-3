40|$|The Czech {{labour market}} showed a {{positive}} falling {{trend in the}} unemployment rate of university graduates between 2003 and 2008. Problems stemming from the economic crisis in 2008 significantly affected the labour market. New university graduates, whose numbers are increasing every year, suddenly became a major risk group. The gap between the requirements of demand and supply is increasing on the labour market. Employers currently have a lack of skilled workers. New college graduates are regrettably not interested in these professions, and their career aspirations are generally focused on business and the creative professions, often supported by marketing. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the career aspirations of Czech university students interested in business management. This article is based on primary research carried out among Czech university students in September 2012 (220 out of 386 undergraduates participated in the study at the Faculty of Management and Economics at Tomas Bata University in Zlin. Of those, 57 % would like to work as managers after the completion of their university studies).
