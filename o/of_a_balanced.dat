After {{the end of the}} {{government}} shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress {{would not be able to}} draft a balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E

Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E

The effort was an extension of existing programs that use fees for offshore drilling permits to expand or build parks. At the same time, Jewell publicly pledged to work with President Obama to preserve mountains and rivers, with or without Congressional action. Existing laws, such as the 1906 Antiquities Act, give the president broad authority to preserve land, a power Jewell indicated she and the President were prepared to use as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> approach between development and conservation.|$|E

25|$|The best {{possible}} prediction method would yield {{a point in}} the upper left corner or coordinate (0,1) of the ROC space, representing 100% sensitivity (no false negatives) and 100% specificity (no false positives). The (0,1) point is also called a perfect classification. A random guess would give a point along a diagonal line (the so-called line of no-discrimination) from the left bottom to the top right corners (regardless of the positive and negative base rates). An intuitive example of random guessing is a decision by flipping coins. As the size of the sample increases, a random classifier's ROC point migrates towards the diagonal line. In the case <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> coin, it will migrate to the point (0.5, 0.5).|$|E

40|$|The {{earliest}} concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> {{nature in}} Western thought {{saw it as}} being provided by gods but requiring human aid or encouragement for its maintenance. With the rise of Greek natural philosophy, emphasis shifted to traits gods endowed species with at the outset, rather than human actions, as key to maintaining the <b>balance.</b> The dominance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> constantly intervening God in the Middle Ages lessened interest in the inherent features of nature that would contribute to balance, but the Reformation led to renewed focus on such features, particularly traits of species that would maintain all of them but permit none to dominate nature. Darwin conceived of nature in balance, and his emphasis on competition and frequent tales of felicitous species interactions supported the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> nature. But Darwin radically changed its underlying basis, from God to natural selection. Wallace was perhaps the first to challenge the very notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> nature as <b>an</b> undefined entity whose accuracy could not be tested. His skepticism was taken up again in the 20 th century, culminating in <b>a</b> widespread rejection <b>of</b> the idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> nature by academic ecologists, who focus rather on a dynamic, often chaotic nature buffeted by constant disturbances.

25|$|While the spin-off's {{format is}} very similar to that of The Apprentice, it adopts a more gentle tone with the young candidates, in {{contrast}} to the approach given to older candidates on the main show.

Throughout the process, the candidates, divided into two teams that they {{at the beginning of the}} competition, take part in a series of business-related tasks, appointing one member of their team as the project manager (PM), with Lord Sugar having Brady and Hewer overseeing the team's performance on each task, while providing the candidates with an upmarket house/apartment to live in during the competition; unlike the main show, the young candidates do not partake in a series of Interviews in the penultimate stage of the contest.|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{reputation}} as a liberal, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against the welfare reform laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun {{voted in favor of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Balanced</b> Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former Majority Leader Harry Reid.|$|E
25|$|The show's initial stage, {{which is}} not filmed, focuses on open auditions and {{interviews}} held across the country; this stage searches for the candidates for a series before filming of it begins, which often attracts thousands of applicants. A second round will usually be held in London for {{a small percentage of}} applicants, who divide into groups and are asked to do various exercises to test their business skills and to gauge how they work as a team. Following this, between 20 and 30 applicants are chosen and given an assessment by a psychologist, receiving further checks by the production team and providing them with references, before the final line-up is selected from this group and filming can begin. The number of candidates who appear in a series has varied over the show's history, though consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> number of men and women; for the first two series, the show featured 14 candidates, increased to 16 between Series 3 to 9 (the fifth series featured 15, as a candidate dropped out with little time left to find a replacement), and later 20 to mark the tenth year of the show (the highest number of any variation of The Apprentice), before eventually consisting of 18 candidates from the eleventh series. Candidates who successfully make it into the show are split into two teams, normally by gender, in which they usually pick a team name {{at the start of the}} process.|$|E

500|$|Vervliet {{comments}} that Granjon [...] "laid {{the foundation for}} our image of the way an Italic should look." [...] Although he was not quite the first designer to use the idea of italics having capitals sloped to complement the roman, he [...] "solved successfully the problem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>balanced</b> inclination of the capitals, a feature much ahead of the designs with a more irregular slope of his Viennese and Mainz predecessors...and even compared to...Garamont. A proper optical harmony of the angle of slope is characteristic for all Granjon’s Italics; it allowed the compositor to use whole lines of capitals without causing too much giddiness." [...] Granjon also cut many swash capitals, which Vervliet describes as [...] "deliciously daring" [...] and have often been copied, for instance in Robert Slimbach's revivals for Adobe (discussed below).|$|E
500|$|Two rival {{plans were}} then {{prepared}} by the Senate Democrats and House Republicans. [...] The Democratic plan would immediately raise the debt limit by $2.7 trillion, enough to last beyond the 2012 elections, and would decrease spending by $900 billion over ten years. [...] The Republican plan would cut a total of $850 billion over ten years, and would raise the debt limit in two stages: by $1 trillion immediately, enough to last until early 2012, and then would form a bipartisan committee to recommend {{the second half of}} the budget cuts, which upon being passed by Congress would increase the debt limit by another $1.6 trillion. [...] Neither plan included revenue increases or cuts to entitlement programs. [...] The vote on the Republican plan was delayed several times as more conservative members of the caucus refused to support it. [...] After being altered to again require passage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Balanced</b> Budget Amendment before the second stage of debt limit increases, it passed the House 218–210, with 22 Republicans opposing the bill. [...] It was defeated in the Senate two hours later by a vote of 59–41, as the Democratic plan was prepared to be taken up there.|$|E
500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now... {{if ever there was a}} time when it was necessary to put our house in order, it is now."
