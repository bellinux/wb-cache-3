25|$|The derived {{category}} {{allows us}} to encapsulate all derived functors RnF in one functor, namely the so-called total derived functor RF: D+(A) → D+(B). It is the following composition: D+(A) ≅ K+(Inj(A)) → K+(B) → D+(B), where the first equivalence of categories is described above. The classical derived functors {{are related to the}} total one via RnF(X) = Hn(RF(X)). <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the RnF forget the chain complex and keep only the cohomologies, whereas RF does keep track of the complexes.|$|E
25|$|Surrealists {{have also}} drawn on sources as {{seemingly}} diverse as Clark Ashton Smith, Montague Summers, Horace Walpole, Fantômas, The Residents, Bugs Bunny, comic strips, the obscure poet Samuel Greenberg and the hobo writer and humourist T-Bone Slim. <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Surrealist strands {{may be found}} in movements such as Free Jazz (Don Cherry, Sun Ra, Cecil Taylor etc.) and even in the daily lives of people in confrontation with limiting social conditions. Thought of as the effort of humanity to liberate imagination as an act of insurrection against society, Surrealism finds precedents in the alchemists, possibly Dante, Hieronymus Bosch, Marquis de Sade, Charles Fourier, Comte de Lautreamont and Arthur Rimbaud.|$|E

25|$|If {{a problem}} X is in C and hard for C, then X {{is said to}} be {{complete}} for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally hard, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, {{in the sense that they}} are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P=NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P=NP.|$|E
25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex situs, as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.|$|E
500|$|Addition {{of a text}} can {{effectively}} change the programmatic intent of a composition, as with the two choral symphonies of Franz Liszt. Both the Faust and Dante symphonies were conceived as purely instrumental works and only later became choral symphonies. However, while Liszt authority Humphrey Searle asserts that Liszt's later inclusion of a chorus effectively sums up Faust and makes it complete, another Liszt expert, Reeves Shulstad, suggests that Liszt changed the work's dramatic focus {{to the point of}} meriting a different interpretation of the work itself. According to Shulstad, [...] "Liszt's original version of 1854 ended with a last fleeting reference to Gretchen and an ... orchestral peroration in C major, based on the most majestic of themes from the opening movement. <b>One</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this conclusion remains within the persona of Faust and his imagination". When Liszt rethought the piece three years later, he added a [...] "Chorus mysticus", the male chorus singing the final words from Goethe's Faust. The tenor soloist, accompanied by the chorus, sings the last two lines of the text. [...] "With the addition of the 'Chorus Mysticus' text", Shulstad writes, [...] "the Gretchen theme has been transformed and she no longer appears as a masked Faust. With this direct association to the final scene of the drama we have escaped Faust's imaginings and are hearing another voice commenting on his striving and redemption".|$|E

From his {{philosophical}} heritage came Abraham's use of transphenomenology and anasemia: 'We {{will encounter}} this transphenomenological motif again, which, {{along with the}} anasemic rule, has long oriented this research'.

2500|$|Apparitional {{experiences}} appear {{prima facie}} more {{compatible with the}} philosophical theory of representationalism. [...] According to this theory, the immediate objects of experience when we are perceiving the world normally are representations of the world, rather than the world itself. [...] These representations have been variously called sense-data or images.

2500|$|In {{the case}} of the voltage amplifier, the output voltage βVout of the {{feedback}} network is applied in series and with an opposite polarity to the input voltage Vx travelling over the loop (but in respect to ground, the polarities are the same). As a result, the effective voltage across and the current through the amplifier input resistance Rin decrease so that the circuit input resistance increases (<b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Rin apparently increases).

2500|$|The second {{question}} arising from divine foreknowledge of future contingents concerns {{the means by}} which God knows such events. [...] Craig says that the question presupposes a tensed or A-theory of time, for on a tenseless or B-Theory of time there is no ontological distinction between past, present, and future, so that contingent events which are future relative to us are no more difficult for God to know than contingent events which are, relative to us, past or present. [...] Distinguishing between perceptualist and conceptualist models of divine cognition, Craig says that models which construe God's foreknowledge of the future along perceptualist lines (God foresees what will happen) are difficult to reconcile with a tensed theory of time (though <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> God perceives the present truth-values of future contingent propositions). He does not similarly challenge a conceptualist model which construes God's knowledge along the lines of innate ideas.|$|E
2500|$|Properly speaking, Georgian {{does not}} {{distinguish}} nouns from adjectives; rather, it distinguishes modifiers from modified by relative {{position in the}} nominal clause. [...] As a result of this, things that might sound like adjectives can have substantive force in Georgian: [...] one could say mindoda lurji ts'igni ("I would like the blue book") or just mindoda lurji ("I would like the blue one"). [...] The declension of these adjective-like modifiers {{is different from that}} of nouns, but like that of nouns, it depends on whether the root of the adjective ends with a consonant or a vowel: a vowel-final-stem adjective is identical in all cases, while a consonant-final-stem adjective changes from case to case. (Put another way, <b>one</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> vowel-final-stem adjectives do not actually decline for case.) The following table presents declensions of the adjectives did- ("big") and ch'aghara- ("grey-haired" [...] actually used for people) with the noun datv- ("bear").|$|E
