40|$|Abstract. Internal {{gettering}} (IG) {{behavior for}} Fe, Ni and Cu in Czochralski (CZ) silicon wafers has been studied. Oxygen precipitates for IG were formed in wafers using three different thermal simulation processes (Low, Medium and High). Dependence of the <b>oxide</b> <b>precipitate</b> density {{as a function}} of oxygen concentration at different thermal simulation processes was evaluated from etch pits created by Secco etching. It was found that the <b>oxide</b> <b>precipitate</b> density is strongly dependent on the oxygen concentration, rather than the thermal simulation processes applied. Almost 100 % of gettering efficiency (GE) was measured for Fe, Ni and Cu in the wafers with high <b>oxide</b> <b>precipitate</b> densities. Poor gettering efficiency was realized for Fe, Ni and Cu in the wafers with low oxygen concentration at all three thermal simulation processes. The result of this study suggested a strong correlation between gettering efficiency and <b>oxide</b> <b>precipitate</b> density. It is found that the critical oxygen precipitation density necessary for effective gettering is more than 1 E 9 /cm 3.

40|$|One of {{the reasons}} why the {{principal}} gettering mechanism of copper at oxide precipitates is not yet clarified is that {{it was not possible to}} identify the presence and measure the copper concentration in the vicinity of oxide precipitates. To overcome the problem we used a 14. 5 nm thick thermal oxide layer as a model system for an <b>oxide</b> <b>precipitate</b> to localize the place where the copper is collected. We also analyzed a plate-like <b>oxide</b> <b>precipitate</b> by EDX and EELS and compared the results with the analysis carried out on the oxide layer.

As the results of these experiments also show that copper segregates at the SiO interface layer of the thermal oxide it is concluded that gettering of copper by oxide precipitates is based on segregation of copper to the SiO interface layer. © The Author(s) 2015.
