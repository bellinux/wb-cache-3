Needless to say, businesses need to rely on their machine park to function as planned, avoiding stops in production due to machine failures. This is where fault detection methods play a very important part. In this thesis a specific fault detection method based on signal analysis will be considered. When testing a robot for fault(s), a specific <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> (trajectory) is executed {{in order to be able}} to compare test data from different test occasions. Furthermore, different <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> yield different measurements to analyse, which may affect the performance of the analysis. The question posed is: Can we find an optimal <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> so that the fault is best revealed in the test data? The goal of this thesis is to, using regression analysis, investigate how the presently executed <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> in a specific diagnosis method relates to the faults that are monitored (in this case a so called friction fault) and decide if a different one should be recommended. The data also includes representations of two disturbances. The results from the regression show that the variation in the test quantities utilised in the diagnosis method are not explained by neither the friction fault or the <b>test</b> <b>cycle.</b> It showed that the disturbances had too large effect on the test quantities. This made it impossible to recommend a different (optimal) <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> based on the analysis...|$|R

The <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> is intended to provide an in-laboratory verification capability to determine if an engine exceeds the in-use emissions standards. By simulating the real-world driving pattern of the vehicle the <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> provide the most realistic estimation of emission levels in the NTE zone of operation. It is well recognized that traditional laboratory <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> do not provide an accurate representation of a vehicle’s operation on the road under present-day driving conditions. This cycle was developed by collecting and analysing engine activity data and statistical information on heavy-duty vehicle use for different applications under real-world conditions.

40|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} provide versatility to {{the railway}} system {{as they do}} not depend on electric feeding. Worldwide they constitute important parts of locomotive fleets used for various tasks such as mainline services, shunting and terminal operations. The main drawbacks are emissions of CO 2, NOx and other pollutants. The emissions to air are in general controlled by legislation. The European testing and approval procedure for locomotive engines is performed with the ISO 8178 -F <b>test</b> <b>cycle.</b> It is alone meant to resemble all European locomotives. Good correlation was found between mainline operations and the ISO 8178 -F <b>test</b> <b>cycle.</b> A good correlation was furthermore found between shunting operations and North American shunting <b>test</b> <b>cycles.</b> However, this thesis has shown that this results in inadequate description of for instance shunting operations. Typical characteristics for shunting are relatively high ratio of transient loading, low mean power output and high amount of idling. Therefore important aspects of diesel locomotive usage are thereby disregarded in certifications. Deficient correlation between <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> and intended operations may lead to locomotives that are not properly optimised {{for the type of}} operation they are intended for. Improperly dimensioned and optimised locomotives cause impaired fuel economy and more emissions emitted. Many Swedish diesel locomotives are to a large extent used in shunting-like conditions in yards and industries for instance. Therefore, it is recommended to supplement the present ISO <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> with a <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> that includes the characteristic of shunting. Knowledge about duty cycles for specific operations can be of importance in locomotive acquisition, dimensioning of new locomotives or when estimating emissions and/or fuel consumption. It is essential to make proper dimensioning of propulsion systems as it can imply lower life cycle costs as well as fewer emissions. Appropriate dimensioning of the propulsion system is particularly important for non-conventional propulsion systems. If the application range of a <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> is narrow, its emulating capability ought to be better at describing and representing the indented application. Today's <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> state fractional power or torque as a function of engine speed. This may result in misleading duty cycles when the same kind of operation is undertaken with different locomotives that have widespread power ratings. A more powerful locomotive used for the very same load as a less powerful locomotive will result in a different duty cycle. Non-conventional propulsion systems are gaining popularity also in the railway industry where implementation of new technology usually is slow. Dual mode and hybrid systems are two examples. Related to <b>test</b> and duty <b>cycles</b> the build-up of these new propulsion systems change the prerequisites of the propulsion systems. From a duty cycle perspective it is reasonable to implement an additional <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> for non-conventional propulsion systems if the popularity rises. QC 2011111...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus on}} exhaust {{emissions}} {{has increased the}} last decades. In the coming years emission restrictions on nitrogen oxides (NO x) will be intensified while restrictions on PM are still pending consensus. With this, it becomes increasingly important that the emission measurements achieved during engine certification reflects the emissions formed during real engine operation. This study presents results of an assessment of measurement procedures for quantifying NO x and PM emissions from marine diesel engines for certification purposes. The present methods for quantifying NO x are questioned and the feasibility of applying the same measurement procedures for determining PM emissions is investigated. The study {{is based on the}} currently in use measurement procedures with focus on the application of steady state <b>test</b> <b>cycles.</b> For NO x emission concern, the current <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> was compared to cycles that were constructed based on specific vessel operation of a platform supply vessel, an anchor handling vessel and an oil tanker. Comparing the vessel specific <b>cycles</b> and the <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> showed considerable differences in the chosen loads and weighting of them. Calculations where done on total weighted NO x emissions based on the <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> and the constructed cycles. The results, giving difference in total weighted emissions comparing vessel specific <b>cycles</b> and <b>test</b> <b>cycle,</b> were not as distinctive as first thought. The difference found showed an increase or decrease in emissions of approximately 10 %. There were uncertainties to the calculations due to the specific NO x emissions used. The data had been collected from two engines, which might not be representative for a general average of specific emissions. New evaluations should be done with more extensive emission data. An evaluation was done concerning application of the steady state <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> for PM emission measurements. The focus was on evaluating if there are operational conditions inducing PM emissions that are not reflected in the use of <b>test</b> <b>cycle.</b> To evaluate this concern laboratory measurement of PM distribution during transient operation was conducted. The laboratory results gave inconclusive results, thus previous studies on the matter was reviewed. It was found from a study conducted on a ferry, that there was 6. 5 times the number of particles formed during manoeuvring than during the sailing period. To determine the extent of manoeuvring and thereby transient operation, an assessment was made on operation of selected car ferries along the Norwegian coastline. It was found that manoeuvring constituted 5. 5 minutes of a complete voyage, whereas an average of the total voyage duration was found to be 19. 5 minutes. For the vessel from the external study, manoeuvring amounted to a total of 60 minutes, while sailing constituted 150 minutes. By taking the duration of the manoeuvring and sailing into account, a new relationship of PM number was found to be 2. 6 times the amount of particles during manoeuvring than during sailing. For the given vessels, this constitutes that 70 % of the particles formed for a voyage {{can be attributed to the}} manoeuvring phase. The findings give that application of a steady state <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> for these vessels would give a poor reflection of the total emitted particles, and thus a generally applied <b>test</b> <b>cycle</b> should include transient loads in addition to the steady state. Current <b>test</b> <b>cycles</b> used for NO x quantification is with basis from my results unsuited for PM measurements. </p...|$|R
