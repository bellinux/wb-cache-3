The authors received some funding from SINPHONIE (European Commission service contract of the DG Sanco). Abstract Background/Aims: School indoor air quality is important because children {{spend most of their time}} outside home within the school environment. This study aimed to investigate the school environment and its impact on the respiratory health of the children. Methods: A total of 191 pupils in the 9 - to 11 -year age group were selected from 5 primary state schools. Validated school and health questionnaires, spirometry, acoustic rhinometry, nasal lavage, urine for environmental tobacco smoke biomarkers and traffic counts were used. Results: Cumulative (32. 98 %) and current wheezing (17. 8 %) were in keeping with the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Malta data. Southern schools had the highest prevalence of current wheezers (OR 3. 77; p = 0. 012), rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 3. 59; p = 0. 003) and nasal eosinophilic cationic protein levels (p < 0. 001). Small <b>openable</b> <b>window</b> areas increased rhinitic symptoms (OR 3. 14; p = 0. 016). Classes facing roads had increased current wheezers (OR 2. 27; p = 0. 03) and exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) levels (p < 0. 001). Current wheezing was significantly associated with the number of light and heavy vehicles passing near the school (p < 0. 001). The presence of smokers at home was significantly associated with urinary cotinine and 3 HC (p < 0. 001). Proximity to power plants increased the current wheezers (OR 5. 89; p = 0. 001) who had impaired spirometry (p = 0. 003). Asthma symptoms (OR 5. 25; p = 0. 001) and elevated eCO levels (p < 0. 001) were associated with fuel storage facilities near schools. The accumulation of dust on flat surfaces within classrooms was related to wheezing (OR 5. 23; p = 0. 001). Conclusions: The school environment had a direct impact on the respiratory health of children, with several factors having a direct impact on the children's health. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of ventilative cooling in super {{insulated}} residential buildings with focus on thermal comfort and energy use. The case {{of the study is}} Living Lab, an approximately 100 m 2 detached residential building designed with a mixed-mode ventilation system. The building is currently under construction at NTNU campus in Trondheim, Norway. The simulation software IDA ICE 4. 6 has been used to study ventilative cooling in Living Lab. The results from the simulations have been compared to findings from previous studies. General conclusions on the applicability of ventilative cooling in low-energy dwellings have been drawn. The results from the simulations imply {{that there will be a}} severe risk of overheating in Living Lab if no active or passive cooling techniques are applied. Moreover, the results show that ventilative cooling can prevent overheating without significantly increasing the energy demand. Due to the uncertainties related to increased air velocities, it is not possible to eliminate the risk of overcooling caused by ventilative cooling completely. However, the simulations show that overcooling can be held at an acceptable level. The factors most influencing the need for ventilative cooling in Living Lab are in the following order: solar radiation, outdoor temperature and occupancy. The simulations indicate that the <b>openable</b> <b>window</b> area is not a limiting factor for cooling. The study found that the best way to apply ventilative cooling in Living Lab is to implement a concurrent mixed-mode system where the window control system is only active during the day. This system should be designed to open the south and skylight windows to maximum opening when indoor air temperatures exceed 24 C and close them when indoor air temperatures drops below 22 C. Simulations reveal that this system would reduce the number of overheated hours recorded when not utilizing ventilative cooling with 99 %. The number of overcooled hours was kept at a moderate level, 48 hours/year. This ventilative cooling system would increase energy demand with 52 kWh/year and 4 kWh/year compared to use of only hygienic mechanical ventilation and only enhanced mechanical ventilation, respectively. This assignment and previous research show that overheating in low-energy dwellings is often an issue. It should therefore be addressed during the design process. Overheating in low-energy dwellings can be prevented with ventilative cooling. Ventilative cooling can have a significant positive effect on the thermal environment without having a significant negative effect on the use of energy. In some cases, energy consumption can even be reduced when applying ventilative cooling. Overcooling can be an issue when utilizing ventilative cooling. A careful design process is needed for ventilative cooling to have the desired effect. The process should be individual for each building and climate. A more complex natural ventilation system requires a more accurate and careful design process. Also, the acceptable indoor temperatures for mechanically ventilated buildings often have to be adjusted for buildings intended to utilize ventilative cooling. Even though nighttime ventilative cooling is not applicable in certain lightweight dwellings, it has proven to be effective in buildings with more thermal mass. An automatic window control system is often necessary for ventilative cooling to achieve the desired thermal environment. The occupants should, however, be able to overrule the automatic system...|$|R

The car included a [...] "heavy-duty heater and air conditioner, a pair of radiotelephones, a fire extinguisher, a first-aid kit, and a siren." [...] The exterior featured improved, retractable standing platforms and handles for Secret Service agents, and flashing red lights recessed into the bumper. Unique to the X-100 were three sets of removable roofs (a standard soft top, a lightweight metal one, and a transparent plastic one) and a hydraulic lift that raised the rear cushion 11 in off the floor. Both of these feature sets were designed to make the president more visible to the public. Unfortunately, they were also contributors in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After the Kennedy assassination, the X-100 was redesigned for an estimated cost of $500,000. The redesigned X-100 was painted black and featured [...] "improved telecommunications gear, a more powerful engine and flat-proof tires made of rubber-coated aluminum." [...] The fuel tank was protected against explosion by a [...] "porous foam matrix" [...] that minimized spillage {{in the event of a}} puncture. The passenger compartment was protected by [...] of armor, and the three removable roofs were replaced by a fixed glass enclosure that cost more than $125,000. The glass enclosure was made of thirteen different pieces of bulletproof glass (ranging in thickness from 1 to 1+13/16 in) and was then the largest piece of curved bulletproof glass ever made.

40|$|Ventilative cooling as passive {{technique}} {{can limit}} overheating and decrease cooling energy consumption. The national energy performance regulations (EPBD) determine whether, how and under which requirements ventilative cooling can assist to reduce cooling demand and overheating. Therefore, those regulations {{are a key}} factor in the market uptake of ventilative cooling. Without a realistic and achievable approach, ventilative cooling will marginally be applied in buildings. In this study a kind of sensitivity analysis is performed {{to assess the impact of}} parameter variation on the ventilative cooling effect. One reference dwelling is selected and introduced into the EP software of Belgium, France and The Netherlands. In that way, differences in buildings characteristics between countries on the output are ignored. In the three countries ventilative cooling by means of <b>openable</b> <b>windows</b> can be taken into account, in Belgium and France as a percentage of <b>openable</b> <b>windows,</b> in The Netherlands as present or not. The ability of taking into account the properties of ventilative cooling devices is rare, although they have a significant impact on the effective operating time. As can be expected, ventilative cooling always decreases the cooling demand (28 to 74 % in Belgium, 29 to 35 % in The Netherlands for the studied case), especially in combination with mobile solar shading. Similar to the cooling demand, the risk on overheating in Belgium decreases by applying ventilative cooling. In France, summer indoor temperature can be strongly reduced by using <b>openable</b> <b>windows,</b> although the fraction <b>openable</b> <b>windows</b> has no effect. In The Netherlands, the risk on overheating cannot be assessed. The overall primary energy consumption of the reference dwelling is lower when ventilative cooling is applied (up to 9 % in Belgium and up to 3 % in The Netherlands) except for France where <b>openable</b> <b>windows</b> remarkably increase the heating demand (up to 29 %). The remarkable differences between the national energy performance procedures urge the need for a European ventilative cooling standard to harmonize national energy regulations...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of providing thermal control systems on occupants' wellbeing in two particular European contexts, including a Norwegian cellular plan office {{with high levels of}} thermal control and a British open plan office with limited thermal control. The former provided each occupant with a personal office, within which <b>openable</b> <b>windows,</b> blinds, door and the ability to control the temperature was provided. In the Norwegian approach, personal differences in perceiving the thermal environment were respected and the architectural design of the building allowed each individual to set the thermal environment. In contrast, limited <b>openable</b> <b>windows</b> were provided for occupants seated {{around the perimeter of the}} building in the open plan office. The main strategy in the British approach was to provide a uniform thermal environment for all occupants according to the standard comfort zone. Natural ventilation was the main system, while in the Norwegian practice a combination of natural ventilation and air conditioning was in operation. As a result, the energy use of the Norwegian practice was much higher than the British practice. A field study of thermal comfort was applied with a particular emphasis on grounded theory. Survey questionnaires, environmental measurements and interviews were conducted. The Norwegian occupants reported much higher health rate up to 40 % compared to those in the British practice.

40|$|Poor {{acoustic}} insulation of building façades is often caused by poor mounting conditions and poor final set-up of <b>openable</b> <b>windows.</b> For the first, when wrong materials {{are used to}} obturate {{the gap between the}} window and the construction, the subsequent decrease in {{acoustic insulation}} can be observed in a wider range of frequencies. A poor final set-up of the window will usually lead to whistle noises inside the rooms, especially next to busy roads. Consequently, the aims of this investigation are to evaluate different methods to detect acoustical failures in <b>openable</b> <b>windows,</b> and to present an efficient approach to optimise the sound insulation of a façade. By means of experimental measurements in the acoustic laboratory on a standard openable window, two different and complimentary approaches are compared to evaluate its acoustical quality and failures. More specifically, the first is based on the standard sound insulation measurement according to EN ISO 140 - 3, and the second consists of ultrasonic measurements. The experimental results demonstrate that the standard sound insulation measurements enables to evaluate the quantitative impact of different parameters governing acoustical failures, {{such as the use of}} the correct gasket, continuity and correct amount of pressure applied on the gasket. In addition, it was observed that the ultrasonic measurements enable a quick qualitative assessment that is very efficient to determine the exact position of the acoustic leaks in the façade. Finally, a combined use of standard and ultrasonic measurements is proposed to deliver an efficient approach to detect acoustical failures of a façade. The ultrasonic approach is a quick and cost-effective way to instantly track deficiencies of a window on site, whereas the standard measurement in the laboratory is more time consuming but needed to guarantee the performance of a building element. status: publishe...|$|E

Numerical studies on the fire-induced air velocity, temperature, and pressure fields under steady burning in a highrise building are reported in this paper. A high building with 12 rooms (four storeys and three rows) of length 5 m, width 12 m, and height 15. 2 m was considered. Every room is of length 5 m, width 4 m, and height 3. 8 m. To allow complete development of the flow at the opening, the computational domain was extended 4 m in length, 2 m in width on both sides, and 5. 5 m in height outside the building. A fire of size 0. 83 m by 1. 2 m by 0. 4 m and of constant heat release rate was located. The technique of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used.

This paper presents a numerical study on the heat release rate (HRR) of wood chipboard in a gasoline fire that breaks out in a compartment with two opposite openings under different wind speeds of 1. 0 ms 1, 2. 0 ms- 1, 5. 0 ms 1 and 10. 0 ms- 1. Three different grid sizes were tested. For each grid resolution, three slice file output quantities suggested for measuring errors in the velocity and scalar fields were selected for comparison. The predicted results show that wind action would increase the HRR of a ventilation-controlled fire, and decrease the HRR of a fuel-controlled fire due to cooling and dilution of air. The HRR in the fire growth phase of wood in a gasoline fire in the same compartment with a single door opening was validated with full-scale burning experiments without wind action. The HRR in the fire growth phase in the compartment with two openings on opposite walls was then compared with the experimental data.

40|$|People with low-income often {{experience}} higher {{exposures to}} air pollutants. We compared {{the exposure to}} particulate matter (PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10), Black Carbon (BC) and ultrafine particles (PNC; 0. 02 - 1 µm) for typical commutes by car, bus and underground from 4 London areas with different levels of income deprivation (G 1 to G 4, from most to least deprived). The highest BC and PM concentrations were found in G 1 while the highest PNC in G 3. Lowest concentrations for all pollutants were observed in G 2. We found no systematic relationship between income deprivation and pollutant concentrations, suggesting that differences between transport modes are a stronger influence. The underground showed the highest PM concentrations, followed by buses and a much lower concentrations in cars. BC concentrations in the underground were overestimated due to Fe interference. BC concentrations were also higher in buses than cars because of a lower infiltration of outside pollutants into the car cabin. PNCs were highest in buses, closely followed by cars, but lowest in underground due {{to the absence of}} combustion sources. Concentration in the road modes (car and bus) were governed by the traffic conditions (such as traffic flow interruptions) at the specific road section. Exposures were reduced in trains with non-openable windows compared to those with <b>openable</b> <b>windows.</b> People from lower income deprivation areas have a predominant use of car, receiving the lowest doses (RDD< 1 µg h- 1) during commute but generating the largest emissions per commuter. Conversely, commuters from higher income deprivation areas have a major reliance on the bus, receiving higher exposures (RDD between 1. 52 - 3. 49 µg h- 1) while generating less emissions per person. These findings suggest an aspect of environmental injustice and a need to incorporate the socioeconomic dimension in life-course exposure assessments...|$|E
40|$|There are {{few studies}} on {{rhinitis}} and {{sick building syndrome}} (SBS) among students in tropical countries. We studied associations between levels of five fungal DNA sequences, two mycotoxins (sterigmatocystin and verrucarol) and cat allergen (Fel d 1) levels in schools and rhinitis and other weekly SBS symptoms in the students. Fungal DNA was measured by quantitative PCR and cat allergen by ELISA. Pupils (N = 462) from eight randomly selected schools in Johor Bahru, Malaysia participated (96 %). Dust samples were collected by cotton swabs and Petri dishes exposed for one week. None of the schools had a mechanical ventilation system, but all classrooms had <b>openable</b> <b>windows</b> that were kept open during lectures and indoor CO 2 levels were low (mean 492 ppm; range 380 - 690 ppm). Weekly nasal symptoms (rhinitis) (18. 8 %), ocular (11. 6 %), throat (11. 1 %), dermal symptoms, headache (20. 6 %) and tiredness (22. 1 %) were common. Total fungal DNA in swab samples was associated with rhinitis (p = 0. 02), ocular symptoms (p = 0. 009) and tiredness (p = 0. 001). There were positive associations between Aspergillus versicolor DNA in Petri dish samples, ocular symptoms (p = 0. 02) and tiredness (p = 0. 001). The level of the mycotoxin verrucarol (produced by Stachybotrys chartarum) in swab samples was positively associated with tiredness (p = 0. 04). Streptomyces DNA in swab samples (p = 0. 03) and Petri dish samples (p = 0. 03) were negatively associated with tiredness. In conclusion, total fungal contamination, measured as total fungal DNA) in the classrooms, Aspergillus versicolor and verrucarol can be risk factors for rhinitis and SBS symptoms among students in the tropical country Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the determinants of}} personal exposure concentrations black carbon (BC), ultrafine particle number concentrations (PNC), and particulate matter (PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10) in different travel modes. We quantified the contribution of key factors that explain the variation of the previous pollutants in four commuting routes in London, each covered by four transport modes (car, bus, walk and underground). Models were performed for each pollutant, separately to assess the effect of meteorology (wind speed) or ambient concentrations (with either high spatial or temporal resolution). Concentration variations were mainly explained by wind speed or ambient concentrations {{and to a lesser}} extent by route and period of the day. In multivariate models with wind speed, the wind speed was the common significant predictor for all the pollutants in the above-ground modes (i. e., car, bus, walk); and the only predictor variable for the PM fractions. Wind speed had the strongest effect on PM during the bus trips, with an increase in 1 m s- 1 leading to a decrease in 2. 25, 2. 90 and 4. 98 μg m- 3 of PM 1, PM 2. 5 and PM 10, respectively. PM 2. 5 and PM 10 concentrations in car trips were better explained by ambient concentrations with high temporal resolution although from a single monitoring station. On the other hand, ambient 32 concentrations with high spatial coverage although lower temporal resolution predicted better the concentrations in bus trips, due to bus routes passing through streets with a high variability of traffic intensity. In the underground models, wind speed was not significant and line and type of windows on the train explained 42 % of the variation of PNC and 90 % of all PM fractions. Trains in the district line with <b>openable</b> <b>windows</b> had an increase in concentrations of 1684 cm- 3 for PNC and 40. 69 μg m- 3 for PM 2. 5 compared with trains that has non-openable windows. The results from this work can be used to target efforts to reduce personal exposures of London commuters...|$|E
