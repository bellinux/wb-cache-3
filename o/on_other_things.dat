5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to eat or chew <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E

500|$|Clarke had {{his mind}} <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> besides awards and El Alamein. He {{delegated}} {{much of the}} ongoing planning to 'A' Force staff, as the department was now well established. Instead he flew to London and Washington in October to discuss strategic deception for Operation Torch, the forthcoming British-American invasion of the French North African colonies, leaving Charles Richardson (a planning officer at Eight Army HQ) and Geoffrey Barkas (Director of Camouflage, Middle East Command) to implement Operation Bertram. For the first time deception experts from across the theatres of war worked together. John Bevan of the London Controlling Section hosted an October conference for Clarke, Peter Flemming from India, and representatives from Washington. The meeting agreed on plans for a disinformation campaign, which would attempt to convince German high command that the Allied targets in Africa were Dakar and Sicily (the far eastern and western limits of the theatre). Four days after Montgomery's success at El Alamein, on , Allied forces landed in Morocco and Algeria {{to the surprise of}} German forces there. On [...] Clarke, along with Bevan and Flemming, met Churchill to discuss all the Allied deception strategies.|$|E

2500|$|The periods {{preceding}} {{and contemporary}} with the Protestant Reformation saw translations of the Bible into vernacular (local) European languages—a development {{that contributed to}} Western Christianity's split into Roman Catholicism and Protestantism due to disparities between Catholic and Protestant versions of crucial words and passages (though the Protestant movement was largely based <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> such as a perceived need to reform the Roman Catholic Church to eliminate corruption). [...] Lasting effects on the religions, cultures, and languages of their respective countries were exerted by such Bible translations as Martin Luther's into German, Jakub Wujek's into Polish, and William Tyndale's and later the King James Bibles translators' into English.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the Food Stamp Program as laid out in its {{implementation}} was to assist low-income households in obtaining adequate and nutritious diets. According to Peter H. Rossi, a sociologist whose work involved evaluation of social programs, [...] "the program rests {{on the assumption that}} households with restricted incomes may skimp on food purchases and live on diets that are inadequate in quantity and quality, or, alternatively skimp on other necessities to maintain an adequate diet". Food stamps, as many like Rossi, MacDonald, and Eisinger contend, are used not only for increasing food but also as income maintenance. Income maintenance is money that households are able to spend <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> because they no longer have to spend it on food. According to various studies shown by Rossi, because of income maintenance only about $0.17–$0.47 more is being spent on food for every food stamp dollar than was spent prior to individuals receiving food stamps.|$|E

2500|$|Now {{continuing}} their {{career as a}} trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album IX Equilibrium and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, , composed entirely by Ihsahn. [...] Ihsahn later recalled that [...] "When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn't think we would do anything more with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor {{had a lot of}} integrity, and that {{if we were going to}} end it, we should end it while we still created great music. [...] For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth and I pulled in different directions, we didn't see any point in continuing. [...] The core of the band wasn't intact anymore". Samoth echoed Ihsahn's position: [...] "At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the best thing to do. [...] We really wanted to focus <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> and felt it was the only right thing to do".|$|E
2500|$|The early {{influx of}} Filipinos into the United States was {{in large part}} due to social {{programs}} such as the pensionando program and the necessity for labor in certain areas such as California and Alaska. Laborers and farmers who migrated from the Philippines were known as the [...] "Manong" [...] Generation, an Ilocano term referring to an elderly person. [...] Filipino migrant workers began coming to the U.S. around the start of the 20th century; they were mostly men who worked in either California or Alaska. Some had worked in the sugar planations of Hawaii as well, but this occurred before Hawaii became a state. These men were referred to as the “Manong” generation, which is an Ilocano term designated for elderly people. For many Filipino laborers and workers during this time period, there was an emphasis on dressing well. This happened for multiple reasons. First, Filipino laborers looked to disassociate themselves from lower class citizens. Another reason included the desire to emulate Hollywood actors during the 1920’s and 1930’s. Filipinos were unable to rent or own homes in cities such as Los Angeles, so they spent their money <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> such as clothing. In living spaces, Filipinos were confined to upwards of fifteen to twenty tenants in a single room to save money. This allowed for Filipinos to spend their money on clothing instead of rent and other possessions instead. Also, Filipinos were portrayed as weak, submissive, unassertive, and eager to please; dressing well was perceived to counter those stereotypes. Despite earning meager wages, Filipino laborers bought nice clothing as a means to appear nicer than their pay would suggest. Lastly, another reason for the desire to dress well was to impress relatives back in the Philippines. Filipino laborers sent pictures of themselves in their suits in order to give them the impression they were quite successful in America.|$|E
2500|$|Scouting for a {{supporting}} cast to play opposite her began. Dan Castellaneta, a relative unknown, {{was asked to}} read for the show after he was spotted by Ullman at Chicago's Second City. Castellaneta's portrayal of a blind {{man who wants to}} be a comedian brought her to tears instead of making her laugh. Actress Julie Kavner had co-starred in Brook's spin-off series to The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper. Kavner played Harper's younger, socially awkward sister Brenda, a role for which she won an Emmy Award. Kavner was at the top of the list of people Brooks wanted to be part of the show. Brooks on Kavner: [...] "When somebody's intrinsically funny -- you know, in-their-bones funny -- they never have to work at (being funny), so they're free to work <b>on</b> <b>other</b> <b>things.</b> We were all nuts about her work. She was the person we most wanted to work with Tracey." [...] Actor Sam McMurray read for a guest spot on the show playing William, lover of thirteen-year-old valley girl Francesca's (Ullman) father. McMurray recalling his casting: [...] "The first Francesca sketch, they said, 'Play the guy not so gay.' And I said 'I disagree.' I had a big mouth then -— still do. I said, 'I think he’s more the woman. I think he's more out there.' So I read and I read it big, and they cast me. It was just a one-off, and then we were on hiatus. I did the one week, and I had a friend coincidentally who used to write, a guy named Marc Flanagan, and he was on the show as a staff guy. He called me up and said, 'Did they call your agent?' I said, 'No, why?' He said, 'They wanna make you a regular.'" [...] Another actor who was originally cast for a guest shot which led to becoming a series regular was choreographer Joseph Malone. [...] The show now had its cast.|$|E
