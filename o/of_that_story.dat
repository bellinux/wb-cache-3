5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z. Marcas, the narrator– Charles Rabourdin, whose identity is only revealed {{at the end of}} the story– is in fact the son of a central character from Balzac's 1837 tale La Femme supérieure. The title character <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story</b> is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end of the La Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z. Marcas is evidence of his failure.|$|E
5|$|Producer Michael G. Wilson {{developed}} the film's plot while the previous {{film in the}} series, Casino Royale, was being shot. Purvis, Wade, and Haggis contributed to the script. Craig and Forster had to write some sections themselves due to the Writers' Strike, though they were not given the screenwriter credit in the final cut. The title was chosen from a 1959 short story in Ian Fleming's For Your Eyes Only, though the film does not contain any elements <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story.</b> Location filming took place in Mexico, Panama, Chile, Italy, Austria, and Wales, while interior sets were built and filmed at Pinewood Studios. Forster aimed to make a modern film that also featured classic cinema motifs: a vintage Douglas DC-3 was used for a flight sequence, and Dennis Gassner's set designs are reminiscent of Ken Adam's work on several early Bond films. Taking a course away from the usual Bond villains, Forster rejected any grotesque appearance for the character Dominic Greene to emphasise the hidden and secret nature of the film's contemporary villains.|$|E
25|$|The central {{subject of}} several {{versions}} of the Kentish Royal Legend is {{an account of the}} murder of two young princes, restitution by way of land to found an abbey by Domne Eafe, and the life of its second Abbess, Mildrith.

Even Poirot acknowledges that Rossakoff offered wildly varying accounts of her early life. Poirot later became smitten with the woman and allowed her to escape justice.|$|E

25|$|The second Romana {{enjoys a}} more {{intimate}} relationship with the Doctor than her previous incarnation, {{to the point that}} some fans have assumed a romantic relationship with the Doctor. Although a relationship was never explicitly shown or intended by the writers, many fans have found the signs of a romantic relationship particularly evident in the story City of Death, perhaps reflecting the real-life romance between Tom Baker and Lalla Ward which blossomed during the production <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> leading to their brief marriage in 1981. In many ways, she might be claimed to be the companion most like her Doctor (if Romana I were not more like the Doctor than her) – besides being of the same race and comparable intelligence, she occasionally mimics his sense of style, wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him in moments of banter and more practical situations. As her practical experience develops, she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she encounters.|$|E

It was also the final film of Ramachandran's three-film contract with Modern Theatres.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} father-figures {{is one that}} is {{explored}} throughout The X-Files, in relation to both Mulder and Scully. As well as their own fathers, a number of characters play a paternal role to the agents in later episodes, including Deep Throat, the Cigarette-Smoking Man and Senator Matheson. Both of the protagonists have deep-rooted family issues and this episode {{is the beginning of the}} exploration <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story</b> arc. A motif often employed in the show is that of mirroring, doubling or cloning.

500|$|Scott Feinberg {{wrote in}} The Hollywood Reporter about a September 22 New York Times article that [...] "dredged up and {{highlighted}} a 1985 essay by another scholar, James Olney, that questioned the 'literal truth' of specific incidents in Northup's account {{and suggested that}} David Wilson, the white amanuensis to whom Northup had dictated his story, had taken the liberty of sprucing it up to make it even more effective at rallying public opinion against slavery." [...] According to Olney, when abolitionists invited an ex-slave to share his experience in slavery at an antislavery convention, and when they subsequently funded the appearance <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story</b> in print, [...] "they had certain clear expectations, well understood by themselves and well understood by the ex-slave, too." ...|$|E
500|$|One cut Goldenberg had to make, {{which he}} [...] "hated" [...] to do, was {{the absence of}} Quidditch, the Wizarding sport.

In the book, Ron grows as a character by trying out for the Quidditch team. [...] "Ron facing challenges and coming into his own {{in the same way that}} Harry is, we tried to get that into the film in other ways, as much as possible. So, you feel like, if not the details <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> at least the spirit of it is present in the film". The change disappointed actor Rupert Grint who had been [...] "quite looking forward to the Quidditch stuff".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by co-executive {{producer}} David H. Goodman, while being directed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer veteran David Solomon.

[...] Executive producer Steve Pearlman developed the series to have standalone episodes that still encouraged viewers to watch each week.

[...] Emma portion <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story</b> that kind of continues." [...] Pearlman added that [...] "there are other twists and turns along the way that don't {{have anything to do with}} the specifics of the Cinderella story that are additive to our character development. Hopefully, what we're doing over the course of the season is continuing to build each week, give the audience something new about our main characters that keeps them coming back." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Pokey Mom" [...] {{was written}} by Tom Martin and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson {{as part of the}} twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000–2001). According to then-showrunner Mike Scully, the story of this episode originated {{from the fact that the}} staff members of The Simpsons wanted to do an episode about Marge but felt they did not want it to revolve around her getting a new job, as that had been seen on the show [...] "too often". They decided to explore one of Marge's attributes that had been seen in earlier episodes, eventually choosing her interest in art. Martin conceived of the sub-plot surrounding Homer following a visit to a chiropractor. He has said that the [...] "heart" [...] <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story</b> is that the chiropractors in Springfield become opposed to Homer's method of healing people and try to stop it after losing business, in reference to how chiropractors in real-life [...] "are a bit hated by the AMA (American Medical Association)" [...] and how the AMA has tried to restrict their businesses in the past. Martin has also noted that the episode shows how [...] "a lot of chiropractors are these great healers and they do great work, and then there's some that are crooked." ...|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} for [...] "TS-19" [...] transpired at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, {{which was}} depicted as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Producers {{of the show}} {{were not allowed to}} photograph the interior of the actual buildings as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a point of reference due to its high security. Although the location was not featured in the comics of the same name, Hurd felt {{that it was important to}} add because of its close proximity to the survivor's camp. As opposed to the previous episode, where filming mostly took place outside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for [...] "TS-19" [...] occurred inside of the building. Darabont conceived the idea of exploring into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [...] "When Frank was pitching the idea to me, saying he wanted to bring them to the CDC and telling me all the different things that he felt would come out <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> the science of it all and the being trapped in the small location, I was very much picturing a lot of Day of the Dead stuff," [...] stated creator Robert Kirkman. [...] "That's one of the reasons I was so on board with the idea." ...|$|E
500|$|The writers {{made several}} other changes going from season one to season two, {{including}} making the scripts more focused around the entire cast {{rather than just}} Leslie. They also tried to make Leslie appear more intelligent in the second season after receiving audience feedback that she appeared [...] "ditzy", which Michael Schur said was never their intention. Schur said, [...] "In the end, we just felt that Amy is an enormously likable presence on screen, so as the season went on we just tried to create situations where that would shine through." [...] During the episode [...] "Kaboom", a major subplot was resolved when the large construction pit that Leslie had long sought {{to turn into a}} park was filled with dirt and turned into a lot. The pit was first established in the premiere episode and had been a focal point of the series since the show began. Schur said while the pit project was originally conceived as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal, and it was expected to only become a park during the series finale. However, Schur said he felt the early episodes were too focused on the pit and had led viewers to believe the entire show was about filling the pit, which was not the writers' intention, so they accelerated the resolution <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>story</b> arc. The idea of Ben and Chris, two state auditors who come in from outside Pawnee to help the town deal with budget problems, was conceived from news reports at the time of a number of states considering shutting down schools, parks and other services due to the global recession.|$|E
