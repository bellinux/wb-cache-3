5|$|In 1914, {{while working}} for the Balboa Amusement Producing Company, William Jossey wrote the {{screenplay}} for the first feature-length film adaptation. Filming took place in Long Beach, California, where the Balboa studios were located. Footage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> church under construction {{across the street from}} the studio was used for a scene in which one was built by St. Elmo. Contemporary writers credited Bertram Bracken as director, as do some modern sources, including the American Film Institute. Others consider the film the directorial debut of J. Gordon Edwards. Both men subsequently had long careers directing for Fox Film.|$|E
5|$|The coyote is a {{prominent}} character in Native American folklore, {{mainly in the}} Southwestern United States and Mexico, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially respected in Mesoamerican cosmology {{as a symbol of}} military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} was also made to bring Freddy's physical appearance {{closer to that}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> burn victim, {{and the use of}} computer-generated imagery was used in certain sections of Haley's face to further assist in that vision. A Nightmare on Elm Street was primarily filmed in Illinois because of the positive experience the producers of Platinum Dunes had when filming other films in the same area.|$|E

5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. To simulate the look <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> documentary, it is filmed in a single-camera setup, without a studio audience or a laugh track. The show debuted on NBC as a mid-season replacement and ran for nine seasons and 201 episodes. The Office initially featured Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer and B. J. Novak as the main cast; the show experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run.|$|E
5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new bowl games were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> national championship, these bowl games, {{along with the}} earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This {{is far more than}} in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often be the result <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E

5|$|Blackrock is a play by Australian playwright Nick Enright {{that was}} first {{performed}} in 1995. It {{was adapted from}} a 1992 play by Enright, entitled A Property of the Clan, which {{was inspired by the}} murder of Leigh Leigh in Stockton, Australia in 1989. The plays were both well received critically, though they did attract criticism from both Leigh's family and the media due to the fictionalisation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> murder. Despite repeated statements from Enright that the plays were a work of fiction, they have both often been considered by viewers to be a factual account. A Property of the Clan was shortlisted for a New South Wales Premier's Literary Award in 1993, and Blackrock won the AWGIE Award for Best Play in 1996. Blackrock was developed into a feature film of the same name in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Peake's {{portrait}} of Lady Elizabeth Pope {{may have been}} commissioned by her husband, Sir William Pope, to commemorate their marriage in 1615. Lady Elizabeth is portrayed with her hair loose, a symbol of bridal virginity.• See also Stewart, Cradle King, 113. She wears a draped mantle—embroidered with seed pearls in a pattern of ostrich plumes—and a matching turban. The mantle knotted on one shoulder was worn in Jacobean court masques, as the costume designs of Inigo Jones indicate. The painting’s near-nudity, however, makes the depiction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> masque costume unlikely.• Ribeiro, Fashion and Fiction, 89. Loose hair and the classical draped mantle also figure in contemporary personifications of abstract concepts in masques and paintings. Yale art historian Ellen Chirelstein argues that Peake is portraying Lady Elizabeth as a personification of America, since her father, Sir Thomas Watson, was a major shareholder in the Virginia Company.|$|E
5|$|The Gnome Motion Picture Company was a film {{production}} {{company that is}} credited with three productions between 1910 and 1911. The purpose of the company to was to produce stories about gnomes. Alice in Funnyland, The Birth of the Gnomes and Alice's New Year's Party were all productions that were most likely never released. Announcements in trade publications ceased in January 1911 and the company treasurer, Frederick Kalmbach, was later sued by the City of New York for taxes. Of the three planned productions, two official synopses were released in The Nickelodeon. Despite no evidence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> release, the American Film Institute still recognizes all three films as being released in January 1911.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> infinity was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy {{of the relationship between}} God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's. He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one. To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the Absolute Infinite with God, and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{features}} prominently as a trickster {{figure in}} the folktales of America's indigenous peoples, alternately assuming the form <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>actual</b> coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote acts as a picaresque hero which rebels against social convention through deception and humor. The coyote was likely given its trickster role {{in light of the}} actual animal's intelligence and adaptability; pre-Columbian American people observed its behavior, and their folkloric representations reflected its attributes. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike the gray wolf, which has undergone a radical improvement of its public image, cultural attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E
