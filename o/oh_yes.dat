500|$|... "Machine Gun" [...] {{is another}} song that Hendrix had {{spent more time}} developing. [...] By the Fillmore East concerts, it became an {{extended}} guitar improvisational piece, which [...] "would completely change the perception of Hendrix's capabilities as an improviser and musician", according to Shadwick. [...] Although based on a [...] "minor drone-blues" [...] {{in the line of}} [...] "Voodoo Child (Slight Return)", Hendrix's performance has been compared to jazz saxophonist John Coltrane's approach to improvisation. [...] Miles Davis, with whom Coltrane had recorded several albums in the 1950s, including the influential Kind of Blue, noted the connection: [...] "Jimi liked what I had done with Kind of Blue and some other stuff and wanted to add more jazz elements to what he was doing. [...] He liked the way Coltrane played with all those sheets of sound, and played his guitar in a similar way". [...] From Hendrix's dedication of the song [...] "to all the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York, <b>oh</b> <b>yes,</b> and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam", [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is as much about the late 1960s American race riots as the war in Vietnam. [...] Guitarist Vernon Reid describes it as [...] "like a movie about war without the visuals. [...] It had everything—the lyrics, the humanism of it, the drama of it, the violence of it, the eeriness of it, [...] the unpredictability of it". [...] In many commentaries about Band of Gypsys, [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is singled out as the highlight of the album. [...] Both McDermott and Shadwick call it one of Hendrix's greatest achievements, which sets a standard {{that the rest of the}} album does not approach.|$|E

Cranky Critic called it [...] "Bloody damned good", as well as {{saying that it was}} [...] "A perfect date flick." [...] Nitrate said that [...] "Notting Hill is whimsical and light, fresh and quirky", with [...] "endearing moments and memorable characters". In his review of the film's DVD John J. Puccio noted that [...] "the movie is a fairy tale, and writer Richard Curtis knows how much the public loves a fairy tale", calling it [...] "a sweet film".|accessdate=20 May 2007|author=John J. Puccio|publisher=DVD Town.com}} Desson Howe of The Washington Post gave the film a very positive review, particularly praising Rhys Ifans' performance as Spike. James Sanford gave Notting Hill three and a half stars, saying that [...] "Curtis' dialogue may be much snappier than his sometimes dawdling plot, but the first hour of Notting Hill is so beguiling and consistently funny it seems churlish to complain that the rest is merely good." [...] Sue Pierman of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated that [...] "Notting Hill is clever, funny, romantic– and <b>oh,</b> <b>yes,</b> reminiscent of Four Weddings and a Funeral", but that the film [...] "is so satisfying, it doesn't pay to nitpick." [...] Roger Ebert praised the film, saying [...] "the movie is bright, the dialogue has wit and intelligence, and Roberts and Grant are very easy to like." [...] Kenneth Turan gave a good review, concluding that [...] "the film's romantic core is impervious to problems". CNN reviewer Paul Clinton said that Notting Hill [...] "stands alone as another funny and heartwarming story about love against all odds".|$|E

2500|$|In a {{relatively}} quiet dispute, some lyrics from the single [...] "B-Boy Stance" [...] were {{interpreted as an}} insult on the Toronto-based rapper K'naan. In the single, k-os rapped [...] "They took cameras to Africa for pictures to rhyme/Over; <b>Oh,</b> <b>yes,</b> the great pretenders," [...] and [...] "Religious entertainers {{who want to be}} life savers." [...] K’naan interpreted the lyrics as being aimed at him filming the music video for the single Soobax in Kenya. Friends say that k-os was simply expressing ideas about the LoveMovement (his videproduction team) who shot the video in Kenya and ex manager Sol guy who was managing K'naan at the time. k-os has been said to believe that hip hop allows friends to express their ideas to each other via song. He was very puzzled by Knaan's personal 'public' angle on the lyrics of [...] "B-Boy Stance" [...] especially because his song Revolutionary Avacado came after Knaan's repeated efforts to collaborate with k-os.
