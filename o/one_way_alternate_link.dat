40|$|It is {{well known}} that the minimum {{crossing}} number of an <b>alternating</b> <b>link</b> equals the number of crossings in any reduced <b>alternating</b> <b>link</b> diagram of the link. This remarkable result is an application of the Jones polynomial. In the case of the braid index of an <b>alternating</b> <b>link,</b> Murasugi had conjectured that the number of Seifert circles in a reduced alternating diagram of the link equals the braid index of the link. This conjecture turned out to be false. In this paper we prove the next best thing that one could hope for: we characterize exactly those <b>alternating</b> <b>links</b> for which their braid indices equal to the numbers of Seifert circles in their corresponding reduced <b>alternating</b> <b>link</b> diagrams. More specifically, we prove that if $D$ is a reduced <b>alternating</b> <b>link</b> diagram of an <b>alternating</b> <b>link</b> $L$, then $b(L) $, the braid index of $L$, equals the number of Seifert circles in $D$ if and only if $G_S(D) $ contains no edges of weight one. Here $G_S(D) $, called the Seifert graph of $D$, is an edge weighted simple graph obtained from $D$ by identifying each Seifert circle of $D$ as a vertex of $G_S(D) $ such that two vertices in $G_S(D) $ are connected by an edge if and only if the two corresponding Seifert circles share crossings between them in $D$ and that the weight of the edge is the number of crossings between the two Seifert circles. This result is partly based on the well known MFW inequality, which states that the $a$-span of the HOMFLY polynomial of $L$ is a lower bound of $ 2 b(L) - 2 $, as well as a result due to Yamada, which states that the minimum number of Seifert circles over all link diagrams of $L$ equals $b(L) $...|$|R

However, when many crossings are added to a single twist region of a link diagram, the geometry of the link complement stabilizes (approaches a geometric limit), but a corresponding checkerboard surface increases in complexity with crossing number. In this paper, we generalize checkerboard surfaces to certain immersed surfaces, called twisted checkerboard surfaces, whose geometry better reflects that of the <b>alternating</b> <b>link</b> in many cases. We describe the surfaces, {{show that they are}} essential in the complement of an <b>alternating</b> <b>link,</b> and discuss their properties, including an analysis of homotopy classes of arcs on the {{surfaces in}} the link complement. 1...|$|R
