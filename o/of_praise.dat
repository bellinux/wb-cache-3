5|$|On 9 October 1959, Hordern {{made his}} debut on Broadway at the Cort Theatre in Marcel Aymé's comedy Moonbirds, {{alongside}} the comedian Wally Cox.

For that performance Bach composed four laudes, songs <b>of</b> <b>praise</b> partly in German, partly in Latin to be inserted at certain points in the E-flat major version of the Magnificat. The E-flat major version of the Magnificat including these interpolations is known as BWV 243a.|$|E

Several members, including director Matt Nava and composer Austin Wintory, had previously worked on the 2012 video game Journey—the ocean setting of Abzû was both {{a reaction to the}} desert setting of Journey and inspired by Nava's love of scuba diving. The setting and story drew from Sumerian mythology and the cosmic ocean myth. Reaching high positions in sales charts, Abzû was praised by journalists: the majority <b>of</b> <b>praise</b> went to its art style, with some critics comparing it to Journey.|$|E

London was like nothing George had seen before: it was 50 times larger than Hanover, and the crowd was estimated at up to {{one and a half}} million spectators. George courted popularity with voluble expressions <b>of</b> <b>praise</b> for the English, and claimed that he had no drop of blood that was not English.|$|E
