While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect <b>on</b> <b>aging.</b>|$|E

The lack of progress calls for critical reflection {{on the status of}} policy debates and arguments <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> in the sub-region. In a context of acute development challenges and resource constraints, the paper links the impasse in policy action to a fundamental lack of clarity about how rationales and approaches for policy <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> relate to core national development agendas. It then explicates four steps required to elucidate these connections, namely: (a) A full appreciation of key aspects of mainstream development agendas; (b) identification of ambiguities in calls for policy on ageing; (c) pinpointing of key perspectives, arguments and queries for redressing the ambiguities; and (d) addressing ensuing information needs. We argue that advocacy and research <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> in sub-Saharan Africa need to consider the framework proposed in the paper urgently, in order to advance policy and debate <b>on</b> <b>ageing</b> in the region...|$|R

40|$|In {{the main}} paper we {{considered}} models {{with a separate}} survival probability for animals {{in their first year}} of life. We may wish to consider the survival probability separately for longer than a year, for example if an animal is juvenile for longer than a year. To include such cases we extend the models examined to consider survival separately for the first J years of their life. The animal would then be considered an adult for years J+ 1 onwards. A similar x/y/z notation is used. Here x represents the first J years of life with the following options: (i) Dependent <b>on</b> <b>age</b> for years 1 to J (A 1 :J). (Note that A 1 : 1 is equivalent to C.) (ii) Dependent <b>on</b> <b>age</b> and time for years 1 to J (A 1 :J,T). (Note that A 1 : 1,T is equivalent to T.)

5|$|In late 2002, after {{airlines}} expressed {{reservations about}} {{its emphasis on}} speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from composite materials which promised to be 20percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was {{the first stage of}} a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including D-check teardowns and inspections for corrosion, a recurring issue <b>on</b> <b>aging</b> 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work was to study the relationship of daily milk yield (DMY) <b>on</b> <b>age</b> and live body weight on of Zaraibi and Shami goats in Sinai, Egypt. Fifty lactated Zaraibi and 60 lactated Shami goats were used to record the DMY (g) during March–August 2009. Age of the both studied breeds was ranged from 24 to 72 months. Weight was ranged from 20 to 33 kg in Zaraibi and from 25 to 40 kg in Shami. Data of DMY were statistically analyzed to obtain the partial regression coefficients of DMY <b>on</b> <b>age</b> and weight within each studied breeds. Two models were used to estimate the partial linear and/or quadratic coefficient of DMY <b>on</b> <b>age</b> and weight. According {{to the results of}} model 1, Model 2 was done for DMY <b>on</b> <b>age</b> as linear and weight as linear and quadratic in Zaraibi. While, in Shami model 2 was done for DMY <b>on</b> <b>age</b> and weight as linear only. Results indicated that DMY of Zaraibi and Shami were 576 ± 9. 7 and 587 ± 9. 2 g, respectively. In model 1, partial linear and quadratic regression coefficient estimates in Zaraibi for DMY <b>on</b> <b>age</b> were (b 1) 1. 93 g/mo and (b 2) − 0. 03 g/mo 2 and on weight were (b 3) 121 g/kg and (b 4) − 2. 17 g/kg 2, respectively. These result indicated that relationship of DMY on weight was negative curve-linear. While, partial regression coefficients in Shami goat were − 0. 49, 0. 01, 32. 75 and − 0. 37 for b 1, b 2, b 3 and b 4, respectively. In model 2, the linear relationship of DMY <b>on</b> <b>age</b> (b 1 =− 1. 38 g/mo) in Zaraibi became negative and significant (p 0. 05).
