5|$|One {{justice of}} the court is elected by the court to serve a six-year term as Chief Justice. The Chief Justice is then {{responsible}} for all administration of the Supreme Court. Under a law enacted in 1981 the chief {{is not only the}} titular head of the Supreme Court, but also is the chief executive officer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Judicial Department. In that role the Chief Justice supervises all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> courts, appoints the Chief Judge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Court of Appeals, assigns presiding judges for the trial level state courts, makes court rules, and {{is in charge of the}} department’s budget. As administrator the chief is also the recipient of many reports from the court system including non-legal employees of the department. The first Chief Justice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court was William P. Bryant, while the longest serving chief was Wallace P. Carson, Jr. who held the position for 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Palmer {{traveled}} to the Oregon Country in 1845. He {{played a central role}} in blazing the last leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Trail, the Barlow Road, with Sam Barlow and others. Specifically, Palmer is noted for having climbed high on Mount Hood to observe the surrounding area when the party ran into difficulty. He wrote a popular immigrant guidebook, co-founded Dayton, Oregon, and served as a controversial Indian Affairs administrator. After Oregon became a state, Palmer served in both branches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Legislative Assembly. He was selected as Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> House of Representatives for one session in 1862, and in 1870 lost a bid to become Governor of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} the decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively {{based on the}} Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change {{the outcome of the}} case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1853, the {{official}} court {{reporter for the}} publication of all Supreme Court decisions was the Oregon Reports, abbreviated Or. or Ore. in case citations.

5|$|Once the {{government}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Territory arrived in March 1849, a new legislature with two chambers was established. Lovejoy {{was elected to}} the first session of this legislature, first serving in the lower chamber Oregon House of Representatives. Representing Clackamas District again, he also became the first Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Territorial Legislature. In 1851, he returned to the legislature, serving in the upper chamber Council. The following year, he remained in the Council, but now elected as a Whig Party politician. In 1854, he was back in the House of Representatives, and in 1856 he served in one final session, now as a Democratic Party member.|$|E
5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and decisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E
5|$|Palmer's brother, named Ephraim {{like their}} father, also immigrated to Oregon {{and served as}} a captain in the first {{regiment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Infantry.

Joel Palmer died in Dayton on June 9, 1881, at the age of 70. His former home that he built in 1852, Palmer House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987, and is now operating as a restaurant. Palmer's name is one of 158 memorialized in the frieze of the two chambers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oregon</b> Legislative Assembly at the Oregon State Capitol, with his located in the Senate chamber. During World War II the SS Joel Palmer Liberty ship was built and named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|After {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in the Salmon River area of Idaho, a group of immigrants persuaded an Illinois-born trapper and trader named Tim Goodale to lead them through the cutoff.

Numbering 795 men and 300 women and children, the unusually large group was relatively unmolested during its journey and named the cutoff for their guide.
