5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when <b>our</b> <b>love</b> was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1964, the Supremes {{recorded}} the single [...] "Where Did <b>Our</b> <b>Love</b> Go". The song was originally intended by Holland-Dozier-Holland for the Marvelettes, who rejected it. Although the Supremes disliked the song, the producers coerced them into recording it. In August 1964, while the Supremes toured as part of Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars, [...] "Where Did <b>Our</b> <b>Love</b> Go" [...] reached {{number one on the}} US pop charts, much to the surprise and delight of the group.

For the sake of us two, fight for <b>our</b> <b>love</b> against temptation". The track features Queen and Dominican bachata singer Frank Reyes; she expressed her love for the song (and bachata in general), calling it a genre where [...] "men express themselves with women". The minor-key [...] "Cansada" [...] (Tired) showcases Queen's rapping skills, featuring techno synthesizers. Frances Tirado of Primera Hora described it as [...] "pegajosa" [...] ("addictive").|$|E

500|$|According to Religion News Service writer Steve Rabey, [...] "Within You Without You" [...] "contrast Western individualism with Eastern monism". The lyrics convey basic {{tenets of}} Vedanta philosophy, {{particularly}} in Harrison's {{reference to the}} concept of maya (the illusory nature of existence), in the lines [...] "And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion / Never glimpse the truth". Author Joshua Greene paraphrases the song-wide message as: [...] "A wall of illusion separates us from each other … which only turns <b>our</b> <b>love</b> for one another cold. Peace will come when we learn to see past the illusion of differences and come to know that we are one …" [...] The solution espoused by Harrison is for individuals to see beyond the self and each seek change within, further to Vivekananda's contention in Raja Yoga that [...] "Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest that divinity …" [...] According to ethnomusicologist David Reck, aside from the reference to maya, the lyrics convey Indian philosophical concepts such as advait (the one essential reality), satya (perception of truth) and, in the line [...] "With <b>our</b> <b>love</b> we could save the world", universal love.|$|E
