40|$|This program, used {{ultraviolet}} observations by the IUE Observatory {{along with}} other tools to search for abundance anomalies indicative of CNO processing in the secondary (mass-donating) stars of six interacting binary systems. Related IUE-based activities were also undertaken under this grant. Two Supplements to the grant were awarded. Supplement No. 1 was {{in connection with the}} NASA Grant Supplements for Education program, for a workshop for elementary school science teachers. <b>The</b> two sessions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workshop were held October 24 and November 14, 1992. Eighteen school teachers from central Pennsylvania, grades 1 - 7, participated in the workshop, for which they received one unit of in-service training credit from their Intermediate Unit. Supplement No. 2 was awarded for additional IUE observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Algol</b> <b>stars</b> V 342 Aql and TU Mon. Observations of all six candidate stars were made with IUE, and attention was narrowed to TU Mon in particular, for which further IUE observations were made using Director's discretionary time. Observations of TU Mon were also carried out with the Voyager UV spectrometers, and optical spectroscopy was obtained on several occasions at Penn State's Black Moshannon Observatory. Photometric data on TU Mon were acquired by Dr. Paul Etzel at Mt. Laguna Observatory (MLO). McGouldrick was employed part-time during the Fall academic semester to assist in accessing the IUE Archive, and to correlate data on some cataclysmic variables and related objects that were observed with both IUE and the Voyager Far Ultraviolet Spectrometers. Approximately 21 relevant binary systems were observed with the Voyager UVS over the past decade, and a paper is being prepared for eventual publication that will serve as an index to the UVS data archive on these stars, providing observation dates, mean count rates in far and extreme UV bands, and a discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevant literature concerning the far UV behavior (including correlative IUE information from the archive and <b>the</b> literature). Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> activity under the grant was in connection with V 342 Aquilae, a 3. 39 day Algol system thought to be in a state of rapid mass transfer.

40|$|This program {{involves}} {{analysis and}} interpretation of EUVE spectrometer observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> active <b>stars</b> <b>Algol</b> (beta Per) and 71 Tauri. The EUVE satellite spectrometers observed the prototype eclipsing binary Algol over nearly 1. 5 orbital periods. Effective exposure times were 100 ksec and 89 ksec in the short wave (70 - 180 A) and medium wave (140 - 370 A) channels. High temperature (up to 20 MK) Fe XVI-XXIV emission lines are clearly detected in the overall spectrum. In addition, a quiescent continuum is present which increases towards shorter wavelengths. Using synthesized spectra of optically thin line and continuum emission folded through the instrumental response, we have examined constraints on the (Fe/H) coronal abundance in Algol. We find that the coronal Fe is underabundant by factors that approximately equal 2 - 4 relative to solar photospheric values, unless an unreasonably large quantity of coronal plasma at T greater than 30 MK {{is present in the}} quiescent spectrum. The latter possibility is, however, inconsistent with available X-ray data. Lightcurves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high temperature EUV lines compared to line emission at He II 304 A show considerable differences, with much deeper minima present in the He II line during both primary and secondary eclipses. Toward <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observation a moderate flare lasting approximately 6 hours was detected in the high temperature Fe emission lines. The 71 Tau observation, for about the same exposure time, revealed only a handful of weak emission lines; however, the strongest lines were also those of Fe XXIII/XX, suggesting a hot coronal plasma. No obvious flaring or other variation was present in the 71 Tau Deep Survey lightcurve...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four known large X-ray flares detected {{to date on the}} eclipsing binary system Algol, using an approach based on hydrodynamic simulations of decaying flaring loops including sustained heating. This method yields, for <b>the</b> large BeppoSAX <b>Algol</b> flare of Aug. 1997 (where a geometrical estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flaring region is available) a more reliable size than approaches based on <b>the</b> free decay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flaring loop. For the three flares analyzed here (one observed by EXOSAT, one by GINGA and one by ROSAT) we show that indeed sustained heating is present in all cases, so that <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flaring region is always smaller than previously derived. No evidence for the very long loops previously found through quasi-static analysis methods (extending out to several stellar radii) is found.
