500|$|Leigh's death {{received}} {{widespread and}} ongoing coverage {{in both the}} Sydney and Newcastle media, possibly due to a fascination with her reduplicated name. Between 1989 and 1994, The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh, 23 of them featured on the front page. At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period. Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a [...] "celebrity crime", and to Leigh being {{referred to as a}} [...] "celebrity victim". In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton, and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals, [...] stating [...] "I think one of the main things is that people can identify with people involved.

On Carter and Stark's relationship moving into the second season, Atwell said, [...] "there’s a new comfort level between Stark and Peggy ... they’re on a bit more of an even level. She respects him hugely, but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him ... he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his Dionysian ways, but when it comes to Peggy, he doesn’t see her as big boobs and red lips. He sees her as someone he can actually have a proper conversation with. Which probably scares the hell out of him".|$|E

Their views are. structurally characterized by the author and submitted to critical comparison.

The results of pre- and post-course surveys were compared to examine how their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers may have changed. After the post-course survey, interviews to randomly selected students taught by different BE teachers were conducted to further examine their perceptions. The results showed that both BE teachers and students had positive images <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers. Moreover, not many variables were found in both groups <b>of</b> <b>BE</b> teachers and their students.

40|$|Heidegger {{argued that}} modern {{human beings have}} {{forgotten}} a more fundamental and originary understanding of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> This forgetting <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{is not limited to}} lived experience but permeates the history of philosophy and metaphysics. Put simply, modern philosophy (and, for Heidegger, metaphysics) presupposes a reductive understanding <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> as an entity, or an entity with enduring presence, that ultimately limits the possibilities of human thinking and existence. Educational practice and scholarship also operates from this comportment of a forgetting <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> The following inquiry raises the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in teaching by phenomenologically engaging with three key distinctions from Heidegger’s thinking as each bears upon educational practice. World and attunement, the first two distinctions, are most accessible in Heidegger’s thinking from his magnum opus Being and Time. The third distinction represents a theme from Heidegger’s later thinking on technology, the danger of Enframing. While not exhaustive, each concept interrogates the many-sided question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in order to illuminate new possibilities for teaching. The inquiry does not offer solutions but rather traces a path that opens and keeps in tension the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in teaching in order to support further study...|$|R
2500|$|In December, {{developers}} at Sxip Identity began {{discussions with}} the OpenID/Yadis community after announcing {{a shift in the}} development of version 2.0 of its Simple Extensible Identity Protocol (SXIP) to URL-based identities like LID and OpenID. In March 2006, JanRain developed a Simple Registration (SREG) extension for OpenID enabling primitive profile-exchange and in April submitted a proposal to formalize extensions to OpenID. The same month, work had also begun on incorporating full XRI support into OpenID. Around early May, key OpenID developer David Recordon left Six Apart, joining VeriSign to focus more on digital identity and guidance for the OpenID spec. By early June, the major differences between the SXIP 2.0 and OpenID projects were resolved with the agreement to support multiple personas in OpenID by submission of an identity provider URL rather than a full identity URL. With this, as well as the addition of extensions and XRI support underway, OpenID was evolving into a full-fledged digital identity framework, with Recordon proclaiming [...] "We see OpenID as being an umbrella for the framework that encompasses the layers for identifiers, discovery, authentication and a messaging services layer that sits atop and this entire thing has sort <b>of</b> <b>been</b> dubbed 'OpenID 2.0'. [...] " [...] In late July, Sxip began to merge its Digital Identity Exchange (DIX) protocol into OpenID, submitting initial drafts of the OpenID Attribute Exchange (AX) extension in August.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} problem of {{relation}} between the question <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> {{and the question of}} art in the thought of Martin Heidegger. His thought trajectory comprises two different forms <b>of</b> question considering <b>Being.</b> He calls the first one the main question. This form he considers to be metaphysical since it can be traced in traditional philosophical thought back to Plato and Nietzsche, or the thought of the first beginning. The second form is the fundamental question about Being which leads to overcoming of metaphysical understanding <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> and belongs to the thought of the second beginning. This second form, according to his words at the seminar at Le Thor appears in three forms along his thought trajectory; firstly, as a fundamental ontological question of the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Being,</b> then, as significant historical question concerning the truth <b>of</b> <b>Being,</b> and finally, as a topological question concerning the space and spatiality <b>of</b> <b>Being.</b> His position concerning art needs to be considered in the light of fundamental issue <b>of</b> <b>Being</b> in his thought...|$|R
