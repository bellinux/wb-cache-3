5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> proposed that a bill <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> was {{submitted}} to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> now supported the Bill {{as a means of}} silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E

His writings have been a significant influence on political thought and events, including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774, the Virginia Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> of 1776, and his Objections to this Constitution of Government (1787) in opposition to ratification of the constitution.
