5|$|Congressional {{candidate}} and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch)—whose campaign platform includes the elimination <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> school arts programs—editorializes on television to rescind {{the budget of}} the school's production of West Side Story. She succeeds after an angry mother throws a brick at Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) recruits the members to sell advertising space in the program book to raise money; when Kurt (Chris Colfer) asks his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to purchase an ad, he instead gathers a group of businessmen to fund the musical. He then announces that he is running for congress against Sue.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, McLachlan {{was an avid}} cyclist, accrediting this to {{the fact}} that his home town Vancouver was not cold enough for ponds to freeze over to play ice hockey on. During his teenage years, he trained upwards of six hours a day, and won several {{national}} championships in the sport. He qualified to represent Canada in the 1976 Summer Olympics, but the lack <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> cycling in North America at the time would have necessitated him funding his own journey and leaving school to do so; McLachlan opted instead to remain in education and focus on his interest in photography.|$|E
5|$|Morehead's term as {{governor}} {{was an active}} one. He approved the appropriation <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the first Kentucky State Fair, which {{was seen as a}} vehicle for encouraging improvements in agriculture. He also approved the formation of the Kentucky State Agricultural Society in 1856. The state geological survey begun under Governor Lazarus W. Powell was completed and published. Internal improvements progressed as well; railroad mileage in the state increased from 242 miles to 568 miles during Morehead's term.|$|E

5|$|On April 30, {{legislators in}} the U.S. Congress {{released}} the proposed 2017 federal budget, which included partial {{funding for the}} electrification project, but restricts its distribution unless Secretary Chao signs off on the grant. The proposed budget includes $100million of the $647million grant, with the balance expected in future years. Secretary Chao claimed she could not sign the grant without the full grant being budgeted, which was disputed by Caltrain and both California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris. On May 22, the FTA announced its intent to sign the funding grant, restoring the final piece <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the electrification project. The official grant was finally signed on May 23.|$|E
5|$|Some Lucian calypsonians {{recorded}} in the 1980s, mostly on 45-RPM discs which remain largely unavailable today. The Lucian music industry is quite small scale, due to the island's small market, its lack of recording studios and record producers, the widespread bootlegging of cassettes, and the general unavailability <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> musical ventures. Saint Lucia is home to several radio stations including Radio St. Lucia and Radio Caribbean International, which play a variety of popular music; since 1989, St Lucian radio stations have played {{an increasing number of}} programs about Lucian culture and in the local Creole tongue.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War the {{historical}} analysis of British castles {{was dominated by}} Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw {{an increasing number of}} excavations of motte and bailey castles, and the number of castle excavations as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With an increasing number of castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> rescue archaeology. Despite this the number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, drawing on the evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier in the century.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, South Dakota has {{the lowest}} per capita total state tax rate in the United States. The state does not levy {{personal}} or corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, or taxes on intangible personal property. The state sales tax rate is 4.5 percent. Various localities have local levies so in some areas the rate is 6 percent. The state sales tax {{does not apply to}} sales to Indians on Indian reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of sales tax collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large source <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units. The South Dakota Special Tax Division regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol-related taxes.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, the Government of the Cook Islands {{identified}} the lack <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> sport facilities {{as a key}} reason why the nation has not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995. While official recognition as an Olympic sport {{did not mean that}} it was played at the Olympics, it did mean that the national association and the Cook Islands government could then access Olympic funding to help cover costs for facilities, travel, coaching, umpire training and other grass roots development efforts. The Cook Islands Netball Association is the governing body for the sport in the Cook Islands, and historically, the sport has been administered by women. Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside. In 1990, the Cook Islands Netball Association had 15 clubs affiliated with it, all based in the southern islands group, including Ngatangia/Matavera, Avatiu/Nikao, Arorangi, Titikaveka, Takuvaine, Tupapa, Outer Islands.|$|E
5|$|In 354BC, Demosthenes {{delivered}} his first political oration, On the Navy, {{in which he}} espoused moderation and proposed the reform of the symmoriai (boards) as a source <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the Athenian fleet. In 352BC, he delivered For the Megalopolitans and, in 351BC, On the Liberty of the Rhodians. In both speeches he opposed Eubulus, the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342BC. The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism {{in the internal affairs}} of the other Greek cities. Contrary to Eubulus's policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with Megalopolis against Sparta or Thebes, and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife. His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens's needs and interests through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, her {{government}} {{introduced legislation}} to reform funding {{arrangements for the}} health system, {{with the intention of}} giving the Commonwealth responsibility for providing the majority of funding to public hospitals and 100 per cent <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> primary care and GP services. In February 2011, Gillard announced extensive revision of the original health funding reforms proposed by the Rudd Government, which had been unable to secure the support of all state governments. The revised Gillard government plan proposed that the federal government move towards providing 50% of new health funding (and not 60 per cent as originally agreed) and removed the requirement of the states to cede a proportion of their GST revenue to the Federal Government in order to fund the new arrangement. The new agreement was supported by all state premiers and chief ministers and signed on 2 August.|$|E

5|$|The Costume Institute Gala {{is a major}} {{fundraising}} {{benefit that}} serves as an opening celebration for the Institute's annual fashion exhibit. Following the event, the exhibition runs for several months. The 2014 exhibition was scheduled to run from May 8 until August 10, 2014. The Gala {{is widely regarded as}} one of the most exclusive social events in New York and one of the biggest fundraising nights in the city with $9 million raised in 2013 and a record of $12 million the following year. It is one of the most notable sources <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the Institute. The affair, attended by personalities from the arts, fashion, high-society, film and music, has been held at the Met since 1948 and is considered to be the fashion industry's premier annual red carpet event. Its red carpet fashions are widely photographed, reviewed, critiqued and emulated. The museum is closed to the general public on the first Monday of May due to the gala occurring.|$|E
5|$|The academy {{was formed}} as a not-for-profit company in 1999 and officially opened on 1 April 2000. It {{occupied}} converted naval premises until a clubhouse was built, which was opened in June 2005 by the Princess Royal. £7.85 million <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> the project was donated by charities, individuals and local councils; the National Lottery donated £3 million in 2003, and the South West Regional Development Agency added £3.34 million. The academy's aims are to promote the sport of sailing {{at all levels of}} competence and ability, through courses, training and events, and to contribute to the economic regeneration of the area. Since opening it has created a demand in service and marine industries worth around £10 million. WPNSA continues to promote sailing to local schools, offering benefits such as free boat hoist and storage. Use of the facilities and access to training is open to anyone in return for an annual membership fee. On 6 July 2005, London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, and the WPNSA was chosen to host the sailing events.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} the men {{galvanized}} the missionary effort in the United States, sparking an outpouring <b>of</b> <b>funding</b> <b>for</b> evangelization efforts around the world. Their work is still frequently remembered in evangelical publications, and in 2006 {{was the subject of}} the film production End of the Spear. Several years after the death of the men, the widow of Jim Elliot, Elisabeth, and the sister of Nate Saint, Rachel, returned to Ecuador as missionaries with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International) to live among the Huaorani. This eventually led to the conversion of many, including some of those involved in the killing. While largely eliminating tribal violence, their efforts exposed the tribe to increased influence from the outside.|$|E
