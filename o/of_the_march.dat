5|$|Conversely, Robespierre's impassioned defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march</b> {{raised his}} public profile considerably.

His later rise to become virtual dictator of the Revolution was greatly facilitated by his actions during the occupation of the Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{co-operation}} in the AFL-CIO merger, Meany and Reuther had {{a contentious}} relationship for many years. In 1963, Meany and Reuther disagreed about the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, {{a major event}} {{in the history of}} the civil rights movement in the United States. Meany opposed AFL-CIO endorsement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march.</b> In an AFL-CIO executive council meeting on August 12, Reuther's motion for a strong endorsement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march</b> was supported by only A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the titular leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march.</b> The AFL-CIO endorsed a civil rights law and allowed individual unions to endorse the march. When Meany heard Randolph's speech after the march, he was visibly moved. Thereafter, he supported the creation of the A. Philip Randolph Institute to strengthen labor unions among African Americans and to strengthen ties with the African American community. Randolph said that he was sure that Meany was morally opposed to racism.|$|E

5|$|For {{the march}} itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest {{discipline}} and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, {{but from the}} residents of his own ashram, who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline. The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march,</b> along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march</b> so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based {{on the needs of}} the local residents. Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.|$|E

5|$|A distant, mournful fanfare (A), {{played on}} a cornet {{representing}} a bugle, {{is followed by a}} brisk military march initiated by a duet for side drum and piccolo (B). A passage for brass precedes the introduction of a theme or leitmotif associated with the phantom Kijé which, after a reprise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march</b> and a C major crescendo, is repeated on tenor saxophone, an instrument relatively new to the orchestra at that time. The cornet fanfare then returns to close the movement.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards {{came the}} Bataan Death March, {{which was the}} forcible transfer, by the Imperial Japanese Army, of 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war after the three-month Battle of Bataan in the Philippines during World War II. The death toll <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march</b> is {{difficult}} to assess as thousands of captives were able to escape from their guards (although many were killed during their escapes), {{and it is not}} known how many died in the fighting that was taking place concurrently. All told, approximately 2,500–10,000 Filipino and 300–650 American prisoners of war died before they could reach Camp O'Donnell.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking the road.

Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces for the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march,</b> the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, there was common resentment against the reactionary attitudes {{prevailing}} in Court circles {{even before the}} uproar sparked by the notorious banquet precipitated the political aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march.</b> Deeper planners in the crowd spread the word that the king needed to dismiss his royal bodyguards entirely and replace them all with patriotic National Guardsmen, a line of argument that had a compelling resonance among Lafayette's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|C. Rajagopalachari, a close {{associate}} of Gandhi, led the march which had close to 150 volunteers, {{most of whom}} belonged to the Indian National Congress. It began at Trichinopoly (now Tiruchirappalli) on 13 April 1930 and proceeded for about 150 miles towards the east before culminating at Vedaranyam, a small coastal town in the then Tanjore District. By collecting salt directly from the sea the marchers broke the salt law. As a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march,</b> Rajagopalachari created awareness among the people by highlighting the importance of khādī {{as well as social}} issues like caste discrimination. The campaign came to an end on 28 April 1930 when the participants were arrested by the police. Its leader Rajagopalachari was imprisoned for six months. The march along with the ones at Dandi and Dharasana drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement.|$|E

Robin Herd, co-owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>March</b> Racing Team, took control of the club in 1995. In June of that year, the board of directors unveiled plans for a new 16,000-seat stadium at Minchery Farm, to replace the dilapidated Manor Ground. The club had hoped to move into the new stadium near the Blackbird Leys housing estate by the start of the 1998–99 season, but construction was suspended during the preceding season, because construction company Taylor Woodrow had not been paid for the work already undertaken.|$|E

5|$|In Asia Minor, Conrad {{decided not}} {{to wait for the}} French, and marched towards Iconium, capital of the Seljuq Sultanate of Rûm. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the {{authority}} of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads. Conrad underestimated the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>march</b> against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case. Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road. The king led one of these, which was almost totally destroyed by the Seljuqs on 25 October 1147 at the second battle of Dorylaeum.|$|E

The ship has the features of a Caduceus representing trade and economy. This kind of mast has two wings surrounding a pole with two snakes encircling it.
