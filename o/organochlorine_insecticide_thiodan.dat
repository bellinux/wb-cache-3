40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{usage of}} <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticides</b> in the Queensland sugar industry from 1947 to 1987, there is remarkably little {{information on the}} use and environmental consequences of their usage. This thesis explores three aspects of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticide</b> use in two significant sugarcane growing regions in North Queensland, the Herbert and Burdekin River regions. The first is the distribution of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticide</b> residues in sugarcane soils and coastal and riverine sediments in both regions to assess the current distribution of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticide</b> residues and provide information on historical inputs to coastal sediments. This information is combined with historical information regarding insecticide use in both regions to derive a mass balance for the applied insecticides. The second {{is the use of}} an enzyme assay (ethoxyresorufin 0 -deethylase, EROD) to assess the exposure of a common tropical estuarine fish species, Acanthopagrus berda, to a range of organic contaminants and provide a screening tool for exposure to <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticide</b> residues. The third aspect is the examination of the historical factors influencing risks associated with insect control in the sugar industry, with a particular emphasis of the risks associated with <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticide</b> use. Easily detectable concentrations of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticide</b> residues were found in the sugarcane soils of the Herbert and Burdekin River regions and reflected known application histories.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Organochlorine</b> <b>insecticides</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} organotoxins and make a large group of pesticides. Physicochemical properties of these toxins, especially their high lipophilicity, facilitate the absorption and storage of these toxins in human and animal bodies. The existence of the residues of these toxins in milk {{which is one of the}} most widely used foodstuff containing lipids can be a quantitative and qualitative index for the presence of these toxins in animal bodies. In this research the residues of seven important <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticides</b> in 35 milk samples marketed in the city of Ahwaz, Iran, have been identified and measured. First the lipid phase was separated from the aqueous phase, then extraction of the toxin residues from the lipid phase and subsequent purification of each was achieved through a column of activated Florusil. Detection and measurement of the toxins were achieved by using HPLC instrument with a UV-Visible detector.

The analytical method for the determination of <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticides</b> is based on the technique of Microwave-Assisted Extraction. The extraction was carried out with 40 mL of an acetonitrile/water (95 : 5) mixture at 100 oC for 10 min. Compound detection was carried out by GC/MS. Method recoveries for all compounds were higher than 80 % and LOQ values were in the range of 5 - 10 μg/kg. The analytical method for the determination of lignans in blood plasma consists of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the samples, the isolation of the lignans and the sample clean-up by the use of adsorbents, and the chromatographic determination by HPLC. Mean recoveries were in the range of 74 - 98 % with RSD values lower than 11 %. The study for the absorption of the lignans by the organism was carried out by the administration of experimental diets based on sesame seeds and its products to rats.
