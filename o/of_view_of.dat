5|$|From {{the point}} <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> physics, spirals are lowest-energy {{configurations}} which emerge spontaneously through self-organizing processes in dynamic systems. From the point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> chemistry, a spiral {{can be generated}} by a reaction-diffusion process, involving both activation and inhibition. Phyllotaxis is controlled by proteins that manipulate the concentration of the plant hormone auxin, which activates meristem growth, alongside other mechanisms to control the relative angle of buds around the stem. From a biological perspective, arranging leaves as far apart as possible in any given space is favoured by natural selection as it maximises access to resources, especially sunlight for photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> each chapter in the story is a limited {{perspective}} {{of a range of}} characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories interweave a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.|$|E
5|$|Accounts of {{the conquest}} {{as seen from}} the point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> the {{defeated}} highland Maya kingdoms are included in a number of indigenous documents, including the Annals of the Kaqchikels, which includes the Xajil Chronicle describing the history of the Kaqchikel from their mythical creation down through the Spanish conquest and continuing to 1619.

5|$|For {{the design}} of the Festspielhaus, Wagner {{appropriated}} some of the ideas of his former colleague, Gottfried Semper, which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at Munich.

5|$|From {{the point}} <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} {{is related to}} Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used to compute the Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E

Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E

5|$|In cladistics, a homoplasy is a trait {{shared by}} two or more taxa for any reason other than that they share a common ancestry. Taxa which do share ancestry {{are part of the}} same clade; cladistics seeks to arrange them {{according}} to their degree of relatedness to describe their phylogeny. Homoplastic traits caused by convergence are therefore, from the point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> cladistics, confounding factors which could lead to an incorrect analysis.|$|E
5|$|In that vein, {{infinite}} matrices {{can also}} be used to describe operators on Hilbert spaces, where convergence and continuity questions arise, which again results in certain constraints that have to be imposed. However, the explicit point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> matrices tends to obfuscate the matter, and the abstract and more powerful tools of functional analysis can be used instead.|$|E
