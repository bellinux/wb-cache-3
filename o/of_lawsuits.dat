5|$|Later in his career, Ford {{split with}} Huddleston's successor, Mitch McConnell, over a {{proposed}} settlement <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits</b> against tobacco companies. Ford favored the package as presented to Congress, {{which would have}} protected the price support program, while McConnell favored a smaller aid package to tobacco farmers {{and an end to}} the price support program. Both proposals were ultimately defeated, and the rift between Ford and McConnell never healed.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits</b> {{complicated}} the divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up its bid to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E

5|$|The NAACP {{then brought}} suit {{challenging}} all five laws in state court. A state circuit court held {{three of the}} laws unconstitutional, but upheld the barratry law and the law prohibiting advocacy <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits</b> against the state. On appeal, the Virginia Supreme Court struck down the anti-advocacy law as well, but upheld the barratry law. In a 6-to-3 ruling in 1963 that gave broad protection to public interest legal organizations, the U.S. Supreme Court in NAACP v. Button, held that all five of the barratry, champerty, and maintenance laws violated the 1st and 14th Amendments to the constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Ratsiraka {{administration}} {{launched an}} inquiry into Tiko business practices in September 2000 and issued an executive decision in June 2001 that the company should be shut down for failure to adhere to a 1996 agreement requiring Tiko to create jobs and produce low-cost vegetable oil; this ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court on 16 October 2002. A number <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits</b> have been filed over Ravalomanana's business practices, including a court judgment {{on the eve of}} the 2001 presidential election requiring the payment of between 200 and 363 billion Malagasy francs in Tiko back taxes, but all were either dismissed or ended in an out-of-court settlement; none resulted in a criminal conviction.|$|E

5|$|The {{two works}} are bound {{together}} in one surviving manuscript, the earliest surviving cartulary from medieval England. A major theme is the losses suffered by Worcester {{at the hands of}} royal officials and local landowners. Included amongst the despoilers are kings such as Cnut and William the Conqueror, and nobles such as Eadric Streona and Urse d'Abetot. Also included are accounts <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits</b> waged by the Worcester monks in an effort to regain their lost lands. The two sections of the cartulary were first printed in 1723. The original manuscript was slightly damaged by fire in 1733, and required rebinding. A new printed edition is in production as of 2010.|$|E
5|$|A series <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits</b> {{between the}} State of Oregon, the United States government, and the railroads ensued. Another lawsuit was brought by Portland {{attorney}} and future U.S. Representative Walter Lafferty {{on behalf of}} 18 western Oregon counties, which sued to claim revenue from timber sales on the O lands. The cases worked their {{way up to the}} United States Supreme Court, which ruled in 1915 in Oregon & California R. Co. v. United States that despite the violation of grant terms, the railroad had been built and the railroad company should be compensated. In 1916, Congress passed the Chamberlain–Ferris Act, which revested the remaining 2,800,000 acres of land to the United States government, and compensated the railroad at $2.50 per acre from an account, the Oregon and California land grant fund, funded by timber sales from the land. Oregon counties affected by the revestiture of land were also to be compensated from the fund.|$|E
5|$|Cohen {{thereafter}} {{launched a}} media offensive claiming the DRS was biased {{in favor of}} large businesses and made frequent threats <b>of</b> <b>lawsuits</b> against Nominet. Cohen stated {{he believed that the}} DRS system was unfair {{for a number of reasons}} and would seek redress against Nominet with the High Court via judicial review. Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via the appeal process in the DRS. Cohen refused and, after several months, instead issued proceedings for judicial review. The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen's case in August 2005, noting that Cohen's company, Cyberbritain Group Ltd., should have used the appeal process forming part of Nominet's domain resolution service. Afterward, Cohen's company asked for a rehearing and, as that case progressed, the interim domain name was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site. In November 2005, Cohen dropped all legal action against Apple.|$|E
