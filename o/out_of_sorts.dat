25|$|Bosman {{finally made}} it to a World Twenty20 tournament in the Caribbean in 2010, but {{appeared}} strangely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sorts</b> and made just eight runs in two innings, failing to find the boundary once. Despite that failure, he was signed by Derbyshire as their overseas player for the Friends Provident t20 tournament in 2010, and responded in superb fashion, hammering 94 off 50 balls {{to set up a}} crushing 65-run win over a strong Yorkshire side in June.|$|E
25|$|Cnut died at Shaftesbury in Dorset and {{was buried}} in the Old Minster, Winchester. With the events of 1066 the new regime of Normandy was keen to signal its arrival with an ambitious {{programme}} of grandiose cathedrals and castles throughout the High Middle Ages. Winchester Cathedral was built on the old Anglo-Saxon site and the previous burials, including Cnut's, were set in mortuary chests there. During the English Civil War in the 17th century, plundering Roundhead soldiers scattered the bones of Cnut on the floor and they were spread amongst the various other chests, notably those of William Rufus. After the restoration of the monarchy, the bones were collected and replaced in their chests, although somewhat <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sorts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Even Gowen's {{anthracite}} combination, {{successful at}} maintaining profitable market prices even as depression set in, {{was not able}} to continue long in unity. Internecine squabbles and continued deteriorating business conditions all around undermined the effectiveness of this pooling effort, and coal prices and revenues fluctuated year by year. The combination unraveled in August 1876, with Gowen angrily denouncing erstwhile coal pool member Asa Packer by name. Meanwhile, earlier in the year the Coal & Iron Company's retail marketing operation at Port Richmond was transferred to an independent concern. As the Philadelphia coal market continued to decline, Schuylkill County mine operators sent Thomas Baumgardner, who had given Franklin Gowen his first introduction to the coal and iron businesses during his apprenticeship, as part of a committee to get a read on Gowen's intentions. Still <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sorts</b> over the larger anthracite combination's falling apart, Gowen would not commit to any new price-fixing arrangement.|$|E

25|$|Though {{there was}} 35 minutes for England to bat until stumps they survived with 10/0 as a stormcloud loomed over the ground. Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were sending down three short balls an over and Umpire Bailhache {{told them they}} should bowl fuller, but the next ball was a Thommo bouncer and the umpire gave the English batsmen {{the benefit of the}} bad light. Ian Chappell complained about the umpire's {{interference}} as strictly speaking he could not tell the bowlers what to bowl and the ABC commentator Frank Tyson agreed. Brian Luckhurst edged Lillee (2/25) to Ian Chappell early the next morning leaving Dennis Amiss and John Edrich to bat, both of whom had broken bones in their hands from the first innings. Edrich took pain-killing injections in the drinks break, but was plainly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sorts</b> and was bowled by Thomson (6/46). Amiss received a brute of a ball from Thomson that he sent to Doug Walters at third slip. This brought Mike Denness and Keith Fletcher together at 40/3 and they resisted for an hour when the captain was taken by Walters off another Thommo thunderbolt, soon followed by Fletcher, caught by Greg Chappell off Terry Jenner (2/45) and Tony Greig bowled by Thomson yorker at 94/6. There was little hope of England lasting the day, but Alan Knott held out for two hours making 19, adding 29 with Peter Lever and 47 with the top-scorer Derek Underwood (30). When Underwood fell at 162/8, Knott and Hendrick soon followed and England were all out for 166 to lose by 166 runs, 84 minutes short of saving the game. Thomson took 6/46, which remained the best Test figures of his career.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{defended the}} scene as {{appropriate}} for Bond's character development. While HuffPost's Daniel Wood felt that the Sévérine was killed {{too early in the}} film, he associated her death with the removal of the [...] "harmless chauvinism" [...] starting from Casino Royale, and better connected with Bond's emotionally deficient character. Wood acknowledged that the representation of female characters as [...] "commodities" [...] was negative, but argued it suited Bond's characterization. James Peaty of Den of Geek! interpreted the moment as purposefully [...] "brutal and shocking" [...] in order show the audience [...] "how <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sorts</b> Bond has become and that perhaps the greatest threat he faces this time out is his own inertia and ineptitude" [...] and shift the film's focus to M (Judi Dench).|$|E

When Doggett and Reyes arrive, they hear a gunshot from inside an abandoned warehouse. There, they find Richman dead. Scully explains that he was holding her at gunpoint until they arrived, then shot himself. After Scully's lecture to FBI cadets, Doggett explains to her and Reyes that Kobold planned the entire ordeal as a game and got away with it. Explaining that the word [...] "Dae/moni/cus" [...] was code for the chosen victims' names, in a game Kobold devised to culminate in his eventual escape from the asylum. That the [...] "demons" [...] angle was merely to get the X-files' involvement and that they were all thoroughly [...] "checkmated" [...] by Kodold. Reyes, though accepting of Doggett's theories, is still nevertheless disconcerted with the true feeling of evil that she experienced, and believes Doggett was equally <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sorts</b> because, though loath to admit it, he too felt its presence.|$|E

After recovering from the injury Ramdin was recalled to the Test squad to tour England in May and July, replacing Baugh who had not contributed as many runs as the selectors hoped. Playing his first Tests since 2010 he set himself a target of scoring three half-centuries in the three-Test series. West Indies lost the first two matches and Ramdin made scores of 6, 43, 1 and 6,• prompting former player Viv Richards to remark [...] "Ramdin just looks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sorts.</b>|$|E

[...] Utley remained confident for the 2014 season. [...] "For younger guys, I think results make you feel better," [...] Utley said. [...] "But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I felt pretty decent at the plate.

2500|$|The Cricket Ground hosted {{what many}} {{consider}} to be the toughest Grand Final of all in 1973 when defending premiers Manly-Warringah faced the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, who were playing in their first ever Grand Final after joining the competition in 1967. The Sharks were Captain-coached by Great Britain halfback Tommy Bishop and had a forward pack led by his tough St. Helens and GB teammate Cliff Watson and 1973 Rothmans Medallist Ken Maddison, along with goal kicking 18-year-old whiz-kid centre Steve Rogers. Manly were coached by Ron Willey and captained by tough hooker Freddy Jones, and could boast internationals Ken Irvine, Ray Branighan, Bob Fulton, John O'Neill, British lock Malcolm Reilly, as well as tough tackling second-row forward Terry Randall and 19-year-old fullback Graham Eadie. From the opening kick off the game descended into a series of high or late tackles and several all-in brawls, though surprisingly referee Keith Page didn't send any player off, despite threatening to do so and repeatedly handing out cautions, including twice to all 26 players on the field. In the opening minutes of the game, Mal Reilly was felled in back play by Cronulla hooker Ron [...] "Rocky" [...] Turner well after he kicked the ball and, after writhing on the ground in agony with a badly bruised hip, left the field for a pain killing injection. When he returned he created mayhem with strong-arm tactics, although he was clearly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>sorts</b> football wise and was replaced after just 25 minutes by John Bucknell. In the end, {{the difference between the two}} teams was Manly's international centre Bob Fulton who scored two tries in leading Manly to a 10–7 win. The game was described by Sunday Telegraph writer Ian Heads as [...] "A Grand Final as tough and dirty as any bar-room brawl".|$|E
