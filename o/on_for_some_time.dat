The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid {{than that of the}} female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, {{in stark contrast to the}} relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E

References in the Talmud to the Sifra are ambiguous; It is uncertain whether the texts mentioned in the Talmud are to {{an earlier version of}} our Sifra, or to the sources that the Sifra also drew upon. References to the Sifra {{from the time of the}} early medieval rabbis (and after) are to the text extant today. The core of this text developed in the mid-3rd century as a critique and commentary of the Mishnah, although subsequent additions and editing went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> afterwards.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} this neglect, the Indian towns at San Juan Capistrano, San Dieguito, and Las Flores did {{continue}} <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> under a provision in Gobernador Echeandía's 1826 Proclamation that allowed for the partial conversion of missions to pueblos. According to one estimate, the native population {{in and around the}} missions proper was approximately 80,000 {{at the time of the}} confiscation; others claim that the statewide population had dwindled to approximately 100,000 by the early 1840s, due in no small part to the natives' exposure to European diseases, and from the Franciscan practice of cloistering women in the convento and controlling sexuality during the child-bearing age. (Baja California Territory experienced a similar reduction in native population resulting from Spanish colonization efforts there).|$|E
25|$|Once {{the siege}} began, the Thebans fought desperately, fearing for their homes, wives and children. The battle went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> {{and it was}} in doubt. However, Alexander sent in his {{reserves}} and the situation started to improve. Despite the Theban's valiant struggle, however, Alexander noticed that a unit of their guard had abandoned one of the gates. It is here that he sent Perdiccas troops to enter and penetrate into the city itself. At this point, realizing that the fight for the city walls was a lost cause, the Thebans retreated and began their final battle within the city itself. It was around this time that Philotas and his garrison broke out of the citadel and began fighting in the battle as well.|$|E

25|$|The battle went <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> with {{no clear}} victor, but the Syracusans {{eventually}} pushed the Athenian ships toward the coast, and the Athenian crews fled to the camp behind their wall. Demosthenes suggested that they man the ships again and attempt to force their way out, as now both fleets had lost about half their ships and Nicias agreed. The men themselves {{did not want to}} board the ship because they were afraid. They then decided to retreat by land. Hermocrates sent some supposed informers to the Athenians to falsely report that there were spies and roadblocks further inland, so the Athenians would be safer if they did not march away. Gylippus used this delay to build the roadblocks that did not yet exist, and the Syracusans burned or towed away the Athenian ships on the beach, so that they had no way off the island.|$|E
25|$|This pattern goes <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> {{until the}} Super Bowl {{comes up and}} Tender's agent plans him an {{elaborate}} wedding to take place at half-time, following which, Tender will issue another miraculous prediction. Tender goes wandering around, trying {{to meet up with}} Fertility, which he finally does in a men's bathroom where they've taken adjacent stalls. Adam appears then with a gun, and reveals that he's already laid a trap to kill Tender's agent the same way he killed the caseworker, so that Tender would be suspect for both murders. Fertility confirms that the agent will die the next day at the Super Bowl, and comes up with a plan for Tender to make a prediction big enough to distract the police long enough for him to escape. Adam, intending this all along, plans to escape with Tender and Fertility. Agreed on their course of action, the three part.|$|E
25|$|Chiume later drew {{attention}} to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating {{their opposition to the}} post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them. Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots had been going <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack of agreed objectives and the unplanned nature of their response. The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest thing there was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.|$|E

2500|$|Following on from Dune, Lynch was contractually still {{obliged to}} produce two other {{projects}} for De Laurentiis: {{the first of}} these was a planned sequel, which due to the film's lack of success never went beyond the script stage. The other was a more personal work, based upon a script that Lynch had been working <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> Developing from ideas that Lynch had had since 1973, the resulting film, Blue Velvet, was set in the fictional town of Lumberton, USA, and revolves around a college student named Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan), who finds a severed ear in a field. Subsequently, investigating further with the help of friend Sandy (Laura Dern), he uncovers that it is related to a criminal gang led by psychopath Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), who has kidnapped the husband and child of singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and repeatedly subjects her to rape. Lynch himself characterizes the story as [...] "a dream of strange desires wrapped inside a mystery story".|$|E
2500|$|In 1845, it was {{alleged that}} paupers at the Andover Union workhouse {{employed}} in crushing bones were (regardless {{of age or}} state of decay) eating marrow from the bones and gnawing off any shreds of meat still adherent. [...] When reported to the guardians, they had neither intervened, nor informed the Poor Law Commissioners. [...] The Assistant Poor Law Commissioner for the area (a Mr Parker) was sent to investigate, and found the allegations to be largely true, if slightly over-stated. This had been going <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> without being detected by the Poor Law Commission's supervisory regime (in the first instance Mr Parker). The Home Secretary had {{on a number of}} occasions told the House of Commons that grinding bone was work of too penal a nature to be carried out by workhouse inmates, and the Poor Law Commission would see that his wish that it should cease was acted upon. [...] The crushed bones were mostly sold to the guardians(for use as fertiliser) at a price which did not represent good value for the rate-payer.|$|E

2500|$|Evidence {{from the}} reign of [...] King Henry VIII seems to show the abbey {{suffering}} from neglect and maladministration in its later years. Abbot Richard Lye lavished {{the resources of the}} monastery on his own family. On 25 October 1508 he granted to his sister Joan and her husband, John Copeland, a large weekly ration of bread and ale, twelve wagonloads of wood annually from Lythwood, and tithes of corn and hay from the townships of Prescott and Stanwardine in the Wood, in Baschurch parish. They also received property: a dwelling house and a shop in Shrewsbury, and meadowland and another home in Colneham. It seems that this generosity with others' property had gone <b>on</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time,</b> as they were also given the reversion of further meadowland then occupied by Joan and the abbot's father, Lodovic Lye. The gifts were limited to Joan's lifetime, apart from the shop and houses, which were to pass to her husband for his lifetime if he survived her. Episcopal visitations from the time of Abbot Richard Baker complain of unpaid debts, poor accounting, buildings in decay and land leased without consulting the chapter. This apparently refers to the grants to Joan and John Copeland, which had been made nominally on behalf of abbot and convent together. The infirmary was in ruins and Thomas Butler, the subprior, had taken its glass for his own chamber.|$|E
