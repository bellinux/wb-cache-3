50|$|The {{rectangular}} mill {{stands on}} a fieldstone foundation. The wooden body of the mill is faced with shingles. The boat-shaped roof is also covered with shingles. It has latticed vanes with a span of 60 ft, designed to be covered with sailcloth. The mill can be rotated {{by means of a}} manually operated yaw. For a period, a bakery was attached to the mill. The workings of the mill have been preserved and include grinders, an <b>oat</b> <b>roller,</b> a drum sieve, a cap wheel, a crown drive and a vane shaft.|$|E

Dry milling of oats using roller milling offers the opportunity to produce, at a lower processing cost, fractions enriched in antioxidant activity. <b>Oats</b> were <b>roller</b> milled and the stocks separated by size using sieving; the fractions were analysed for compositional differences. A clear difference was seen between the larger particles, which were richer in bran and its associated components, and the smaller, starch-rich particles, with a natural cut-off point occurring at 420 μm. This established the feasibility of using dry milling and sieving oats to yield enriched fractions. Oats (cv. Gerald) from a variety of sources were dehulled then milled once and fractionated to yield a bran-rich fraction (> 420 μm) and a starch-rich fraction (< 420 μm). Polar lipid extracts were derived from these fractions and their antioxidant activity measured by chemiluminescence (CL). Bran-rich fractions had significantly higher antioxidant activity than the corresponding starch-rich fraction and appeared to have a more potent population of phenolic antioxidant compounds...|$|R
