5|$|During {{the entire}} period of 1970–74, FRELIMO {{intensified}} guerrilla operations, specialising in urban terrorism. The use of landmines also intensified, with sources stating {{that they had}} become responsible for two <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> Portuguese casualties. During the conflict, FRELIMO {{used a variety of}} anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, including the PMN (Black Widow), TM-46, and POMZ. Even amphibious mines were used, such as the PDM. Mine psychosis, an acute fear of landmines, was rampant in the Portuguese forces. This fear, coupled with the frustration of taking casualties without ever seeing the enemy forces, damaged morale and significantly hampered progress.|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} {{have been seen}} {{sleeping}} and foraging together as monogamous pairs, although polygamy and solitary behavior has also been observed. At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> days. During social grooming (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using a scent gland on the throat, and grooming sessions can last several minutes. While feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over non-resident males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta).|$|E

The one weapon of which there was no shortage was locally produced explosives. However, they had far less than what was necessary to carry out a war: in November, only one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> Jewish combatants was armed, rising to two out of three within Palmach.|$|E

After the 1925-26, all seven provincial teams featured in every season. They were joined temporarily by Rhodesia (who contested the consecutive 1929-30 and 1931-32 season), and permanently by North Eastern Transvaal in 1937-38, which was the final season before World War II.

40|$|M. Ed. Depression of {{adolescents}} is often misunderstood or misjudged. Depression is an universal disorder worldwide {{and there are}} more than 300 million people who are suffering from it (Star, 11 April 1999). Approximately nine percent of all children experience symptoms of depression. It increases from twenty two to forty percent among adolescents (Offord, 1987 : 10). On any given point of time there are as much as one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> thirty <b>three</b> children and as many as one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> eight adolescents suffering from clinical depression (Dubuque, 1998 : 64). Unfortunately depression has become part of our society and we shall {{have to learn how to}} handle it in order to render assistance to people who are suffering from this disorder. It is a shocking fact that more and more adolescents are trying to commit suicide. This is one of the findings that came to light in September 1999 during a Symposium of the South African Council for Child and Family Care. The following question arises: what is the experience of adolescent girls who are in a place of caring and who are suffering from depression and which guidelines could be provided to psychological educationists to accompany girls and to promote their mental health?A qualitative, describing and conceptual design was used to collect data and describe the adolescent girl in a place of caring and who is suffering from depression. The research took place in two phases. In Phase One in depth phenomenological interviews were conducted. In Phase Two logical inference was used to generate guidelines to psychological educationists to provide accompaniment to adolescent girls who are in places of care and who are suffering from depression. From the research it appeared that the following themes continuously came to the front amongst girls who are in places of care and who are suffering from depression: • need of acceptance and fear of loneliness; • a lack of hope and purpose in life; and • psychological coping mechanisms as a way of handling situations. The following sub-themes of adolescent girls who are in places of care and who are suffering from depression are identified: • a negative self concept; • poor self acceptance; • poor interpersonal relationships; • fear which is related to the girls' own helplessness and inability to escape from situations; and • defence mechanisms: rationalisation to make depression more acceptable; and suppression to suppress emotions in this way. From the research certain needs were identified by adolescent girls who are in places of care and who are suffering from depression: • the need of acceptance and the need of the addressing the fear of loneliness; • the addressing of feelings of lack of hope and purpose in life; and • the need of healthy coping mechanisms as a way in which situations could be handled. Guidelines to psychological educationists for the accompaniment of adolescent girls who are in places of care and who are suffering from depression are set out as follows: • guidelines to address the need of acceptance and the fear for loneliness; • guidelines to address the lack of hope and purpose in life; and • guidelines to develop healthy coping mechanisms...|$|R
25|$|Chek Lap Kok Airport was {{designed}} as a replacement for the former Hong Kong International Airport (commonly known as Kai Tak Airport) built in 1925. Located in the densely built-up Kowloon City District with a single runway extending into Kowloon Bay, Kai Tak had only limited room for expansion to cope with steadily increasing air traffic. By the 1990s, Kai Tak had become one of the world's busiest airports – it far exceeded its annual passenger and cargo design capacities, and one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> flights experienced delays, largely due to lack of space for aircraft, gates, and a second runway. In addition, noise mitigation measures restricted nighttime flights, as severe noise pollution (exceeding 105dB(A) in Kowloon City) adversely affected an estimated total of at least 340,000 people.|$|E
25|$|With {{the switch}} to CBS, WTTV became the de facto home station of the Colts, due to CBS' {{contract}} to carry a schedule mainly made up of American Football Conference games and Thursday Night Football, and a deal between Tribune Broadcasting and the team making the station and WXIN exclusive broadcast partners. This means both stations will air Colts preseason games, team programming and coach's show beginning {{in the summer of}} 2015; advertising within Lucas Oil Stadium is also included in the deal. Additionally, both stations will carry the Super Bowl for two <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> years starting in 2016, with WTTV carrying CBS coverage of Super Bowl 50 in 2016 and WXIN Fox's coverage of Super Bowl LI in 2017. Between CBS' AFC rights and Fox's NFC rights, the only time the Colts would not play on a Tribune station would be if they were scheduled for an NBC Sunday Night Football telecast, which would air on WTHR, or ESPN Monday Night Football, which has traditionally aired on WRTV. The first Colts game to air on WTTV as a CBS affiliate was the team's first-round playoff victory over the Cincinnati Bengals on January 4, and it carried two more games in the 2014 NFL season before the Colts lost to the Patriots in the AFC Championship on January 18, 2015.|$|E

500|$|Another {{cardioid}} subwoofer array pattern {{can be used}} horizontally, {{one which}} takes few channels of processing and no change in required physical space. This method is often called [...] "cardioid subwoofer array" [...] or [...] "CSA" [...] even though the pattern of all directional subwoofer methods is cardioid. The CSA method reverses the enclosure orientation and inverts the polarity of one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>three</b> subwoofers {{across the front of}} the stage, and delays those enclosures for maximum cancellation of the target frequency on stage. Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically, by reversing the wiring polarity, or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward. This method reduces forward output relative to a tight-packed, flat-fronted array of subwoofers, but can solve problems of unwanted low frequency energy coming into microphones on stage. Compared to the end-fire array, this method has less on-axis energy but more even pattern control throughout the audience, and more predictable cancellation rearward. The effect spans a range of slightly more than one octave.|$|E
