40|$|The {{systematic}} use of mice {{for research}} purposes began in 1929 {{in one of the}} oldest laboratories of modern science, the Jackson laboratory in Bar Harbour, Maine (USA), which was built to facilitate the study of the 'genetics of cancer in inbred strains of mice' (Knowles 1998, p. 116). But those years were not easy times for researchers, and so in order to maintain financial security the 'scientists undertook many activities to support their investigations into the genetic control of cancer, including the sale of their own research animals' (ibid.). It seems that in pre-war America scientists turned entrepreneurial out of necessity (see on the entrepreneurial bio-scientists Betta 2006; on the cultural shift in science Finkel 2005). Around 1998 the Jackson laboratory distributed two million manipulated mice per year. 'However, the scientific staff of the laboratory remained closely involved in ensuring the genetic quality of distributed strains' (ibid). Is the <b>onco-mouse</b> an animal, an artefact, or a tool? Undoubtedly, the <b>onco-mouse</b> is the product of primitive laboratory science as it first emerged in the 1920 s, although it embodies a certain form of creativity and entrepreneurial style in an unusual place. By primitive laboratory science we mean little sophisticated laboratory science compared with what is currently at stake in the laboratories of the new genetic science, in which we witness an increased commercialisation of physical life in general, health, healthcare, and medicine. In the laboratories of the new genetics rules a new form of creativity, one which is capable of creating strong and durable objects, weak and revocable subjects, and interdependent objects-subjects. But what sort of entity is the <b>onco-mouse?</b> It seems to us that this entity will never escape the status that has been assigned to it by creative scientific zeal, and which results from a particular scientific approach towards nature; this approach has been made possible by a cultural change that helped to transform a creature into a novel system for the study of diseases. To implant cancer cells into an animal scientists have to increase the level of pain and unwell-being to it, something that must result from an economic attitude to life. Testing procedures sometimes presuppose the creation of platforms on which new drugs are applied and tested. This is the case of the oncomouse. The term <b>onco-mouse</b> describes a mutant mouse in which a specific gene is targeted for modification. This procedure results from a combination of techniques involving transgenic techniques (heterologous techniques) or mouse related techniques (homologous techniques). Scientists might decide to insert a certain gene resistant to antibiotics or other drugs; in this case the gene will not be expressed and the mouse is called knock-out mouse. Conversely, when a gene is inserted and expected to express, then the mouse is called knock-in mouse. Usually what scientists insert are embryonic stem cells (ES) linked to a gene. These mice are considered novel systems, in other words, they are research tools that can be acquired and sold to research institutions (OECD 1998) ...|$|E
40|$|Integrin avb 3 plays a {{critical}} role in tumor angiogenesis and me-tastasis. Suitably radiolabeled cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) peptides can be used for noninvasive imaging of avb 3 ex-pression and targeted radionuclide therapy. In this study, we de-veloped 64 Cu-labeledmultimeric RGDpeptides, EfE[c(RGDyK) ] 2 g 2 (RGD tetramer) and E(EfE[c(RGDyK) ] 2 g 2) 2 (RGD octamer), for PET imaging of tumor integrin avb 3 expression. Methods: Both RGD tetramer and RGD octamer were synthesized with glutamate as the linker. After conjugation with 1, 4, 7, 10 -tetra-azacyclododecane-N, N 9,N$,N$ 9 -tetraacetic acid (DOTA), the peptides were labeled with 64 Cu for biodistribution and small-animal PET imaging studies (U 87 MG human glioblastoma xenograft model and c-neu <b>onco-mouse</b> model). A cell adhesion assay, a cell-binding assay, recep-tor blocking experiments, and immunohistochemistry were also performed to evaluate the avb 3 -binding affinity/specificity of th...|$|E
30|$|What I {{would like}} to emphasise here is that in physics, the {{fundamental}} concepts regarding {{the relation between the}} natural and the artificial were set up during the development of modern science in the sixteenth century. Since then, techniques have become more and more sophisticated and more and more important for natural science. But this is a continuous process which is not finished nor has it, at least in physics, entered a new qualitative level. 16 This might be different in life science. Techniques, such as genetic engineering, in vitro fertilisation and cloning, might introduce new qualities into the relationship between the natural and the artificial. For me, it seems to be plausible that hybrids such as the <b>onco-mouse</b> are extraordinary examples of how technical intervention is extended into living beings. Here, we find a mixture of the naturally grown and the artificially produced which might be significantly different from previous manipulations produced by breeding which leads to high-output cows or pigs with extra vertebra. Another field where the traditional concepts of the natural and the artificial are contested could be found when it comes to human nature and the technical interventions into the human body such as doping or to change the sex or for cosmetic surgery and other kinds of human enhancement 17 (Barkhaus and Fleig 2002 a; Habermas 2001).|$|E
40|$|Patent law has during time {{evolved from}} {{industrial}} inventions to also include intellectual inventions. Patentability has as well changed with time. For technology to be patentable {{it must be}} considered to be a technical solution to a problem, and today genetic inventions are considered to be such a technical solution. From the beginning plants and animals were not considered as inventions; however, technology progress urged modifications of existing legislation to meet development progress within technology. European as well as international harmonization have been carried out in this field to ensure uniformity. The exclusion from patentability for plant and animal varieties can be found in several sources of law; this study focuses on the exclusions in Article 4 of Directive 98 / 44 /EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, as well as in Article 53 b of the European Patent Convention. After two specific cases from the European Patent Office the scope of the exclusion from patentability for plant and animal varieties was questioned. The two cases <b>ONCO-mouse</b> and Plant Genetic Systems had different outcomes, patent was granted in one case and not in the other; and that raised confusion as to the definition of plant and animal varieties, as both cases concerned genetic modification. Although there is no clear definition of plant and animal varieties, case law provides guidance to a certain extent, the reasoning in the case law also gives guidance as to where the judiciary is heading in its interpretation. There is more legislation concerning plant varieties, and the definition of this term might {{be considered to be}} clearer. The general opinion seems to be that what is said about plant varieties should be applied mutatis mutandis to animal varieties, and vice versa, however this may be questionable in some cases. The lack of a clear definition of the terms plant and animal varieties might result in a lack of legal certainty in this field, as demonstrated by the questioning of the two contradicting cases mentioned above. Rapid developments in the field of biotechnology imply that the patentability of plants and animals will be assessed on other grounds in the future. As biotechnology is an expanding area, the acceptance of new controversial inventions may occur on a more regular basis. Time will tell if this is the case...|$|E
