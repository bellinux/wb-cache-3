5|$|Diamond is hard, {{chemically}} inert, and {{has high}} thermal conductivity {{and a low}} coefficient of thermal expansion. These properties make diamond superior to any other existing window material used for transmitting infrared and microwave radiation. Therefore, synthetic diamond is starting to replace zinc selenide as the output window of high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. Those synthetic polycrystalline diamond windows are shaped as disks of large diameters (about 10cm for gyrotrons) and small thicknesses (to reduce absorption) and can only be produced with the CVD technique. Single crystal slabs of dimensions of length up to approximately 10mm are becoming increasingly important in several areas of optics including heatspreaders inside laser cavities, diffractive optics and as the <b>optical</b> <b>gain</b> medium in Raman lasers. Recent advances in the HPHT and CVD synthesis techniques have improved the purity and crystallographic structure perfection of single-crystalline diamond enough to replace silicon as a diffraction grating and window material in high-power radiation sources, such as synchrotrons. Both the CVD and HPHT processes are also used to create designer optically transparent diamond anvils {{as a tool for}} measuring electric and magnetic properties of materials at ultra high pressures using a diamond anvil cell.|$|E

The Yule–Nielsen formula {{is by far the most}} widely used research method of <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain.</b> However, solving the Yule–Nielsen parameter n remains a difficult problem. This paper disregards solving for the Yule–Nielsen parameter n, analyzes the light scattering and osmotic effect of halftone presswork, deduces the exact expressions of blank area of presswork, and determines the reflectivity of the dot part and halftone presswork according to the point spread function and probability method. Furthermore, this paper analyzes how the <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> depends on the dot area coverage of presswork, ink layer transmittivity, and paper-based spectral reflectivity. In addition, a new algorithm model for <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> is established. By employing the Clapper–Yule Model to calculate the spectral transmittance of printing ink and comparing it with the practical measured spectral reflectivity of the halftone presswork proof, the accuracy of the model established in this paper is fully verified. ...|$|R

Accordingly, understanding these processes is a major objective as being a basic requirement for device optimization.

40|$|Ink {{spreading}} {{and lateral}} light scattering in the substrate affect {{the color of}} a halftone print. One of the most important phenomena which affects the print result is dot gain, meaning that printed dots appear larger than the dots in the digital bitmap. This is partly due to the ink spreading and ink penetration into the substrate, resulting in an enhancement of the physical dot size, referred to as the physical dot gain. Lateral propagation of light in paper causes printed dots to appear larger than their physical size, which is called <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain.</b> Characterization of total dot gain, i. e. the combination of physical and <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain,</b> is an important issue in the study of paper properties and print characteristics. Many models based on macroscopic measurements are reported in the  literature to separately characterize both physical and <b>optical</b> dot <b>gains.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} go beyond the macroscopic models, and to study the halftone prints on a microscopic scale, by using microscale images captured by a high-resolution camera. In this dissertation, three approaches based on the Murray-Davies model are proposed to obtain the total dot gain. In the first approach, by minimizing the root-mean-square difference between the calculated spectrum and the reflected spectrum measured by the  spectrophotometer, the total dot gain is approximated. The other two approaches are based on microscale images captured by a highresolution camera. These two approaches differ in their schemes on how to obtain the gray tone of the full tone ink. By the use of microscale images, it is also possible to illustrate the shape of the effective dot area for the investigated paper substrate. A novel approach based on the histogram of microscale images is also proposed to separate physical from <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain.</b> Attaining the physical dot gain characteristic makes it possible to determine the actual physical dot shape, by which the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) of the paper substrate is estimated. The proposed approach is validated by comparing the estimated MTF of eleven offset printed coated papers to the MTF obtained from the unprinted papers using measured and Monte-Carlo simulated edge response. Another potential usage based on the separation of physical from <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain,</b> is to study the characterization of different color inks. In this dissertation, the dependency of dot gain and wavelength in color print is investigated. It has been illustrated that the light scattering effect, which is the reason for <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> creation, must be less sensitive to different wavelength bands. It has also been shown that it is possible to separate two printed color inks by illuminating the halftone print with having light in the reflective wavelength band of one of the two colors. Comparison of the <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> for different dot shapes and perimeters, but with the same area, shows the dependency of <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> on the dot shape perimeter. The dependency of <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> on the dot shape perimeter verifies the fact that the amount of <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> is different for different types of halftoning...|$|R

50|$|In CSSNCs {{with only}} one exciton, {{absorption}} and stimulated emission occur equally and in CSSNCs {{with more than one}} exciton, non-radiative Auger recombination occurs, which decays <b>optical</b> <b>gain,</b> an important quality in lasers.

This has the advantage that lasing threshold could be lowered under continuous wave excitation, enhancing the potential of CSSNCs as <b>optical</b> <b>gain</b> media. Type II CSSNCs separate the electrons and holes of the exciton pair, which leads to a strong electric field and thus, reducing absorption losses.|$|E

40|$|A {{common problem}} in the {{printing}} industry today is <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain.</b> <b>Optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> is popularly thought {{to be caused by}} light scatter in paper 1.

The Yule-Nielsen effect is described in the following equation: R(1 /n) = Fo Ri (1 /n) + (1 - Fo) Rp (1 /n) (1) This research involves studying the n factor of this equation. This factor is an index of the amount of <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> and is highly correlated with the scattering coefficient of the paper. The n factor is already known to be wavelength dependent. The purpose of my research is to find out what causes n to be wavelength dependent.

40|$|One of the {{printing}} troubles on print quality is non-uniformity of printing density called print mottle. The causes of print mottle are various. As far as paper, {{it has been}} thought that surface roughness of paper, absorption of ink and fountain solution cause non-uniformity of ink transfer. As the results of evaluation on commercial coated paper, print mottle did not occur in solid area and non-uniformity of ink transfer also did not arise. But print mottle occurred in halftone dots, and it was thought another factor except ink transfer affect print mottle in halftone dots. This was confirmed because print mottle was also observed in halftone dots which shape and density were quite even on the paper (chemical proof). The purpose {{of this research is}} to clarify the cause affecting print mottle in halftone dots. It is known that apparent dot <b>gain</b> (<b>optical</b> dot <b>gain)</b> arises in halftone dots due to lateral light scattering of printing medium, and <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> affects printing density. We set up a hypothesis that non-uniformity of <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> causes print mottle in halftone dots. Therefore, we investigated the non-uniformity of lateral light scattering of paper that was thought to bring about the non-uniformity of <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain.</b> In the past researches to measure the lateral light scattering, ruled-lines were formed on the paper, the modulation arisen in amplitude of microdensity profile of ruled-lines due to light scattering, and light intensity distribution against distance was calculated from the modulation. We measured the modulation using printed ruled-lines on paper. Non-uniformity of light scattering was found, and it was though that this was caused by coating amount variation and so on from microscopic observation. From these results, non-uniformity of <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain</b> was thought {{to be one of the}} important factors affecting print mottle in halftone dots...|$|R

40|$|The printed dots appear {{bigger than}} the dots in the {{original}} digital bitmap. This is {{partly because of the}} spreading and penetrating of the ink on and in the paper, called physical dot gain, and partly because of the diffusion of the light in paper, which is referred to as <b>optical</b> dot <b>gain.</b> Dot gain is often approximated by measurements obtained by densitometer or spectrophotometer. In this study we use a very high-resolution scanner with a resolution of 2 μm/pixel and with a field of view of 2. 7 × 2 mm, which makes it possible to clearly see the small halftone dots and their surroundings. In this camera it is also possible to illuminate the paper surface both from above and below, which means that the camera can capture both the reflected and transmitted lights.
