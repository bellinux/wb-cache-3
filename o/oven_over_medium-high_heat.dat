40|$|Cassava starch nanocrystals (CSN) has {{not been}} {{reported}} in open literature, although other starches such as rice, corn, potato and bean were widely used as the main material. Thus, {{the objective of this}} research was to investigate the possibility of synthesizing high yield of CSN at different concentration of sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4). The physical and chemical properties of synthesize CSN was also investigated. Synthesized CSN was prepared by hydrolysing native cassava starch (NCS) with several concentration of H 2 SO 4 (2. 8 M, 3. 0 M, 3. 2 M and 3. 4 M). The acid hydrolysis process took five days with continuous stirring speed of 300 to 400 rpm, with constant temperature of 37 °C. The hydrolysed solution of CSN underwent centrifuging process with distilled water until neutral to make sure that no acid residues remain in the CSN solution. The CSN precipitate was dried in an <b>oven</b> <b>over</b> night at 60 °C. The highest yield (1. 1 %) produced was from 3. 4 M CSN. Morphology test by Transmission Electron Microscopy indicated that the samples have been destructed and degraded to be nanocrystals with a size range of 5 - 20 nm.

40|$|Abstract. High {{accelerating}} gradients {{generated by}} a high density electron beam moving through plasma {{has been used to}} double the energy of the SLAC electron beam [1]. During that experiment, the electron current density was high enough to generate its own plasma without significant head erosion. In the newly commissioned FACET facility at SLAC, the peak current will be lower and without pre-ionization, head erosion will be a significant challenge for the planned experiments. In this work we report on our design of a meter scale plasma source for these experiments to effectively avoid the problem of head erosion. The plasma source is based on a homogeneous metal vapor gas column that is generated in a heat pipe oven [2]. A lithium <b>oven</b> <b>over</b> 30 cm long at densities over 1017 cm- 3 has been constructed and tested at UCLA. The plasma is then generated by coupling a 10 TW short pulse Ti:Sapphire laser into the gas column using an axicon lens setup. The Bessel profile of the axicon setup creates a region of high intensity that can stretch over the full length of the gas column with approximately constant diameter. In this region of high intensity, the alkali metal vapor is ionized through multi-photon ionization process. In this manner, a fully ionized meter scale plasma of uniform density can be formed. Methods for controlling the plasma diameter and length will also be discussed...|$|R
