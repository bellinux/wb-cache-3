Traditionally, this operation mode is implemented by periodically shifting inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>sections</b> so as to jump a single reactor unit in the flow direction. Here, a network of four catalytic reactors carrying on the methanol synthesis process is considered {{and the effect of}} varying the number (n s) of reactor units jumped by inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>sections</b> on network stability and performance is investigated. Increasing n s, a greater variety of periodic regimes giving rise to trains of temperature waves characterized by spatial periodicity are detected as the switching velocity varies. These regimes well reproduce the inter-stage cooling effect of multistage fixed bed reactors and, hence, guarantee in general large conversion values. Moreover, an intriguing coexistence between T-periodic and multi-periodic temperature wave trains is revealed, T being the period needed for the system to recover its initial configuration. A T-periodic symmetric wave train characterized by k waves always coexists with a number of k- 1 stable symmetric kT-periodic regimes, except when symmetry breaking is encountered. The k- 1 coexisting regimes correspond to wave trains with a number of waves ranging between 1 and k- 1. Bifurcational analysis is performed to characterize the stability range of periodic regimes and to systematically analyze multiplicities and bifurcations as the switching velocity is varied and at different n s. © 2011 Elsevier B.

50|$|An {{oil water}} {{separation}} hydrocyclone is a device designed to separate oil from water {{by the use}} of a strong vortex. These separators are passive (no moving parts) and resemble long tapered pipes. They typically contain an inlet section, long tapered section and a long <b>outlet</b> <b>section.</b> In operation the strong vortex is created when the oily water is injected tangentially into the inlet end of the separator. This creates a centrifugal force, that accelerates as it moves down the tapered cone. The centripetal and centrifugal forces separate the heavier water component to the outside of the vortex while the lighter oil droplets are forced to the centre. The separated oils are removed through an orifice at the inlet end of the cone and treated water is discharged through the opposite end. The centrifugal forces generated inside the vortex of the better de-oiling hydrocyclone separators are of the order of 1,000 times the force of gravity. This is why smaller emulsified oil droplets as low as 15 microns can be removed.|$|E

There are three grinding roller wheel assemblies in the mill grinding section, which are mounted on a loading frame via pivot point.The fixed-axis roller in each roller wheel assembly rotates on a segmentally-lined grinding table that is supported and driven by a planetary gear reducer direct-coupled to a motor. The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.|$|E

Due to the extremely convoluted character of the flow pattern, it is difficult to suggest the design rules and operational procedures that will ensure this uniformity without resorting to detailed experimental and numerical studies. Using a room temperature physical model, we have simulated the creeping flow of glass in a forehearth. The 3 D temperature field and velocity field of the model fluid (silicon oil) were mapped.

An intensity of the convective heat transfer of LRE combustion with the supersonic part of a nozzle shell in the first approximation is inversely proportional to the cross sectional area of gas dynamic path and reduces substantially as approaching to the <b>outlet</b> <b>section</b> of the nozzle. Therefore, in case of large nozzle expansion ratio the use of modern heat-resistant materials allows us to implement its <b>outlet</b> <b>section</b> as a thin-walled uncooled adjutage. This design solution results in reducing total weight of nozzle and decreasing overall preheat of LRE propellant used to cool the engine chamber. For a given diameter of the nozzle <b>outlet</b> <b>section</b> and pressure of combustion gases in this section, to make informed choices of permissible length for uncooled adjutage, it is necessary to have a reliable estimate of its thermal state on the steady-state LRE operation. A mathematical model of the nozzle shell heat transfer with the gas stream taking into account the heat energy transfer by convection and radiation, as well as by heat conduction along the generatrix of the shell enables this estimate. Quantitative analysis of given mathematical model showed that, because of the comparatively low pressure and temperature level of combustion gases, it is acceptable to ignore their own radiation and absorption capacity as compared with the convective heat intensity and the surface nozzle radiation. Thus, re-radiation of its internal surface portions is a factor of importance. Its taking into consideration is the main feature of the developed mathematical model. </p...|$|E

In particular, the tests concern the transition from nominal flow to natural circulation regime, typical of decay heat removal (DHR) regime. To this purpose the CIRCE pool facility has been updated to host a suitable test section in order to reproduce the thermal-hydraulic behaviour of a HLM pool-type reactor. The test section basically consists of an electrical bundle (FPS) made up of 37 pins arranged in a hexagonal wrapped lattice with a pitch diameter ratio of 1. 8. Along the FPS active length, three sections were instrumented to monitor the heat transfer coefficient along the bundle as well as the cladding temperatures at different ranks of the sub-channels. This paper reports the experimental data as well as a preliminary analysis and discussion of the results, focusing on the most relevant tests of the campaign, namely Test I (48 h) and Test II (97 h).

40|$|Introduction: Procedures {{and methods}} for more {{accurate}} measurement and improved management of water are continually being {{sought to make}} better use of our water resources. Of all the devices and structures developed for measuring water, measuring flumes {{are among the most}} widely accepted and used. The most common measuring flume is the Parshall flume developed by Ralph Parshall at Colorado State University. Common to most flumes is the basic geometry consisting of a converging inlet section, a throat, and a diverging <b>outlet</b> <b>section.</b> Occasionally, the diverging <b>outlet</b> <b>section</b> is removed under free flow conditions, and the water is allowed to jet directly from the throat section into the downstream channel. This is not always permissible, however, in unlined channels because of possible erosion problems. In flat gradient channels, a flume may be installed to operate under conditions of submerged flow rather then free flow in order to (1) reduce energy losses, and (2) allow placement of the flume on the channel bed to minimize the increase in water surface elevation upstream from the flume. The purpose of the research effort reported herein was to develop a flume which would operate satisfactorily under both free flow and submerged flow conditions...|$|E
