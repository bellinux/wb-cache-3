5|$|The Southern Railway {{operating}} department undertook trials to improve fleet efficiency. When built, Eastbourne-based No. A629 was fitted with an experimental pulverised fuel burner of German design; {{the experiment was}} terminated when a minor explosion {{was caused by the}} powdered coal coming into contact with sparks thrown from the blastpipe. The experiment also proved that pulverised coal was a false economy, as much of the fine dust was sucked through the chimney without combustion taking place. The locomotive was returned to normal coal burning in 1935. In 1947 the class became a test-bed for a government-backed scheme regarding fuelling arrangements in anticipation of a coal shortage. Two of the class, Nos. 1625 and 1797, were converted to oil burning, with more set to follow suit; but the project was abandoned and the two <b>oil</b> <b>burners</b> were reverted to coal-firing before this could take place.|$|E
25|$|Trainbuilder has {{released}} a ready-to-run brass {{model of the}} series, featuring numbers J500, 502, 508, 510, 518, 520, 523 as coal burners, and 531, 535, 538, 541, 544, 552, 555 and 558 as <b>oil</b> <b>burners.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trainbuilder has {{released}} {{a series of}} locomotives, including engines N420, 422-425, 450 and 468 and SAR 750, 752 and 755 as coal burners, and <b>oil</b> <b>burners</b> 426-432 (with 430 in Jubilee green) and 453 and 498.|$|E
2500|$|... 2017 saw the {{announcement}} by Trainbuilder that {{a range of}} brass, ready-to-run engines would be released in the near future. Planned models include R700, 704, 707 (PBC <b>burner),</b> 710, 719 (<b>oil</b> <b>burner),</b> 748 (<b>oil</b> <b>burner),</b> 750 and 769.|$|R
25|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> is {{a heating}} device which burns fuel oil. The oil is {{directed}} under pressure through a nozzle {{to produce a}} fine spray, which is usually ignited by an electric spark with the air being forced through by an electric fan. In 1880, Amanda Jones invented the <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> in the <b>oil</b> fields of northern Pennsylvania where Jones completed her trial and error efforts of heating furnaces.|$|R

25|$|With {{fluctuating}} {{oil prices}} and an unreliable supply of coal in the early 1950s, the VR appeared to take something of a bet either way, ordering thirty of the class as coal burners and thirty as <b>oil</b> <b>burners.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following the war ten of {{the class}} were {{converted}} to <b>oil</b> <b>burners</b> in 1947 and again in 1949 due to industrial trouble on the Collie coalfields, where the WAGR obtained its coal fuel. These conversions were temporary, lasting {{only as long as}} the lack of fuel prevailed. In later years the boilers were modified to be interchangeable with the Pm and Pmr class locomotives, which were introduced in 1949.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} time, the railway's steam {{locomotives}} have burnt coal. The {{requirement for}} the locomotives to have a hot fire burning efficiently for a solid hour has led to problems when best Welsh steam coal has not been readily available. During 1978 Nos.2 and 8 ran with <b>oil</b> <b>burners.</b> To hold the fuel oil, a tank was fitted {{to the roof of}} each locomotive. The tanks were thin and followed the profile of the roof. In 2000, No.2 was again fitted with an oil burner in an attempt avoid the increasing problems of obtaining suitable coal.|$|E

50|$|Original <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> {{transformers}} were {{copper wire}} conductors wrapped around an iron core. A standard type of transformer to this day. In the mid 90s electronic igniters replaced the copper and iron transformer,solving many {{problems related to}} the old style transformer. This new technology in igniters would soon replace all old style transformers throughout the <b>oil</b> <b>burner</b> industry. The new igniters would run cooler so the output voltage could be increased from 10,000 to 20,000 VAC.|$|R
50|$|This is {{mechanically}} {{very different}} from a diesel engine that {{is a form of}} internal combustion engine, which is sometimes colloquially referred to as an <b>oil</b> <b>burner.</b>|$|R
25|$|Vegetable oil {{can be used}} as an {{alternative}} fuel in diesel engines and in heating <b>oil</b> <b>burners.</b> When vegetable oil is used directly as a fuel, in either modified or unmodified equipment, it is referred to as straight vegetable oil (SVO) or pure plant oil (PPO). Conventional diesel engines can be modified to help ensure that the viscosity of the vegetable oil is low enough to allow proper atomization of the fuel. This prevents incomplete combustion, which would damage the engine by causing a build-up of carbon. Straight vegetable oil can also be blended with conventional diesel or processed into biodiesel or bioliquids for use under a wider range of conditions.|$|E
500|$|Other major {{proposals}} {{included the}} ones from Blohm&Voss and Vickers. While both included the same armament as Germania, the former design had a smaller displacement—26,055longtons (26,473metrictons) versus 28,033longtons (28,483t)—and devoted a {{greater amount of}} weight to protection: 8,974longtons (9,118t, 34.8% of the displacement), versus 8,820longtons (8,960t, 31.77%). Blohm&Voss' design included a belt starting at 150mm in the bow, increasing to 250mm, then tapering to [...] in the stern. It would have been powered by six double-ended coal boilers with <b>oil</b> <b>burners</b> alongside. These boilers would have generated 38,000shafthorsepower (shp) to drive four propellers, giving the ships a maximum speed of [...] Only one rudder would have been fitted. The Vickers design had a shorter belt of 250mm amidships, and would have used 15 boilers with <b>oil</b> <b>burners</b> to provide 34,000shp and the same 22knots.|$|E

2500|$|Built {{specially}} for {{the line}} in 1895 and 1896, Nos.1 to 5 were manufactured by the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works of Winterthur. The first locomotives cost £1,525 (equivalent to £ in [...] ). Nos.1 to 3 were delivered before the line was open and used on construction work. On at least two occasions, trials have been made on <b>oil</b> <b>burners</b> on Nos.1 to 5, the latest being on No.2 in the late 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|On January 5, 1920, it was {{reported}} that articles of incorporation would be filed that day for the Inland Empire Boat & Truck Company. [...] The new company would take over the O.C.T.C.’s steamers, including Grahamona, and would commence operations on March 1. [...] The business plan would be to operate truck lines from the principal landings on the Columbia and the Willamette Rivers, with Grahamona serving on the Columbia. [...] The steamers were to have been converted to <b>oil</b> <b>burners.</b> [...] Capt. A.B. Graham, formerly of O.C.T.C., would be manager of the new company, of which he was also an incorporator. [...] Capt. Clyde Raabe would be superintendent of the steamboat service.|$|E
2500|$|Later, Prescision Scale Models {{produced}} {{a range of}} the engines in both in-service and preserved formats and liveries, including features like the extended coal bunker on preserved engines, name plates and crests as appropriate and other details. 12 units each of coal burners 700, 711, 724, 753 and 769 were released, along with 20 units each of 719 and 748 as <b>oil</b> <b>burners.</b> 30 units of R704 in its Glasgow Exhibition scheme were included, along with [...] "As Preserved" [...] R707 (25 units), R761 (20 units), R766 (25 units, green, with cab window wipers and radio antennae), and five models of R770 in V/Line grey with orange; a wholly fictional locomotive and livery.
