40|$|Purpose- The issue <b>of</b> <b>export</b> {{success and}} the ability to sustain oneself in {{international}} horticultural markets have become more critical in the recent global and economic downturn because of its significance to the economy and to actors in the horticultural export chain. The extent of success is even much critical for enterprises. Therefore this study establishes the factors which influence the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success which measures the extent <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Design- Primary data were collected from 52 managers and representatives <b>of</b> horticultural <b>exporting</b> firms through a semi-structured questionnaire. The tobit model was used to estimate the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success by horticultural enterprises in Ghana. Findings- The result indicates that, manager’s educational level, managers past experience, manager trained in export management, manager’s entrepreneurial orientation, presence <b>of</b> <b>export</b> department, product diversification and government support directly influences the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Export barriers and constraints in accessing working capital negatively influences intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Practical implications- Personnel or personal development in terms <b>of</b> training in <b>export</b> management and build up of experience is important in the quest to improve the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. Organizational reforms such as institution <b>of</b> <b>export</b> department and diversifying horticultural export products improves the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success. To improve the intensity of success, external factors such as working capital inaccessibility and trade barriers should be addressed by various stake holders. In all government and institutional interventions has been proved to be of the essence. Originality/value- Although various determinants <b>of</b> <b>export</b> performance or success have been established by researchers the factors that influence the intensity <b>of</b> <b>export</b> success is not known. This study therefore bridges this gab. Tobit, export success, horticulture, enterprises, Ghana, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
5|$|Switzerland's most {{important}} economic sector is manufacturing. Manufacturing consists largely {{of the production}} of specialist chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods, scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The largest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods), machines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%). Exported services amount to a third <b>of</b> <b>exports.</b> The service sector – especially banking and insurance, tourism, and international organisations – is another important industry for Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{increase}} in the domestic manufacturing industry {{there was still a}} significant shortfall in many items. In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E

Until 1850, rubber production was insignificant, but between 1881 and 1890, it had reached third place among Brazilian exports. This was about 81tons between 1827 and 1830 reaching 1,632tons in 1852.

Results from the qualitative study based on the data from a mail survey with 354 responses reveal that the development <b>of</b> <b>export</b> memory quality is positively related with quality <b>of</b> <b>export</b> information acquisition, the quality <b>of</b> <b>export</b> information interpretation, export coordination, and integration of the information into the organizational system.

5|$|The {{profitability}} {{of the agricultural}} sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some diversification as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom.

5|$|Economic {{conditions}} have fluctuated {{with the changing}} price of oil since 1985, for example during and following the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990–91. With its highly developed communication and transport facilities, Bahrain {{is home to a}} number of multinational firms and construction proceeds on several major industrial projects. A large share <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> consist of petroleum products made from imported crude oil, which accounted for 51% of the country's imports in 2007. Bahrain depends heavily on food imports to feed its growing population; it relies heavily on meat imports from Australia and also imports 75% of its total fruit consumption needs. Since only 2.9% of the country's land is arable, agriculture contributes to 0.5% of Bahrain's GDP. In 2004, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, which will reduce certain trade barriers between the two nations. Due to the combination of the global financial crisis and the recent unrest, the growth rate decreased to 2.2% which is the lowest growth rate since 1994.|$|E

In 1830 some 113 manufacturers were based in Calais and the St Pierre suburbs, the majority of which were English. There are still two major lace factories in Calais with around 700 looms and 3000 employees. The town exports in the early 20th century were lace, chemicals, paper, wines, especially champagne, spirits, hay, straw, wool, potatoes, woven goods, fruit, glass-ware, lace and metal-ware.

5|$|From the 14th to the 16thcentury, Finnish {{horses were}} {{exported}} to Russian and Germany in such quantities that eventually {{restrictions on the}} number <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> were set. The Finnish horses exported to Russia in early 19thcentury influenced {{the development of the}} Vyatka horse. In the 19thcentury and early 20thcentury, horses of Finnish origin were used in creating many Baltic and Russian agricultural draught breeds, such as the Tori Horse and the Lithuanian Draught. In most cases, these breeds were developed by crossbreeding Finnish horses on small local horses, thus increasing size. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Finnhorse was also used in the breeding of the Estonian horse. The heavy Mezen horse was bred with both the Finnhorse and the Estonian Horse, until its stud book was closed in the 1950s. Traces of Finnhorse influence is found in other Soviet and Russian work horse breeds, in the mid-20thcentury, Finland exported 15,000 horses to Soviet Russia as part of its war indemnity. In the 1960s and 1970s, pony-sized Finnhorses were also used to improve quality and broaden the gene pool of the Norwegian Nordlandshest, which had become highly inbred by the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Rathores, {{traditional}} {{rulers of}} the Marwar region of western India, {{were the first to}} breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light draught and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a breed society was formed for the Marwari in India. The exportation of Marwaris was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number <b>of</b> <b>exports</b> were allowed.
