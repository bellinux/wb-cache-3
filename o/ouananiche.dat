50|$|The river {{has been}} dammed for {{hydroelectric}} power. Now, {{it is also}} a tourist river with rafting, canoeing, and fishing opportunities. It is known for its reserve of fresh-water salmon. In the region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, this fish is known as <b>Ouananiche.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other names used to {{reference}} Atlantic salmon are: bay salmon, black salmon, caplin-scull salmon, Sebago salmon, silver salmon, fiddler, {{or outside}} salmon. At {{different points in}} their maturation and life cycle, they are known as parr, smolt, grilse, grilt, kelt, slink, and spring salmon. Atlantic salmon that do not journey to sea are known as landlocked salmon or <b>ouananiche.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Atlantic salmon do {{not require}} saltwater. Numerous {{examples}} of fully freshwater (i.e., [...] "landlocked") populations of the species exist throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including a now extinct population in Lake Ontario, which have been shown in recent studies to have spent their entire life cycle in watershed of the lake. In North America, the landlocked strains are frequently known as <b>ouananiche.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ashuapmushuan River and {{its tributaries}} provide {{spawning}} grounds and habitats for landlocked salmon (Salmo salar <b>ouananiche).</b> Newly hatched salmon remain in the river for 2 to 4 years before migrating to Lake Saint-Jean where it remains {{for most of its}} adult life. Then, at age 4 to 8, it will return to the river to spawn. While the Ashuapmushuan River has significantly contributed to salmon production for the lake, the salmon population has seen a sharp decline in the 1990s. Despite conservation measures, its status remains of concern.|$|E

40|$|A Newfoundland Light 2 ̆ 6 Power Co. Limited {{project to}} build a 1, 000 kW {{hydroelectric}} plant in 1981 required measures to replace lost <b>Ouananiche</b> spawning grounds. After studying various alternatives, it was agreed a spawning canal would be provided in the tailrace to replace the lost spawning ground while ensuring minimal effect on plant operations...|$|E
40|$|T HE {{life cycle}} of the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) is {{typically}} divided between freshwater and marine environments. Spawning occurs in rivers and the juvenile salmon, known as parr, remain in this habitat for from 1 to 7 years before changing into smolts and migrating to the sea. Little is known of the marine life of the salmon except that it usually occupies a period of from 1 to 3 years, during which growth is extremely rapid. Following this phase the fish return to the rivers of their origin, attain full sexual maturity, and spawn, thus completing the cycle. All Atlantic salmon {{do not conform to}} this pattern, however, and a number of forms, known as <b>Ouananiche,</b> Sebago salmon, landlocked salmon, etc., are recognized, which complete their life cycle entirely ’ in fresh water. These freshwater races are exceedingly widespread in eastern North Amer-ica. Jordan and Evermann (1896) recognized two types and, although they were indistinguishable morphologically, listed them as subspecies of the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar sebago and Salmo salar <b>ouananiche.</b> Wilder (1947) was unable to find any morphological criterion for separating the Sebago salmon from the Atlantic salmon. The most obvious distinction between the Atlantic salmon and its freshwater races is that the latter do not migrate to sea at any stage in the life cycle, although in many in-stances they are not prevented from doing so by other than physiological barriers. Sebago salmon inhabit lakes that are distributed along the fringe of the presumed maximum extent of the Pleistocene glaciation in eastern North America. A population, now extinct, inhabited Lake Ontario until the be-ginning of this century (Huntsman, 1944). Other populations are found i...|$|E
40|$|A {{potential}} velocity barrier {{which could}} preclude {{the migration of}} <b>ouananiche</b> and brook trout to their spawning habitat in the upper West Salmon River was identified downstream of the Upper Salmon Hydroelectric Development. An HEC- 2 backwater computer model {{was used to assess}} current velocities downstream of the project and to identify areas where fish passage might be prevented. Predicted velocities in three areas appeared to be only marginally greater than that thought to be critical, indicating that fish passage might not be prevented. As a consequence, a post-development monitoring study was undertaken to determine the success of fish passage and the need for mitigation. The monitoring study found that fish passage was unimpeded under the post-development flow regime and that no mitigation was required. The interdisciplinary approach used to evaluate this velocity-related fish passage problem is discussed, and the interaction between regulator and proponent is examined in relation to the environmental impact assessment process...|$|E
40|$|Return {{times of}} 7 - 12 {{years have been}} {{recently}} hypothesized for salmonids collected from recently (post- 1980) created reservoirs in NF. These return times have been primarily based on reservoir age though {{factors such as the}} flooded riparian zone and acidity have all been postulated to affect return times. It was the goal of this study to improve upon predictions of return times for Newfoundland by expanding the current database of mercury in fish and by incorporating several of these factors. [...] An investigation into sediment mercury levels in 34 non-impounded headwater lakes across NF indicated that acidity had no effect on the amount of mercury accumulated at the lake bottom. Watershed area to lake area ratio (WA:LA) was found to be significant in explaining the variation observed in sediment mercury levels. This suggested that large watershed can deposit significant amounts of mercury sorbed to organic material to small lakes that then act as sinks for this metal. This relationship was further supported by the positive correlation between lake colour and WA:LA. [...] The slope of the relationship between mercury concentration and fork length for salmonids was found to change significantly over time. Reservoir age and conductivity were found to be significant in predicting the slope of the relationship between fish mercury levels and fork length for <b>ouananiche</b> (Salmo salar) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis). Only the per cent Area Flooded was significant in predicting the slope for arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). Slope variability between the three control ponds and between pre-impoundment and post-impoundment mercury data precluded determination of return times for either species. [...] An investigation into mercury time series data for a number of impounded and non-impounded sites indicated that high slopes may be characteristic of non-impounded sites and of old reservoirs. Results suggested that impoundment lowers the slope during the first 4 to 5 years following inundation by increasing mercury levels in smaller fish more so than in larger fish. Slopes appeared to return to pre-impoundment levels approximately 5 to 6 years after inundation. Weighted regression indicated that mercury increase in a selected size interval following impoundment was 8 to 73 times faster than the decline after mercury levels peaked. ...|$|E
