25|$|Grain color (red, {{white or}} amber). Many wheat {{varieties}} are reddish-brown due to phenolic compounds {{present in the}} bran layer which are transformed to pigments by browning enzymes.

The yellowish color <b>of</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> and semolina flour made from it {{is due to a}} carotenoid pigment called lutein, which can be oxidized to a colorless form by enzymes present in the grain.|$|E
500|$|On January 18, 1909, Brenner {{submitted}} {{models to}} the Mint with a Lincoln profile on the obverse, and a reverse design {{very similar to}} that on the then-current French silver coins, showing a tree branch. [...] He also proposed designs for a Lincoln half dollar, with the late president to appear on one side, and a standing Liberty design—almost identical to the obverse of the same French coins. [...] Leach replied on [...] that no change to the half dollar could be made without congressional approval. [...] By , Leach had discovered the origin of the branch design—although numismatic historian Don Taxay notes that it is odd Leach had not discovered the source of the standing Liberty design, given that they were {{on opposite sides of the}} same French coins. [...] Leach did not confront the sculptor with the artistic borrowing, but instead simply ruled out the submitted designs as unsuitable for the reverse of the cent. [...] He urged the sculptor to prepare a simple design, bearing the denomination, the country's name, and the motto [...] "E pluribus unum". [...] Brenner worked quickly, and on , delivered models for both obverse and reverse similar to the eventual coin, though with a somewhat larger bust of Lincoln, and the motto [...] "In God We Trust" [...] omitted. [...] As a design element on the reverse, Brenner used two ears <b>of</b> <b>durum</b> <b>wheat.</b> [...] The designs were shown to President Roosevelt, who approved them although Roosevelt required [...] "UNITED", which Brenner had spelled [...] "VNITED", to be spelled in the conventional way. After Leach examined the models, he objected to the fact that Brenner had put his full surname on the obverse. [...] Brenner wrote in return, [...] "I shall take it out and put it in small letters on the reverse." ...|$|E

The results indicated that the gluten index had little dependence on the environment, being determined to the greatest extent by the genotype. Compared with varieties having weak gluten, those with a strong gluten matrix responded less sensitively to changes in environmental conditions. Among the meteorological factors, high temperature {{at the end of the}} grain-filling period caused the greatest reduction in the mean gluten index of three varieties (R 2 = 0. 462), while the fertiliser was found to be a significant factor affecting the gluten strength <b>of</b> winter <b>durum</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties.
