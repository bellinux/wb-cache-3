5|$|The Hungarian bow is {{a fairly}} long, {{approximately}} symmetrical, composite reflex bow with bone stiffeners. Its shape is known from two graves in which {{the position of the}} bone plates could be reconstructed.

5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically significant. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

5|$|Avialans diversified into a {{wide variety}} of forms during the Cretaceous Period. Many groups {{retained}} primitive characteristics, such as clawed wings and teeth, though the latter were lost independently in a number of avialan groups, including modern birds (Aves). While the earliest forms, such as Archaeopteryx and Jeholornis, retained the long bony tails <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors,</b> the tails of more advanced avialans were shortened {{with the advent of the}} pygostyle bone in the group Pygostylia. In the late Cretaceous, around 95 million years ago, the ancestor of all modern birds also evolved a better sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Lorian, after {{considering}} {{his knowledge of}} events, believes that the wormhole must be avoided altogether. Archer and Lorian then disagree over whether to implement an engine modification to Enterprise, since there is a 22% chance it may cause {{the destruction of the}} ship. Archer then meets with old T'Pol on board old Enterprise, and considers a plan where his ship could pass through it safely, due to alternate modifications suggested by her. A frustrated Lorian then reveals a secret plan: to steal the newer plasma injectors from Enterprise to allow them to confront the Xindi in the place <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maya {{households}} interred {{their dead}} underneath the floors of their houses, with offerings {{appropriate to the}} social status of the family. There the dead could act as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasized, often with a household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors.</b>|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, {{those used in}} harness, and those destined for meat production. Horses may be {{automatically}} registered if at least 87.5 percent <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> (seven out of eight) were registered Norman Cobs. Purebred stallions may not be bred more than 70 times per year. Foals produced through artificial insemination and embryo transfer may be registered, but cloned horses may not. In general, breeders look to produce horses with good gaits and an aptitude for driving, while keeping the conformation that makes the Norman Cob one of nine French draft breeds.|$|E
5|$|When endothermy first {{appeared}} in the evolution of mammals is uncertain, though it is generally agreed to have first evolved in non-mammalian therapsids. Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals, but there is evidence that some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors,</b> perhaps including ancestors of the therians, may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians. Likewise, some modern therians like afrotheres and xenarthrans have secondarily developed lower body temperatures.|$|E
5|$|While {{the civil}} rights {{movement}} fought against racial segregation, MalcolmX advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. MalcolmX suggested the United States government owed reparations to black people for the unpaid labor <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors.</b> He also rejected {{the civil rights}} movement's strategy of nonviolence, advocating instead that black people should defend themselves.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all horses are counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in the counts each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. The life span of horses on Cumberland Island is approximately half that <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors,</b> due to infestations of parasites and disease. They also suffer from digestive issues linked to the ingestion of {{a great amount of}} sand, which causes intestinal blockages and abdominal distension.|$|E
5|$|In 1913, the Jockey Club and {{the owners}} of the General Stud Book passed a {{regulation}} named by the foreign press after the Jockey Club's senior steward, Lord Jersey, prohibiting the registration of horses in the book unless all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> had been registered. Despite protests from American breeders, the regulation remained in force until 1949. Among the factors influencing its relaxation were the racing success of ineligible horses in Europe and the damage caused to British and Irish breeders by the unavailability of French Thoroughbreds during and after the Second World War. In addition, by 1949 the possibly impure ancestors of the American bloodlines had receded far back in most horses' ancestry.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published {{a new study}} in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something theNew Scientisthas coinednominative determinism. Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points {{when it comes to}} names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> who were smiths. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

5|$|The Balts or Baltic peoples, {{or their}} Indo-European protoplasts, have settled (at {{different}} times different parts of) {{the territory of}} today's northeast Poland {{as well as the}} lands located further north and east, generally east of the lower Vistula River, the Baltic seashore north of there including and past the Sambian peninsula, and the inland area east of the above regions (some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> came from as far east as the upper Oka River), from the early Iron Age. The analysis of the Baltic historic range has been aided by the studies of their characteristic toponyms and hydronyms, in addition to the examination of the archeological record and the few ancient written sources.|$|E
5|$|While the {{northern}} origin {{theory has been}} dismissed by many historians, the epigraphist K. V. Ramesh has suggested that an earlier southern migration is a distinct possibility which needs examination. According to him, the complete absence of any inscriptional reference of their family connections to Ayodhya, and their subsequent Kannadiga identity {{may have been due}} to their earlier migration into present day Karnataka region where they achieved success as chieftains and kings. Hence, the place of origin <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>ancestors</b> may have been of no significance to the kings of the empire who may have considered themselves natives of the Kannada speaking region. The writing of 12th century Kashmiri poet Bilhana suggests the Chalukya family belonged to the Shudra caste while other sources claim they were Kshatriyas.|$|E

She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play, especially the ardin harp, and was taught traditional Mauritanian music by her father, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music. As a result, she grew up listening to classical western works such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi and Wagner, as well as the music of traditional Berber, Egyptian, Lebanese and Senegalese artists. She often accompanied her parents who sang traditional griots.|$|E
