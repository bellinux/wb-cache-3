For if the Sun shine into a {{very dark}} Chamber through an <b>oblong</b> <b>hole</b> F, [in Fig. 1.] whose breadth is the sixth or eighth part of an Inch, or {{something}} less; and his beam FH do afterwards pass first through a very large Prism ABC, distant about 20 Feet from the hole, and parallel to it, and then (with its white part) through an <b>oblong</b> <b>hole</b> H, whose breadth is about the fortieth or sixtieth part of an Inch, and which is made in a black opake Body GI, and placed at the distance {{of two or three}} Feet from the Prism, in a parallel Situation both to the Prism and to the former hole, and if this white Light thus transmitted through the hole H, fall afterwards upon a white Paper pt, placed after that hole H, at the distance of three or four Feet from it, and there paint the usual Colours of the Prism, suppose red at t, yellow at s, green at r, blue at q, and violet at p; you may with an Iron Wire, or any such like slender opake Body, whose breadth is about the tenth part of an Inch, by intercepting the Rays at k, l, m, n or o, take away any one of the Colours at t, s, r, q or p, whilst the other Colours remain upon the Paper as before; or with an Obstacle something bigger you may take away any two, or three, or four Colours together, the rest remaining: So that any one of the Colours as well as violet may become outmost in the Confine of the Shadow towards p, and any one of them as well as red may become outmost in the Confine of the Shadow towards t, and any one of them may also border upon the Shadow made within the Colours by the Obstacle R intercepting some intermediate part of the Light; and, lastly, any one of them by being left alone, may border upon the Shadow on either hand. All the Colours have themselves indifferently to any Confines of Shadow, and therefore the differences of these Colours from one another, do not arise from the different Confines of Shadow, whereby Light is variously modified, as has hitherto been the Opinion of Philosophers. In trying these things 'tis to be observed, that by how much the holes F and H are narrower, and the Intervals between them and the Prism greater, and the Chamber darker, by so much the better doth the Experiment succeed; provided the Light be not so far diminished, but that the Colours at pt be sufficiently visible. To procure a Prism of solid Glass large enough for this Experiment will be difficult, and therefore a prismatick Vessel must be made of polish'd Glass Plates cemented together, and filled with salt Water or clear Oil.|$|E
6000|$|We {{got to the}} {{bulkhead}} at last. Those were stout planks. She was a ship, well finished in every detail--the Narcissus was. They were the stoutest planks ever put into a ship's bulkhead--we thought--and then we perceived that, in our hurry, we had sent all the tools overboard. Absurd little Belfast wanted to break it down with his own weight, and with both feet leaped straight up like a springbok, cursing the Clyde shipwrights for not scamping their work. Incidentally he reviled all North Britain, {{the rest of the}} earth, the sea--and all his companions. He swore, as he alighted heavily on his heels, that he would never, never any more associate with any fool that [...] "hadn't savee enough to know his knee from his elbow." [...] He managed by his thumping to scare the last remnant of wits out of Jimmy. We could hear the object of our exasperated solicitude darting to and fro under the planks. He had cracked his voice at last, and could only squeak miserably. His back or else his head rubbed the planks, now here, now there, in a puzzling manner. He squeaked as he dodged the invisible blows. It was more heartrending even than his yells. Suddenly Archie produced a crowbar. He had kept it back; also a small hatchet. We howled with satisfaction. He struck a mighty blow and small chips flew at our eyes. The boatswain above shouted:--"Look out! Look out there. Don't kill the man. Easy does it!" [...] Wamibo, maddened with excitement, hung head down and insanely urged us:--"Hoo! Strook'im! Hoo! Hoo!" [...] We were afraid he would fall in and kill one of us and, hurriedly, we entreated the boatswain to [...] "shove the blamed Finn overboard." [...] Then, all together, we yelled down at the planks:--"Stand from under! Get forward," [...] and listened. We only heard the deep hum and moan of the wind above us, the mingled roar and hiss of the seas. The ship, as if overcome with despair, wallowed lifelessly, and our heads swam with that unnatural motion. Belfast clamoured:--"For the love of God, Jimmy, where are ye?... Knock! Jimmy darlint!... Knock! You bloody black beast! Knock!" [...] He was as quiet as a dead man inside a grave; and, like men standing above a grave, we {{were on the verge of}} tears--but with vexation, the strain, the fatigue; with the great longing to be done with it, to get away, and lie down to rest somewhere where we could see our danger and breathe. Archie shouted:--"Gi'e me room!" [...] We crouched behind him, guarding our heads, and he struck time after time in the joint of planks. They cracked. Suddenly the crowbar went halfway in through a splintered <b>oblong</b> <b>hole.</b> It must have missed Jimmy's head by less than an inch. Archie withdrew it quickly, and that infamous nigger rushed at the hole, put his lips to it, and whispered [...] "Help" [...] in an almost extinct voice; he pressed his head to it, trying madly to get out through that opening one inch wide and three inches long. In our disturbed state we were absolutely paralysed by his incredible action. It seemed impossible to drive him away. Even Archie at last lost his composure. [...] "If ye don't clear oot I'll drive the crowbar thro' your head," [...] he shouted in a determined voice. He meant what he said, and his earnestness seemed to make an impression on Jimmy. He disappeared suddenly, and we set to prising and tearing at the planks with the eagerness of men trying to get at a mortal enemy, and spurred by the desire to tear him limb from limb. The wood split, cracked, gave way. Belfast plunged in head and shoulders and groped viciously. [...] "I've got 'im! Got 'im," [...] he shouted. [...] "Oh! There!... He's gone; I've got 'im!... Pull at my legs!... Pull!" [...] Wamibo hooted unceasingly. The boatswain shouted directions:--"Catch hold of his hair, Belfast; pull straight up, you two!... Pull fair!" [...] We pulled fair. We pulled Belfast out with a jerk, and dropped him with disgust. In a sitting posture, purple-faced, he sobbed despairingly:--"How can I hold on to 'is blooming short wool?" [...] Suddenly Jimmy's head and shoulders appeared. He stuck halfway, and with rolling eyes foamed at our feet. We flew at him with brutal impatience, we tore the shirt off his back, we tugged at his ears, we panted over him; and all at once he came away in our hands as though somebody had let go his legs. With the same movement, without a pause, we swung him up. His breath whistled, he kicked our upturned faces, he grasped two pairs of arms above his head, and he squirmed up with such precipitation that he seemed positively to escape from our hands like a bladder full of gas. Streaming with perspiration, we swarmed up the rope, and, coming into the blast of cold wind, gasped like men plunged into icy water. With burning faces we shivered to the very marrow of our bones. Never before had the gale seemed to us more furious, the sea more mad, the sunshine more merciless and mocking, and the position of the ship more hopeless and appalling. Every movement of her was ominous of the end of her agony and of the beginning of ours. We staggered away from the door, and, alarmed by a sudden roll, fell down in a bunch. It appeared to us that the side of the house was more smooth than glass and more slippery than ice. There was nothing to hang on to but a long brass hook used sometimes to keep back an open door. Wamibo held on to it and we held on to Wamibo, clutching our Jimmy. He had completely collapsed now. He did not seem to have the strength to close his hand. We stuck to him blindly in our fear. We were not afraid of Wamibo letting go (we remembered that the brute was stronger than any three men in the ship), but we were afraid of the hook giving way, and we also believed that the ship had made up her mind to turn over at last. But she didn't. A sea swept over us. The boatswain spluttered:--"Up and away. There's a lull. Away aft with you, or we will all go to the devil here." [...] We stood up surrounding Jimmy. We begged him to hold up, to hold on, at least. He glared with his bulging eyes, mute as a fish, and with all the stiffening knocked out of him. He wouldn't stand; he wouldn't even as much as clutch at our necks; he was only a cold black skin loosely stuffed with soft cotton wool; his arms and legs swung jointless and pliable; his head rolled about; the lower lip hung down, enormous and heavy. We pressed round him, bothered and dismayed; sheltering him we swung here and there in a body; and on the very brink of eternity we tottered all together with concealing and absurd gestures, like a lot of drunken men embarrassed with a stolen corpse.|$|E

Spring-back is an issue in sheet metal forming processes and some times is a principle problem for producing precise components. This is more important if some kind of cuttings exists on the bending surfaces. Experiments show that punched holes on bending surfaces affect {{the value of the}} spring-back. In this paper the spring-back of components with <b>oblong</b> <b>holes</b> on bending surfaces are studied experimentally and an artificial neural network is applied to predict the spring-back in L-bending shape dies. Based on 40 case experiments, a neural network is trained. Sheet metal material type, the size of the hole, blank holder force, the ratio of die clearance to sheet thickness, die and punch radius is used as input and the final angle of the bending is the output of the neural network. The trained neural network was tested by experiment results of 30 new cases. It was observed that the neural network gives close predictions of final angles...|$|R

40|$|Sheet metal bending {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely applied sheet metal {{operations}}. The bending operations present several technical problems in production, such as prediction of spring-back and the punch load. In this paper, the value of the spring-back and bending forces are investigated for a low carbon steel material. Two thicknesses of material (0. 95 and 0. 75 mm) are applied. Sheet metal components, which are used in the experiments, have <b>oblong</b> <b>holes</b> on their bending surfaces. The influence of the area of the holes, die angles, die widths and punch radius on the value of the spring-back and the bending forces in V-die bending is studied. It is found that all these parameters affect the spring-back and the bending forces, but not in the same way. A new equation is suggested in this paper to predict the bending forces in V-shaped dies for parts with holes on the bending surfaces...|$|R

The material used for the components are High Strength Low Alloy Steel. The dies used are V-shape dies.

40|$|A {{computer-controlled}} apparatus processes {{batches of}} soybeans into {{one or more}} of a variety of food products, under conditions that can be chosen by the user and reproduced from batch to batch. Examples of products include soy milk, tofu, okara (an insoluble protein and fiber byproduct of soy milk), and whey. Most processing steps take place without intervention by the user. This apparatus was developed for use in research on processing of soy. It is also a prototype of other soy-processing apparatuses for research, industrial, and home use. Prior soy-processing equipment includes household devices that automatically produce soy milk but do not automatically produce tofu. The designs of prior soy-processing equipment require users to manually transfer intermediate solid soy products and to press them manually and, hence, under conditions that are not consistent from batch to batch. Prior designs do not afford choices of processing conditions: Users cannot use previously developed soy-processing equipment to investigate the effects of variations of techniques used to produce soy milk (e. g., cold grinding, hot grinding, and pre-cook blanching) and of such process parameters as cooking times and temperatures, grinding times, soaking times and temperatures, rinsing conditions, and sizes of particles generated by grinding. In contrast, the present apparatus is amenable to such investigations. The apparatus (see figure) includes a processing tank and a jacketed holding or coagulation tank. The processing tank can be capped by either of two different heads and can contain either of two different insertable mesh baskets. The first head includes a grinding blade and heating elements. The second head includes an automated press piston. One mesh basket, designated the okara basket, has <b>oblong</b> <b>holes</b> with a size equivalent to about 40 mesh [40 openings per inch (. 16 openings per centimeter) ]. The second mesh basket, designated the tofu basket, has holes of 70 mesh [70 openings per inch (. 28 openings per centimeter) ] and is used in conjunction with the press-piston head. Supporting equipment includes a soy-milk heat exchanger for maintaining selected coagulation temperatures, a filter system for separating okara from other particulate matter and from soy milk, two pumps, and various thermocouples, flowmeters, level indicators, pressure sensors, valves, tubes, and sample port...|$|R

Both producer and customers will bene t from a new automated small ve axis mill, especially ProVista that has started this paradigm shift. ProVista wants the opportunity to mill holes in their own glasses. Today they are depending on two foreign companies to mill the holes. This is both time consuming and costly for ProVista and their customers. This master thesis comprises the study, design and manufacturing of a ve axis mill. The decision to build a ve axis CNC mill was made early in the process, this was done by integrating a three axis CNC mill with two extra rotations axes. The project incorporates the main areas within mechatronics such as designing and building mechanical and electronic parts and the interplay between them, control system for controlling and tuning the motors. The mill shall produce di erent holes, mostly circular with angles so that the binoculars achieve the correct focal point in accordance to the user's needs. The users are mainly surgeons and dentists, who depend on magni cation provided with two binoculars, focused at an item to performer their work more e ciently and correctly. In ProVista sub market the users vary from hobbyist using binocular glasses to paint tin soldiers, old people reading the paper and other people that are visually impaired. The solution this project presents is a new small ve axis CNC mill special designed for milling in glasses. The mill is based on the High-Z S 400 purchased from CNC-Step in Germany. The chosen design for the two extra axes is a two axis rotary table design also known as trunnion. The trunnion table was tted with two stepper motor, from the same producer used on the High-Z S 400. The stepper motors were chosen mainly for their low cost and ease of use. There has been made a control box with motor drives and power supply for the trunnion table. The control box is also tted with serial ports, parallel port, fan, emergency button, fuse and power connection. A new xture for glasses is also designed and built. This will most probably be the rst milling xture for a pair of glasses in the world. The software used in the project is Excel and Mach 3. Excel was used to generate the G code from the position, diameter and the angle of the holes. After this the data is saved in a txt le, making it readable by Mach 3. This process has been made as user friendly as possible so that a user can operate the milling machine without problems. The Mach 3 CNC program already has a good enough interface, and only needed to be modi ed with a six axes interface. The Excel spreadsheet is been made simpler and the user may only change a few variables, the transfer of the G code is also been done simpler by adding the possibility to save the column with G code as txt le. The most typical holes that ProVista needs are circular <b>holes</b> and <b>oblong</b> <b>holes</b> (prism). After implementation several test were carried out to verify that the di erent parts obtained the requirements. Among the tests that were carried out was: resolution and repeatability for the mill, and the backlash for the trunnion table. In the last test it was milled holes through glasses to verify that the nal product met the requirements All tests met the requirements with good margin, except the last test. The problem will be xed and the test will be redone before handing over the machine to ProVista. With the new automated mill ProVista will be able to o er high quality visual aids on the world market. Their products will be made quicker and at a lower cost, bene ting both ProVista and the customers. ProVista will also have a new tool in their further research, which may result in new methods to help visually impaired so they may have a better quality of life. With the newly acquired high capacity to mill holes in glasses, ProVista would be able to take in orders from other visual aid companies. Further work may involve reducing the size of the mill since a large portion of the work area is unused. The user interface should be something similar to HMI (Human Machine Interface) where the users do not see the Mach 3 or Excel and just put in the desired position, diameter and angles on a touch screen. The xture should also be modi ed so that the glasses are self centred, this will reduce any minor errors. A new spindle should also be re tted to reduce noise level...|$|R

The xture should also be modi ed so that the glasses are self centred, this will reduce any minor errors. A new spindle should also be re tted to reduce noise level...|$|R
40|$|On rare {{occasions}} diseases and injuries sustained during {{the lifetime of}} an organism can be preserved in the fossil record, {{in the form of}} osseous lesions and exostoses, and may help gain a better insight in disease acquisition, soft tissue anatomy and even behavioral aspects of the organisms affected. Deducing behaviour from fossil evidence is never an easy task, the field of paleopathology {{has proven to be a}} potent tool for understanding and directly correlating fossilized remnants of these interactions with behavioral patterns by employing a multidisciplinary approach merging medical science and paleontology into one (Halstead, 1990; Rothschild & Martin, 1993; Tanke & Currie, 1998). With the help of new visualization techniques, including highly detailed computer tomography and three-dimensional imaging, much more detailed paleopathological surveys can be undertaken. The recently discovered mosasaur of the Maastrichtian Type section, nicknamed “Carlo” (NHMM 2012072) after its discoverer, is employed to illustrate the possibilities of modern techniques for reconstructing paleo-ethology. The external appearance of the maxillary and premaxillary revealed multiple areas of rugosity, including the anteriormost section of the premaxilla, together with an antero-posteriorly located lesion, with associated damage to the left maxilla. Furthermore, a bony callus was present on the left dentary, that may have been related to the damage of the upper jaw sections. To gain more insight in the underlying cause of the lesions and their extent, the dentaries, together with the upper jaw sections, were CT scanned at the Universitair Medisch Centrum (UMC, Utrecht, The Netherlands), and Maastricht University Medical Center (MUMC+, Maastricht, The Netherlands) respectively. A small triangular-shaped concentration of less-dense irregular bony material could be distinguished underneath the ridge-like protrusion, which can be traced along the entire length of the ridge-like exostosis. Underlying the three <b>oblong</b> <b>holes</b> in the left maxillary, are interconnected tubules, that either represent modified neurovascular canals, or drainage pathways for infectious material. In order to get a better perspective on the internal remodeling, three dimensional models were constructed using a combination of Avizo v. 8. 1, Meshlab v. 1. 3. 2 and Polyworks workspace manager v 12. 1. 23 at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, Germany. The appearance of this large catchment area differs from the observed neurovascular canals in some respects. The internal bony architecture enclosing these maxillary canals differs in appearance to the sharply defined structures visible in the neurovascular network of the premaxillary. Furthermore, the latter displays a highly organized interaction of the various neurovascular tubular structures, while the former display different shapes, sizes and orientation between one another. With additional canals extending from the lateral subsurface of the maxillary, it is therefore highly unlikely that these are part of a structured network of neurovascular tubules. Concerning the damage to the anteriormost section of the premaxillary, post-mortem erosion cannot be excluded as a possible cause, however, the elevated and partially healed anterior edge and the additional lesions present, seem to point towards a more traumatic origin. Furthermore, the majority of the damage is concentrated on the left side of the skull, while post-mortem bacterial erosion is most prominent in the right lateral side. Additional information can be gained from the advanced state of healing observed and the extensive nature of the infection, as both seem to indicate that the organism has survived the initial facial injury for a period of at least several weeks to a few months. All of the facial injuries observed in NHMM 2012072, are best explained by a non-fatal interaction with one (or more) large mosasaur(s), adding to the approximately handful of possible inter- or intraspecific confrontations present in the fossil record. Whether or not the animal eventually collapsed under the negative effects of the infection associated with the trauma cannot be stated for certain. However, since the infection seems to have still been ongoing at the time of death, one might propose chronic infection to be the underlying cause. A newly discovered specimen of Tyranno-saurus rex (RGM 792. 000) from the Hell Creek Formation (Upper Maastrichtian) of Montana, has revealed numerous pathologies (Schulp et al., 2015). This specimen displays excellent surface preservation with little signs, if any, distortion (Schulp et al., 2015). The exceptional preservation resulting from rapid burial in a relatively uniform deposit of “fine to medium grained unconsolidated sand”, allows for it to be used to demonstrate the amount of diagnostic information that can be gained through three-dimensional renderings (Kaskes, 2016; Schulp et al., 2015). To allow for an in depth analysis of the various etiologies of the multiple abnormal morphologies, the caudal vertebral element was CT scanned using a Toshiba Aquilion at Leidens Universitair Medisch Centrum (LUMC) Leiden, The Netherlands, at 0. 5 mm slice thickness, rendering 512 coronal, 512 saggital and 705 axial slices. Three dimensional models were constructed using a combination of RadiAnt DICOM Viewer V 1. 9. 16, MITO Medical Imaging Toolkit v 2. 0, and InVesalius v 3. 0, providing additional insight in the extent and nature of the superficial and endosteal changes, as well as providing radiodensity-based quantification of these extents. This paleopathological test case can be employed as a template for etiological studies of both osseous (i. e. pathology 1 and 2) and soft tissue alterations (i. e. pathology 3). Here the presence of an exostosial surface growth (i. e. pathology 1) with extensive pitting and subcortical focal zones of penetrative lesions strongly suggest that RGM 792. 000 suffered from a localized infection, whether traumatic in origin remains debatable. Moreover, cortical disruptions of the articular surfaces of this vertebral element are apparent (pathology 2), potentially reflecting the first documented case of pressure-based deformation in a dinosaurian vertebra in literature. The extent, both overall as well as radiopacity patterns, and morphology of these disruptions of the cortical surface were vital in excluding various hypothetical etiologies. The presence of such alterations in RGM 792. 000 seems to concur with other observations in postulating a high ontogenetic age for this specimen. Besides these superficial or subperiosteal changes, a central radiolucent cavity can be identified, largely obscured by a high density iron-rich mineral infill and (ventrally) enclosed by a distinct pattern of trabecular radiolucencies (pathology 3). A three-dimensional rendering of the trabecular architecture reveals that the mineral deposition enclosing and invading the central cavity (RC) has not compromised the structural and architectural morphology, as even the smallest of trabeculae ventral to the cavity seem encased rather than destroyed. Consequently, the formation of these structures must have occurred prior to the mineral apposition, thus spurring various hypotheses for its etiology, including non-pathological causative mechanisms (e. g. intense pneumatization as in other theropods, sauropods and Aves) (Brochu, 2003). Additional renderings of the radiolucent cavity (RC) by employing the distinct radiopacity of the localized mineral apposition, the non-aggressive nature of the alterations and the sharp demarcation could be established, leaving a diagnosis of a benign neoplasm or a metabolic disorder as viable hypotheses. Despite the trabecular pattern displaying a large degree of similarity to the radiological appearance of hemangioma, a definite diagnosis cannot be given at this time for the related changes are usually focal in cases of vertebral hemangioma, affecting one region of the vertebral centrum more prominently. Osteoporotic changes, on the other hand, would provide an alternative hypothesis, however, these would not only be restricted to the endosteal space of the vertebral body but would also affect the vertebral spinae, a feature not observed in RGM 792. 000. This may represent the first reported case of a tumor in a North American theropod and together with the infectious and developmental disorders already described above may greatly expand the paleopathological array found in theropods (Rothschild and Tanke, 2005; Rothschild, Tanke and Ford, 2001) ...|$|R
30|$|Locking screw failure with {{proximal}} compression tube nails was not documented; however, two {{locking screw}} bending failures with the conventional interlocking nails had been recorded. We {{assumed that the}} main reason for this is the self-dynamization effect feature of the 20 -mm <b>oblong</b> <b>hole</b> in addition to the continuous contact between the fractured edges. The continuous contact effect between the fractured edges may decrease the bending stress on locking screws by sharing the axial loads. Higher locking screw failure rates had been reported for the conventional interlocking nails [8, 9, 10]. The locking screw bending failure had been reported to occur intraoperatively during nail compression by central screws [3].|$|E

Para essa finalidade, um lote de sementes de café arábica 'Catuaí Amarelo IAC 62 ' foi submetido ao beneficiamento nesses três equipamentos, em diversas combinações. As frações retidas pelas peneiras 22 / 64 e 20 / 64 avos de polegada, na máquina de ventiladores e peneiras, constituíram a maior parte do lote e foram processadas, separadamente, em mesa densimétrica. Foram {{realizadas}} avaliações de pureza física, massa de mil sementes, peso hectolítrico, teor de água, tipos de sementes predominantes e integridade do endocarpo. Observou-se que: a) A máquina de pré-limpeza, a máquina de ventiladores e peneiras e a mesa densimétrica foram eficientes para a homogeneização do lote de sementes de café, proporcionando obtenção de melhor qualidade física na seqüência operacional em que foram utilizadas de forma conjugada; b) O uso de peneiras com crivos oblongos e crivos circulares, intercaladas na máquina de ventiladores e peneiras, possibilitou a separação de sementes mocas, de sementes com resíduos de exocarpo aderidos ao endocarpo e de sementes desprovidas de endocarpo, melhorando a aparência do lote; c) A mesa densimétrica foi o equipamento que proporcionou melhor separação de sementes com endocarpo danificado, bem como alterações favoráveis à qualidade física do lote; d) As sementes pequenas, retidas nas menores peneiras da máquina de ventiladores e peneiras, e as sementes de menor massa específica, classificadas ou não por tamanho e coletadas na descarga inferior da mesa densimétrica, foram as de baixa qualidade física. The need of {{more suitable}} information concerning coffee seeds processing {{led to the}} present research whose objectives were to verify {{the possibility of using}} the pre-cleaning machine, air-screen cleaner and gravity table for separate coffee seed lots into fractions according to the physical seeds characteristics and to study their effects on physical seed quality. One seed lot of 'Catuaí Amarelo IAC 62 ' was processed by several operational sequences in a pre-cleaning machine, in an air-screen cleaner and in a gravity table, according to technical recommendations for seed processing. The fractions retained over the screens with 22 / 64 and 20 / 64 inch circular holes of the air-screen cleaner were processed separately in the gravity table. The seeds were evaluated in the laboratory as to their purity, weight of thousand seeds, weight of hectoliter, moisture content, predominant seed types and endocarp integrity. It was observed that: a) The pre-cleaning machine, the air-screen cleaner and the gravity table were effective for separating and classifying coffee seed lots into homogeneous size classes, promoting the best seed quality in the complete sequence of the processing; b) The air-screen cleaner with <b>oblong</b> <b>hole</b> screens and cleaner with circular hole screens promoted the separation of peaberry seeds, seeds with exocarp fragments and seeds without endocarp, improving the appearance and physical quality of the coffee seed lot; c) The gravity table promoted better separation of seeds with damaged endocarp, improving favorable alterations in the physical seed characteristics and improving quality of the seed lot; d) The small seeds retained by screens with smallest holes of the air-screen cleaner and the light seeds, classified or not by size and discharged on the lowest spout of the gravity table, showed inferior physical quality...|$|E
