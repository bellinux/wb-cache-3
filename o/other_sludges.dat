40|$|Biohydrogen {{production}} from arabinose was examined using four different anaerobic sludges with different pHs ranging from 4. 5 to 8. 0. Arabinose (30 g l− 1) {{was used as}} the substrate for all experiments. Individual cumulative hydrogen production data was used to estimate the three parameters of the modified Gompertz equation. Higher hydrogen production potentials were observed for higher pH values for all the sludges. G 2 (acclimated granular sludge) showed the highest hydrogen production potential and percentage of arabinose consumption compared to the <b>other</b> <b>sludges</b> tested. Granular sludges (G 1 and G 2) showed different behaviour than the suspended sludges (S 1 and S 2). The differences were observed to be smaller lag phases, the percentage of acetate produced, the higher percentage of ethanol produced, and the amount of arabinose consumed. A high correlation (R 2 = 0. 973) was observed between the percentage of n-butyrate and the percentage of ethanol in G 1 sludge, suggesting that ethanol/butyrate fermentation was the dominant fermentative pathway followed by this sludge. In S 1, however, the percentage of n-butyrate was highly correlated with the percentage of acetate (R 2 = 0. 980). This study indicates that granular sludge can be used for larger pH ranges without reducing its capacity to consume arabinose and achieve higher hydrogen production potentials.

40|$|This work {{determined}} rheological parameters able {{to describe}} the rheological properties of the flocculant sludge presents in sulphidogenic anaerobic bioreactors, i. e. a MBR (membrane bioreactor) and a CSTR (continuous stirred tank reactor). Both sludges displayed a non-Newtonian rheological behaviour with shear thinning properties, slightly thixotropic for a TSS content ranging from 0 to 23 g l¿ 1. Both sulphidogenic sludges displayed pseudoplastic properties. To predict the rheological properties of <b>other</b> <b>sludges,</b> three rheological models (Casson, Bingham and Herschel¿Buckley) were selected and fitted to the experimental rheological data obtained. The mathematic equations of these three models give seven rheological parameters. To select relevant rheological parameters, exponential and second-order polynomial equations were tested to evaluate {{the relationship between the}} rheological parameters and the sludge TSS content. These two last variables were statistically fitted with a second-order polynomial correlation, which allows to select rheological parameters able {{to describe the}} evolution of the sludges in both bioreactors. The Bingham model applied on the pseudo-Newtonian area of a rheogram gives the more suitable rheological parameters to describe the evolution of the rheological properties of anaerobic sulphidogenic flocculant sludge. The selected rheological parameters of the sulphidogenic sludges are affected by the bioreactor type and its operation time. This is likely linked to changes in microbial consortia involving a change in biomass morphology and a decrease in floc strength...|$|E
40|$|A {{combination}} of different methods {{was applied to}} investigate the occurrence of anaerobic processes in aerated activated sludge. Microsensor measurements (O 2, NO 2 −, NO 3 −, and H 2 S) were performed on single sludge flocs to detect anoxic niches, nitrate reduction, or sulfate reduction on a microscale. Incubations of activated sludge with 15 NO 3 − and 35 SO 42 − {{were used to determine}} denitrification and sulfate reduction rates on a batch scale. In four of six investigated sludges, no anoxic zones developed during aeration, and consequently denitrification rates were very low. However, in two sludges anoxia in flocs coincided with significant denitrification rates. Sulfate reduction could not be detected in any sludge in either the microsensor or the batch investigation, not even under short-term anoxic conditions. In contrast, the presence of sulfate-reducing bacteria was shown by fluorescence in situ hybridization with 16 S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes and by PCR-based detection of genes coding for the dissimilatory sulfite reductase. A possible explanation for the absence of anoxia even in most of the larger flocs might be that oxygen transport is not only diffusional but enhanced by advection, i. e., facilitated by flow through pores and channels. This possibility is suggested by the irregularity of some oxygen profiles and by confocal laser scanning microscopy of the three-dimensional floc structures, which showed that flocs from the two sludges in which anoxic zones were found were apparently denser than flocs from the <b>other</b> <b>sludges...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Aerobic {{granular}} sludge (AGS) {{technology has}} been extensively studied recently to improve sludge settling and behaviour in activated sludge systems. The main advantage is that aerobic granular sludge (AGS) can settle very fast in a reactor or clarifier because AGS is compact and has strong structure. It also has good settleability and a high capacity for biomass retention. Several experimental works have been conducted in this study to observe the settling behaviours of AGS. The study thus has two aims: (1) to compare the settling profile of AGS with <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> flocs and (2) to observe the influence of mechanical mixing and design of the reactor to the settleability of AGS. The first experimental outcome shows that AGS settles after less than 5 min in a depth of 0. 4 m compared to <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> flocs (from sequencing batch reactor, conventional activated sludge and extended aeration) which takes more than 30 min. This study also shows that the turbulence from the mixing mechanism and shear in the reactor provides an insignificant effect on the AGS settling velocity.

40|$|Three sludge types {{from the}} same {{treatment}} stream (undigested liquid, anaerobically digested liquid and dewatered, anaerobically digested cake) were used in a field based tub study. Amendments (4, 8, and 16 Mg dry solid (ds) ha(- 1)) were incorporated into the upper 15 cm of a sandy loam soil prior to sowing with rye-grass (Lolium perenne L.). Nitrogen transformations in the soil were determined for the 80 d period following incorporation. Nitrogen uptake and crop yield were measured in the cut sward 35 and 70 d after sowing. The study showed that application of sewage sludge at rates as low as 4 Mgha(- 1) can have a nutritional benefit to rye-grass over the two harvests. Differences in N transformation, and hence crop nutritional benefit, between sludge types were evident throughout the experiment. In particular, the dewatering process changed the mineral N characteristics of the anaerobically digested sludge, which, when not dewatered, outperformed the <b>other</b> <b>sludges</b> in terms of yield and mineralisation rate at both harvests. The dewatered sludge produced the lowest yield of rye-grass. The undigested liquid sludge had the lowest foliar N and soil NO(3) -N concentrations, possibly immobilised as the large oxidisable C component of this sludge was metabolised by the microbial biomass.

40|$|Refinery wastes, {{tank bottoms}} and <b>other</b> <b>sludges</b> in particular, pose unique {{opportunities}} for waste reduction. Federal Land Disposal Restrictions (LDR’s) applicable to nonwastewater forms of K 048, KO 49, K 050, and KO 51 took full effect on November 8, 1990. These LDR’s {{can be met}} by pre-treating the sludge at the source before going to volume-reducing filtration equipment. If effective pretreatment is not performed, the resulting waste will require either incineration, or cost-prohibitive further treatment. A great deal of these wastes has been, {{and will continue to}} be, land disposed at secure repositories. Now stringent federal LDR standards must be met prior to land disposal. Because “Constituent Concentration in Waste ” (CCW) standards for the nonwastewater forms of K 048 -KO 51 deal almost exclusively with common oil constituents, the problem of meeting CCW standards is reduced to that of efficient oil recovery prior to, or as a part of, onsite pretreatment. Several alternative methods can achieve LDR standards. Perhaps the most promising treatment technology is the use of surfactants to break oil emulsions in tank bottoms and other wastes before sludge is removed from the tank. Cationic surfactants appear to be the most promising for crude oil emulsions. Often a combination of surfactants works best. Another optional treatment is to break emulsions by “salting out”, or by pH adjustment. These methods will allow oil to separate with varying degrees of effectiveness. Breaking emulsions in the sludge while the waste is still in the tank, however, is an excellent way to reduce the volume and toxicity of refinery waste. Refinery coker units can also Play a large part in reducing the volume of waste requiring off-site handling. DAF float (K 048) in particular can be managed almost entirely on-site.

The presence of sulfate (COD/sulfate ratio = 1) in the feed of glucose fed anaerobic sludges did not change the physico-chemical characteristics throughout the incubation. In contrast, the presence of iron in the feed (in addition to glucose and sulfate, COD/iron ratio = 1) reduced the protein and carbohydrate content in the SMP and EPS with about 50 % after 30 days incubation compared to the other feeding conditions.

Conventional parameters of process performance, such as gas production, acetic acid production, COD, phosphorus, nitrogen and suspended solids loadings and % COD removal were also monitored. The response of both biochemical and conventional parameters to changing process conditions was then compared.

In a {{time when}} the world is {{becoming}} more environmentally conscious, and is looking for simple, efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly solutions to sewage and sludge treatment, the dual digestion system presents itself as an attractive alternative to <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> treatment systems. The dual digestion system comprises an autoheated thermophilic (55 - 65 °C) aerobic first stage and a mesophilic (37 °C) anaerobic second stage. Past research into the dual digestion system has given rise, inter alia, to the following claims (de Villiers, et al, 1991) : a) sludge disinfection and stabilisation occur in one process - disinfection. in the thermophilic aerobic first stage and stabilisation in the anaerobic second stage. b) the stability of the anaerobic stage is considerably 'improved by the increase in H 2 C 03 * alkalinity and pH in the aerobic stage. c) in the aerobic stage the sludge is aerobically or thermally pretreated (conditioned) making it more readily digestible under anaerobic conditions, thereby allowing significantly reduced retention times from 25 to 30 days for normal digestion, to 8 to 10 days. Messenger (1991), in a full scale investigation at the Potsdam Wastewater Treatment Plant in Milnerton, Cape Town, verified claims (a) and (b), but was unable to verify claim (c) above.

40|$|Treatment of High Level Waste (HLW) is {{the second}} most costly problem {{identified}} by OEM. In order to minimize costs of disposal, the volume of HLW requiring vitrification and long term storage must be reduced. Methods for efficient separation of chromium from waste sludges, such as the Hanford Tank Wastes (HTW), are key to achieving this goal since the allowed level of chromium in high level glass controls waste loading. At concentrations above 0. 5 to 1. 0 wt. % chromium prevents proper vitrification of the waste. Chromium in sludges most likely exists as extremely insoluble oxides and minerals, with chromium in the plus III oxidation state [1]. In order to solubilize and separate it from <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> components, Cr(III) must be oxidized to the more soluble Cr(VI) state. Efficient separation of chromium from HLW could produce an estimated savings of $ 3. 4 B[2]. Additionally, the efficient separation of technetium [3], TRU, and other metals may require the reformulation of solids to free trapped species as well as the destruction of organic complexants. New chemical processes are needed to separate chromium and other metals from tank wastes. Ideally they should not utilize additional reagents which would increase waste volume or require subsequent removal. The goal of this project is to apply hydrothermal processing for enhanced chromium separation from HLW sludges. Initially, the authors seek to develop a fundamental understanding of chromium speciation, oxidation/reduction and dissolution kinetics, reaction mechanisms, and transport properties under hydrothermal conditions in both simple and complex salt solutions. The authors also wish to evaluate the potential of hydrothermal processing for enhanced separations of technetium and TRU by examining technetium and TRU speciation at hydrothermal conditions optimal for chromium dissolution. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of granular sludge from upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors for bioremediation of chlorinated pollutants was evaluated by using carbon tetrachloride (CT) {{as a model}} compound. Granular sludges cultivated in UASB reactors on methanol, a volatile fatty acid mixture, or sucrose readily degraded CT supplied at a concentration of 1, 500 nmol/batch (approximately 10 μM) without any prior exposure to organohalogens. The maximum degradation rate was 1. 9 μmol of CT g of volatile suspended solids− 1 day− 1. The main end products of CT degradation were CO 2 and Cl−, and the yields of these end products were 44 and 68 %, respectively, of the initial amounts of [14 C]CT and CT-Cl. Lower chlorinated methanes accumulated in minor amounts temporarily. Autoclaved (dead) sludges were capable of degrading CT at rates two- to threefold lower than those for living sludges, indicating that abiotic processes (mediated by cofactors or <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> components) {{played an important role}} in the degradation observed. Reduced components in the autoclaved sludge were vital for CT degradation. A major part (51 %) of the CT was converted abiotically to CS 2. The amount of CO 2 produced (23 %) was lower and the amount of Cl− produced (86 %) was slightly higher with autoclaved sludge than with living sludge. Both living and autoclaved sludges could degrade chloroform. However, only living sludge degraded dichloromethane and methylchloride. These results indicate that reductive dehalogenation, which was mediated better by living sludge than by autoclaved sludge, is only a minor pathway for CT degradation. The main pathway involves substitutive and oxidative dechlorination reactions that lead to the formation of CO 2. Granular sludge, therefore, has outstanding potential for gratuitous dechlorination of CT to safe end products...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure the effect of adding triethanolamine (TEA) to caustic leaching solutions to improve the solubility of aluminum in actual tank-waste sludge. High-level radioactive waste sludge that had a high aluminum assay was used for the tests. This waste, which originated with the processing of aluminum-clad/aluminum-alloy fuels, generates high levels of heat because of the high {sup 90 }Sr concentration and contains hard-to-dissolve boehmite phases. In concept, a chelating agent, such as TEA, can both improve the dissolution rate and increase the concentration in the liquid phase. For this reason, TEA could also increase the solubility of <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> components that are potentially problematic to downstream processing. Tests were conducted to determine if this were the case. Because of its relatively high vapor pressure, process design should include methods to minimize losses of the TEA. Sludge was retrieved from tank 12 H at the Savannah River Site by on-site personnel, and then shipped to Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the study. The sludge contained a small quantity of rocky debris. One slate-like flat piece, which had approximate dimensions of 1 1 / 4 x 1 / 2 x 1 / 8 in., was recovered. Additional gravel-like fragments with approximate diameters ranging from 1 / 8 to 1 / 4 in. were also recovered by sieving the sludge slurry through a 1. 4 -mm square-pitch stainless steel mesh. These particles ranged from a yellow quartz-like material to grey-colored gravel. Of the 32. 50 g of sludge received, the mass of the debris was only 0. 89 g, and the finely divided sludge comprised {approx} 97 % of the mass. The sludge was successfully subdivided into uniform aliquots during hot-cell operations. Analytical measurements confirmed the uniformity of the samples. The smaller sludge samples were then used as needed for leaching experiments conducted in a glove box. Six tests were performed with leachate concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 3. 0 m NaOH, 0 to 3. 0 m TEA and 0 to 2. 9 m NaNO{sub 3 }. Figure ES. 1 illustrates the leaching of aluminum in all six tests. One test was performed at an operating temperature of 80 C to obtain baseline data, and the remaining five tests were all performed at 60 C. A leaching solution of 3. 0 m NaOH was used for the test performed at 80 C and for one of the tests performed at 60 C. These results indicated that more aluminum entered the solution at the higher temperature, though equilibrium was achieved at both temperatures within {approx} 10 days. The addition of TEA significantly increased the concentration of aluminum in the leachate, and the concentration continued to increase even after 11 days of processing. The fraction of aluminum dissolved at 60 EC increased from {approx} 35 % using 3. 0 m NaOH alone to {approx} 87 % using a combination of 3. 0 m NaOH and 3. 0 m TEA. The high-nitrate, low-hydroxide solutions did not significantly dissolve the aluminum, because aluminate ion could not be produced. A small addition of TEA had no effect on this process. The use of TEA also increased the solubility of some <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> components. The fractions of copper, nickel, and iron that were dissolved increased to 72, 13, and 52 %, respectively. However, the original fractions of these metals were only 0. 055, 0. 72, and 3. 1 %, respectively, of the dry mass of the sludge and therefore represent minor constituents. The presence of nickel in the leachate did have a dramatic effect on its color, which changed from light yellow to deep green as the nickel concentration increased. By comparison, the baseline leaching with 3. 0 m NaOH at 60 C removed {approx} 14 % of the copper; iron and nickel were below the detectable limit...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} Cr {{addition}} on the fluidity of aluminum (LM 6) alloy {{has been investigated}} by spiral fluidity test. Presence of 0. 1 wt. % Cr decreased fluidity of melt due to formation of sludge. In fact Cr changes the morphology of the intermetallic phase from β-intermetallics less harmful polyhedral morphology (α-intermetallics). The β-phases have largest surface to volume ratio, hence they have the largest interfacial region with the melt and are the most detrimental intermetallic to drop off the fluidity. In Cr-containing alloys the effect of α-phase is less detrimental than β-phase to the fluidity. On the <b>other</b> hand <b>sludge</b> formation and consuming Si and shifts the local chemical composition of the melt to the aluminum side of the phase diagram which has lower fluidity than eutectic and hypereutectic compositions...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} carried out at the Industrial Area of Khartoum North in the Khartoum state to {{determine}} the industrial effluents characteristics, their effect on sewers and their impact to the surrounding environment. Special {{attention has been given}} to tanneries effluents. In this study some factories, in the Industrial Area of Khartoum North, with different industrial types were selected for a closer study; their industrial operations and processing were observed, and their effluents were taken for physical and chemical analysis. The factories were: 1 -Food Industry (Tahnia), Military Forces Factory. 2 -Textiles, Sudanese Dyers Co. Ltd. 3 -Pharmaceuticals, Amipharma. 4 -Soaps and Oils, Soap and Allied Industries (Bittar). 5 -Tanneries, Hibatan Tannery. Most of the factories in the Industrial Area of Khartoum North have no pretreatment units for the treatment of their effluents and therefore characteristics of wastewater flowing to the pubic sewerage system are not conforming with the standard limits. The analyses were performed to measure the characteristics of these industrial effluents: they include physical tests like: colour, odor, temperatures, and chemical tests like: pH, BOD, COD, SS, TDS, Chrome content, and dissolved sulphides tests. The results of the physical and chemical tests showed different degrees of pollution for different industries. These results were compared with THE INDUSTRIAL LOCAL ORDER FOR KHARTOUM NORTH OF 1971 together with the limits used by INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT ORDERS of the nineties. Pharmaceutical, textiles, and soap industries showed less pollution, while food industries and tanneries showed a great degree of pollution; they almost exceeded all the acceptable limits of 1971. Tanneries were selected for the design of the pretreatment unit plant. All tanning processes, chemicals used in each process, and the types of wastes (solid and liquid) produced in each stage were observed. The max number of the different types of skins (i. e. the batch), the amount of water used in the industry, and the amount of wastewater produced were calculated. Many other tanneries in Khartoum state were visited to know the different tanning processing used and also to see their pretreatment units. Almost all of these tanneries use the same operations and processes for the tanning, but unfortunately most of them have only physical treatment (screens and settling tanks) with no maintenance or cleaning intervals. No treatment for the chrome content or the dissolved sulphides {{is carried out}}; their effects to the man and environment are widely known. Afrotan tannery has relatively a more advanced pretreatment unit plant. A typical pretreatment unit plant is proposed for the tanneries effluents, it comprises: - A bar screen: this decreases the suspended solids in the effluent. - A lifting tank with a lifting pump of submersible type. - A Chrome (Cr) storage and precipitation tank, where calcium hydroxide is added. Aeration can be used to enhance the precipitation. All Cr and other heavy metals are precipitated as hydroxides in the process. A mobile helicoidally sludge suction pump is used to remove all the precipitated Cr sludge and transferred to the Cr sludge drying beds. BOD and COD are also reduced. - Equalization and sulphides oxidation tank: all effluents are collected in this tank, mixed together, neutralized and become a homogenous solution. A rotary vane blower and a system of air diffuser devices are used for aeration of the effluent to oxidize all the dissolved sulphides. BOD and COD are also reduced in the process. - Pit for eventual dosage of chemicals: poly, manganese sulphate, and iron chloride may be added to the effluent, just before the sedimentation tank, to enhance the settling of all the remaining suspended solids. - Sedimentation tank, Dortmund type: all the suspended solids are removed in this tank; BOD is also reduced by a great percentage. The mobile suction pump (used for the suction of Cr sludge above) is used to remove all the <b>other</b> settling <b>sludge</b> from the sedimentation tank and transfer it to the <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> drying beds. - Drying beds: Cr drying beds and <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> drying beds are used to dry the sludge for the removal of odors and for volume reduction. Cr can also be reused after its drying but it needs special separate system for the process. The construction of the effluent treatment plant cost lots of money, but here in this design, this problem is highly considered and overcomed. The proposed pretreatment unit plant will cost about 60, 000 US. $. This is all done to enhance the construction of these plants to provide a clean effluent and hence a clean environment. A comparison is made with other designs prepared by the UNIDO, solving the problems of 7 tanneries in Africa. The designs were almost similar, depending on the situation. The cost varies between 100, 000 and 250, 000 US. $. This cost is really cheap compared with the great hazards that are caused by tanneries effluents...|$|R
40|$|The {{initial phase}} of bulk waste removal {{operations}} was recently completed in Tank 5 F. Video {{inspection of the}} tank indicates several mounds of sludge still remain in the tank. Additionally, a mound of white solids was observed under Riser 5. In support of chemical cleaning and heel removal programs, samples of the sludge and the mound of white solids {{were obtained from the}} tank for characterization and testing. A core sample of the sludge and Super Snapper sample of the white solids were characterized. A supernate dip sample from Tank 7 F was also characterized. A portion of the sludge was used in two tank cleaning tests using oxalic acid at 50 C and 75 C. The filtered oxalic acid from the tank cleaning tests was subsequently neutralized by addition to a simulated Tank 7 F supernate. Solids and liquid samples from the tank cleaning test and neutralization test were characterized. A separate report documents the results of the gas generation from the tank cleaning test using oxalic acid and Tank 5 F sludge. The characterization results for the Tank 5 F sludge sample (FTF- 05 - 06 - 55) appear quite good with respect to the tight precision of the sample replicates, good results for the glass standards, and minimal contamination found in the blanks and glass standards. The aqua regia and sodium peroxide fusion data also show good agreement between the two dissolution methods. Iron dominates the <b>sludge</b> composition with <b>other</b> major contributors being uranium, manganese, nickel, sodium, aluminum, and silicon. The low sodium value for the sludge reflects the absence of supernate present in the sample due to the core sampler employed for obtaining the sample. The XRD and CSEM results for the Super Snapper salt sample (i. e., white solids) from Tank 5 F (FTF- 05 - 07 - 1) indicate the material contains hydrated sodium carbonate and bicarbonate salts along with some aluminum hydroxide. These compounds likely precipitated from the supernate in the tank. A solubility test showed the material to be water-soluble consistent with the determined composition. The analytical data for the solid residues filtered from the oxalic acid solution and filtered oxalic acid indicate {{a large portion of the}} Tank 5 F sludge used in the tank cleaning test dissolved into the oxalic acid. The results of a material balance calculation indicate a high percentage of the iron, uranium, sodium, and aluminum dissolved during both tests. Approximately half of the manganese, a small portion of the plutonium, and essentially none of the nickel dissolved during the tank cleaning tests. Additionally, the results show slightly higher dissolution of the sludge in the 75 C test compared to the 50 C test however, the amount of sludge dissolution gained by using the higher temperature remains small. Some uncertainty remains with respect to the amount of plutonium dissolved in the tank cleaning test. The neutralization of the filtered oxalic acid solutions from the cleaning test produced a large volume of solids ({approx} 2 X the original sludge mass after filtration and air drying). A large portion of the increase in solids could be attributed to the formation of sodium oxalate. The data from analysis of the solid residues filtered from the neutralization tests and the filtrate obtained indicate most of the iron, uranium, manganese, and a large portion of the aluminum precipitated during the neutralization tests. The data for the 50 C test and the 75 C test show good agreement with the exception of the amount of aluminum precipitated from the neutralization. The slower addition rate of the oxalic acid filtrate to the simulated Tank 7 F supernate in the 75 C test might account for the smaller amount of aluminum precipitated and differences in the particle size/morphology and composition of the particulates. Some evidence of uranium separation from <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> elements appears in the 75 C data. Data collected from the tank cleaning and neutralization tests indicates most of the uranium dissolved during the cleaning test with oxalic acid along with the iron, aluminum, and sodium in the sludge. During the neutralization of the oxalic acid, the majority of the uranium precipitates from solution along with the iron and <b>other</b> typical <b>sludge</b> elements. The CSEM results of the 75 C neutralization test provide some evidence of uranium separation from <b>other</b> <b>sludge</b> elements. However, the CSEM analysis looked at a very small amount of sample, which might not be representative of the bulk material and the sludge sample also showed areas of high uranium concentration. Additionally, how the test results will scale to the full-scale neutralization in a waste tank remains uncertain. The analysis of the oxalic acid filtrates indicates that only a small portion of the plutonium dissolved during the tank cleaning test. However, the analytical data from the solid residues filtered from the cleaning test contradict the solution data and indicate approximately half of the plutonium dissolved...|$|R
