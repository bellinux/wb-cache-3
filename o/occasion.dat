40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} violations of the sphericity assumption on Type I error rates for different methodical approaches of repeated measures analysis using a simulation approach. In contrast to previous simulation studies on this topic, up to nine measurement <b>occasions</b> were considered. Effects {{of the level of}} inter-correlations between measurement <b>occasions</b> on Type I error rates were considered for the first time. Two populations with non-violation of the sphericity assumption, one with uncorrelated measurement <b>occasions</b> and one with moderately correlated measurement <b>occasions,</b> were generated. One population with violation of the sphericity assumption combines uncorrelated with highly correlated measurement <b>occasions.</b> A second population with violation of the sphericity assumption combines moderately correlated and highly correlated measurement <b>occasions.</b> From these four populations without any between-group effect or within-subject effect 5, 000 random samples were drawn. Finally, the mean Type I error rates for Multilevel linear models (MLM) with an unstructured covariance matrix (MLM-UN), MLM with compound-symmetry (MLM-CS) and for repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) models (without correction, with Greenhouse-Geisser-correction, and Huynh-Feldt-correction) were computed. To examine the effect of both the sample size and the number of measurement <b>occasions,</b> sample sizes of n = 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 were considered as well as measurement <b>occasions</b> of m = 3, 6, and 9. With respect to rANOVA, the results plead for a use of rANOVA with Huynh-Feldt-correction, especially when the sphericity assumption is violated, the sample size is rather small and the number of measurement <b>occasions</b> is large. For MLM-UN, the results illustrate a massive progressive bias for small sample sizes (n = 20) and m = 6 or more measurement <b>occasions.</b> This effect could not be found in previous simulation studies with a smaller number of measurement <b>occasions.</b> The proportionality of bias and number of measurement <b>occasions</b> should be considered when MLM-UN is used. The good news is that this proportionality can be compensated by means of large sample sizes. Accordingly, MLM-UN can be recommended even for small sample sizes for about three measurement <b>occasions</b> and for large sample sizes for about nine measurement <b>occasions...</b>|$|R
