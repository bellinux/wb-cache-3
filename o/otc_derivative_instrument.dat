5000|$|In their 2000 {{paper by}} Schinasi et al. {{published}} by the International Monetary Fund in 2001, the authors observed {{that the increase in}} <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> transactions would have been impossible [...] "without the dramatic advances in information and computer technologies" [...] that occurred from 1980 to 2000. During that time, major internationally active financial institutions significantly increased the share of their earnings from derivatives activities. These institutions manage portfolios of derivatives involving tens of thousands of positions and aggregate global turnover over $1 trillion. At that time prior to the financial crisis of 2008, the OTC market was an informal network of bilateral counterparty relationships and dynamic, time-varying credit exposures whose size and distribution tied to important asset markets. International financial institutions increasingly nurtured the ability to profit from <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> activities and financial markets participants benefitted from them. In 2000 the authors acknowledged that the growth in OTC transactions [...] "in many ways made possible, the modernization of commercial and investment banking and the globalization of finance." [...] However, in September, an IMF team led by Mathieson and Schinasi cautioned that [...] "episodes of turbulence" [...] in the late 1990s [...] "revealed the risks posed to market stability originated in features of <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> <b>instruments</b> and markets.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} whether the regulatory measures on over the counter (<b>OTC)</b> <b>derivatives</b> under Article VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 2010 (Dodd-Frank), introduced in the United States of America are able to address the problems posed by the said <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> <b>instruments.</b> The financial <b>instruments</b> engineered by <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> prior to the financial crisis of 2008 were and are still widely deployed for the purported purpose of hedging against risk. Examples of such risks are: fluctuation in currency rates or commodity prices or default risk in loans payment. However, such financial instruments are also employed for speculation on the fluctuation of the currency rates or the commodity prices or any other indices in the financial market. Its purpose is for higher financial yield. It is this latter aspect of the trade that <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> are more popular than exchange traded (ET) derivatives because the former is not subjected to regulatory control. They are therefore more flexible and tailored to the needs of the customers. And the costs of entering into <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> are less than ET derivatives because the latter are subjected to administrative and margins costs imposed by the exchanges. The popularity of the <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> market with the investors and speculators coupled with increasing new financial products - embedded with <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> elements, resulted in <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> to be traded at a phenomenally high level at the time of the crisis. According to Bruce Carruthers, in the United States, in 1986 the total value of ET derivatives was more than <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives.</b> By 2008 the total value of <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> had become ten times greater than the ET derivatives even though the latter had increased by one hundred fold. Lynn Stout provided the numbers in the growth of <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> as follows: according to the Bank for International Settlements, at the end of 1999 the total notional value of <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> was approximately US$ 88 trillion. By 2008 the OTC market value had a value of about US$ 600 trillion. Major financial institutions and banks held a disproportionate amount of such instruments and their value could not be determined. They became a liability as opposed to instruments which provide insurance to risk.

5000|$|Born was {{appointed}} to the CFTC on April 15, 1994 by President Bill Clinton. Due to litigation against Bankers Trust Company by Procter and Gamble and other corporate clients, Born and her team at the CFTC sought comments on the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, a first step in the process of writing CFTC regulations to supplement the existing regulations of the Federal Reserve System, the Options Clearing Corporation, and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Born was particularly concerned about swaps, financial instruments that are traded over the counter between banks, insurance companies or other funds or companies, and thus have no transparency except to the two counterparties and the counterparties' regulators, if any. CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers. On May 7, 1998, former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt joined Rubin and Greenspan in objecting to the issuance of the CFTC’s concept release. Their response dismissed Born's analysis and focused on the hypothetical possibility that CFTC regulation of swaps and other <b>OTC</b> <b>derivative</b> <b>instruments</b> could create a [...] "legal uncertainty" [...] regarding such financial instruments, hypothetically reducing the value of the instruments. They argued that the imposition of regulatory costs would [...] "stifle financial innovation" [...] and encourage financial capital to transfer its transactions offshore. The disagreement between Born and the Executive Office's top economic policy advisors has been described not only as a classic Washington turf war, but also a war of ideologies, [...] insofar as it is possible to argue that Born's actions were consistent with Keynesian and neoclassical economics while Greenspan, Rubin, Levitt, and Summers consistently espoused neoliberal, and neoconservative policies.|$|R

40|$|Since their {{inception}} {{in the late}} 1970 s, <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> have fundamentally changed financing practices in the world. As many Asian "developing" markets like Korea have noticed the advantages of <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives,</b> {{they have begun to}} permit those transactions, at least since the late 1980 s. For these latecomers, issues familiar in other "developed" markets have often recurred, and regulators must fix the extent of a proper regulatory approach within their own regulatory traditions. As a general principle, for the proper appreciation of <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> from a legal perspective, it is crucial to understand two overlapping areas: (1) the relationship between the form and economic substance of each product, and (2) the link between <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> and "hedged transactions" or "economic positions" of the users. Misunderstanding these critical features leads to overlooking the evolving nature of derivatives in general and overemphasising the risk of <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> in particular. This Study proposes flexibility and creativity, stability, and global harmonisation as the three pillars of a viable legal framework for <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives.</b> Firstly, since <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> exist for their flexibility and creativity in dealing with the particular needs of market participants, legal systems should meet such market needs. Secondly, as <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives</b> have given rise to substantial concerns about systemic failure, the legal system is responsible for ensuring the availability of contractual devices designed by market participants to protect themselves and (collectively) the financial system itself. Thirdly, any legal response to these products in each jurisdiction should be consistent with that of other jurisdictions. Against this background, this Study concludes that there still remains considerable uncertainty in several areas of the Korean law as it tries to deal with legal issues inherent in <b>OTC</b> <b>derivatives.</b> This Study proposes legislative reform as the best method to reduce such legal uncertainty. This conclusion can also be true of any new financial products in any developing or underdeveloped markets. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

The main attraction of the central clearing proposals is that they will make positions in standardised derivatives more transparent.
