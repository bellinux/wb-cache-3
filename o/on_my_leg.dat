5|$|Sheindlin has {{authored}} seven books. In 1995, Judge Sheindlin published {{her first}} book, “Don’t Pee <b>On</b> <b>My</b> <b>Leg</b> and Tell Me It’s Raining,” {{in which she}} offers her insight into {{how and why the}} family court fails in its mission to impact shattered families. “Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever,” her second book, was published in January 1999. A New York Times best seller, the book challenges women to be the best they can be.|$|E
5|$|In February 1993, Sheindlin's outspoken {{reputation}} {{made her}} {{the subject of a}} Los Angeles Times article, profiling her as a woman determined to make the court system work for the common good. She subsequently was featured in a segment on CBS's 60 Minutes, bringing her national recognition. This led to her first book, Don't Pee <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Leg</b> and Tell Me It's Raining, published in 1996. She retired as a family court judge that same year after hearing over 20,000 cases. After her retirement, Sheindlin continued to receive increasing amounts of public attention.|$|E
500|$|After the 60 Minutes {{special on}} her family court career in 1993 and {{authoring}} {{her first book}} shortly thereafter (Don't Pee <b>on</b> <b>My</b> <b>Leg</b> and Tell Me It's Raining), Sheindlin was approached about starring in a new reality courtroom series, featuring [...] "real cases with real rulings." [...] She accepted the offer.|$|E
25|$|Mike Bore: If it was pitched on the off stump, I thought, I'll hit it straight. If it's <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> I'll sweep it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Me stop in? When I can't stand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> perhaps I {{shall have}} a chance.' The young man spoke huskily. He {{had a slight}} Scotch accent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Me! {{going to}} America on an airship! After that balloon! 'Ere! I say--I don't want to go! I {{want to walk}} about <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs.</b> Let me get out! I didn't understand." ...|$|R
500|$|What I went through, only I {{will ever}} know. My knee cap {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I think I've got {{a bullet}} crease <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg.</b> I didn't know I had it till now.... It's bleedin' a little. But it's nothin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can prove}} it," [...] said Mr. Davis, fixing {{her with a}} {{glittering}} eye. [...] "Do you remember the serpent I 'ad tattooed <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> for a garter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, catch hold of me, old woman," [...] cried Rooney, {{putting an}} arm round the poor creature's waist; [...] "sit <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs.</b> They'll act {{something}} like a buffer to your old bones." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{never can}} be what I was. I feel about sixty, and don't care for {{anything}} now I've got here. Let me stay till I'm <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> then I'll clear out and never trouble you any more,' said Dan despondently.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{much prefer}} that she should, for then I {{could get up}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> and answer her off the reel." [...] Of course {{everybody}} there understood what she meant,--including old John Bates, who stood at the sideboard and coolly drank the toast himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you could}} ease the {{pressure}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> [...] . . . steady, now! steady! [...] . . . Can you sit {{up in the}} saddle? [...] . . . Are you hurt? [...] . . ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's a nasty rip <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> and my arm feels mighty sore, but that's all the damage. Seems to me I haven't much to {{complain}} of, considering how far I fell." ...|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. (Desperately {{looking at}} his watch.) With a knife. I came down--old Van Loo did, that's to say--and fell <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> so I couldn't run. And then this man came up and began {{chopping}} at me as I sprawled.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I guess I may as well, and get quite firm <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> before I start. Another {{week or so}} {{will bring}} me up if I study hard, so I shall not lose my time. I'll tackle my Latin as soon as it's ready, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But how did {{you lose}} your scalp?" [...] asked Zack--"tell us all about it. Upon my life, you're the most {{interesting}} fellow I ever met with! And, I say, let's walk about, while we talk. I feel steadier <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> now; and it's so infernally cold standing here." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "For {{three long}} years I was beastly treated, heavy irons <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> I wore,My back from {{flogging}} it was lacerated, and often painted with crimson gore,And many a lad from downright starvation lies mouldering humbly beneath the clay,Where Captain Logan he had us mangled on his triangles at Moreton Bay.|$|R
6000|$|... "Over the wall, {{the moment}} the Prior's back was turned. I {{was not going to}} wait till I was chained up in some rat's-hole with a half-hundred of iron <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> and flogged till I confessed that I was what I am not,--a runaway monk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} cross Solomon's Mountains {{nearly two years}} ago," [...] was the answer, spoken in the hesitating voice {{of a man who}} has had little recent {{opportunity}} of using his tongue, [...] "but when I reached here a boulder fell <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> and crushed it, and I have been able to go neither forward nor back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all that}} {{happened}} to me, sir. The old man'd had a fox-terrier like yours. And after the old man passed out the puppy got real, chummy with me. Just as I was making the hoist of the last sling-load, what does the puppy do but jump <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> and sniff my hand. I turned to pat him, and the next I knew my other hand had slipped into the gears and that finger wasn't there any more.|$|E
6000|$|Of my {{own accord}} I {{could not have}} stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great girls who sit {{on each side of}} me, set me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently {{assisted}} me to his very feet, and I caught her whispered counsel-- ...|$|R
60|$|It's {{so serious}} that I can't help {{thinking}} something will happen. Whenever I've {{got in a}} really tight fix something has turned up and put me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> again. Last time, Aunt Elizabeth had an apoplectic fit. But of course it wasn't really very profitable because mourning is so desperately expensive.|$|R
2500|$|... killed instantly, others fatally wounded. I felt a blow <b>on</b> <b>my</b> left <b>leg</b> {{like someone}} ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I'm Brass's clerk, am I?' said Dick. 'Brass's clerk, eh? And {{the clerk}} of Brass's sister--clerk {{to a female}} Dragon. Very good, very good! What shall I be next? Shall I be a convict in a felt hat and a grey suit, {{trotting}} about a dockyard with my number neatly embroidered on my uniform, and {{the order of the}} garter <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> restrained from chafing my ankle by a twisted belcher handkerchief? Shall I be that? Will that do, or is it too genteel? Whatever you please, have it your own way, of course.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I will." [...] And, arming {{himself with}} a few slices of Bologna in case his {{appetite}} should {{get the best of}} him, Carrots began the story. [...] "That man was sweeter than pie all the time I was ridin' home with him, an' you'd thought he loved me 'most to death till we got to the farm. Then I helped unharness them plaguy old mules, an' one of 'em fetched me a kick with his heels that left a black-an'-blue spot <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> bigger'n the whole front of the City Hall. I up with a club, an' was goin' to knock the life out er him; but the farmer caught me by the collar, an' shook me till I thought my head would fly off." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{that night}} wasn't wasted. I had my {{pedometer}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg.</b> Twichell and I {{were in a}} pedometer match. Twichell had longer legs than I. The only way I could keep up was to wear my pedometer to bed. I always walk in my sleep, and on this occasion I gained sixteen miles on him. After all, I never found that sock. I never have seen it from that day to this. But that adventure taught {{me what it is}} to be blind. That was one of the most serious occasions of my whole life, yet I never can speak of it without somebody thinking it isn't serious. You try it and see how serious it is to be as the blind are and I was that night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Four times, and lay {{each time}} for {{an hour in the}} blankets. I feel very weak, and must have lost very many pounds in weight, but my head is clear, and I suffer no pain whatever. The marks <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> have not spread, and seem to me less dark in colour than they were." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of my doleful dumps, some one tapped me on the shoulder, and looking up I saw a couple of rough sturdy fellows {{standing}} behind me. Not knowing what to expect I jumped <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> and was preparing again to make battle; but I was tripped up and secured in a twinkling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, madam, I {{went up to}} {{the castle}} to see the steward, and Mr. Martin just {{mentioned}} my loss to Lord Pendennyss, ma'am, and my lord ordered me this cart, ma'am, and this noble horse, and twenty golden guineas into the bargain to put me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> again--God bless him for it, for ever!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{a slender}} chance," [...] he told her, [...] "but I {{employed}} it. I waited in London, in hiding, close upon a fortnight ere I {{had an opportunity}} of seeing Sunderland. He laughed me to scorn at first, and threatened me with the Tower. But I told him the letter was in safe hands and would remain there in earnest of his good behaviour, and that did he have me arrested it would instantly be laid before the King and bring his own head to the block more surely even than my own. It frightened him; but it had scarcely done so, sweet, had he known that that precious letter was still in my boot, for my boot was <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg,</b> and my leg {{was in the room}} with the rest of me.|$|E
6000|$|Having {{experienced}} {{five months}} of this war, I became infected with fever and a strong coldness of the stomach [rupture]. The doctor ordered {{me out of it}} altogether. They have also cut me with knives for a wound <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg.</b> It is now healed but the strength is gone, and it is very frightened of the ground. I have been in many hospitals for a long time. At this present I am living in a hospital for Indian troops in a forest-reservation called [...] "New," [...] which was established by a King's order in ages past. There is no order for my return to India. I do not desire it. My Regiment has now gone out of France--to Egypt, or Africa. My officer Sahibs are for the most part dead or in hospitals. During a railway journey when two people sit side by side for two hours one feels the absence of the other when he alights. How great then was my anguish at being severed from my Regiment after thirty-three years! Now, however, I am finished. If I return to India I cannot drill the new men between my two crutches. I should subsist in my village on my wound-pension among old and young who have never seen war. Here I have great consideration. Though I am useless they are patient with me.|$|E
5000|$|During a {{town hall}} meeting in 2009, a {{constituent}} who opposed President Barack Obama's health care plan told Stark, [...] "Mr. Congressman, don't pee <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>leg</b> and tell me it's raining." [...] Stark responded with, [...] "I wouldn't dignify you by peeing on your leg. It wouldn't be worth wasting the urine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{very hard}} on a fellow like me; I have nobody to say a kind word to me; no, not one." [...] And Sir Louis, in his wretchedness, began to weep. [...] "Come, doctor; if you'll put me once more <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs,</b> I'll let you draw on the estate for five hundred pounds; by G----, I will." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am getting}} all right again. I {{have not been}} well, been very low, and have been obliged to have a doctor; a very {{agreeable}} fellow indeed, who soon {{turned out to be}} an old friend of Olliffe's.[19] He has set me <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> and taken his leave [...] "professionally," [...] though he means to give me a call now and then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye," [...] {{replied the}} other gruffly. [...] "At least I am Rolf. Men choose {{to call me}} Ganger because I prefer to gang <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>legs</b> rather than gang on the legs of a horse. They say it is because no horse can carry me; but thou seest {{that that is a}} lie, for I am not much heavier than thyself." ...|$|R
