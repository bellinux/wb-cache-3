5|$|Human {{activities}} have affected stocks of {{many species of}} teleost, through overfishing, pollution and global warming. Among many recorded instances, overfishing caused the complete collapse of the Atlantic cod population off Newfoundland in 1992, leading to Canada's indefinite closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishery.</b> Pollution, especially in rivers and along coasts, has harmed teleosts as sewage, pesticides and herbicides have entered the water. Many pollutants, such as heavy metals, organochlorines, and carbamates interfere with teleost reproduction, often by disrupting their endocrine systems. In the roach, river pollution has caused the intersex condition, in which an individual's gonads contain both cells that can make male gametes (such as spermatogonia) and cells that can make female gametes (such as oogonia). Since endocrine disruption also affects humans, teleosts are used to indicate the presence of such chemicals in water. Water pollution caused local extinction of teleost populations in many northern European lakes {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century.|$|E
25|$|Economic or bioeconomic {{overfishing}} additionally {{considers the}} cost of fishing when determining acceptable catches. Under this framework, a fishery {{is considered to be}} overfished when catches exceed maximum economic yield where resource rent is at its maximum. Fish are being removed from the fishery so quickly that the profitability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> is sub-optimal. A more dynamic definition of economic overfishing also considers the present value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> using a relevant discount rate to maximise the flow of resource rent over all future catches.|$|E

25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{recreational}} blue crab fishery in the Gulf of Mexico is not well known. Commercial crabbing was first reported in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1880s. Early crab fishermen used long-handled dip nets and drop nets among other simple fishing gear types to trap crabs at night. Blue crab spoiled quickly, which limited distribution and hindered the growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> for several decades. The first commercial processing plant in Louisiana opened in Morgan City in 1924. Other plants opened soon after, although commercial processing of hard blue crabs was not widespread until World War II.|$|E

25|$|Iran has 1,786 {{kilometers}} of coastline on the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. These southern waters {{are rich in}} fish and other marine resources.

25|$|The yellowfin whiting is a schools species, {{with its}} {{movements}} highly controlled by tidal phases, with the species often moving over shallow sand banks {{with the rising}} tide. Where it occurs with other species of sillaginids, it is unique in that it remains in the shallow protected inshore waters, while other species move offshore as they grow. This is likely a response to reduce interspecific competition between sillaginids. The dietary and reproductive biology of the yellowfin whiting has been extensively studied in Western and South Australia, where it comprises a major part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishery.</b> As {{with a number of}} other sillaginids, the species has been recorded 'burrowing' in the substrate to avoid predators.|$|E

However, much of the province's natural resources were already controlled by outside interests.

25|$|The Queensland fishery {{originated}} in 1981, after a single operator began targeting eastern school whiting, S. flindersi. It was {{soon discovered that}} stout whiting were highly abundant in the surrounding region and the fishery began to shift towards the species. The original operator who realised the potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> continued after the market took a downfall, upgrading equipment with a new snap freezing facility, which became essential for exporting the fish. There was a rapid expansion in the fishery between 1989 and 1990, with 10 operators recording a 1789 tonne haul in 1990. In 1991 the market once again took a downfall due to low demand, and the fishery is now closely monitored by fishery authorities, with a 1000 tonne limit on the total yearly catch in place since 2000. This limit includes the fish taken as bycatch in other fisheries such as prawn trawling, which means often a sizable amount must be discarded.|$|E
25|$|Management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fishery</b> is by {{consensus}} of all management agencies {{with an interest}} in the resource and include the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and the province of Ontario, and work under the mandate of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The commission makes assessments using sophisticated mathematical modeling systems. The Commission {{has been the focus of}} considerable recrimination, primarily from angler and charter fishing groups in the U.S. which have had a historical antipathy to commercial fishing interests. This conflict is complex, dating from the 1960s and earlier, with the result in the United States that, in 2011, commercial fishing was mostly eliminated from Great Lakes states. One report suggests that battling between diverse fishing interests began around Lake Michigan and evolved to cover the entire Great Lakes region. The analysis suggests that in the Lake Erie context, the competition between sport and commercial fishing involves universals and that these conflicts are cultural, not scientific, and therefore not resolvable by reference to ecological data.|$|E
