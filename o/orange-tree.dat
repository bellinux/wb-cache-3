60|$|There was a neatly-dressed young woman, with {{a little}} flower-pot in her hand, {{standing}} near him, waiting for her turn. There was a small <b>orange-tree</b> in her flower-pot. It was about six inches high. The sight of this <b>orange-tree</b> interested Marco very much, for {{it reminded him of}} home. He had often seen orange-trees growing in the parlors and green-houses in New York.|$|E
6000|$|... "What caitiff has dared!" [...] he exclaimed, {{when his}} hat was knocked {{off by a}} well-aimed orange from a {{neighbouring}} <b>orange-tree,</b> and a vulgar voice squeaked: ...|$|E
6000|$|Wherewith {{the friends}} fell into {{conversation}} more immediately interesting to themselves, {{while at the}} other end of the court, sheltered by a great <b>orange-tree,</b> a committee of the [...] "Traveller's Joy" [...] was held.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} slipped {{his arm around}} the young diplomatist's waist, and they walked on in decorous silence under the <b>orange-trees.</b>|$|R
60|$|Sometimes I {{glanced at}} the newspaper; {{sometimes}} I {{looked out at the}} pleasant Southern garden, where the fountain flashed and fell among weeping willows, and laurels, <b>orange-trees,</b> and myrtles.|$|R
6000|$|... "You will be apt to find Dr. Gregg at the hotel," [...] {{said the}} consul. [...] "You {{can see it}} from the door--it's that two-story {{building}} with the balcony, where the <b>orange-trees</b> are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor Allen," [...] echoed {{one or two}} voices, in {{the same}} low tone, for as they peeped out beyond the <b>orange-tree,</b> Allen might be seen, {{extended}} on a many-coloured rug, in an exceedingly deplorable attitude.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And if ill report should come, Stephen,' {{she said}} smiling, 'why, the <b>orange-tree</b> must save me, as it saved virgins in St. George's {{time from the}} {{poisonous}} breath of the dragon. There, forgive me for forwardness: I am going.' ...|$|E
60|$|But they cannot {{tell you}} in Coralio (as you shall learn) what became {{of the money that}} Frank Goodwin dropped into the <b>orange-tree.</b> But that shall come later; for the palms are {{fluttering}} in the breeze, bidding us to sport and gaiety.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wrenn's fancy {{was walking}} down a green lane of old France toward a white cottage with <b>orange-trees</b> gleaming against its walls. In her {{pictures}} {{he had found the}} land of all his forsaken dreams.|$|R
60|$|Smith looked business, {{but he was}} no advertiser. He commented {{upon the}} scenery, {{remarking}} upon its fidelity to the pictures in the geography; and then inquired for the United States consul. Goodwin pointed out the starred-and-striped bunting hanging above the little consulate, which was concealed behind the <b>orange-trees.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{they entered}} a patio, or courtyard, where some <b>orange-trees</b> grew round a {{fountain}} of water, and a life-sized crucifix stood against the wall. As he passed this sacred emblem Peter bowed and crossed himself, an example that Castell did not follow. The priest looked at him sharply.|$|R
6000|$|ABSOLUTE It is but too true, indeed, ma'am;--yet I fear our ladies {{should share}} the blame--they think our admiration of beauty so great, that {{knowledge}} in {{them would be}} superfluous. Thus, like garden-trees, they seldom show fruit, till time has robbed them of the more specious blossom.--Few, like Mrs. Malaprop and the <b>orange-tree,</b> are rich in both at once! ...|$|E
60|$|Bessie, on the verandah, noted {{all this}} going on, {{every now and}} again {{catching}} snatches of the lazy rascals' talk, which chimed in but too sadly with her own thoughts. Turning from them impatiently, she began to watch the hens marching solemnly about the drive, followed by their broods. This picture, also, had a sanguinary background, for under an <b>orange-tree</b> two rival cocks were fighting furiously. They always did this about once a week, nor did they cease from troubling till each retired, temporarily blinded, to the shade of a separate <b>orange-tree,</b> where they {{spent the rest of the}} week in recovering, only to emerge when the cure was effected and fight their battle over again. Meanwhile, a third cock, young in years but old in wisdom, who steadily refused to retaliate when attacked, looked after the hens in dispute. To-day the fray was particularly ferocious, and, fearing that the combatants would have no eyes left at all if she did not interfere, Bessie called to the old Boer hound who was lying in the sun on the verandah.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the summer}} heat, Jaffier Ali pitched a tent {{for him in}} a garden outside the walls of Shiraz, where he worked with much enjoyment, [...] "living among {{clusters}} of grapes, {{by the side of}} a clear stream," [...] and sitting under the shade of an <b>orange-tree.</b> From thence he made an expedition to see the ruins of Persepolis, greatly to the perplexity of his escort, who, after repeatedly telling him that the place was uninhabited, concluded that he had come thither to drink brandy in secret! ...|$|E
60|$|Presently he {{observed}} Jantje sneaking about between the <b>orange-trees</b> {{as though he}} wished {{to call attention to}} himself. Had he not wanted to do so he would have moved {{from one to the other}} in such a way that nobody could have seen him. His partial and desultory appearances indicated that he was on view.|$|R
6000|$|In the court-yard a {{fountain}} leaped alway, [...] A Triton blowing jewels through his shell [...] Into the sunshine; Mordred turned away, [...] Weary because the stone face {{did not tell}} [...] Of weariness, nor could he bear to-day, [...] Heartsick, to hear the patient sink and swell [...] Of winds among the leaves, or golden bees [...] Drowsily humming in the <b>orange-trees.</b>|$|R
60|$|Not far off was an {{extensive}} grove of <b>orange-trees</b> in full bearing; and myself and another {{were selected to}} go with him, and gather a supply for the party. When we went in among the trees, the sumptuousness of the orchard was unlike anything I had ever seen; while the fragrance shaken from the gently waving boughs regaled our senses most delightfully.|$|R

60|$|But {{there was}} an alarm outside. The barber, Esteb√°n, {{at the sound of}} the shot, had raised his voice; and the shot itself had aroused half the town. A pattering of feet came up the street, and {{official}} orders rang out on the still air. Goodwin had a duty to perform. Circumstances had made him the custodian of his adopted country's treasure. Swiftly cramming the money into the valise, he closed it, leaned far out of the window and dropped it into a thick <b>orange-tree</b> in the little inclosure below.|$|E
60|$|While {{she still}} hesitated, the two Boers, under whose watch and ward Muller had placed her uncle, {{advanced}} and stood {{between him and}} her, cutting her off from him. Muller turned and walked a few paces--ten or so--to the right, and in desperation she followed him. He halted behind a bushy <b>orange-tree</b> of some eight years' growth. Overtaking him, she stood silent, {{waiting for him to}} begin. They were quite close to the others, but the roaring of the flames of the burning house was still sufficiently loud to have drowned a much more audible conversation.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Tom was a {{great deal}} in Eva's room. She used to get very restless, and then she liked to be carried about. He was so big and strong that he could do it very easily. He would walk about with her under the <b>orange-trees</b> in the garden, or sitting down on some of their old seats, would sing their {{favorite}} hymns.|$|R
60|$|I {{had felt}} that the air was growing hotter and hotter; but nobody seemed to notice it until the moon went out and a burning hot wind began lashing the <b>orange-trees</b> with a sound like {{the noise of the}} sea. Before we knew where we were, the dust-storm was on us, and {{everything}} was roaring, whirling darkness. The supper-table was blown bodily into the tank. We were afraid of staying anywhere near the old tomb for fear it might be blown down. So we felt our way to the <b>orange-trees</b> where the horses were picketed and waited for the storm to blow over. Then the little light that was left vanished, and you could not see your hand before your face. The air was heavy with dust and sand from the bed of the river, that filled boots and pockets and drifted down necks and coated eyebrows and moustaches. It {{was one of the worst}} dust-storms of the year.|$|R
60|$|There are <b>orange-trees</b> {{laden with}} fruit: who knows not them? and that awkward-boughed tree, with huge green fruit, and deeply-cut leaves {{a foot or}} more across--leaves so grand that, {{as one of our}} party often suggested, their form ought to be {{introduced}} into architectural ornamentation, and {{to take the place of}} the Greek acanthus, which they surpass in beauty--that is, of course, a Bread- fruit tree.|$|R
6000|$|Little as Mrs. Langford was wont {{to allow}} {{herself to be}} assisted, she was gratified with the obliging offer, and Henrietta had carried the myrtle, the old-fashioned oak-leaved geranium, with its {{fragrant}} deeply-indented leaves, a grim-looking cactus, {{and two or three}} more, and was deep in the story of the <b>orange-tree,</b> the pip of which had been planted by Uncle Geoffrey at five years old, but which never seemed likely to grow beyond the size of a tolerable currant-bush, when Beatrice came down and beheld her with consternation--"Henrietta! Henrietta! what are you about?" [...] cried she, breaking full into the story. [...] "Do make haste." ...|$|E
6000|$|March 15th.--This morning I {{went with}} my wife and Miss Hoar to Miss Hosmer's studio, to see her statue of Zenobia. We found her in her premises, {{springing}} about with a bird-like action. She has a lofty room, with a skylight window; it was pretty well warmed with a stove, and there was a small <b>orange-tree</b> in a pot, with the oranges growing on it, and two or three flower-shrubs in bloom. She herself looked prettily, with her jaunty little velvet cap on the side of her head, whence came clustering out, her short brown curls; her face full of pleasant life and quick expression; and though somewhat worn with thought and struggle, handsome and spirited. She told us that [...] "her wig was growing as gray as a rat." ...|$|E
60|$|That season's wheat is long garnered, Pierre; that season's ripe {{apples and}} grapes are in; no crop, no plant, no fruit is out; the whole harvest is done. Oh, woe to that belated winter-overtaken plant, which the summer {{could not bring}} to maturity! The {{drifting}} winter snows shall whelm it. Think, Pierre, doth not thy plant belong to some other and tropical clime? Though transplanted to northern Maine, the <b>orange-tree</b> of the Floridas will put forth leaves in that parsimonious summer, and show some few tokens of fruitage; yet November will find no golden globes thereon; and the passionate old lumber-man, December, shall peel the whole tree, wrench it off at the ground, and toss it for a fagot to some lime-kiln. Ah, Pierre, Pierre, make haste! make haste! force thy fruitage, lest the winter force thee.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then my {{humble and}} {{pressing}} entreaty is the more,' said Flora, 'that in travelling back {{you will have}} the kindness to look for this foreign gentleman along all the roads {{and up and down}} all the turnings and to make inquiries for him at all the hotels and <b>orange-trees</b> and vineyards and volcanoes and places for he must be somewhere and why doesn't he come forward and say he's there and clear all parties up?' ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{were many}} plants, {{and as the}} amateur {{gardener}} fetched all {{the water from the}} well in the court, with his own active hands, his work spun on to some length. The great school-clock ticked on. Another hour struck. The carr√© and the youthful group lost the illusion of sunset. Day was drooping. My lesson, I perceived, must to-night be very short; but the <b>orange-trees,</b> the cacti, the camelias were all served now. Was it my turn? ...|$|R
6000|$|KING. [...] "'Ah, to whom do {{you tell}} that! Have not I tried to plant, sow, till, dig, with the GEORGICS in my hand? [...] "But, Monsieur," [...] said my man, [...] "you are a fool (BETE), and your Book no less; {{it is not in}} that way one goes to work." [...] Ah, MON DIEU, what a climate! Would you believe it, Heaven, or the Sun, refuse me everything? Look at my poor <b>orange-trees,</b> my olive-trees, lemon-trees: they are all starving.' ...|$|R
60|$|After dinner, we find at {{the door}} of the hotel an English {{architect}} whom we know, and we take a boat together for a moonlight row upon the lake, and voyage far up the placid water through air that bathes our heated senses like dew. How far we have left Milan behind! On the lake lies the moon, but the hills are held by mysterious shadows, which for the time are as substantial to us as the hills themselves. Hints of habitation appear in the twinkling lights along the water's edge, and we suspect an alabaster lamp in every casement, and in every invisible house a villa such as Claude Melnotte described to Pauline,--and some one mouths that well-worn fustian. The rags of sentimentality flutter from every crag and olive-tree and <b>orange-tree</b> in all Italy--like the wilted paper collars which vulgar tourists leave by our own mountains and streams, to commemorate their enjoyment of the landscape.|$|E
60|$|Dane swung {{himself from}} the saddle before a door ornamented by a {{beautiful}} bronze bell handle, and spent two minutes pulling the bell vigorously. There was no answer nor any sound within, and remembering {{that it did not}} necessarily follow that the handle had a wire attached, he stepped back into the roadway and flung himself against the barrier. A hasp of some kind yielded, and he staggered forward into the garden. The sun was dipping behind the cordillera, but its red light beat into his eyes, and at first he could see only a row of crimson oleanders stretching away before him. Their fragrance and the scent of heliotrope was heavy within his nostrils. Passing through the shadow of an <b>orange-tree</b> he made out a white wall garlanded by blue bougainvillea, and halted at the sound of a startled voice as his eyes fell upon the group on the terrace beneath it.|$|E
6000|$|We rode on, {{sick and}} sorry, to find {{unexpected}} relief. We entered a clearing, with Bananas and Tanias, Cacao and Bois Immortelle, and better still, Avocado pears and <b>orange-tree,</b> with fruit. A tall and stately dame was there; her only garment a long cotton-print gown, which covered her tall figure from throat to ankle and wrist, showing brown feet and hands {{which had once}} been delicate, and a brown face, half Spanish, half Indian, modest and serious enough. [...] We pointed to a tall <b>orange-tree</b> overhead, laden with fruit of every hue from bright green to gold. She, on being appealed to in Spanish, answered with a courteous smile, and then a piercing scream of--'Candelaria, come hither, and get oranges for the Governor and other senors!' Candelaria, {{who might have been}} eighteen or twenty, came sliding down under the Banana-leaves, all modest smiles, and blushes through her whity-brown skin. But having no more clothes on than her mother, she naturally hesitated at climbing the tree; and after ineffectual attempts to knock down oranges with a bamboo, screamed in her turn for some Jose or Juan. Jose or Juan made his appearance, in a ragged shirt. A lanky lad, about seventeen years old, he was evidently the oaf or hobbedehoy of the family, just as he would have been {{on this side of the}} sea; was treated as such; and was accustomed to be so treated. In a tone of angry contempt (the poor boy had done and said nothing) the two women hounded him up the tree. He obeyed in meek resignation, and in a couple of minutes we had more oranges than we could eat. And such oranges: golden- green, but rather more green than gold, which cannot be (as at home) bitten or sucked; for so strong is the fragrant essential oil in the skin, that it would blister the lips and disorder the stomach; and the orange must be carefully stripped of the outer coat before you attack a pulp compared with which, for flavour, the orange of our shops is but bad sugar and water.|$|E
60|$|His {{face was}} white and drawn. As Miss Copleigh and I limped up, he came forward to meet us, and, when he helped her down from her saddle, he kissed her before all the picnic. It was like a scene in a theatre, and the {{likeness}} was heightened by all the dust-white, ghostly-looking men and women under the <b>orange-trees,</b> clapping their hands, {{as if they were}} watching a play--at Saumarez's choice. I never knew anything so un-English in my life.|$|R
60|$|They {{moved out}} of the open to one of the terraces, where a pergola of <b>orange-trees</b> {{provided}} a shaded sauntering space that was at once cool and fragrant. As they went, he considered her admiringly, and marvelled at himself that it should have taken him so long fully to realize her slim, unusual grace, and to find her, as he now did, so entirely desirable, a woman whose charm must irradiate all the life of a man, and touch its commonplaces into magic.|$|R
