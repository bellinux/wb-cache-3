The resistance of rice to ozone is a quantitative trait controlled by nuclear genes [27]. The identification of QTLs and the analysis of molecular markers of <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> are important steps in increasing the resistance of rice to ozone stress. Kim et al. [27] reported that QTLs associated with the <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> of rice were mapped on chromosomes by using recombinant inbred lines from a cross between “Milyang 23 ” and “Gihobyeo”, and QTLs were tightly linked to three markers. The association between these markers and <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> in rice cultivars and doubled haploid populations was analyzed. The markers permit the screening of the rice germplasm for <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> {{and the introduction of}} resistance into elite lines in breeding programs.

40|$|Potatoes are an {{important}} staple crop, grown {{in many parts of}} the world. Although ozone deposition to many vegetation types has been measured in the field, no data have been reported for potatoes. Such measurements, including the latent-heat flux, were made over a fully grown potato field in central Scotland during the summer of 2006, covering a 4 -week period just after rainfall and then dry, sunny weather. The magnitude of the flux was typical of many canopies showing the expected diurnal cycles. Although the bulk-canopy stomatal conductance declined as the field dried out (~ 300  mmol-O 3  m- 2  s- 1 to ~ 70  mmol-O 3  m- 2  s- 1), the total ozone flux did not follow the same trend, indicating that non-stomatal deposition was significant. Over a dry surface non-stomatal resistance (Rns) was 270 - 450  s m- 1, while over a wet surface Rns was ~ 50 % smaller and both decreased with increasing surface temperature and friction velocity. From the variation with relative humidity (RH) it is suggested that three processes occur on leaf surfaces: on a very dry surface ozone is removed by thermal decomposition, possibly enhanced by photolytic reactions in the daytime and so Rns decreases as temperature increases; at 50 - 70 % RH a thin film of liquid blocks the "dry" process and resistance increases; above 60 - 70 % RH sufficient surface water is present for aqueous reactions to remove <b>ozone</b> and <b>resistance</b> decreases...|$|R
40|$|Ozone is a toxic air {{pollutant}} that can damage plant leaves and substantially affect the plant’s {{gross primary production}} (GPP) and health. Realistic estimates {{of the effects of}} tropospheric anthropogenic ozone on GPP are thus potentially important to assess the strength of the terrestrial biosphere as a carbon sink. To better understand the impact of ozone damage on the terrestrial carbon cycle, we developed a module to estimate ozone uptake and damage of plants for {{the state of the art}} global terrestrial biosphere model OCN. Our approach accounts for ozone damage by calculating (a) ozone transport from the free troposphere to leaf level, (b) ozone flux into the leaf, and (c) ozone damage of photosynthesis as a function of the accumulated ozone uptake over the life-time of a leaf. A comparison of modelled canopy conductance, GPP, and latent heat to FLUXNET data across European forest and grassland sites shows a general good performance of OCN. In comparison to literature values, we demonstrate that the new model version produces realistic stomatal flux ratios as well as <b>ozone</b> surface <b>resistances</b> and depo- sition velocities. A sensitivity study reveals that key metrics of the air-to-leaf ozone transport and ozone deposition, in particular the stomatal ozone update are reason- ably robust against uncertainty in the underlying parameterisation of the deposition scheme. Correctly estimating canopy conductance plays a pivotal role in the estimate of cumulative ozone uptake. When applied at the European scale, we find that the added complexity of the ozone uptake simulation substantially affects simulated ozone uptake and accumulation, be- cause aerodynamic <b>resistance</b> and non-stomatal <b>ozone</b> destruction reduce the predicted ozone concentrations outside the leaves. Ozone impacts on GPP and transpiration in a Europe-wide simulation indicate that tropospheric ozone impacts the regional carbon and water cycling less than expected from previous studies...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of NO-NO 2 -O- 3 {{trace gas}} {{exchange}} were performed for two transition season periods during the La Nina a year 1999 (30 April to 17 May, "wet-dry," and 24 September to 27 October, "dry-wet") over a cattle pasture in Rondonia. A dynamic chamber system (applied during the dry-wet season) {{was used to}} directly measure emission fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) and surface resistances for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O- 3) deposition. A companion study was simultaneously performed in an old-growth forest. In order to determine ecosystem-representative NO 2 and O- 3 deposition fluxes for both measurement periods, an inferential method (multiresistance model) was applied to measure ambient NO 2 and O- 3 concentrations using observed quantities of turbulent transport. Supplementary measurements included soil NO diffusivity and soil nutrient analysis. The observed NO soil emission fluxes were nine times lower than old-growth rain forest emissions under similar soil moisture and temperature conditions and were attributed to {{the combination of a}} reduced soil N cycle and lower effective soil NO diffusion at the pasture. Canopy resistances (R-c) of both gases controlled the deposition processes during the day for both measurement periods. Day and night NO 2 canopy resistances were significantly similar (alpha = 0. 05) during the dry-wet period. <b>Ozone</b> canopy <b>resistances</b> revealed significantly higher daytime resistances of 106 s m(- 1) versus 65 s m(- 1) at night because of plant, soil, and wet skin uptake processes, enhanced by stomatal activity at night and aqueous phase chemistry on vegetative and soil surfaces.

40|$|Fresh leafy produce, such as {{lettuce and}} coriander, {{are subject to}} post-harvest {{microbial}} contamination and decay. Because of increasing pesticide resistance and consumer pressures, alternative residue-free treatments, such as ozone, are being actively explored and encouraged to reduce microbial loads and curb spoilage of crops in storage/transit. However, several researchers have reported that {{a component of the}} bacterial population on leaf surfaces is resistant to ozone treatment. To investigate the potential reasons for this bacterial survival, confocal microscopy was used to visualise microbes on leaf surfaces before and after ozone treatment. Direct observation (live/dead cell staining) of cells after ozone exposure showed that some cells were still alive; this included cells in small colonies as well as individual cells. We hypothesised that cell (colony) age and prior stress (cold) contributes to, or is responsible for, the <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> observed. Interestingly, cells derived from older agar-grown colonies (7 – 12 -day-old) and cold stressed cells of a Pseudomonas sp.

The results are similar to our previous studies in humans that showed that ozone-induced hyperresponsiveness occurs shortly after exposure and is rapidly reversible and suggest that the ozone effect is linked to an acute inflammatory response in the airways...|$|R
40|$|Ozone (O 3) is a colorless {{and sharp}} odorous natural gas that is {{composed}} of three oxygen atoms. Ozone, that is toxic and pollutant near earth&# 146;s surface, it is vital in stratosphere by absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation. Although initial years after being discovered it was used for disinfection, studies conducted have come into question for medical usage of ozone. Ozone therapy may be summarized as administering a particular amount of ozone/oxygen mixture into body cavities or circulation. Ozone/oxygen gas mixture can be applied via intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intrapleural, intrarectal and intradiscal as well as topically. Most frequent ozone administration is major autohemotherapy. In this method, 50 - 270 ml blood of patient is taken into a special bottle and after contacting with ozone/oxygen mixture for a particular duration, it is re-infused. During this period, hydrogen peroxide produced by oxidative stress and lipid oxidations mediates the biological effects of ozone therapy by acting as a second messenger. Repetition of <b>ozone</b> administration creates <b>resistance</b> against oxidative stress via inducing antioxidative system.

Products are available in a variety of forms, from paste-like materials to flowable adhesives. Both single- and multi-component versions are available, each with several different cure chemistries. The commercial importance of silicone sealants and adhesives is based on their unique combination of properties that permit them to satisfy important needs in a broad variety of markets. These properties include excellent weather and thermal stability, <b>ozone</b> and oxidation <b>resistance,</b> extreme low temperature flexibility, high gas permeability, good electrical properties, physiological inertness and curability by a variety of methods at both elevated and ambient temperatures.

These unique characteristics are the result of a scientific endeavour to combine some of the most stable chemical and physical attributes of the inorganic world with the highly utilizable aspects of organic materials. A qualitative list of the features of siloxane polymers that contribute to the unique combination of properties of silicone sealants and adhesives relevant in construction applications is given in Table 1. Almost all these inherent attributes are a consequence of four fundamental aspects: the low intermolecular forces between dialkylsiloxane molecules, the dipolar nature and the strength of the siloxane bond and the flexibility of the siloxane backbone.

In {{addition to the}} mechanical properties, attention was also given to the resistance to thermal aging, oil and ozone of the blends. Silica was selected as a reinforcing filler in this study due to its unique characteristic to interact with CR. The results reveal that, due to the better filler dispersion and the greater crosslink density, the silica-filled CR possesses lower compound viscosity and better mechanical properties, compared to the silica-filled NR. The aging properties, oil and <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> of the silica-filled CR are also significantly better {{than those of the}} silica-filled NR.

Five in each healthy and damaged trees of Pinus thunbergii growing in air polluted area for 12 years were chosen based on visible foliar injury and growth. The cones of P. thunbergii, which were collected from healthy and damaged trees, were analyzed for physical characteristics and seeds from the cones were used to test germination percentage under O 3 treatment. The germinated seeds were continuously exposed to O 3 treatment and the lipid peroxidation and activities of antioxidative enzymes were determined for both seeds and seedlings. The O 3 treatment for seed germination and seedling development were conducted at three conditions: control, 150 ppb and 300 ppb of O 3. The non-treated seeds from the damaged trees showed 21. 6 % lower germination than those from the healthy ones. On the O 3 treatment of 300 ppb, seed germination decreased approximately 10 % for the healthy trees and 19 % for the damaged trees compared to that on the control. The seeds from the healthy trees showed significantly higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase (CAT) than those from the damaged trees. The activities of GR, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and CAT decreased along with the increasing O 3 concentration in two tree grades.

40|$|The main {{advantage}} of saturated elastomers, such as EPM and EPDM over their unsaturated counter-parts {{is the absence}} of carbon-carbon unsaturation in the main polymer chain, resulting in excellent <b>ozone</b> and heat <b>resistance.</b> A consequent dis{{advantage of}} the absence of unsaturation is the lack of reactivity of these saturated elastomers. Such reactivity is desired for cross-linking, providing the typical rubber properties like high tensile strength, elasticity and resistance to solvents, and/or for further chemical functionalization of the polymer chain, which yields polymers with increased polarity or reactivity and, thus, enhanced adhesion to polar substrates or compatibility with other polar polymers. The common way to overcome the lack of reactivity for saturated polymers is by pursuing free-radical reactions, usually initiated by thermal decomposition of peroxides. Peroxide cross-linking of EP(D) M-rubbers is commercially applied and also grafting of unsaturated monomers onto EP(D) M, for example maleic anhydride (MA), initiated by peroxides is performed on an industrial scale. A major disadvantage of peroxide-induced reactions is lack of selectivity which leads to a number of side reactions, the most common being disproportionation of two macro-radicals and β-scission which results in polymer degradation. Organic azides are a class of organic compounds that are known for their reactivity towards saturated hydrocarbons. Hence, it is interesting to study their performance in cross-linking/modification of saturated EP(D) M-rubbers. Upon heating nitrogen is split off from the azides and the resulting nitrene R-N species insert into a C-H bond. This reaction mechanism is expected to be completely different from the radical processes resulting from peroxides and, most importantly, no side reactions are likely to occur. The purpose of this thesis is therefore to investigate azides as viable alternatives for peroxides in cross-linking and grafting of saturated elastomers, in particular EP(D) M...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) rubber {{emerges as}} a {{dominant}} elastomer for major engineering applications. The major properties of EPDM are its outstanding heat, <b>ozone</b> and weather <b>resistance</b> ability. It has a good resistance to polar substances and steam condition too. In automobiles EPDM rubber has a common use as seals. This includes door seals, window seals, trunk seals and sometimes hood seals. Frequently these seals {{are the source of}} noise due to the movement of the door versus the car body. This is due to friction between the EPDM rubber parts and the mating surfaces. Thus, the contact iteration between the rubber sealing and the indenting object must be known to optimize the performance of rubber sealing. However, it is need less to mention that the behaviour of any viscoelastic material is very difficult to be predicted. In the present work various tribo-characteristics of EPDM rubber of different hardness have been evaluated utilizing the available laboratory test facilities in the Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. Compression tests have been carried out using ‘Instron’ to determine the flow behaviour of EPDM rubber of different hardness both in dry as well as under different conditions of lubrication. The flow behaviour like load -vs. - elongation curves, true stress -vs. - elongation curves and true stress -vs. - true strain curves have been drawn from the experimental data. Abrasive wear behaviour has been evaluated using a two-body abrasion tester and the pattern abrasion has been appraised through SEM/EDAX study. Experimental results reveal that the hardness of EPDM rubber has significant effect on the flow behaviour and wear characteristics. The hardness, again, depends on the proportion of carbon black (CB) content. Thus it can be stated that the flow behaviour can be governed by controlling the CB concentration in the EPDM rubber. Based on the experimental results conclusion has been drawn accordingly. Some of the important tribo-characteristics of EPDM have been highlighted. Light has also been shed on various possible areas of further researches those should be undertaken in the future to come...|$|R

A range of ozone treatments were explored to deliver optimal bacterial inactivation while maintaining the visual appearance (color) of produce.

However, this EPDM is not commercially available anymore. On the opposite side, DCPD-EPDM showed the lowest reactivity so that almost no modification could be realized. The result with ENB-EPDM was, that upon application of CTBBS to ENB-EPDM, gelation occurred and, therefore, a low amount of modification was achieved.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} feasibility of sterilizing surfaces with ozone-saturated water by the methods of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC). Initially, {{it was determined that}} there was no apparent difference in <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> between spores of Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium sporogenes when they are suspended in water. Both species were inactivated by a 10 -min exposure at ambient temperature. Resistance was increased when the spores were dried on AOAC carriers. Viable organisms were recovered after an exposure of 40 min at ambient temperature. An increase in the reactor water temperature to 60 degrees C did not improve the effectiveness of the ozone in sterilizing AOAC carriers. Dried spores of C. sporogenes were more resistant than B. subtilis spores because of a greater accumulation of organic matter on the carriers. No significant sporicidal activity was demonstrated after 40 min for spores of either species when they were inoculated on silk suture loops. The data suggest that organic loading and poor ozone penetrability are key factors in effecting the ability of ozone to sterilize surfaces rapidly...|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric ozone causes visible {{injuries}} in selected plants. Some plant {{species have been}} recognized as resistant and sensitive to ozone. Differences in the response to ozone of two kinds of plants are interesting because of practical implications. Resistant cultivars (without visible symptoms) will be more valuable for agriculture, forestry and horticulture. It is, however, necessary {{to find out the}} reason of the occurrence of the visible symptoms. The presented studies focused on selected morphological and anatomical differences between well-known ozone-sensitive (Bel W 3) and -resistant (Bel B) cultivars of tobacco plants. Daily growth of the sensitive cultivar was higher than that of the resistant one. This tendency was also valid for the leaf growth which might have been the response of the sensitive cultivar to decreased photosynthetic leaf area (necrosis) caused by ozone. Morphological investigations revealed thinner upper epidermal cells in the sensitive cultivar. Moreover, a decrease of spongy mesophyll cell layers was observed. The obtained results suggest that it is the anatomical structure that may be partly responsible for <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> — wider epidermal cells, more spongy mesophyll cell layers...|$|E
40|$|Rust {{resistant}} and susceptible cultivars of Helianthus annuus {{were exposed}} {{for short periods}} to 230 ppb ozone, a concentration often measured in central Europe and elsewhere during summer months. Chlorophyll fluorescence induction {{was used to measure}} a number of photosynthetic parameters. The stress caused was detectible within minutes following exposure to ozone. Measurements of ϕmax and ϕss showed that only the susceptible cultivar was stressed. However, following Fs and Fm, fluorescence over long periods, it was clear that both cultivars were stressed by ozone. Subsequent to the fumigation with ozone, the resistant cultivar restored to levels prior to exposure to ozone, indicating repair to the damage caused. Both cultivars showed repair during the dark, while the damage caused to the susceptible cultivar appeared to be permanent. Both the utilisation of excitons as well as the number of closed versus open reaction centres were influenced by the <b>ozone.</b> <b>Resistance</b> to a stressor (in this case to rust) was beneficial to the plants, indicating a common response to stress and also adaptation to stressors...|$|E
40|$|Isoprene {{is formed}} in and emitted by {{plants and the}} reason for this {{apparent}} carbon waste is still unclear. It has been proposed that isoprene stabilizes cell and particularly chloroplast thylakoid membranes. We tested if membrane stabilization or isoprene reactivity with ozone induces protection against acute ozone exposures. The reduction of visible, physiological, anatomical, and ultrastructural (chloroplast) damage shows that clones of plants sensitive to ozone and unable to emit isoprene become resistant to acute and short exposure to ozone if they are fumigated with exogenous isoprene, and that isoprene-emitting plants that are sensitive to ozone do not suffer damage when exposed to ozone. Isoprene-induced <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance</b> is associated with the maintenance of photochemical efficiency and with a low energy dissipation, as indicated by fluorescence quenching. This suggests that isoprene effectively stabilizes thylakoid membranes. However, when isoprene reacts with ozone within the leaves or in a humid atmosphere, it quenches the ozone concentration to levels that are less or non-toxic for plants. Thus, protection from ozone in plants fumigated with isoprene may be due to a direct ozone quenching rather than to an induced resistance at membrane level. Irrespective of the mechanism, isoprene {{is one of the most}} effective antioxidants in plants...|$|E
40|$|Bio-based {{thermoplastic}} elastomers (TPE) containing {{natural rubber}} and poly(lactic acid) were prepared by melt blending in an internal mixer. The blend ratio was 60 % of natural rubber and 40 % of poly(lactic acid). Dynamic vulcanization of natural rubber was {{performed with the}} sulfur system. The 2 mm – thick sheet samples were prepared by compression molding. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of plasticization of PLA on the mechanical and physical properties of the derived TPE. Four plasticizers were selected: tributyl acetyl citrate (TBAC), tributyl citrate (TBC), glycerol triacetate (GTA), and triethyl- 2 -acetyl citrate (TEAC). The investigated properties were the tensile properties, tear strength, thermal ageing and <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance,</b> hardness, resilience, tension set and compression set. All plasticizers increased the strain at break. TBAC and TBC increased the stress at break. All plasticizers decreased the tear strength, hardness and resilience, and slightly changed the tension and compression set. TBAC seemed to be the best plasticizer for the TPE. The presence of 4 pph (parts per hundred resin) of plasticizer provided the highest strength and tensile toughness and the strain at break increased with the increasing plasticizer content. The plasticizers decreased the Tg and Tcc of the PLA and did not affect the degree of crystallinity of PLA in the TPE...|$|E
40|$|Ascorbate (AsA) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} antioxidant in plant cells and a cofactor for {{a large number of}} key enzymes. However, the mechanism of how AsA levels are regulated in plant cells remains unknown. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) activation-tagged mutant AT 23040 showed a pleiotropic phenotype, including <b>ozone</b> <b>resistance,</b> rapid growth, and leaves containing higher AsA than wild-type plants. The phenotype was caused by activation of a purple acid phosphatase (PAP) gene, AtPAP 15, which contains a dinuclear metal center in the active site. AtPAP 15 was universally expressed in all tested organs in wild-type plants. Overexpression of AtPAP 15 with the 35 S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter produced mutants with up to 2 -fold increased foliar AsA, 20 % to 30 % decrease in foliar phytate, enhanced salt tolerance, and decreased abscisic acid sensitivity. Two independent SALK T-DNA insertion mutants in AtPAP 15 had 30 % less foliar AsA and 15 % to 20 % more phytate than wild-type plants and decreased tolerance to abiotic stresses. Enzyme activity of partially purified AtPAP 15 from plant crude extract and recombinant AtPAP 15 expressed in bacteria and yeast was highest when phytate was used as substrate, indicating that AtPAP 15 is a phytase. Recombinant AtPAP 15 also showed enzyme activity on the substrate myoinositol- 1 -phosphate, indicating that the AtPAP 15 is a phytase that hydrolyzes myoinositol hexakisphosphate to yield myoinositol and free phosphate. Myoinositol is a known precursor for AsA biosynthesis in plants. Thus, AtPAP 15 may modulate AsA levels by controlling the input of myoinositol into this branch of AsA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis...|$|E
