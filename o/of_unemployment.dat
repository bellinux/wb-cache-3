5|$|As of the UK's 2001 census, Didsbury had an {{estimated}} workforce of 10,755 or 75% of the population. Economic status in Didsbury was: 48% in full-time employment, 11% retired, 10% self-employed, 8% in part-time employment, 4% full-time student (without job), 4% housewife/husband or carer, 4% permanently sick or disabled, 4% unemployed, and 2% economically inactive for unstated reasons. Didsbury's 48% rate of full-time employment compares with 33% in Manchester and 41% {{across the whole}} of England. The area's 4% unemployment rate {{is in contrast to}} Manchester's rate of 9%, and broadly in line with the 5% rate <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> for England.|$|E
5|$|Between 1987 and 1998, the {{development}} corporation attracted 1,000companies, generating 28,299new jobs and £1.759billion of private sector investment. The setting {{up of the}} corporation {{was intended to be}} only a temporary measure, terminating on 31March 1997, but it was extended for a further year until March 1998 when responsibility for Trafford Park's development passed to Trafford Council. The park is once again a major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration has led to a high start-up rate for businesses and low rates <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in the area. As of 2008, there were 1,400 companies within the park employing an estimated 35,000 people.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{explores the}} extent to which labor-market institutions, such as the degree of {{employment}} protection, affect heterogeneous responses <b>of</b> age-specific <b>unemployment</b> rates to macroeconomic shocks. We derive empirical predictions from a theoretical model and test them using panel data <b>of</b> the <b>unemployment</b> rate <b>of</b> 18 developed countries spanning the 1971 - 2008 period. By regressing changes <b>of</b> age-specific <b>unemployment</b> rates on the overall unemployment rate, the heterogeneity of responses <b>of</b> age-specific <b>unemployment</b> rates to a macroeconomic shock is estimated. We further examine how this heterogeneity depends on various labor-market-institution indexes, originally published by OECD and extended by other sources.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the psychological impact <b>of</b> past <b>unemployment.</b> Using 11 waves of German panel data, {{we show that}} life satisfaction is lower {{not only for the}} current unemployed (relative to the employed), but also for those with higher levels <b>of</b> past <b>unemployment.</b> However, the negative wellbeing effect <b>of</b> current <b>unemployment</b> is weaker for those who have been unemployed more often in the past. The panel data also reveal some evidence that those suffering greater falls in wellbeing on entering unemployment are less likely to remain unemployed one year later. Together, these findings offer a psychological explanation <b>of</b> persistent <b>unemployment...</b>|$|R
5|$|Built {{on a site}} long {{favored by}} pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other {{travelers}} on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth {{through the end of}} the 19thcentury. In the 20thcentury, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{originally}} {{wanted to}} make a film about the life of American photographer Weegee, but switched focus after discovering the unique narrative possibilities surrounding the stringer profession. He wrote Lou as an antihero, based on the ideas <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> and capitalism. Gyllenhaal played a pivotal role in the film's production, from choosing members of the crew to watching audition tapes. Filming took place over the course of four weeks, and was a challenging process that included over eighty locations.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{decline from}} {{the turn of}} the 20th century, coupled with the {{building}} of Gateshead's first council estate, saw Carr Hill transformed from an industrial settlement into a residential suburb of the Gateshead Council ward of Deckham. Governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party, the suburb is economically disadvantaged compared to other areas of the borough and nationally, with high levels <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> and low levels of income. It is served by Carr Hill Primary School. There are two small parks that contribute to the social activity of the area, as does the Elgin Centre at Elgin Road. Two historic venues, both now closed, face uncertain futures, as does the parish church.|$|E

Around 10% of residents claim Jobseeker's Allowance; this is double the Gateshead average and is the highest figure in the borough. Youth unemployment levels are also very high at 14%, which compares to a borough average of 9% and is also the highest figure in Gateshead. The average income of residents is only £18,000 per annum; this compares to a Gateshead average of £27,000 and is the lowest figure in the borough.|$|E
5000|$|Youth {{unemployment}} is the <b>unemployment</b> <b>of</b> youth (generally ages 15-24) and {{is different from}} the general <b>unemployment</b> <b>of</b> Spain. <b>Unemployment</b> describes those who actively search for work but that are without jobs. In Spain, youth unemployment has increasingly become alarming, especially in recent decades, given that the rate <b>of</b> youth <b>unemployment</b> has risen to such high levels. Youth unemployment in Spain rose very much during and following the Financial Crisis of 2008, and among OCDE nations Spain experienced the largest increase of job losses among young people. [...] The increase in segmentation of the labor market, the lack of effective employment policies and deficiencies in the education system have been cited as some of the principal reasons behind the significant level <b>of</b> youth <b>unemployment</b> in Spain.|$|R

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|The General Theory {{argues that}} demand, not supply, {{is the key}} {{variable}} governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, {{is defined by the}} sum of consumption and investment. In a state <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> and unused production capacity, one can only enhance employment and total income by first increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low employment equilibrium – the demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.|$|E
5|$|The Poor Law system {{began to}} decline with the {{availability}} of other forms of assistance. The growth of friendly societies provided help for its members without recourse to the Poor Law system. Some trade unions also provided help for their members. The Medical Relief Disqualification Removal Act 1885 meant that people who had accessed medical care funded by the poor rate were no longer disqualified from voting in elections. In 1886 the Chamberlain Circular encouraged the Local Government Board to set up work projects when unemployment rates were high rather than use workhouses. In 1905 the Conservatives passed the Unemployed Workman Act which provided for temporary employment for workers in times <b>of</b> <b>unemployment.</b>|$|E

His birthplace was 39 John Street, Abercwmboi (then known as Cap Coch) in the South Wales coalfields, the fourth child of Thomas Davies and his wife Esther. Thomas was a miner and trade union activist, who under the pseudonym Y Llwynog ("the Fox") wrote a column for the Welsh language newspaper Tarian y Gweithiwr ("The Worker's Shield"), in which he berated pit management and safety practices. His general militancy led to his blacklisting by pit owners, and after spells <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> he eventually found work as an insurance agent.|$|E
