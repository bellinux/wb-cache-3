40|$|Re-evaluation of the {{cultural}} heritage of the past has been an integral part <b>of</b> Soviet <b>literary</b> criticism.

5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements <b>of</b> <b>literary</b> realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France {{were in danger of}} being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.|$|E

40|$|From {{the dawn}} of film history to today, film-adaption has {{generally}} been treated as the unfavored stepchild <b>of</b> the <b>literary</b> work upon which it is based. One reason for this bias is that film is seldom viewed as a free-standing work of art but rather as an off-shoot <b>of</b> its <b>literary</b> model. This perception is particularly true <b>of</b> German <b>literary</b> criticism. In this thesis I intend to study more closely the problems involved with film-adaption and to demonstrate {{on the basis of}} three examples that process <b>of</b> transforming a <b>literary</b> work into film can in fact be a fascinating construct of intermediality...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{completion}} <b>of</b> <b>Literary</b> Hall in 1870, the Clinton Lodge Masons regularly utilized {{the first floor}} of the building as a meeting space, while the Romney Literary Society maintained its use of the second floor as a library. Between its various periods of dormancy, the Clinton Lodge and the associated Order of the Eastern Star, which was organized in July 1919, utilized Literary Hall as a meeting space, and following the Romney Literary Society's disestablishment, the Masons and Eastern Star continued their use of the building. In 1973, prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines purchased Literary Hall from the Clinton Lodge Masons and provided the lodge with a land lot for the construction of a new Masonic Temple at the corner of Washington and Center Streets in Romney. Following his purchase <b>of</b> <b>Literary</b> Hall, Haines used the historic building as a law office building and private museum. Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979.|$|E
