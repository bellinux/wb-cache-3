5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was put <b>off</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it.

Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E

In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped <b>off</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> farmer as he plowed.|$|E

The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of the IPO market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR.
