It consisted of Chief Justice Arthur Sifton, mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom. It began taking evidence in July. In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay; coal supply promptly increased, as did its price. In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (<b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of company stores (a sore point among the miners), and the incorporation of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E

25|$|PGA Tour players {{compete for}} two {{player of the}} year awards. The PGA Player of the Year award dates back to 1948 and is awarded by the PGA of America. Since 1982 the winner has been {{selected}} using a points system with points awarded for wins, money list position and scoring average. The PGA Tour Player of the Year award, also known as the Jack Nicklaus Trophy, is administered by the PGA Tour and was introduced in 1990; the recipient is selected by the tour players by ballot, although the results are not released <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> who has won. More often than not the same player wins both awards; in fact, as seen in the table below, the PGA and PGA Tour Players of the Year have been the same every year from 1992 through 2016. The Rookie of the Year award was also introduced in 1990. Players are eligible in their first season of PGA Tour membership if they competed in less than seven events from any prior season. Several of the winners had a good deal of international success before their PGA Tour rookie season, and some have been in their thirties when they won the award. In March 2012, a new award, the PGA Tour Courage Award, was introduced in replacement of the defunct Comeback Player of the Year award.|$|E

40|$|These are {{the results}} of two surveys of relatives, and others who knew people who had died, {{describing}} events {{in the year before}} death and their views on the time of the person's death. Those surveyed were identified from death certificates in England. The main focus is on a sample of 3696 people dying in 1990 in 20 health authorities, with supporting analysis from an earlier national sample of 639 people dying in 1987. Variation in peoples' views about whether an earlier death would have been better is reported, in the context of debate about euthanasia. Spouses were less likely <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> feel {{that it would have been}} better if the person had died earlier, and this held true even when controlling for the deceaseds' levels of pain, distress, dependency and age. Spouses were more likely <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a later death would have been better, though not in cases where the deceased was reported as having said they wanted to die sooner. Spouses were influenced by the loss which the death of the person represented for them, being more likely <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they missed the person who died a great deal, and feel loneliness was a big problem. Non spouses (children and other relatives of the deceased, friends, neighbours and a few officials) on the other hand were more likely <b>than</b> spouses <b>to</b> <b>say</b> an earlier death would have been better, even when levels of pain, distress, dependency and age were controlled for. They were also more likely <b>than</b> spouses <b>to</b> <b>say</b> this when the deceased was not said to have wanted to die earlier. This was influenced by the fact that they experienced care as more burdensome than spouses, finding that it restricted their lives. The consequences of all this is that the very old were more likely to be cared for by people who, in retrospect, felt that it would have been better if the old person had died earlier. The views of the very old, particularly of women, suggest that they themselves often take on the view that they are 'too old'. death euthanasia age caring...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{research}} {{on the effects of}} education on religion and spirituality in Chinese societies. This gap is addressed through quantitative analysis of a new dataset, the Religious Experience Survey in Taiwan, in conjunction with the repeated cross-sectional Taiwan Social Change Survey. In Taiwan, people with higher education are less likely <b>than</b> <b>others</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that they have a religion, to worship or pray frequently, and to regard those activities as important. They are more likely, however, to express an interest in mystical or supernatural things, and to report a variety of religious experiences. This paradox arises not because the educated Taiwanese are spiritual but not religious, but rather because they are somewhat polarized: those who have no religion and those reporting religious experiences are not the same individuals. Although education is highly correlated with both birth cohort and income, the findings strongly suggest that education is the key explanatory variable. The official promotion of Confucian thought and its adoption by the educated elite helps to explain the surprising conjunction of declining religious affiliation and increased engagement with spirituality...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Businesses {{that seek}} to develop an {{appropriate}} operations strategy for serving a multicultural customer market face challenges that are distinct from businesses that serve a relatively homogeneous local market. While the strategic implications of expanding services from a domestic market to international locations have been well documented, the issue of dealing with multinational customers at a single location has largely been neglected by researchers, {{as far as we}} can determine. This paper attempts to fill the research gap by presenting a method for determining the extent to which restaurant managers should maintain standard menus and food items, as opposed to customizing their operations for different ethnic and cultural groups. To that end, we applied a customer-based approach to help managers at four international-airport food outlets to improve their food- service revenues from their three major passenger groups: English-, Japanese-, and Spanish-speaking customers. In this case, language preference was used as a proxy for cultural identity. We submit that although there are many differences among, say, English-speaking peoples, they are more similar <b>to</b> each <b>other</b> <b>than</b> they are <b>to,</b> <b>say,</b> Spanish speakers. Moreover, the language a person speaks is a substantial factor in trying to communicate in a particular location. One can guess that Japanese speakers in the United States, for example, might experience more language barriers than either English or Spanish speakers. We present an approach for modeling the preferences of different cultural groups, evaluating the differences among the groups, and determining a strategy to maximize market share for each of the four food-service providers that we studied. Indeed, one food-service vendor implemented our study 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations and enjoyed a substantial revenue gain over the previous year 2 ̆ 7 s same-period sales. We believe that the method we propose has valuable implications for any service provider who must consider operating strategies for a multicultural or multinational site, although we focus on the distinct concept of a domestic foodservice business that serves a multicultural market...|$|R

6000|$|Besides, my friends, there is, I {{know too}} well, a great danger in {{making too much}} of these little outward ceremonies, {{especially}} with children and young people. For the heart of man is just as fond as it ever was of idolatry, and superstition, and will-worship, and voluntary humility, and paying tithe of mint, anise, and cummin, while it neglects the weightier matters of the law, justice, mercy, and judgment: and, therefore, there is very great danger, if we make too much of these ceremonies, harmless and even good {{as many of them}} may be, of getting to rest in them, and thinking that God is pleased with them themselves. Whereas, what God looks at is the heart, the spirit, the soul; and whether it is right or wrong, proud or humble, hard or loving: and if we think so much of the outward and visible form, that we forget the inward and spiritual grace, for which it ought to stand, then we lay a snare for our own souls to turn them away from the worship of the living God, and break the second commandment. Much more, if we pride ourselves on being more reverent than our neighbours in these outward forms, and look down on, and grudge at, those who do not practise them; for then we turn our humility into pride, and our reverence to Christ into an insult to him; for the true way to honour Christ is to copy Christ. No one really honours and admires Christ's character who does not copy him; and to esteem ourselves better <b>than</b> <b>others,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in our hearts, 'Stand by, for I am holier <b>than</b> thou,' <b>to</b> offend and drive away Christ's little ones, and wound the consciences of weak brethren by insisting on things against which they have a prejudice, is to run exactly counter to Christ and the mind of Christ, and to be more like the Pharisees than the Lord Jesus. That is not surely esteeming <b>others</b> better <b>than</b> ourselves: that is not surely looking not merely on our own things, but also on the things of others; that is not fulfilling the law of love; that is not following St. Paul's example, who gave up, he says, doing many things which he thought right, because they offended weaker spirits than his own. 'All things,' he <b>says,</b> 'are lawful <b>to</b> me, but all things are not expedient.' 'Ay,' says he, 'I would eat no meat while the world standeth, if it cause my brother to offend.' ...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{survey data}} do not provide {{comprehensive}} baseline information about U. S. beliefs and attitudes on terrorism and counterterrorism. Improved understanding of public attitudes can inform programs and tools related to managing public risk perception, increasing effectiveness of pre- and post-event communication by Federal, state, and local officials, and building and supporting more resilient social networks within and across communities. In this project, systematic survey data was collected from a sample of Americans {{in response to a}} range of newly developed survey questions. The survey was developed by two leading survey methodologists, following consultations with a research team of experts who study the dynamics of terrorism, counterterrorism, and community resilience, as well as with practitioners and officials from throughout the homeland security community. The questions were administered to members of a web panel by the on-line survey firm Knowledge Networks, and a second wave of the survey will be issued approximately six months after the first wave to allow for analysis of attitudes over time. The first wave of the questionnaire was completed, from September 28, 2012 to October 12, 2012, by 1, 576 individuals 18 years of age and older. The first section of the questionnaire assessed the salience of terrorism by asking respondents whether they had thought about terrorism in the preceding week, how likely they thought a terrorist attack in the United States was in the next year, and whether they had done anything differently in the past year because of the possibility of such an attack. The second section of the questionnaire posed questions about how likely respondents would be to call the police in response to various actions potentially related to terrorism and how concerned respondents felt the government should be about these actions. Respondents who said they had thought about a terrorist attack in the last week were more likely <b>than</b> <b>other</b> respondents <b>to</b> <b>say</b> they were likely to call the police in response to the various situations described to them. The survey then assessed respondents' awareness and evaluation of government efforts related to terrorism in the United States. A large majority of the respondents said that the U. S. government has been very effective (33 percent) or somewhat effective (54 percent) at preventing terrorism; less than 13 percent characterized the government as not too effective or not effective at all. In a final section of the survey, we asked respondents about two specific programs focused on increasing communication between members of the public and the government on topics related to terrorism...|$|R
