25|$|Late one {{afternoon}} when returning from town we {{were met by}} a few {{women and children who}} told us that Mexican troops from some other town had attacked our camp, killed all the warriors of the guard, captured all our ponies, secured our arms, destroyed our supplies, and killed many of <b>our</b> <b>women</b> and children. Quickly we separated, concealing ourselves as best we could until nightfall, when we assembled at our appointed place of rendezvous— a thicket by the river. Silently we stole in one by one, sentinels were placed, and when all were counted, I found that my aged mother, my young wife, and my three small children were among the slain.|$|E

Our men fashioned {{the wood}} into pipe stems, emergency snowshoes, snares, wooden nails, whistles for the children, beading looms, and frames for stretching hides. Rotted willow wood {{was used to}} smoke hides. Green willow branches were burned to smoke meat. We twisted the inner bark fibers into temporary rope, twine and fish nets. We weather proofed rawhide by wrapping it in willow bark. We used willow branches as lathing for our houses. Our men scraped off the inner cambium layer and added other ingredients, such as bearberry, to make a smoking mixture, ‘Kinnikinick’. We repaired our carts, made a shelter when we were caught in a storm, burned for fuel and had {{a variety of other}} practical uses for the wood of the willow.|$|E

500|$|He {{wrote that}} to the natives, the Christianity brought by the Spaniards had come to symbolize the {{brutality}} with {{which they had been}} treated; he quoted one Taino cacique (tribal chief), [...] "They tell us, these tyrants, that they adore a God of peace and equality, and yet they usurp our land and make us their slaves.

[...] (This is a strategy being followed by organizers in numerous developing countries. Educating women raises the lives of families as a whole.)

500|$|Many of {{the assassins}} {{had belonged to}} the Trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters, only to find their support for him eroded by the state's crimes against its people. Imbert, one of the assassins, sums up this {{realization}} in a comment prompted by {{the murder of the}} Mirabal sisters: [...] "They kill our fathers, our brothers, our friends. And now they're killing <b>our</b> <b>women.</b> And here we sit, resigned, waiting our turn." [...] In an interview, Vargas Llosa describes the corruption and brutality of Trujillo's regime: [...] "He had more or less all the common traits of a Latin American dictator, but pushed to the extreme. In cruelty, I think he went far far away from the restand in corruption, too." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Fischer {{had ended}} his formal {{education}} at age 16, {{dropping out of}} Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals.

500|$|By then, revolutionary {{examples}} also {{inspired the}} prisoners of Darnytsia to proclaim {{their own political}} goals, and openly demand the union of Transylvania with Romania. Their manifesto of April 26 (April 13), reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body. The document states: [...] "we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that {{once and for all}} that we [...] cannot carry on with our lives within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state.

500|$|By the 1970s, while women's liberation was a {{mainstream}} term in American public discourse, no comparable movement {{existed in the}} Soviet Union, despite gender-based income inequality and a rate of additional work in the household greater than that experienced by American women. There were also double standards in social norms and expectations. [...] "A man can fool around with other women, drink, even be lackadaisical toward his job, and this is generally forgiven," [...] wrote Hedrick Smith, former Russian correspondent for The New York Times, but [...] "if a woman does the same things, she is criticized for taking a light-hearted approach toward her marriage and her work." [...] In {{an open letter to}} the country's leadership shortly before he was expelled from it in 1974, the dissident writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn pointed out the heavy burden placed on women to do the menial work in Soviet society: [...] "How can one fail to feel shame and compassion at the sight of <b>our</b> <b>women</b> carrying heavy barrows of stones for paving the street?" ...|$|E
500|$|To help refresh the show, {{several new}} writers were hired, {{including}} Greenstein, Joe Keenan, who {{also served as}} an executive producer, and Bob Daily, {{who was also a}} producer. Daily commented, [...] "When we came on in season three, the mandate was to bring the show back to its roots. That meant having plotlines spring from relatable experiences, no matter how operatic or convoluted." [...] For the season's main mystery, Cherry and the writers wanted to incorporate more of the series' regular characters rather than bringing in various new ones, like they had done in the second season with Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and her family. They developed the Orson plot line around the [...] "idea that one of <b>our</b> <b>women</b> marries a guy who has dark secrets and possibly a violent streak." [...] Cherry opined: [...] "I thought there was something exciting about that, but real and relatable." [...] Greenstein commented that the writers worked backwards from the second season's cliffhangers to develop the Orson storyline, forsaking the original material that had been developed earlier. The cast responded positively to the new material for the season.|$|E
500|$|Her second collection, The Rosary (or Beads – Chetki) {{appeared}} in March 1914 and firmly established her {{as one of}} the most popular and sought after poets of the day. Thousands of women composed poems [...] "in honour of Akhmatova", mimicking her style and prompting Akhmatova to exclaim: [...] "I taught <b>our</b> <b>women</b> how to speak, but don't know how to make them silent". Her aristocratic manners and artistic integrity won her the titles [...] "Queen of the Neva" [...] and [...] "Soul of the Silver Age," [...] as the period came to be known in the history of Russian poetry. [...] In Poem Without a Hero, the longest and one of the best known of her works, written many decades later, she would recall this as a blessed time of her life. [...] She became close friends with Boris Pasternak (who, though married, proposed to her many times) [...] and rumours began to circulate that she was having an affair with influential lyrical poet Alexander Blok. In July 1914, Akhmatova wrote “Frightening times are approaching/ Soon fresh graves will cover the land"; [...] on August 1, Germany declared war on Russia, marking the start of [...] "the dark storm" [...] of world war, civil war, revolution and totalitarian repression for Russia. The Silver Age came to a close.|$|E

500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. We do not want that; we want all <b>our</b> <b>women</b> to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
