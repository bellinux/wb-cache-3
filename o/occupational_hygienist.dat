50|$|The <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienist</b> may be {{involved}} with the assessment and control of physical, chemical, biological or environmental hazards in the workplace or community that could cause injury or disease. Physical hazards may include noise, temperature extremes, illumination extremes, ionizing or non-ionizing radiation, and ergonomics. Chemical hazards related to dangerous goods or hazardous substances are frequently investigated by occupational hygienists. Other related areas including indoor air quality (IAQ) and safety may also receive {{the attention of the}} <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienist.</b> Biological hazards may stem from the potential for legionella exposure at work or the investigation of biological injury or effects at work, such as dermatitis may be investigated.|$|E

5000|$|Occupational hygiene (United States: {{industrial}} hygiene (IH)) is the anticipation, recognition, evaluation, {{control and prevention}} of hazards from work that may result in injury, illness, or affect the well being of workers. These hazards or stressors are typically divided into the categories biological, chemical, physical, ergonomic and psychosocial. [...] The risk of a health effect from a given stressor {{is a function of}} the hazard multiplied by the exposure to the individual or group. For chemicals, the hazard can be understood by the dose response profile most often based on toxicological studies or models. <b>Occupational</b> <b>hygienists</b> work closely with toxicologists (see Toxicology) for understanding chemical hazards, physicists (see Physics) for physical hazards, and physicians and microbiologists for biological hazards (see Microbiology Tropical medicine Infection) Environmental and <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienists</b> are considered experts in exposure science and exposure risk management. Depending on an individual's type of job, a hygienist will apply their exposure science expertise for the protection of workers, consumers and/or communities.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} issues have {{required}} the coordination {{over a number of}} years of a number of medical and para professionals in detecting and then characterizing the nature of the issue, both in terms of the hazard and in terms of the risk to the workplace and ultimately to society. This has involved <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienists</b> in research, collection of data and to develop suitable and satisfactory control methodologies.|$|R
50|$|An <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienist</b> may use one or {{a number}} of commercially {{available}} electronic measuring devices to measure noise, vibration, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, dust, solvents, gases, and so on. Each device is often specifically designed to measure a specific or particular type of contaminant. Such devices are often subject to multiple interferences. Electronic devices need to be calibrated before and after use to ensure {{the accuracy of the}} measurements taken and often require a system of certifying the precision of the instrument.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{investigation}} process, the <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienist</b> may {{be called upon to}} communicate effectively regarding the nature of the hazard, the potential for risk, and the appropriate methods of control. Appropriate controls are selected from the hierarchy of control: by elimination, substitution, engineering, administration and personal protective equipment (PPE) to control the hazard or eliminate the risk. Such controls may involve recommendations as simple as appropriate PPE such as a 'basic' particulate dust mask to occasionally designing dust extraction ventilation systems, work places or management systems to manage people and programs for the preservation of health and well-being of those who enter a workplace.|$|E

40|$|Background: Noise mapping in {{industry}} {{can be useful}} to assess the risks of harmful noise, or to monitor noise in machine rooms. Using GIS -based software for plotting noise maps in an indoor noisy work environment can be helpful for <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienists</b> to monitor noise pollution. Methods: This study {{was carried out in}} a noisy packaging unit of a food industry in Ghazvin industrial zone, to evaluate noise levels by GIS technique. For this reason the floor of packaging unit was divided into squares of 2 × 2 meters and the center of each square was marked as a measurement station based on NIOSH method. The sound pressure level in each station was measured and then the measurement values were imported into Arc GIS software to plot noise map. Results: Unlike the current method, the noise maps generated by GIS technique are consistent with the nature of sound propagation. Conclusion: This study showed that for an indoor work environment, the application of GIS technology rendering the assessment of noise levels in the form of noise maps, is more realistic and more accurate than the routine method which is now being used by the <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienists.</b> ...|$|R

Hence, this investigation was carried out to determine situation of using of protective devices and effective parameters on it, in Qom province workers community in 2006. MethodsThis research is descriptive-sectional study. Sample volume was designed 378 persons working in factories in Qom. First of all, list of Qom factories with noise pollution problems, were collected and 30 important factories among them were selected randomly. In the second stage, 378 persons were selected randomly from workers. The interest information was obtained by questionnaire and collected data were analyzed by SPSS software. ResultsThe obtained results showed that, 83. 6 % of workers have been using ear protective devices. 296 of them, which were using ear protective devices, had an <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienist</b> in their workplaces. This research also showed that, 109 workers that used ear protective devices, had moderate knowledge level. Moreover, 82. 5 % of trained workers have used ear protective devices.

The published literature on modes of transmission, particularly the interface between airborne particle ( 5 micron) modes are examined. Coupled with experimental studies of bioaerosol generation and removal {{in a variety of}} environments, this demarcation on the grounds of particle size appears to abandon basic principles of aerosol physics.

40|$|The first {{recognition}} of the profession of <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienist</b> was preceded by at least 200 years of developments in disease prevention practices in the workplace, many of which could readily be characterized as occupational hygiene.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{increase}} {{the credibility of}} retrospective exposure assessments. documentation of the procedures and presentation of measures on quality control is recommended. The {{aim of this study}} was to present and evaluate the procedures used in a case-control study on leukaemia. METHODS: A series of 1, 087 cases and matched controls were interviewed. Exposure assessments were performed for 13 occupational agents and ten leisure-time activities and the confidence of the assessments was coded. The exposure assessments were performed blind by three <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienists.</b> Ten percent of the interviews were reassessed by two of the three <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienists.</b> RESULTS: The leisure-time activities contributed to a large extent to the overall prevalence of exposure. For organic solvents approximately 25 % of the controls classified as exposed would be misclassified if leisure-time exposure were not considered. The proportions of subject assessments with low confidence were higher for next-of-kin than for in-person interviews. A negative correlation was seen between the proportions of assessments with low confidence and the reliability. A significant difference was seen in the inter-rater comparison between cases and controls when the reliability was calculated for each assessed period; no difference was seen for the subject assessments used for relative risk estimation. CONCLUSION: When low-dose exposure in epidemiological studies are being assessed there is an obvious risk of misclassification if leisure-time activities are not included. Furthermore, the reliability of the assessments may suffer if next-of-kin interviews are used to a large extent. For cancers with poor prognoses, prospective studies are preferable to minimise possible information bias...|$|R

40|$|Objective The aim of {{this article}} is to illustrate, by means of case reports on {{occupational}} exposure in four men with cancer, the hazards of previous and ongoing carcinogenic exposures in ships ’ engine rooms. Several cases of cancer occurred within a few years among the engine room crew of a passenger ferry. An investigation was undertaken to establish the number of cases, the types of cancers involved, and their possible relation to work. Subjects and Methods Nine cases of cancer among crew members of the ferry were reported between 2001 and 2006, six of which occurred in crew working in the engine room. During the investigated time period, 65 men had been employed in the engine room (mean age 40, range 16 – 65, years). Four cases were referred to our department. Medical history, personal risk factors and specific diagnoses were collected by medical examinations and from the medical files.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{suggested}} that a relation may exist between exposure to occupational organic solvents and diseases of the kidney [...] particularly malignancy and glomerulonephritis. Two case referent studies were undertaken in the West Midlands to investigate these possibilities. In the case of renal cancer 54 live cases of biopsy proved adenocarcinoma of the kidney were compared with an equal number of community based healthy referents matched for age, sex, place of residence, and socioeconomic and ethnic grouping. For glomerulonephritis, 50 biopsy proved cases were matched in the same manner with 50 referents. Fourteen other patients were also reviewed who, on biopsy, proved not to have glomerulonephritis. For both sets of cases and their referents each individual was interviewed and a detailed account obtained of medical history and environmental exposures. Exposure to solvents was assessed independently and "blind" in a semiquantitative way by an experienced <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienist.</b> Past exposure was estimated for 10 different solvent types and 17 material types. No relation was found between exposure to solvents and renal cancer or glomerulonephritis. In the case of renal cancer the numbers studied only precluded a fourfold excess risk. For glomerulonephritis, the study, although methodologically superior to most other published studies and of similar size, was of similar power to the renal cancer investigation...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Animal {{evidence}} shows that N-nitrosamines and similar xenobiotic compounds are pancreatic carcinogens. We aimed to determine whether occupational exposure to N-nitrosamines or to pesticides increases risk of pancreatic cancer development. Methods Participants (504 cases, 643 controls) in a population-based case-control study (The Queensland Pancreatic Cancer Study) provided data on demographic, medical and lifestyle factors and lifetime job histories. Specific questions were asked regarding work in rubber and leather industries, metalworking jobs and occupational or direct use of pesticides on animals or crops. An <b>occupational</b> <b>hygienist</b> reviewed this information (blind to case status) to assess likelihood of exposure to N-nitrosamines and pesticides, and estimated level and frequency of such exposures. Results No associations were found for risk of pancreatic cancer and occupational exposure to N-nitrosamines (OR= 0. 85, 95 % CI 0. 51 to 1. 42) and no associations were seen with level or frequency of exposure. No associations were observed for ever exposure to pesticides in general (OR= 0. 90, 95 % CI 0. 61 to 1. 33) or {{to any of the}} pesticide subgroups. Stratification by history of cigarette smoking did not change these results.
