25|$|The <b>oublie</b> was, in {{its basic}} form, {{composed}} only of grain flour and water – just {{as was the}} communion wafer. It took until the 11th century, {{as a product of}} The Crusades bringing new culinary ingredients to Western Europe, for flavorings such as orange blossom water {{to be added to the}} oublies; however, locally sourced honey and other flavorings may have already been in use before that time.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Just also {{composed}} a lengthy draft {{of his own}} philosophical views, De la Nature, which remained hidden in obscurity until its transcription by Albert Soboul in 1951. Soboul first published this work in 1951 under the title [...] "Un manuscrit <b>oublié</b> de Saint-Just" [...] in the Annales historiques de la révolution française, No. 124. An expanded version is included in Alain Liénard's Saint-Just, théorie politique and later versions of Œuvres complètes. De la Nature outlines Saint-Just's ideas {{on the nature of}} society; the actual date it was written is disputed, but the most agreed upon range is between 1791 and 1792.|$|E
500|$|Late in September, a British convoy {{consisting}} of 13 battered ships under Captain Sir James Saumarez appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, {{they were in}} urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege. Nevertheless, Saumarez met {{with representatives of the}} Maltese and on 25 September, sent an offer of truce to Vaubois on their behalf. Vaubois replied [...] "Vous avez, sans doute, <b>oublié</b> que des Français sont dans la place. Le sort des habitans [...] ne vous regarde pointe. Quant à votre sommation, les soldats français ne sont point habitués à ce style" [...] ("You might have forgotten that the French hold this place. The fate of the inhabitants is none of your concern. As for your ultimatum, French soldiers are not accustomed to such a tone"). Unable to persuade the French to give in, Saumarez instead provided the Maltese forces with 1,200 muskets with which to continue the siege. Saumarez, unable to delay repairs any longer, sailed for Gibraltar {{at the end of the}} month.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{some have}} speculated that waffle irons first {{appeared}} in the 13th–14th centuries, {{it was not until the}} 15th century that a true physical distinction between the <b>oublie</b> and the waffle began to evolve. Notably, while a recipe like the fourth in Le Ménagier de Paris was only flour, salt and wine – indistinguishable from common <b>oublie</b> recipes of the time – what did emerge was a new shape to many of the irons being produced. Not only were the newly fashioned ones rectangular, taking the form of the fer à hosties, but some circular <b>oublie</b> irons were cut down to create rectangles. It was also in this period that the waffle's classic grid motif appeared clearly in a French fer à <b>oublie</b> and a Belgian wafelijzer [...] – albeit in a more shallowly engraved fashion – [...] setting the stage for the more deeply gridded irons that were about to become commonplace throughout Belgium.|$|E

60|$|Then {{came the}} great catastrophe, {{involving}} {{the old order}} of society in the national overthrow. Lady Shalem, after a decent interval of patriotic mourning, began to look around her and take stock of her chances and opportunities under the new regime. It was easier to achieve distinction as a titled oasis in the social desert that London had become {{than it had been}} to obtain recognition as a new growth in a rather overcrowded field. The observant eyes and agile brain quickly noted this circumstance, and her ladyship set to work to adapt herself to the altered conditions that governed her world. Lord Shalem {{was one of the few}} Peers who kissed the hand of the new Sovereign, his wife was one of the few hostesses who attempted to throw a semblance of gaiety and lavish elegance over the travesty of a London season following the year of disaster. The world of tradesmen and purveyors and caterers, and the thousands who were dependent on them for employment, privately blessed the example set by Shalem House, whatever their feelings might be towards the fait accompli, and the august newcomer who had added an old Saxon kingdom and some of its accretions to the Teutonic realm of Charlemagne was duly beholden to an acquired subject who was willing to forget the bitterness of defeat and to help others to forget it also. Among other acts of Imperial recognition an earldom was being held in readiness for the Baron who had known how to accept accomplished facts with a good grace. One of the wits of the Cockatrice Club had asserted that the new earl would take as supporters for his coat of arms a lion and a unicorn <b>oublie.</b>|$|E
