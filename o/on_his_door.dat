5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> off the train into a torrent of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E

5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully that the woman will be dead very soon.

25|$|The {{dialogue}} {{begins with}} an unnamed friend of Socrates asking him how his pursuit of the young Alcibiades, just now reputed to be growing his first beard, was proceeding. Socrates explains that while he has just been {{in the company of}} Alcibiades, his mind is now on more interesting matters. He says that Protagoras, the wisest man alive (309c–d), is in town. Socrates relates the story of how his young friend, Hippocrates, son of Apollodorus, came knocking <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> before daybreak and roused him out of bed.

One night, during a severe thunderstorm, Burns walks outside and suffers flashbacks to his experiences with trench warfare in France. The trauma facilitates' Burn's ability {{to talk about his}} frontline experience. The experience also helps Rivers decide to take the job in London, and notifies his commander at Craiglockhart. When Rivers returns, Sassoon describes his recent hallucinations of dead friends knocking <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door.</b> Sassoon admits to guilt for not serving the soldiers and decides to return to the trenches. Rivers, though pleased with Sassoon's decision, worries about what may happen to him there.|$|E
25|$|Many reports erroneously {{stated that}} Borel's room {{was full of}} Nazi-insignia, and rumors he was sympathizing with fascist {{ideologies}} were spurred even more {{by the fact that}} his stepfather had attended several meetings of the Front National in 1989. But besides a picture of Adolf Hitler cut out from a newspaper, graffiti displaying a swastika <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> a few books on World War II, as well as a documentary about David Koresh and the Waco siege, no evidence was found after his death that he was interested in any kind of politics. Also, a girl from Cuers spread the story that Eric had told her about his relationship with his half-sister Caroline, {{who was supposed to be}} his pregnant girlfriend. However, the sister in question did not exist, nor was it true that his father had died of cancer shortly before his rampage.|$|E

500|$|By December 1941, Finn was {{stationed}} at Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay {{on the island}} of Oahu in Hawaii. As a chief aviation ordnanceman, {{he was in charge of}} twenty men whose primary task was to maintain the weapons of VP-11, a PBY Catalina flying boat squadron. At 7:48a.m. on the morning of Sunday, 7 December 1941, Finn was at his home, about a mile from the aircraft hangars, when he heard the sound of gunfire. Finn recalled how a neighbor was the first to alert him, when she knocked <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> saying, [...] "They want you down at the squadron right away!" [...] He drove to the hangars, catching sight of Japanese planes in the sky on the way, and found that the airbase was being attacked, with most of the PBYs already on fire.|$|E
500|$|Tricky {{eventually}} grew {{frustrated with}} {{his role in}} Massive Attack, finding it limiting, and wanted to record an album with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another dimension to his lyrics and their meaning. In 1993, he discovered Martina Topley-Bird, then a teenager at Clifton College, {{when he saw her}} sitting against a wall near his house, singing to herself. [...] "That's really how it happened," [...] she recalled. [...] "A few weeks later, I went around to his house with some friends. We'd been drinking cider after our GCSEs. We were banging <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> but he wasn't in. Then Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and said: 'Yeah, this is Tricky's house, jump in through the window.'" [...] Tricky, whose lyrics had matured from raps about street violence and sex to more personal and introspective writing, said Topley-Bird found his songs [...] "quite depressing", which he believed was because of her more privileged background: [...] "It's just reality. She's been a student all her life, grew up in Somerset, and I don't think she's ever faced the real world. She finds it all a bit weird. But she's my best mate." [...] They would form a musical and romantic partnership over subsequent years, and their first recording together, [...] "Aftermath", later appeared on Maxinquaye. After offering the song to Massive Attack, who were not interested in including it on their 1991 album Blue Lines, Tricky released [...] "Aftermath" [...] independently to local record stores in September 1993 before he signed a record deal with 4th & B'way.|$|E
500|$|Joe Nick Patoski, {{an author}} and {{contributor}} to The New York Times, felt that [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] used the same melody as the Pretenders' new wave sound. He also noticed that Pérez's guitar-lead emulated {{the style of the}} Pretenders James Honeyman-Scott. John LaFollette of The Monitor called [...] "Fotos y Recuerdos" [...] a celebration of multiculturalism which helped [...] " [...] her bank account" [...] using a [...] "marketing strategy" [...] that he called [...] "as American as apple pie." [...] The rock and house music track features a synth-driven violin, ostinatish-percussion, and a steel drum under a cumbia beat. Perone found the song to have [...] "small hints" [...] of music found in Jamaica, Cuba, and Trinidad and Tobago. Patoski believed [...] "Techno Cumbia" [...] contained the [...] "most popular rhythm [...] coursing through the Latin music world." [...] Patoski noted that the track [...] "honored" [...] it by [...] "updating it with vocal samples, second line drumming from New Orleans, and horn charts inspired by soca from the Caribbean." [...] It included the singer rapping under a cumbia beat, the [...] "first successful example" [...] of a cumbia rap prototype. [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom", which also draws on music from the Caribbean, uses [...] "richer" [...] scoring, less-driven synthesizers, and treble-heavy arrangements than the first four songs on Amor Prohibido. Infused with cumbia and reggae, its [...] title suggests the sound of a heart palpitating when a person longs to be the protagonist's object of affection. [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom" [...] is musically similar to [...] "El Chico del Apartamento 512"; Perone called them recurring themes where the protagonist is [...] "attracted to a young man". The song's hook is more accessible to listeners with limited Spanish than that of [...] "Bidi Bidi Bom Bom". The [...] "sunny teen anthem" [...] track [...] "El Chico del Apartamento 512", the protagonist is hit on by several men whom she has no interest in, except for the song's [...] "boy in apartment 512". She finds enough courage to knock <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> to find it answered by a woman who asks if she is searching for her brother. Perone found its lyrics to be [...] "lighthearted" [...] and a relief from the tracks featuring heartbreak and despair.|$|E

50|$|Wojciech Plewiński's {{academic}} background {{was founded in}} architecture - in 1955 he received his diploma from the Kraków Polytechnic University. He studied sculpture at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts, but photography quickly became his passion and he abandoned all other undertakings. He began taking photographs in late 1956. Barbara Hoff from the Przekrój weekly, who later became a famous fashion designer, engaged him as a photographer with the magazine and he continued {{to work with the}} magazine for over four decades. He managed to shoot nearly five hundred of the famous 'kitten' shots of beautiful girls for the front cover. A few years later he took up theatre photography. He ended up developing a long-lasting relationship with the Stary Teatr in Kraków but offers came knocking <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>doors</b> from all sides.|$|R
2500|$|Jack Kerouac spent a {{few days}} in Big Sur in early 1960 at fellow poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti's cabin in the woods, and wrote a novel, Big Sur, based on his {{experience}} there. Big Sur acquired a bohemian reputation with these newcomers. [...] Henry Miller recounted that a traveler knocked <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> looking for the [...] "cult of sex and anarchy." [...] Apparently finding neither, the disappointed visitor returned home. Miller is referenced in Brautigan's A Confederate General at Big Sur, in which a pair of young men attempt the idyllic Big Sur life in small shacks and are variously plagued by flies, low ceilings, visiting businessmen with nervous breakdowns, and 2,452 tiny frogs whose loud singing keeps everyone awake.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1843, {{he put up}} a brass plaque <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door,</b> {{advertising}} {{himself as}} [...] "Architect and Surveyor" [...] and writing to his brother Frank in London: [...] "There {{is nothing to be}} gained here by hiding ones talent in a bushel". In the same letter he wrote of his aim to [...] "improve the taste of the discerning public upon ecclesiastical architecture." [...] In July of the same year, he began this by giving his first lecture, on Norman architecture, presumably at the Sydney School of Arts. Towards the end of the year, he and Sarah rented a house from Dr Hammett in Stanley Street, off College Street, where he was soon to receive an important architectural commission. Their first child, Edith, was born at Stanley Street the following year.|$|E
2500|$|He later {{claimed to}} police {{that he was}} being {{followed}} and that threats were being made against him, with strangers banging on his front door. Doubting the story but aware that he was an aide to the Prince of Wales, the police set up a secret CCTV camera to verify his testimony. Though he continued to make allegations, the police tapes showed that no-one was following him or banging <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door.</b> The police then approached the Prince's staff in St. James's Palace in London and warned that unless Smith received help he would be prosecuted for [...] "wasting police time". The Prince paid for him to attend The Priory, a famous British drink and drug treatment centre frequented by rock stars such as Robbie Williams and prominent people in the aristocracy, the media and the public eye.|$|E
5000|$|Jack Larson and Noel Neill both remembered Reeves as a noble Southern gentleman (even {{though he}} was from Iowa) with a sign <b>on</b> <b>his</b> {{dressing}} room <b>door</b> that said [...] "Honest George, the people's friend". Reeves had been made a [...] "Kentucky Colonel" [...] during a publicity trip in the South, and the sign <b>on</b> <b>his</b> dressing room <b>door</b> was replaced with a new one that read [...] "Honest George, also known as Col. Reeves", created by the show's prop department. A photo of a smiling Reeves and the sign appears in Gary Grossman's book about the show.|$|R
50|$|From his mother, Milne {{acquired}} {{a talent for}} working with his hands. He owned a small tool kit, which he used to disassemble the lock <b>on</b> <b>his</b> nursery <b>door</b> when he was seven years old.

2500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Budapest, however, he finds her murdered. He returns to Vladoviste {{to find his}} friend, Dr. Maria Florescu, Calugarul's replacement, is missing. In a nearby shed, he discovers an unconscious Pekmester in a coffin. In the inn, he finds a bomb <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door.</b> He disarms it, and Ozana tells him Pekmester and a man from Alba Iula {{had been in his}} room. He enters Pekmester's room, and discovers Pekmester and von Krüger are members of the Thule Society, and have been working with the Iron Guard. He also learns von Krüger has been in touch with a young member of the DAP, who he believes to be much more [...] "enterprising" [...] than Anton Drexler. As such, he has sent Pekmester an extract of a manifesto the young man is working on - an early version of Mein Kampf. Moriani ascertains von Krüger and Pekmester are attempting to walk The Path, which they believe ends in the Castle of Twilight, in an effort to become vampires. He also learns Pekmester has discovered Calugarul's grave to be empty.|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} to produce masterful portraits, both in pencil and oils, of almost photographic precision; {{but with the}} departure of the French administration, the painting commissions were rare. During this low point of his career, Ingres augmented his income by drawing pencil portraits of the many wealthy tourists, in particular the English, passing through postwar Rome. For an artist who aspired to a reputation as a history painter, this seemed menial work, and to the visitors who knocked <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door</b> asking, [...] "Is this where the man who draws the little portraits lives?", he would answer with irritation, [...] "No, the man who lives here is a painter!" [...] The portrait drawings he produced in such profusion during this period rank today among his most admired works. He is estimated to have made some five hundred portrait drawings, including portraits of his famous friends. His friends included many [...] musicians including Paganini, and he regularly played the violin with others who shared his enthusiasm for Mozart, Haydn, Gluck, and Beethoven.|$|E
2500|$|At 2 AM on March 3, 1896, Moore is {{awakened by}} one of Kreizler's {{servants}} banging incessantly <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>door.</b> Stevie, a young boy whom Kreizler had saved from being institutionalized and who is dedicated to Kreizler, brings Moore {{to the scene of}} a crime that Kreizler wants Moore to see. Roosevelt, the police commissioner, is already at the scene. When Moore sees the nature of the brutal murder, he is appalled. The victim, Georgio [...] "Gloria" [...] Santorelli, is a 13-year-old boy who prostituted himself by dressing up as a girl; the boy's wrists are tied behind his back, and he is kneeling with his face pressed on the steel walkway where he was found. Though makeup paint and powder on his face are still intact, his eyes are gouged out, his right hand is chopped off, his genitals are cut off and stuffed between his jaws, he has huge gashes across his entire body, his throat has been slashed, and his buttocks are [...] "shorn off". The policeman at the scene, Detective Sergeant Connor, makes it clear that murders of such victims are usually ignored.|$|E

50|$|In July 2013, {{a protest}} held outside his home by a pro-life group led to him leaving {{as he felt}} {{threatened}} by their behaviour.
