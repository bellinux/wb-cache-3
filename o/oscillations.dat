40|$|The <b>oscillation</b> {{behavior}} of laminar lifted flames {{under the influence}} of low-frequency AC has been investigated experimentally in coflow jets. Various <b>oscillation</b> modes were existed depending on jet velocity and the voltage and frequency of AC, especially when the AC frequency was typically smaller than 30 Hz. Three different <b>oscillation</b> modes were observed: (1) large-scale <b>oscillation</b> with the <b>oscillation</b> frequency of about 0. 1 Hz, which was independent of the applied AC frequency, (2) small-scale <b>oscillation</b> synchronized to the applied AC frequency, and (3) doubly-periodic <b>oscillation</b> with small-scale <b>oscillation</b> embedded in large-scale <b>oscillation.</b> As the AC frequency decreased from 30 Hz, the <b>oscillation</b> modes were in the order of the large-scale <b>oscillation,</b> doubly-periodic <b>oscillation,</b> and small-scale <b>oscillation.</b> The onset of the <b>oscillation</b> for the AC frequency smaller than 30 Hz was in close agreement with the delay time scale for the ionic wind effect to occur, that is, the collision response time. Frequency-doubling behavior for the small-scale <b>oscillation</b> has also been observed.

40|$|Background: During lateral acceleration, the {{addition}} of an appropriate roll motion can improve comfort, but some combinations of lateral and roll motion increase motion sickness. Objectives: To determine how motion sickness caused by lateral <b>oscillation</b> fully compensated by roll <b>oscillation</b> (so subjects feel no lateral acceleration) depends on the frequency of <b>oscillation</b> and compare sickness with that caused by uncompensated lateral <b>oscillation.</b> Method: A total of 160 subjects (8 groups of 20) were exposed for 30 min to fully roll-compensated sinusoidal lateral <b>oscillation</b> at one of 8 frequencies (0. 05, 0. 08, 0. 125, 0. 16, 0. 20, 0. 315, 0. 5, 0. 8 Hz). A further 60 subjects (3 groups of 20) were exposed to lateral <b>oscillation</b> (at 0. 315, 0. 5, or 0. 8 Hz) to allow comparison of sickness with that caused by uncompensated lateral <b>oscillation</b> at frequencies not previously studied. Subjects rated symptoms at 1 -min intervals. Results: With fully roll-compensated lateral <b>oscillation,</b> illness ratings tended to increase with increasing frequency of <b>oscillation</b> from 0. 05 to 0. 2 Hz (with peak lateral velocity, ± 1. 0 m · s? 1) and tended to decrease from 0. 315 to 0. 8 Hz (with peak lateral jerk, ± 1. 96 m · s? 3). Roll compensation significantly reduced the duration before subjects developed nausea. Conclusions: Motion sickness is increased by roll <b>oscillation</b> used to compensate fully for low-frequency lateral <b>oscillation.</b> In general, when roll <b>oscillation</b> is combined with low-frequency lateral <b>oscillation,</b> motion sickness cannot be predicted from either the roll <b>oscillation</b> or the lateral <b>oscillation</b> alone. The dependence of motion sickness on the frequency of <b>oscillation</b> is broadly similar for pure lateral <b>oscillation</b> and 100 % roll-compensated lateral <b>oscillation...</b>|$|R

We examined whether this <b>oscillation</b> advantage for vection was due to either the added motion parallax or retinal slip generated by insufficient compensatory eye movement during display <b>oscillation.</b> We constructed radial flow displays which simulated 1 Hz horizontal linear head <b>oscillation</b> (generates motion parallax) or angular head <b>oscillation</b> in yaw (generates no motion parallax). We found that adding simulated angular or linear head <b>oscillation</b> to radial flow increased the strength of linear vection in depth. Neither type of simulated head <b>oscillation</b> significantly reduced vection onset latencies relative to pure radial flow. Simultaneous eye-movement recordings showed that slow-phase ocular following responses (OFRs) were induced in both linear and angular viewpoint <b>oscillation</b> conditions. Vection strength was significantly reduced by active central fixation when viewing displays which simulated angular, but not linear, head <b>oscillation.</b> When these displays with angular <b>oscillation</b> were viewed without stable fixation, vection strength was found to increase with the velocity and regularity of the OFR. We conclude that vection improvements observed during central viewing of displays with angular viewpoint <b>oscillation</b> depend on the generation of eye movements...|$|R
