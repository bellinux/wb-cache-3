The project {{was based on a}} model of a compact Mediterranean city with neighbourhoods in which to live, study and work at the same time. To achieve this, the former land use designation of 22 a, which established that these city centre areas should only be used for industry, had to be changed to the new status of 22 @, which permits the coexistence of all production activities that do not cause a nuisance or pollution, normalizes the presence of dwellings that have been affected since 1953, and favours their restoration...|$|R

The theoretical part presents a view into the theories of localization in order to classify the most important location factors. The following practical part first describes the 17 <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> in the region.

40|$|Investment {{incentives}} {{as well as}} {{promotion of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> {{become one of the}} most debated issue for experts, especially in connection with the effect of foreign direct investments on economies at both national and regional levels. The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of promotion of <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> as the key tool of regional development support in the framework of economic conditions in the Czech Republic. The assessment is focused on <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> support which was provided by the Ministry of Industry and Trade in the Czech Republic or, more precisely, the CzechInvest agency in the framework of the Programme on <b>Industrial</b> <b>Zones</b> Development Support, Programme on Business Zones and Infrastructure Support and the Investment Incentives System. This paper's main source is the data set obtained in empirical research carried out by authors throughout <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> across the Czech Republic. Another important source was the accomplished analysis of economic management of all economic subjects observed in the supported <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> mentioned above. The research shows that firms in <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> have positive effects on the regional labor market, that companies in <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> contribute to technological development through restructuring of industry and affect SMEs positively, that <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> improve the business image of the region. The negative effect on the environment is low and the impact of <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> on social cohesion may be considered as neutral. Firms contribute to efficient use of available resources, creating greater added value. In the context of economic development, it is also possible to evaluate positively stable export growth in its absolute value; wages of workers in <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> may be assessed as above average as firms try to get quality workforce. The contribution of observed companies (or <b>industrial</b> <b>zones)</b> to the total number of jobs created in R&D is very limited. <b>Industrial</b> <b>zones</b> may be considered as significant accelerators of secondary sector development and, to a relatively lesser extent, also on the Quaternary and Quinternary. To assess the impact of the state support in <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> on the state budget, a complex function has been compiled to map specific indicators. The model has been applied in three variants: 'pessimistic', 'medium' and 'optimistic' and has implemented data from the period of 2006 to 2009...|$|R

In the first part of work are described teoretical fundamentals present by Czech and also foreign authors, who are focused on <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> problematics, characteristics of <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> in the Czech Republic and localization. In the second part are two case studies of strategic <b>industrial</b> <b>zones</b> Most-Joseph and Ostrava-Mošnov. The component of case studies is analysis of statistics for the period from 2000 to 2012, which results from observation of casual relations between development of zones and their surrounding areas lead to identification of economic and social impacts of strategic <b>industrial</b> <b>zone</b> {{on the development of the}} region...|$|R
