5|$|<b>Overdrive</b> is the 19th studio album by pop punk trio Shonen Knife. It was {{released}} on April 14, 2014 in Europe, and on April 16, 2014 in Japan. According to band leader Naoko Yamano, because their album Free Time (2010) was heavily influenced by punk rock, and Pop Tune (2012) had explored a more pop-oriented sound, <b>Overdrive</b> was {{a chance for the}} band to explore a more hard rock sound. The album's lyrics cover a wide array of topics, from green tea, fortune cookies, and cats.|$|E
5|$|Running {{parallel}} {{development with}} Fuse, and beginning began {{soon after the}} completion of Resistance 3, Insomniac Games began development of Sunset <b>Overdrive.</b> The game was inspired by Hyena Men of Kenya, Tank Girl, I Am Legend, The Young One, Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. Sunset <b>Overdrive</b> was created by Marcus Smith and Drew Murray; their first pitch to Insomniac's head was rejected as being too confusing. They were given one week to re-pitch the title, and they persuaded studio heads to begin the game's development. The game was later pitched to various publishers, which rejected them because Insomniac demanded to retain ownership of the IP. The project was later pitched to Microsoft Studios, which was eager to work with Insomniac. Microsoft allowed Insomniac to own the rights to the game. Sunset <b>Overdrive</b> was made exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox One console; it was released on the 20th anniversary of Insomniac, in 2014.|$|E

5|$|Sunset <b>Overdrive</b> {{was among}} {{one of the}} first Xbox One exclusives {{revealed}} at Microsoft's press conference at E3 2013. The first gameplay details were revealed by gaming magazine Edge in May 2014. A gameplay demo and a release date announcement happened at E3 2014. Insomniac had worked solely for the PlayStation family for about twenty years, and the announcement of Sunset <b>Overdrive</b> being an Xbox exclusive led to speculation that the relationship between Sony and Insomniac had ended. Insomniac denied such rumors, saying the company would still be working with other publishers to produce titles and that petitions would not change Sunset Overdrives status as an Xbox exclusive. It was released on October 28, 2014.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} a tension gauge, {{increasing}} when a character causes damage or moves toward an adversary and decreasing when a character moves backwards or is {{stopped for a}} long time. When the gauge is half-charged a player can use specials called <b>Overdrive</b> Attacks, which cause more damage than regular moves. A full gauge allows a player to make an Instant Kill, defeating an opponent regardless of health; if an Instant Kill is unsuccessful, the tension gauge will not charge {{for the remainder of}} that round.|$|E
5|$|Sunset <b>Overdrive</b> {{is an open}} world third-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Insomniac Games and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One. It was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013, and released worldwide in October 2014. The game is set in 2027, in a fictional metropolis called Sunset City.

5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} have different capabilities. Both {{are capable of}} using weapons and magic, but the hero is stronger with melee weapons and the heroine is stronger with ranged magical attacks. Weapons have three attributes: slash, jab, and bash; and different attributes cause more or less damage to different enemies. Magical spells can cause damage or defend the protagonists, and {{are affected by the}} weapon the character is holding. Combat takes place in real-time. Located {{at the bottom of the}} screen is an <b>overdrive</b> gauge that increases by one point at each hit given to an enemy. When that gauge is full, the player can release a powerful attack that will deplete the gauge completely if the attack lands. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion.|$|E

5|$|Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have {{frequently}} been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both {{set in the}} Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former {{was the first time}} in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer to the screen, after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa <b>Overdrive,</b> has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story Dogfight by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine Marmot at Hot Property Films.|$|E
5|$|She {{was born}} in Paris and moved with her family to Washington, D.C., in 1966. As a child, Smith was often teased because of her voice. She became a {{professional}} actress in 1982 after graduating from drama school and moved to New York City in 1984, where she appeared in the Broadway production of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing. She made her film debut in 1985's Heaven Help Us, followed by roles in The Legend of Billie Jean and Maximum <b>Overdrive.</b> She moved to Los Angeles in 1986 and received a recurring role in the television series Brothers. In 1987, she auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about the Simpson family on The Tracey Ullman Show. Smith intended to audition for the role of Bart Simpson, but the casting director felt her voice was too high, so she was assigned the role of Lisa, instead. She voiced Lisa for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into their own half-hour show, The Simpsons. For her work as the character, Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992.|$|E
25|$|These {{modified}} JVM Marshall amps were prototypes for {{a signature}} amp that Marshall {{scheduled for release}} in 2011. They replaced the reverb with noise gates that eliminate lag when switching channels. The clean channel {{was replaced by the}} clean channel of a 6100 LM model, which Satriani likes as an option to use distortion pedals with. The orange od channel and the modern red <b>overdrive</b> channel have been better matched with each other as Satriani claims to prefer the organic <b>overdrive</b> of the JVM over pedals. The red <b>overdrive</b> channel was modified for a beefy rock rather than a nu metal sound. The effect loop has been simplified to be serial only.|$|E
