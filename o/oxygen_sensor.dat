40|$|Advancement of gas sensor {{technology}} {{over the past}} few decades has led to significant progress in pollution control and thereby, to environmental protection. An excellent example is the control of automobile exhaust emissions, made possible by the use of <b>oxygen</b> gas <b>sensors.</b> Since early 1970 ’s there have been sustained studies on <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors</b> and has led to development of sensors for various applications with varying performance characteristics. Solid electrolyte based potentiometric, amperometric and metal oxide based semiconducting resistive type sensors are used for high temperature applications. For solution-based pollution monitoring, dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors</b> based on Clark electrodes have played a major role. More recently, for biological and medical applications, optical <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors</b> are beginning to have an impact. In this review, we focus on both high temperature as well as dissolved <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors</b> and compare the different methods of oxygen sensing, discuss underlying principles, and outline the designs and specific applications.

25|$|The sample {{suspended}} in a suitable medium {{is placed in}} a hermetically closed metabolic chamber. The mitochondria are brought into defined “states” by the sequential addition of substrates or inhibitors. Since the mitochondria consume oxygen, the oxygen concentration drops. This change of oxygen concentration is recorded by an <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensor</b> in the chamber. From {{the rate of the}} oxygen decline (taking into account correction for oxygen diffusion) the respiratory rate of the mitochondria can be computed.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the 200, which was equipped with a Stromberg or Pierburg carburetor but was not available to the United States, fuel injection was standard, and the engines incorporated features that maximised performance. The most notable such feature was the addition of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensor</b> in the exhaust system which, in conjunction with a semi-electronic fuel injection system, could make the engine run more efficiently. This improved fuel consumption while simultaneously meeting stricter emission regulations. Mercedes-Benz's four-wheel drive system, the 4Matic was first introduced on the W124 in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Modern EMSs read in {{data from}} various sensors about the {{crankshaft}} position, intake manifold temperature, {{intake manifold pressure}} (or intake air volume), throttle position, fuel mixture via the <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensor,</b> detonation via a knock sensor, and exhaust gas temperature sensors. The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation. As a result, sophisticated electronic ignition systems can be both more fuel efficient, and produce better performance over their counterparts.|$|E

40|$|Gas {{sensors that}} respond {{directly}} to hydrogen are typically {{used to detect}} and quantify unintended hydrogen releases. However, alternative means to quantify or mitigate hydrogen releases are sometimes proposed. One recently explored approach has been to use <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors.</b> This method {{is based on the}} assumption that a hydrogen release will displace oxygen, which can be quantified using <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors.</b> Experimental evaluations designed to impartially assess the ability of <b>oxygen</b> and hydrogen <b>sensors</b> to reliably measure hydrogen concentration changes are presented. Although endorsed by the Global Technical Regulation (GTR) for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Vehicles to verify hydrogen vehicles’ fuel system integrity, the results of this study indicate that the use of <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors</b> for this application may be inappropriate. The sensor testing protocols used for this study included parallel testing of multiple sensors with varying environmental conditions (temperature, pressure, and relative humidity) and gas concentrations. Specific limitations on the use of <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors</b> for hydrogen measurements are identified (e. g. inadequate accuracy for safety applications and may give misleading results under certain conditions) and alternative sensor technologies that meet the requirements for several applications, including those of the GTR, are proposed.

25|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{group of}} researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, developed a novel cryopreservation method {{that helps to}} protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, and facilitates real-time assessments of cell viability. The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response. The use of a real-time single-islet <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensor</b> – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet processing procedure prior to transplantation. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy.|$|E

The exhaust system was overhauled, using a 4-2-1-2 system, meaning four exhaust outlets merging into two pipes, and then joining into a single pipe before splitting into two enlarged, quieter mufflers, which added a few pounds of weight compared to the first generation Hayabusa. The exhaust also included a catalytic converter and an <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensor</b> in order to meet Euro 3 emissions requirements.|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{equipment}} {{includes a}} seal-able metabolic chamber, an <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensor,</b> and devices for data recording, stirring, thermostatisation {{and a way}} to introduce chemicals into the chamber. As described above for whole-animal respirometry the choice of materials is very important. Plastic materials are not suitable for the chamber because of their oxygen storage capacity. When plastic materials are unavoidable (e.g. for o-rings, coatings of stirrers, or stoppers) polymers with a very low oxygen permeability (like PVDF as opposed to e.g. PTFE) may be used. Remaining oxygen diffusion into or out of the chamber materials can be handled by correcting the measured oxygen fluxes for the instrumental oxygen background flux. The entire instrument comprising the mentioned components is often called an oxygraph. The companies providing equipment for whole-animal rspirometry mentioned above are usually not involved in mitochondrial respiromety. The community is serviced at widely varying levels of price and sophistication by companies like Oroboros Instruments, Hansatech, Respirometer Systems & Applications, YSI Life Sciences or Strathkelvin Instruments [...]|$|E
50|$|In {{marine biology}} or limnology, oxygen {{measurements}} are usually done {{in order to}} measure respiration of a community or an organism, but have also been used to measure primary production of algae. The traditional way of measuring oxygen concentration in a water sample has been to use wet chemistry techniques e.g. the Winkler titration method. There are however commercially available <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensors</b> that measure the oxygen concentration in liquids with great accuracy.

2500|$|An {{exception}} to the usage of placing the optic fibre transdermally {{is seen in the}} previously mentioned fibre from Ingo Klimant's group (ruthenium-quenching by oxygen released by glucose-catalysed GOx): The sensor, in fact, was constructed by functionalizing a premade <b>oxygen</b> <b>sensor</b> with Glucose oxydase and inserting it into a glucose-sensing apparatus for amperometric sensors, in particular, a microdialysis catheter CMA 60 implanted transdermally and the sensor connected to its tygon tubing. This sensor was tested in a human volunteer and showed results par with current amperometric systems. The usage of a fibre was dictated by the pre-availability of this compared to a ruthenium-coated lens, which would have had achieved the same results, so this approach should be put in a category of its own alongside transdermal fibres and smart tattoos. However, the aim of the group is to create glucose-sensitive nanoparticles to be interrogated with a transdermal optic fibre and controlled magnetically. [...] As a consequence, the group is improving the oxygen sensing probe by investigating novel oxygen sensitive phosphorescent materials, nanoparticle formulation and the creation of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E
