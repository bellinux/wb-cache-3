50|$|Compared to <b>other</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> Prosecco {{is low in}} alcohol, about 11 to 12 {{percent by}} volume. The flavor of Prosecco has been {{described}} as intensely aromatic and crisp, bringing to mind yellow apple, pear, white peach, and apricot. Unlike Champagne, appreciated for its rich taste and complex secondary aromas, most Prosecco variants have intense primary aromas and are meant to taste fresh, light and comparatively simple. The view that Prosecco cannot be aged has been challenged by other experts, as a recent vertical tasting going back to 1983 demonstrates the longevity of the wines from one of their top producers.|$|R
2500|$|Champagne and <b>other</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> are {{infrequently}} aged, {{and frequently}} have no vintage year (no vintage, NV), but vintage champagne may be aged. Aged champagne {{has traditionally been}} a peculiarly British affectation, and thus {{has been referred to}} as [...] "the English taste", though this term also refers to a level of champagne sweetness. In principle champagne has aging potential, due to the acidity, and aged champagne has increased in popularity in the United States since the 1996 vintage. A few French winemakers have advocated aging champagne, most notably René Collard (1921–2009). In 2009, a 184-year-old bottle of Perrier-Jouët was opened and tasted, still drinkable, with notes of [...] "truffles and caramel", according to the experts.|$|R
25|$|Acidity {{is highest}} in wine grapes {{just before the}} start of veraison, which ushers in the {{ripening}} period of the annual cycle of grape vines. As the grapes ripen, their sugar levels increase and their acidity levels decrease. Through the process of respiration, malic acid is metabolized by the grape vine. Grapes from cooler climate wine regions generally have higher levels of acidity due to the slower ripening process. The level of acidity still present in the grape is an important consideration for winemakers in deciding when to begin harvest. For wines such as Champagne and <b>other</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> having high levels of acidity is even more vital to the winemaking process, so grapes are often picked under-ripe and at higher acid levels.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{constitutes}} the first characterization of Brazilian <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> {{in terms of}} their aromatic compounds. The wines were produced by a traditional method with five classical varieties recognized for the production of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> (Pinot Noir, Pinot Gris, Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling Renano) and five innovative varieties (Moscato Embrapa, Niagara, Villenave, Goethe and Manzoni Bianco) widely used in Brazil for the production of wine. The objective {{of this study was to}} characterize the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> in relation to their chemical composition and volatile compounds content. Of the phenolic compounds determined, the highest concentration was observed for tyrosol. In relation to volatile compounds, twenty-five compounds were determined. Isoamyl acetate was detected in high concentrations in all of the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> particularly Moscato Embrapa (610. 7 μg×L− 1) (odor activity value OAV= 20. 4), and the ethyl octanoate concentration was high in Villenave (976. 6 μg×L− 1) (OAV= 195. 0). High concentrations of monoterpenes, such as linalool, were observed in the Riesling Renano (209. 1 μg×L− 1) (OAV= 8. 4) and geraniol in Moscato Embrapa (128. 6 μg×L− 1) (OAV= 18. 6) wines. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were carried out using the data obtained for the volatile compounds in the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> and the separation of two groups was observed, in which the innovative varieties Moscato Embrapa, Niagara and Villenave were clearly separated from the <b>other</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> These results indicate that the innovative varieties in Brazil can present particular and differentiated characteristics related to the volatile composition, offering an alternative for the production of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> in Brazil...|$|R
2500|$|While most wines {{can benefit}} from lying on their side, Champagne and <b>other</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> tend to age better if they are kept upright. This is because the {{internal}} pressure caused by the trapped carbonic gas provides enough humidity and protection from oxygen. Caterer Magazine claims that the preference for upright storage of Champagne is shared by the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) who conducted an extensive study of Champagnes that were stored in various conditions and orientations. This study found that Champagne stored on its side aged more quickly because oxygen was allowed to seep in after the Champagne corks lost their elasticity due to contact with the wine. [...] However, the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) still recommends storing Champagne on its side, which can be read on their website at: ...|$|R
30|$|These are {{the bulk}} of the results derived from the present study that allowed us to {{highlight}} the profile of the Prosecco purchaser, therefore, to capture the latent preference structure for the product and the selected characteristics of the product. However, the results open a set of theoretical and empirical questions that remain unanswered for further research. First, if we were able to target who likes <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine,</b> {{we may be able to}} understand why they like it. De gustubus disputandum non est (Stiegler and Becker, 1974), however, it is instructive and interesting to understand why a certain consumer profile is associated to the consumption pattern of a particular product. It is interesting to understand whether preferences are formed endogenously (depending on the personal, intimate nature of the individual/consumer) or if they are affected exogenously, with external (socio-economic and cultural) changes. In this perspective, for instance, consumers’ preferences for wine in the last years have evolved towards lighter and fresher products, with lower alcohol content and easier to drink. An important, further research question aims at understanding whether this evidence is due to an exogenous effect on preferences’ structures or is the result of an endogenous change in consumers’ preferences. In order to address those points, further research will also aim at exploring different empirical strategies in order to simultaneously assess the profile of different consumers for different types of other wines, including champagnes and <b>other</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Champagne and {{sometimes}} in <b>other</b> regions producing <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> by the traditional method, the cuvée also refers to the best grape juice from gentle pressing of the grapes. In Champagne, the cuvée is the first 2,050 litres of grape juice from 4,000 kg of grapes (a marc), while the following 500 litres are known as the taille (tail), {{and is expected to}} give wines of a coarser character. Many Champagne producers pride themselves on only using the cuvée in their wine.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tendency}} of still wine from the Champagne region to lightly sparkle was {{noted in the}} Middle Ages but this was considered a wine fault and was disdained in early Champagne winemaking although it made the pride of <b>other</b> historic <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> production areas like Limoux. Dom Pérignon was originally charged by his superiors at the Abbey of Hautvillers {{to get rid of}} the bubbles since the pressure in the bottles caused many of them to burst in the cellar. Later, when deliberate <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> production increased in the early 18th century, cellar workers would still have to wear a heavy iron mask that resembled a baseball catcher's mask to prevent injury from spontaneously bursting bottles. The disturbance caused by one bottle's disintegration could cause a chain reaction, with it being routine for cellars to lose 20–90% of their bottles to instability. The mysterious circumstance surrounding the then unknown process of fermentation and carbonic gas caused some critics to call the sparkling creations [...] "The Devil's Wine".|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} based on both the {{hypothesis}} and observations that grapevines do not grow if the temperature is below 50 °F (10 °C). Each day {{during the growing season}} (assumed under the system to be April 1 through October 31 in the Northern Hemisphere; October 1 through April 30 in the Southern Hemisphere) are assigned growing degree-days according to the amount that the day's average temperature exceeds this threshold; one degree day per degree Fahrenheit over 50 °F (or with SI units, degrees Celsius over 10 °C is used). All days during the growing season are then added up (all negative values are set to zero), with the sum of the growing degree-days used to determine the region's classification in the original Winkler index as follows:The system was originally developed for and is used officially in California and was based on the general ripening capabilities and wine styles that can be achieved in the climate due to heat accumulation (growing degree-days). The general ripening capabilities include hybrid grape varieties through early season, mid-season, and late season ripening V. Vinifera and even table grapes in the warmest areas of Region V. The general wine styles include lighter, more subtle wines with lower alcohol and brighter fruit aromas and flavors (including Champagne and <b>other</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines)</b> found in cooler climates (Regions Ia, Ib, II and lower III) to bolder, bigger wines often with higher alcohol and lush, darker fruit aromas and flavors that are found in warmer climates (Region III, IV and V). Region V was stated as also having a tendency to be more suitable to higher production wines, Sherry and other fortified wines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{method is}} the process used in the Champagne region of France to produce the <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> known as Champagne. It is also the method used in various French regions to produce Crémant or <b>other</b> traditional method <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> in Spain to produce Cava and in Italy to produce Franciacorta. The method {{is known as the}} méthode champenoise, but the Champagne producers have successfully lobbied the European Union to restrict the use of that term within the EU to wines produced from their region. Thus, wines from elsewhere cannot use the term [...] "méthode champenoise" [...] on products sold in the EU, and instead the term [...] "traditional method" [...] (méthode traditionnelle) or the local language equivalent may be seen; for instance, in Germany the term used is [...] "klassische Flaschengärung". South African wines from the Western Cape are labelled with the term [...] "Methode Cap Classique". However, consumers outside the EU may see méthode champenoise used on labels for products made outside France.|$|R
30|$|Finally, the {{interpretation}} of the results might suggest concrete indications for the design of the industrial policy of the Prosecco producer. It is important to highlight that the variables related to product differentiation (spanning from brand, to organoleptic, to bottle format) present estimated coefficients that are not statistically significant. Prosecco CDO is fresh, cheap and with a low alcohol content. These characteristics render the young DINKs the ideal consumers for this product. The main suggestion, therefore, is to use a simple pricing strategy. In fact we can corroborate this industrial policy suggestion by looking at the price trends of Prosecco with respect to <b>other</b> <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines</b> that could be considered substitutes for this product. As shown in section 3, the Prosecco price has increased over the studied period in order to align with the prices of the main substitutes. The competitive advantage of Prosecco relies {{in the fact that the}} Charmat method is relative cheaper with respect to the Champenoise, with which the <b>other</b> main Italian <b>sparkling</b> dry <b>wines</b> are produced. This represents an important insight for industrial policy since producers have to be very careful in their pricing strategy in order to avoid generating (marginal) losses of market shares. In particular, we can compute marginal effects and predict that a 1 % increase in the Prosecco CDO price will decrease the probability that a consumer buys the product by 0.36 %. In addition, a 1 % increase in the Prosecco CGDO price will decrease the probability that a consumer buys the product by 0.26 %. The different sensitivity to price changes is corroborated by the fact that Prosecco CGDO consumers express a preference for the product characteristics (brand and taste) and might be more loyal to the product than Prosecco CDO purchasers. The choice of the trade channel also impacts the pricing strategy. The LSRT can sell large stock of products at relatively low prices. This means that, especially for the smallest Prosecco wineries, it could be more convenient to look at other sales channels (e.g. HoReCa). This strategy seems to be already partially implemented by the firms, and is assessed in our data sample since only five brands (out of a total of 95) have sold almost 50 % of the Proseccos.|$|R

40|$|The foaming {{properties}} in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> are {{an indicator of}} quality {{as it is the}} first quality perception consumers have upon opening a bottle of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> Proteins, which are derived from both grapes and yeast during <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> production, are known to impact the foaming {{properties in}} finished <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines.</b> The objectives of this project were to (1) understand the role and relationship that proteins have on the overall foaming properties and overall quality in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine,</b> (2) determine the role different yeast and grape clones from different varietals have on <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality and (3) understand how bentonite affects <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality. The protein concentration in <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> produced from Mariafeld Pinot noir appeared to impact the foaming properties. The longest elapsed time for foam dissipation was observed in the control treatment where bentonite was not used to strip protein and the shortest time was observed in the treatment where bentonite was used to remove grape and yeast proteins. In Riesling <b>sparkling</b> <b>wines,</b> the largest protein concentrations were observed in non-bentonite treated juices while the lowest were observed in the bentonite treatments. The prevalence of foam observed in both bentonite treatments, where grape proteins were completely removed, indicated that proteins derived over the course of secondary fermentation were foam forming in Riesling <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> It was also observed that different yeast, varietals, clones and soil compositions may impact the protein concentrations, chemical compositions and overall quality of <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine.</b> The results of this research aim to better understand <b>sparkling</b> <b>wine</b> quality to optimize production in the Niagara Peninsula...|$|R
