5|$|Initially {{portrayed as}} an {{imaginary}} {{character in a}} schizophrenia storyline, Rae was later revealed to be real when she arrived to study in Hollyoaks.

She miscarried during an argument with Brendan and subsequently feuded with him; Barlow praised her character for being {{one of the few who}} dared to oppose the Hollyoaks villain.

During series four of the post-watershed spin-off Hollyoaks Later, Rae was murdered by a serial killer, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). The late broadcast slot allowed an explicit depiction of her death.

5|$|The 1970 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> NBA history as it produced seven Hall of Famers and twelve All-Stars. Three of the first four picks were inducted to the Hall of Fame and seven of the first eight picks became All-Stars. The 1970 Draft is also known as the first draft where international players who had never played U.S. high school and college basketball were selected. In the 10th and 11th round, the Atlanta Hawks drafted Mexican Manuel Raga and Italian Dino Meneghin; both were playing in the Italian league at the time. They became the first two international players drafted to the NBA. However, neither of them ever played in the league as the Hawks did not have US$35,000 to buy out either of their contracts with their teams. Meneghin, who played 28 seasons in Italy, has been inducted by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) to the FIBA Hall of Fame and also to the Basketball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|The 1984 draft {{class is}} {{considered}} to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>in</b> NBA history as it produced five Hall of Famers and seven All-Stars. However, it was also marked by the Blazers' selection of Sam Bowie, considered one of the biggest draft busts in NBA history. It is believed that the Blazers picked Bowie over Michael Jordan because they already had an All Star shooting guard in Jim Paxson and a young shooting guard in Clyde Drexler, whom they drafted in the 1983 draft. Although Drexler went on to have a successful career, Bowie's career was cut short by injuries; he had missed two of the past three seasons in his college career as well. Despite having a 10-year career in the NBA and averaging 10.9points and 7.5rebounds per game, Bowie's career was interrupted by five leg surgeries, which limited him to 139games in 5years with the Blazers.|$|E
