25|$|Despite {{the large}} amounts of money spent on the schemes, they were not {{particularly}} effective, because of the failure to provide an outfall at Marfleet. Ship owners continued to oppose such a plan until at least 1810, and there was an agricultural depression from 1815 to 1830. During this period, the port of Hull developed, with the opening of Humber Dock in 1809 and Junction Dock (later Princes Dock) in 1829. By the time the agricultural industry began to recover, the carrs were in a bad state, but so was the Old Harbour at Hull. Holderness Drainage acted quickly, obtaining an Act of Parliament in 1832, which authorised the construction of a drain to Marfleet, where the outlet sluice (known locally as a clow) could be built at a lower level than previous outlets, thus providing a better gradient for the flow of the water. The old Main Drain was embanked where it crossed the carrs, and was used to carry runoff from the streams of Holderness to the Hull. The new lowland drain carried water from the carrs to Marfleet, passing under the upland drain in the Great Culvert. Where possible, <b>old</b> <b>drains</b> were made straighter, wider and deeper, and the meres in the Leven and Tickton area soon disappeared. By 1854, around one sixth of the land was still subject to occasional winter flooding, but most of the carrs were by then used for crops, rather than for pasture.|$|E
30|$|Building work: the {{external}} brickwork shows an advanced degradation {{especially in the}} northern and western façades. In these façades, the plasters are so friable that an integral preservation is not possible. Cement patches evidenced a previous restoration work not compatible {{with the type of}} building. The deterioration was due to the seepages of water coming from the roof and to the humidity coming from {{the external}} surface. During the excavation work around the building, <b>old</b> <b>drains</b> emerged. In the beginning, these drains had the function of carrying the rainwater and the groundwater {{to the side of the}} church.|$|E

50|$|The {{silver maple}} is often planted as an {{ornamental}} tree {{because of its}} rapid growth and ease of propagation and transplanting. It is highly tolerant of urban situations, and is frequently planted next to streets. However, its quick growth produces brittle wood, which is commonly damaged in storms. The silver maple's root system is shallow and fibrous, and easily invades septic fields and <b>old</b> <b>drain</b> pipes; it can also crack sidewalks and foundations. It is a vigorous resprouter, and if not pruned, will often grow with multiple trunks. Although it naturally is found near water, it can grow on drier ground if planted there. In ideal natural conditions, A. saccharinum may live up 130 years, but in urban environments often 80 or less.|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{drainage}} (ditching) {{is widely}} used to increase timber yield in northern forests. When the drainage systems are maintained, their environmental impacts are likely to accumulate over time and along accompanying management, notably after logging when new forest develops on decayed peat. Our study provides the first comprehensive documentation of long-term ditching impacts on terrestrial and arboreal biodiversity by comparing natural alder swamps and second-generation drained forests that have evolved from such swamps in Estonia. We explored species composition of four potentially drainage-sensitive taxonomic groups (vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens, and snails), abundance of species of conservation concern, and their relationships with stand structure in two-ha plots representing four management types (ranging from old growth to clearcut). We found that drainage affected plot-scale species richness only weakly but it profoundly changed assemblage composition. Bryophytes and lichens were the taxonomic groups that were most sensitive both to drainage and timber-harvesting; in closed stands they responded to changed microhabitat structure, notably impoverished tree diversity and dead-wood supply. As a result, natural old-growth plots were the most species-rich and hosted several specific species of conservation concern. Because the most influential structural changes are slow, drainage impacts may be long hidden. The results also indicated that even very <b>old</b> <b>drained</b> stands do not provide quality habitats for old-growth species of drier forest types. However, drained forests hosted many threatened species that were less site typ...|$|R
2500|$|The South Holland Drainage District was {{established}} by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793. At the time, the main <b>drain</b> was the <b>Old</b> Shire <b>Drain,</b> which had been cut from Clowes Cross to Tydd in 1629 by the Adventurers of the Bedford Level, a group of early venture capitalists. The drain was {{also known as the}} South Eau or <b>Old</b> South Holland <b>Drain,</b> and its outfall was into the River Nene at Tydd Gote through a sluice. Prior to obtaining the Act, landowners in South Holland had engaged George Maxwell and John Hudson to draw up plans for a drainage scheme. Maxwell was a land agent and engineer, while Hudson was a surveyor. They made an initial inspection in November 1791, after which they employed others to conduct a full survey. They returned in August 1792, and Maxwell measured the fall on the proposed route as [...] in [...] The estimated cost of the project was nearly £18,000, of which the cutting of the drain accounted for £8,450 and the construction of the sluice at Peters Point on the Nene, £3,100. Their plans were well received, and formed the basis for the Act of Parliament.|$|R
50|$|As {{the water}} from the Baltic Ice Lake withdrew, the land around present-day Sölvesborg became {{accessible}} to settlers from what today is Denmark. The first people to settle were farmers; remains of their presence have been found in the area dating back to the stone age, mostly in the area around Gammalstorp, Siretorp and Istaby. The hill in the east, marking the border towards Karlshamn called Ryssberget, was a direct creation of the glacial movements. On the western side of the hill, the different times of ice withdrawal are clearly noticeable. The <b>old,</b> now <b>drained</b> lake of Vesan was also a product of the ice age.|$|R
40|$|AbstractRetained {{intraperitoneal}} Penrose drain {{secondary to}} fracture and adhesions {{in the immediate}} postoperative period happens on occasion. Most are unreported because {{of the fear of}} medico-legal problems. Previous management of such iatrogenic complications requires repeated laparotomy or wound exploration. Two patients who underwent appendectomy for ruptured appendicitis, with retained intraabdominal drains in the immediate postoperative period, managed eventually by laparoscopic retrieval are presented. Both patients had right low transverse incisions and intraabdominal drains exiting through a separate right lateral abdomen skin opening. Patient 1 had a stuck intraabdominal drain unable to be removed up to the second week. Patient 2 ’s drain retracted intraperitoneally after its mobilization on the sixth post-op day. Both were managed by laparoscopy under general anesthesia with successful removal of both drains. Patient 1 underwent the procedure 3 weeks after the appendectomy, whereas Patient 2 had the procedure on her sixth post-op day. An additional new 1 -cm wound in the periumbilical area was done for the introduction of pneumoperitoneum and 10 -mm port for which the laparoscope was inserted. The second 5 -mm port was inserted through the <b>old</b> <b>drain</b> site wound with peritoneal entry opening separate from the previous peritoneal defect viewed from laparoscope. Both drains had some marked adhesions from ingrowth of omentum to the side holes of the drain, causing it to get stuck in the pelvic cavity. This laparoscopic approach in the management of such iatrogenic complication, besides being cosmetically acceptable, contributes to early recovery and discharge of the patient, and helps to lessen the friction in the recently worsening doctor-patient relationship in Taiwan...|$|R

5000|$|The term groden (c.f. the English verb [...] "to grow") used in Lower Saxony, {{particularly}} {{in the eastern part}} of East Frisia and in the Oldenburg Land, refers to new areas of land washed up by the sea.

As a result of draining the fertile soil compacts and, over time, can sink until it is below sea level. The rising sea level in front of the dyke and the sinking of the <b>old,</b> now <b>drained,</b> sea areas behind the dyke leads to further dykes being built at an ever-higher level to enclose the newly dyked areas of marsh.

In order to relieve flooding in the valley of the River Hull, water from the north of Foston, which formerly drained into the Hull, was diverted to a sea outfall at Barmston. In order to ensure that the water flowed in the opposite direction to the new outfall, various channel were made deeper, and a barrier was constructed at Foston, to prevent the water following its former course. Old Howe Lane, the road that runs from Foston to Beeford crosses the barrier, which is still labelled The Barrier on modern maps. The ditch to the north-east of the road flows northwards to the sea, and is called the Barmston Main Drain; that to the south-west is now the <b>Old</b> Howe <b>Drain</b> and flows to Frodingham Beck, the River Hull and the Humber to reach the sea.|$|R
