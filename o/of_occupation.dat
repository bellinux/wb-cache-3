This offensive is also considered part of the Third Enemy Offensive in Yugoslav historiography. After Operation Trio, NDH forces remained south of the demarcation line between the German and Italian zones <b>of</b> <b>occupation,</b> in spite of protests from the Italians.|$|E

50|$|People {{rate the}} ‘general standing’ <b>of</b> an <b>occupation</b> (the most common question). It {{is taken to}} be a measure of {{occupational}} prestige and hence of the social status <b>of</b> <b>occupations.</b> Many other criteria have been proposed, including ‘social usefulness’ as well as ‘prestige’ and ‘status’ themselves. In order to obtain the scale <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> (which is invariably taken to be national in application), respondents' ratings are aggregated.|$|R

5|$|Various {{artefacts}} {{have been}} uncovered representing the long period <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> {{of the site}} at Dolebury Warren. These include flintwork from the Palaeolithic, bronze spearheads, Bronze Age pottery, and Roman pottery and coins. There is evidence <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> of the site during the Iron Age. The defences and Celtic field systems there {{date back to the}} 7th century−3rd century BCE, though they might mask earlier developments. The hillfort was occupied until approximately 100BC, though it is possible that it was reoccupied in the Roman and post-Roman periods. The archeological consultant Peter Leach has suggested there may even have been a Roman Temple built within the hillfort, while aerial photographs suggest the probable remains of an Iron Age or Roman coaxial field system. Local historian Robin Atthill also suggests that Dolebury may have re-emerged as an important centre of population in the 5th century.|$|E

There is evidence of multiple phases <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> with different styles of decoration, including flower and leaf patterns, geometric patterns, animal and human figures and epigraphy. Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites. Evidence of cultural exchange with Egypt is less than might be expected, while the remains show a surprising amount of contact with al-Andalus, despite the continuous hostilities between the Fatimids and the Umayyads of the Iberian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short period}} <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> duty, the 44th Infantry Division {{returned}} to the United States in July 1945 where it began training for deployment to the Pacific Theater. As part of Operation Coronet it was intended that Dean would lead the division during the planned invasion of Honshū, but the war {{came to an end}} before this took place and the operation was subsequently cancelled. Dean then oversaw the drawdown of the division until he was relieved of command on November 1, 1945. The 44th Infantry Division was disbanded {{by the end of that}} month.|$|E
5|$|After {{conversion}} to M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyers, the battalion moved into Germany, helping force a bridgehead over the Neckar River at the Battle of Heilbronn.

After two weeks <b>of</b> <b>occupation</b> duties it was ordered to prepare for service in the Pacific; however, while it was reforming in the United States, the Japanese surrender was announced, {{and the need for}} more combat units ended. The battalion was demobilized in September 1945.|$|E

30|$|The series titled “Counterfactual” in Fig.  4 a, b {{show that}} changes in the {{composition}} of the labour force would have increased the share <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> placed at {{the upper end of the}} wage distribution instead of the polarization process described above. During the recession, compositional changes, if anything, might have contributed even more to the expansion <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> at the upper part of the wage distribution. Therefore, supply side changes cannot explain the increase in the share <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> at the low end of the wage distribution and hence we require additional explanations to understand the observed polarization process.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Do similar job titles {{refer to}} the same work activities, as assumed often, but hardly empirically tested? The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the {{similarity}} <b>of</b> 160 <b>occupations</b> within and across eight European countries using interrater agreement statistics (rWG). Design/methodology/approach - Using a multilingual web survey, experts and jobholders in the eight countries rated the frequency of ten tasks per occupation they had knowledge of (n= 4, 197 ratings). Three hypotheses are investigated: first, interrater agreements <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> are similar regardless the country; second, interrater agreements <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> are similar within countries; and third, experts and jobholders are similar in their ratings. Findings - Half <b>of</b> the <b>occupations</b> reveal no agreement across ratings, one-third shows a weak/moderate agreement and one in ten shows a strong agreement. H 1 is rejected for task frequency but not for task importance. Within-country similarity <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> is larger than across-country similarity. H 2 is supported for two countries and rejected for two other countries. H 3 is not supported. Jobholders demonstrate higher agreement than experts. Research limitations/implications - An empirical testing of occupation-specific tasks for a wide range <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> across Europe seems a viable approach. Practical implications - The paper contributes to the challenges related to labor market mobility across borders. Originality/value - Work tasks for a wide range <b>of</b> <b>occupations</b> and countries, using job-specific work activities in combination with web surveys and the internet for recruitment of jobholders, have not been used before...|$|R
