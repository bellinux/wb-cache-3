[...] "Once Steven decided he wasn't going to do it, we put the script {{back to the way}} it was," [...] recalls Jinks. [...] "Steven even said, 'I think I made a mistake with a couple <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> asked you guys to try.'" [...] August took his favorite elements from the previous drafts, coming up with what he called [...] "a best-of Big Fish script.

500|$|Following the 2010 season, Kafka {{said that}} his goal for the 2011 offseason was to [...] "continue to learn the offense. I haven't {{mastered}} it by any means, the more study and preparation I can get the better. Physically, I can work on my feet, my arm strength, and my timing and rhythm. There's a bunch <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> can work on, and I'm really excited to get to it." [...] Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Kafka is the hardest working player in the NFL, but needs to get bigger and stronger. The Eagles reportedly received trade offers from other teams for Kafka prior to the 2011 NFL Draft but declined due to his potential. Kafka, in response, laughed and {{did not believe the}} rumors.|$|E

500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary {{for the vice}} president not to rule on disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with his experience as a presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> don't know, I also know a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all." [...] Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration's legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the [...] "assistant President".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked whether}} the album was thematically {{different}} from Fallen, Lee said that [...] "all of the negative and hard, difficult experiences" [...] that characterized the band's music still came across, but displays a less hopeless attitude. Rather than wallowing in [...] "the hard stuff", the record's theme reflects on looking for solutions and happiness. In an interview with MTV News, Lee said about the album's title: I feel like I {{have the ability to}} do a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> couldn't do before, for a number of reasons......A lot of doors have kind of been opened in my life—not just since everything has happened for us. The singer also felt the band [...] "broke the doors" [...] and tried doing different things, which was also an inspiration for the title. Simon Cosyns of The Sun labelled the record's artwork—which sees Lee in front of an open door—as [...] " [...] the dark Evanescence image intact, with sinister fairytale scenes, elaborate Victorian gothic arches, illuminated typography and elaborate flowing dresses". Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters praised the album cover, calling it [...] " [...] gother-looking piece." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E

500|$|On 7 January 2009, Barton was {{questioned}} by the Indian media on why she chose to sign on the project to which she responded [...] "I'm interested in all kinds <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> did this film for moral reasons. Also, I felt the story needed to be told, I {{feel that this is}} going to be an important film." [...] Benjamin Wallfisch, an Emmy and Ivor Novello-nominated composer, composed music for the movie Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain. The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release. On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film's earning. Chouhan called the film [...] "very sensitive" [...] and praised the [...] "heart-rending" [...] performance given by actors. To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal Paytm and the online shopping website Snapdeal. As part of the partnership Paytm and Snapdeal offered their customers a chance to donate money in form of online coupons to the disaster victims.|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the singer using sexually {{explicit}} language to describe an evening {{at her home}} where she is cooking a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone, [...] "I'm in my penthouse half-naked / I cook this meal for you naked". Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes, do the type <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> never ever do. I take one look in the mirror, and I say to myself, 'Baby girl, you can't survive like this.'" [...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness. As she continues to describe her love–hate relationship detailing her emotions, Beyoncé sings the song's bridge: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> <b>I</b> think even its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E

2500|$|When {{questioned}} by reporters, Cowell said, [...] "There {{are a lot}} <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> will eventually clear up {{when the time is}} right, but I really have to be sensitive because there's a lot of people's feelings involved here." [...] The Silvermans released separate statements expressing concern for the well-being of their son during the divorce process. In August 2013, the Silvermans settled their divorce out of court, enabling Cowell to avoid being called as a witness in the divorce proceedings. Cowell subsequently confirmed that Silverman was pregnant with his child, and she gave birth to baby Eric on 14 February 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Hopper began {{painting}} {{urban and}} architectural scenes {{in a dark}} palette. Then he shifted to the lighter palette of the Impressionists {{before returning to the}} darker palette with which he was comfortable. Hopper later said, [...] "I got over that and later things done in Paris were more the kind <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> do now." [...] Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and café scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract cubist experiments, Hopper was attracted to realist art. Later, he admitted to no European influences other than French engraver Charles Méryon, whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{were playing}} a Shield game in Queensland and I threw my arm out {{on the day before}} the match," [...] he recalls. “I lost a lot of power, and a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> could do before I wasn’t able to do. So I {{probably}} changed my technique after that to get more side-on, but I probably got more back-on. I was coming in to bowl but I was facing the wrong way.

2500|$|In 2011, Ai sat on {{the jury}} of an {{international}} initiative to find a universal Logo for Human Rights. The winning design, combining {{the silhouette of a}} hand with that of a bird, was chosen from more than 15,300 suggestions from over 190 countries. The initiative's goal was to create an internationally recognized logo to support the global human rights movement. In 2013, after the existence of the PRISM surveillance program was revealed, Ai said [...] "Even though we know governments do all kinds <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> was shocked by the information about the US surveillance operation, Prism. To me, it's abusively using government powers to interfere in individuals' privacy. This is an important moment for international society to reconsider and protect individual rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 22 November 2014 Cleverly and Tony Bellew {{had their}} rematch, {{this time they}} were both {{fighting}} as cruiserweights. The fight {{took place at the}} Echo Arena in Liverpool. This was also a WBO cruiserweight title eliminator. The title was held by Marco Huck at the time. The bout went 12 rounds as Bellew won via split decision (115-113, 116-112 & 114-115). In the post-fight interview, Bellew said, [...] "I’m over the moon, listen it’s over, it’s put to bed. We said a lot <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> don’t like him now, but it’s been settled tonight. It’s over, it’s done and I've outworked a great athlete." [...] He also stated that he would do a rubber match at Millennium Stadium if there was any demand for it. Cleverly said he struggled with dealing with Bellew at a higher weight.|$|E
2500|$|As soon as {{the results}} of the March 9, 2008 {{primaries}} were announced, NPP's Second Vice President, Miriam Ramírez de Ferrer, announced her immediate resignation, saying [...] "Effectively right now I am no longer the Second Vice President of this party.

There's a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> haven't done I want to do, and I'll also do some things I have to do to help the statehood cause". Ramírez was a candidate for Resident Commissioner in the primaries and was openly supporting Rosselló. She lost to Fortuño's candidate, Pedro Pierluisi, and to another Rosselló supporter who was also defeated, former Senate President, Charlie Rodríguez. When Ramírez was asked by the media if she will vote for Fortuño, she replied [...] "My vote is secret".|$|E

2500|$|AXS writer Terrance Pryor {{considers}} What to Do When You Are Dead {{a concept}} album [...] "based around the main character's suicide and his {{journey through the}} afterlife". Some observers have noted the character going through the Kübler-Ross 5-stage model of grief management. Jorgensen {{grew up in a}} [...] "very scientific environment," [...] which caused him to be influenced by British writer Craig Hamilton-Parker. The album's title comes from a Hamilton-Parker book. Jorgensen explained that since he was [...] "already writing an album in that way, and when I saw that book, I thought, 'It would be really cool to make a whole album out of this." [...] Jorgensen later remarked that placing himself in that perspective helped him [...] "face a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> probably would've been too much of a wuss to face, if I didn't pretend I wasn't alive". The band were initially hesitant working on a concept album until they were persuaded by Jorgensen.|$|E

[...] "I have to tell you, I am in love with Judy Blye Wilson and Jean Dadario Burke [...] Jean is like my mother, and Judy is like my best friend. It's been really nice to be around people like that." [...] Budig additionally noted her favoritism for Jennifer Bassey (Marian). [...] "She's taken me under her wing a little bit.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{objections to}} the inanimate whose date from the late 18th century.

[...] The English James Buchanan in his Regular English Syntax of 1767 considered inanimate whose an incorrect construction that occurs [...] "in the lower kind of poetry and prose", but accepted it in [...] "solemn poetry" [...] when used for personification. [...] In his Plain and Complete Grammar of 1772, Anselm Bayly accepted use of the inanimate whose. [...] The English grammarian Joseph Priestley wrote that whose [...] "may {{be said to be}} the genitive of which", but objected to such use in the 3rd edition of The Rudiments of English Grammar in 1772: [...] "The word whose begins likewise to be restricted to persons, but it is not done so generally but that good writers, and even in prose, use it when speaking <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> do not think, however, that the construction is generally pleasing." ...|$|E
