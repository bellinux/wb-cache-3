The poem's narration reflects on how humankind {{is affected by}} Original Sin, that they can follow the paths of either good <b>or</b> <b>evil,</b> {{and that they can}} atone for their sins. To help the individual, the poem explains that people must leave the time-bound world and look into their selves, and that poets must seek out a perfection, not bound by time in their images, to escape from the problems of language.|$|E

These choices ultimately affect character growth, the reaction of the City's populace towards Cole, and finer elements of gameplay and the story.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good <b>or</b> <b>evil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{important}} texts {{were created}} and studied by scholars. Philosophical works written by Yang Xiong (53 BC – 18 AD), Huan Tan (43 BC – 28 AD), Wang Chong (27–100 AD), and Wang Fu (78–163 AD) questioned whether human nature was innately good <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> and posed challenges to Dong's universal order. The Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Tan (d. 110 BC) {{and his son}} Sima Qian (145–86 BC) established the standard model for all of imperial China's Standard Histories, such as the Book of Han written by Ban Biao (3–54 AD), his son Ban Gu (32–92 AD), and his daughter Ban Zhao (45–116 AD). There were dictionaries such as the Shuowen Jiezi by Xu Shen (c. 58 – c. 147 AD) and the Fangyan by Yang Xiong. Biographies on important figures were written by various gentrymen. Han dynasty poetry was dominated by the fu genre, which achieved its greatest prominence {{during the reign of}} Emperor Wu.|$|E

25|$|The spiritual {{barometer}} is on {{the lower}} {{left side of the}} screen. This is a close-up view of the main character currently being played. Since good behavior is meaningless lacking the temptation to do evil, each character is free to do good <b>or</b> <b>evil</b> acts.
