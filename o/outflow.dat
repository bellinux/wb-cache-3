As it turned west-southwestward, an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery, and the JTWC upgraded Gamede to tropical cyclone status, or the equivalence of a minimal hurricane. Subsequently, its intensification rate slowed somewhat, due to restricted <b>outflow.</b> At 0000UTC on February 23 the MFR upgraded the storm to Tropical Cyclone Gamede, and shortly thereafter it passed over St. Brandon island. Subsequently, <b>outflow</b> became better established, and the JTWC unofficially estimated the cyclone attained winds of 185km/h (115mph) late on February 23 about 250km (400mi) north-northeast of Mauritius island. Initially it was forecast to strengthen further, though slight weakening occurred when a nearby upper-level trough restricted <b>outflow.</b>|$|E
5|$|Banding {{features}} and <b>outflow</b> continued to develop as {{a ring of}} convection formed around the center of Fabian, and on August 30, the storm intensified into a hurricane while gradually slowing its motion to the west-northwest. As banding {{features and}} <b>outflow</b> became better defined, an eye developed {{in the center of}} the deepest convection. Fabian quickly strengthened and attained major hurricane status late that day. Deep convection became very concentric around the 11.5mile (18.5km) wide eye, and the hurricane reached winds of 125mph (205km/h) early on August 31. At this time, the deepest convection near the eye degraded in appearance, and Fabian temporarily stopped its strengthening trend. Later that day, the eye became distinct again within a perfectly round area of deep convection. <b>Outflow</b> continued to expand in all directions, and Fabian intensified into a Category 4 hurricane late on August 31. Thunderstorm activity near the eyewall became more intense, and the cloud tops in the eyewall became much cooler; simultaneously, <b>outflow</b> away from the eye became much more symmetrical, both signs of an intensifying tropical cyclone. Fabian reached its peak intensity of 145mph (230km/h) on September 1 while located 345miles (555km) east of the northern Lesser Antilles.|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of massive stars exceeding 10 M sun usually results in large-scale molecular <b>outflows.</b> Numerical simulations, including ionization, of the {{formation of}} such stars show evidence for ionization-driven molecular <b>outflows.</b> Here we examine whether the <b>outflows</b> seen in these models reproduce the observations. We compute synthetic ALMA and CARMA maps of CO emission lines of the <b>outflows,</b> and compare their signatures to existing single-dish and interferometric data. We find that the ionization-driven models can only reproduce weak <b>outflows</b> around high-mass star-forming regions. We argue that expanding H II regions probably do not represent the dominant mechanism for driving observed <b>outflows.</b> We suggest instead that observed <b>outflows</b> are driven by the collective action of the <b>outflows</b> from the many lower-mass stars that inevitably form around young massive stars in a cluster...|$|R

I will present an analytical model for how stellar feedback simultaneously regulates star formation and drives <b>outflows.</b> One interesting prediction of the model is that although stellar feedback can efficiently generate <b>outflows</b> in all galaxies at high redshift, it is unable to drive <b>outflows</b> in massive galaxies below z ~ 1. This prediction agrees with the results of state-of-the-art cosmological zoom simulations that include explicit stellar feedback. This model, combined with the aforementioned simulations, suggests that high-redshift galaxies are highly turbulent, disordered and characterized by strong starbursts and subsequent violent <b>outflows,</b> and the suppression of <b>outflows</b> in massive galaxies at z ~ 1 is crucial for the emergence of well-ordered, steadily star-forming disk galaxies...|$|R

The effect on quality, time, and operating <b>outflows</b> can be absolute or relative, while the effect on fixed <b>outflows</b> can only be absolute. All process-level projects cause investment outflows—for example, the hiring of additional workers for an insurance company’s claim settlement process. This project increases the periodic fixed <b>outflows</b> of the claim settlement process (e.g., by 50 TEUR), increases the operating <b>outflows</b> (e.g., by 5  %), reduces the average cycle time (e.g., by 25  %), and increases quality by ensuring fewer mistakes (e.g., by 15  %). In another example, adopting a workflow management system for claim settlement reduces the average cycle time (e.g., by 10  min) due to enhanced resource allocation and increases quality in terms of customer satisfaction (e.g., by 10 points). The project also increases the process’ fixed <b>outflows</b> (e.g., by 15 TEUR) and operating <b>outflows</b> (e.g., by 100 EUR per instance) due to improved maintenance.

30|$|<b>Outflows</b> in {{the form}} of jets and winds are {{observed}} from many disc accreting objects ranging from young stars to systems with white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes. A large body of observations exists for <b>outflows</b> from young stars at different stages of their evolution, ranging from protostars, where powerful collimated <b>outflows</b> - jets - are observed, to classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) where the <b>outflows</b> are weaker and often less collimated (see review by Ray et al.

Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 16 while located around 290miles (465km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Due to the tropical depression moving over an area of warm water temperatures with favorable upper level <b>outflow,</b> the National Hurricane Center forecast the tropical depression to slowly intensify to 70mph (110km/h) winds within 72hours the forecast early on September 16.|$|E

40|$|<b>Outflows</b> {{from active}} galactic nuclei (AGNs) {{seem to be}} common and {{are thought to be}} {{important}} from a variety of perspectives: as an agent of chemical enhancement of the interstellar and intergalactic media, as an agent of angular momentum removal from the accreting central engine, and as an agent limiting star formation in starbursting systems by blowing out gas and dust from the host galaxy. To understand these processes, we must determine what fraction of AGNs feature <b>outflows</b> and understand what forms they take.

If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs rather quickly, approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an <b>outflow</b> boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an <b>outflow</b> boundary.

40|$|Abstract. The {{plethora of}} {{asymmetric}} planetary nebulae and the curiously high momenta of pre-planetary nebula <b>outflows</b> suggest that rotational energy is {{extracted from the}} engines. Magneto-rotational <b>outflows</b> driven by dynamos might be operating therein. I summarize scenarios involving (a) an isolated AGB star and (b) a binary. The efficacy of (a) requires re-establishing differential rotation over the AGB star’s lifetime, whereas (b) delivers the angular momentum {{at the end of}} the AGB phase when needed, and may involve turbulent disks. Both can produce fields that drive <b>outflows</b> of the required mechanical luminosity and momentum, though weak points and open questions require further study. 1.

40|$|Context. It is {{generally}} presumed that the <b>outflows</b> from a YSO are directed {{close to its}} rotation axis (i. e. along its angular momentum vector and orthogonal to any attendant accretion disc). Many YSOs are formed from dense prestellar cores embedded in filaments, and therefore the relative orientations of <b>outflows</b> and filaments may place a useful constraint on the dynamics of core formation. Aims. We explore this possibility, {{from the viewpoint of}} what it may tell us about the angular momentum delivered to a core forming in a filament. We stress that we are not here addressing the issue of the relationship of filaments and <b>outflows</b> to the prevailing magnetic field direction, although this is evidently also an interesting issue. Methods. We use data from the literature and the SCUBA archive to estimate the projected angles between 45 observed <b>outflows</b> and the filaments which appear to contain their driving sources. The distribution of these angles is then compared with model predictions, so as to obtain a statistical constraint on the distribution of intrinsic angles between <b>outflows</b> and filaments. Results. Using the limited data available, and neglecting any possible selection effects or correlations between nearby <b>outflows,</b> we infer that the observed <b>outflows</b> have a tendency to be orthogonal to the filaments that contain their driving sources. Specfically, in the cases where the directions of the filaments and <b>outflows</b> are well defined, we infer statistically that of <b>outflows</b> are within of being orthogonal to the filament, and only are within of being parallel to the filament. Conclusions. This suggests that the prestellar cores which spawned the YSOs driving the observed <b>outflows</b> had angular momenta which were approximately orthogonal to the filaments out of which the cores formed.

Our purpose is to study the evolution of the <b>outflows</b> in the intermediate corona from AR 8100, from the time the AR first forms until it dissolves, after several transits at the solar limb. Data acquired by SOHO/UVCS {{at the time of the}} AR limb transits, at medium latitudes and at altitudes ranging from 1. 5 to 2. 3 R_sun, were used to infer the physical properties of the <b>outflows</b> through the AR evolution.

Plasma speeds and electron densities of the <b>outflows</b> were inferred over several rotations of the Sun. AR <b>outflows</b> are present in the newly born AR and persist throughout the entire AR life. Moreover, we found two types of <b>outflows</b> at different latitudes, both possibly originating in the same negative polarity area of the AR. We also analyzed the behavior of the Si XII 520 A line along the UVCS slit in an attempt to reveal changes in the Si abundance when different regions are traversed. Although we found some evidence for a Si enrichment in the AR <b>outflows,</b> alternative interpretations are also plausible. Our results demonstrate that <b>outflows</b> from ARs are detectable in the intermediate corona throughout the whole AR lifetime. This confirms that <b>outflows</b> contribute to the slow wind.
