25|$|It is {{generally}} considered inappropriate {{for a man to}} remove his jacket during a formal social event, but when hot weather and humidity dictate, the ranking man (of the royal family, the guest of honor) may give men permission by noticeably taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> In anticipated hot weather, Red Sea rig is specified in the invitation, although this dress is esoteric in civilian circles, and is particular to certain expatriate communities.|$|E
25|$|While {{in command}} of the Jane, Rodgers' strong and {{determined}} character was made evident during one of his voyages navigating the North Sea. Adverse winter winds had carried the vessel off course, the ship's provisions were almost exhausted, and three of his crewmen had frozen to death in one night, while most of the others had lapsed into hopeless despair. When Rodgers ordered some of the crew to go aloft to secure the ice encrusted rigging, they refused. Outraged at their desolation, Rodgers stripped <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and shirt and, before going aloft, told the insubordinate crew to watch what a man could do. While he climbed the frozen rigging bare-chested, the crew, awe struck, immediately rose to his aid and in little time they secured the faltering rigging. Under the grim circumstances of their situation Rodgers put the matter behind him and days later they safely reached port.|$|E
500|$|Wrigley {{became a}} {{familiar}} and popular {{figure for the}} thousands of Australian airmen who passed through London during the war, and was known to take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and tend bar at Codgers, the headquarters' watering hole. An EATS graduate later remarked that [...] "under Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley we got tremendous service... I was in North Africa, Italy, Sardinia, Corsica and then back in the United Kingdom. We got our mail, we got our comforts... Not only that, when some cow went and pinched 100 quid from me when I was on leave in London, the next day, with a shaking hand, I was able to sign for another 100 quid and have a good time." ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the game}} went to extra time, Netzer {{spoke to the}} {{exhausted}} Christian Kulik, asking whether he still felt fit. Upon Kulik expressing doubt, Netzer took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> training <b>jacket,</b> went to Weisweiler, and informed {{him that he would}} be substituting himself in for Kulik, saying [...] "I'll play now then".|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{ran toward}} the point, and Whitney, following, tore two buttons <b>off</b> <b>his</b> oilskin <b>jacket</b> {{as he tried to}} {{unfasten}} them with numbed fingers. He wore ordinary serge trousers and heavy sea-boots, but the punt must be stopped before she drifted past the little cape. Afterward, it would be too late.|$|R
25|$|When the {{helicopter}} landed, Cleland jumped out, {{followed by the}} two soldiers. They ducked beneath the rotors and turned to watch the liftoff. Cleland reached {{down to pick up}} a grenade that he believed had popped <b>off</b> <b>his</b> flak <b>jacket.</b> It exploded and the blast slammed him backward, shredding both his legs and one arm.|$|R
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Usher exiting {{the club in}} which the [...] "Love in This Club" [...] video takes place, then shows a fiery {{transition}} into the next scene, showing the burnt-down club. As the song begins, Usher inspects the smoking ruins and imagines {{a woman in a}} shard of a broken mirror. He travels through a desert, and takes <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> to reveal a tight-fitting t-shirt, and again imagines the woman, this time in a desert pond. Upon reaching a mountain on which his love interest appears, Usher climb the mountain and rain starts to fall. When he reaches the top of the mountain, the rain clears to be replaced by snowfall. Usher finds that the woman is, yet again, merely an illusion. He opens a locket to reveal a portrait of himself and his partner, which freezes over and cracks. As the video ends, Usher kneels, and the mountains breaks around him, leaving a sole pillar for him to stand on.|$|E
500|$|During the 1938 tour of England, Hassett smuggled a “wet, muddy, and complaining” {{mountain}} goat (put a waistcoat on the goat, {{according to}} some sources) into the bedroom he shared with Stan McCabe and O'Reilly while the team was staying at Grindleford, after they had fallen asleep. They awoke to unexpected smells and bleating. During the 1948 tour of England, he {{was reported to have}} unnerved his teammates and tempted fate by bringing a toy duck into the dressing room, and held up play during a county match by hiding the ball in a pile of sawdust. During the same summer, Hassett and a few teammates were being chauffeured back to London after a function. It was after midnight, but Hassett asked the driver to stop at a random mansion along the road. He then rang the bell and told the startled householder that he [...] "just thought we'd pop in". The owner happened to recognise Hassett and received the cricketers. In the Third Test of the same tour, after dropping two hooked catches from Washbrook, Hassett responded by borrowing a policeman’s helmet, before motioning to Ray Lindwall to bowl another bouncer. During the 1953 tour of England, a waiter spilled a dessert on Hassett's jacket. Initially declining the waiter's multiple offers to have his jacket taken away for cleaning, Hassett acquiesced and while taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> noticed a spot on his trousers. He then silently pointed to the spot, removed his trousers and handed them to the waiter, before continuing to eat his meal in his underpants.|$|E

5000|$|He was {{a member}} of the Zubr {{movement}} of youth. In 2001 he was arrested after the police took a Zubr badge <b>off</b> of <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> at a soccer game. In the same year he was arrested and charged with Article 156 of the Belarusian penal code, [...] "petty hooliganism", after the police confiscated Zubr flags from his friends and arrested 15 people.|$|R
60|$|He {{forced himself}} to get up, and stood still, {{shivering}} in every limb, while a bitter wind struck through him as he gathered his resolution together. Then, stripping <b>off</b> <b>his</b> deerskin <b>jacket,</b> he flung it over one arm as he turned toward his companions' shelter. Kinnaird was awake, and his daughter cried out drowsily when Weston stood looking down at him.|$|R
2500|$|In 1999 he sang [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] at the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, {{then finally}} sang at Old Trafford {{before the last}} match of the Premiership season between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. After the game, when his team had won the league championship, he {{returned}} to the pitch to sing the Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé song [...] "Barcelona", during which he tore <b>off</b> <b>his</b> dinner <b>jacket</b> to reveal a Manchester United shirt.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir," [...] said Marble, {{stripping}} <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> {{and taking}} the tobacco from his mouth. [...] "In one moment.--Just hold on, till I'm ready." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{will not}} allow mere names to make distinctions for me, but still see men in herds for all them. A {{familiar}} name cannot make a man less strange to me. It may be given to a savage who retains in secret his own wild title earned in the woods. We have a wild savage in us, and a savage name is perchance somewhere recorded as ours. I see that my neighbor, who bears the familiar epithet William or Edwin, takes it <b>off</b> with <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> It does not adhere to him when asleep or in anger, or aroused by any passion or inspiration. I seem to hear pronounced by some of his kin {{at such a time}} his original wild name in some jaw-breaking or else melodious tongue.|$|R
50|$|The gang gathers up the girl, her family, the mayor, another {{prominent}} citizen, and {{the sheriff}} for a mock trial. The mayor and his companion are sentenced to being beaten up. The gang claims {{that they are}} owed a rape and ignore Cody {{as he tries to}} stop them. Meanwhile, the other motorcycle gang begins to terrorize the town. Cody asks one of his gang members where Hole-in-the-Wall is located. He is told there is no such place and that the whole story was a fabrication. He tries to convince his girlfriend to leave with him, but she refuses. Cody tears <b>off</b> <b>his</b> Skulls <b>jacket,</b> throws it into the dirt, and rides away. As he does, the police are visible converging on Brookville to restore order.|$|R
60|$|About an {{hour after}} Miss Moorsom had gone below without a sign or a word for him, Renouard {{got out of his}} hammock slung in the waist under the midship awning—for he had given up all the {{accommodation}} below to his guests. He got out with a sudden swift movement, flung <b>off</b> <b>his</b> sleeping <b>jacket,</b> rolled <b>his</b> pyjamas up his thighs, and stole forward, unseen by the one Kanaka of the anchor-watch. His white torso, naked like a stripped athlete’s, glimmered, ghostly, in the deep shadows of the deck. Unnoticed {{he got out of the}} ship over the knight-heads, ran along the back rope, and seizing the dolphin-striker firmly with both hands, lowered himself into the sea without a splash.|$|R
60|$|A deep {{flush of}} anger passed rapidly over Adam's face. He said nothing, but threw <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> {{and began to}} roll up his shirt-sleeves again.|$|E
60|$|Nat {{felt that}} this was true, and, {{following}} her into the cave, he let her take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> The wound was a few inches below the arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Rokens, man," [...] {{interrupted}} Glynn, as {{he pulled}} <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> [...] "the loss is greater to me than to you, for {{that was my first}} whale!" ...|$|E
50|$|In 1941, Anna, Gene, and John Breeskin joined Elias in Mexico City, {{where he}} had become musical {{director}} for XEW, the most important radio station in the country. John Breeskin describes one Christmas sitting in box seat in the principal orchestra hall in Mexico City near the President of Mexico, and watching his father Elias take the stage, lift his baton, and give the downbeat for Tchaikovsky’s The Nutcracker. John Breeskin also describes living in a mansion with several servants, including a chauffeur, a gardener, a bodyguard, a cook and two young maids. Elias would come home from work, take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> suit <b>jacket,</b> and reveal a tiny Capuchin monkey tucked into his armpit. He would come home from the mercado with a parrot with violently colored feathers perched on his shoulder; this was typical.|$|R
60|$|Willie {{had started}} up {{to run out}} and rectify this omission, but on being assured that the fairy liked tea almost as well without as with cream, {{and that there was}} no cream to be got near at hand, he sat down again and {{continued}} to do the honours of the table. First he made the fairy sit up in bed, and commented sadly on her poor thin neck as she did it, observing that she was nothing better than a skeleton in a skin. Then he took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> own <b>jacket</b> and put it on her shoulders, tying the arms round her neck. Next he placed a piece of board in front of her, saying that it was a capital tray, and on this he arranged the viands neatly.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]22 calibre bullet ricocheted off Stevens' teeth before {{embedding}} {{itself in}} his tongue. Despite having been shot, Stevens managed to {{grab hold of}} Easterbrook and force him up against some iron railings {{at the side of}} a railway bridge. During the struggle, the constable managed to twist the gun from Easterbrook's hand, but Easterbrook managed to pull free. Stevens managed to grab the back of Easterbrook's overcoat. Easterbrook who was still running with the constable being dragged behind, suddenly slipped <b>off</b> <b>his</b> overcoat and <b>jacket</b> causing Stevens to fall to the ground. Easterbrook then escaped over the railway bridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is useless}} {{to take the}} trouble to undress, Francis," [...] he said, as the latter threw <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> [...] "Giuseppi can wade out to the rocks without wetting his knees." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Before we begin," [...] {{said the}} tranter, [...] "my {{proposal}} is, that 'twould be {{a right and}} proper plan for every mortal man in the dance to pull <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> considering the heat." ...|$|E
60|$|Jonas {{then took}} <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> rolled up his shirt sleeve, {{lay down on}} the rock, and reached his arm down into the water, but it was a little too deep. He could not reach it.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, he {{imagined}} Ruth studied him with quiet amusement, and wondered whether {{she thought he}} was not playing up. He did not mean to play up; the game was intricate, and, if he were rash, might cost him much. He had taken <b>off</b> <b>his</b> hat and <b>jacket</b> and effort had brought back the color to his skin. His thin face had the clean bronze tint of an Indian's; the soft shirt showed the fine-drawn lines of his athletic figure; but Lister was not conscious of this. He knew his drawbacks, but not all his advantages.|$|R
60|$|The {{next two}} days they {{remained}} at Olenga, as word was sent up to Itchongue, the next town, asking the chief there for leave to come forward. The people had now begun to get over their first timidity, and when Frank {{went out for a}} walk after breakfast he was somewhat embarrassed by the women and girls crowding round him, feeling his clothes and touching his hands and face to assure themselves that these felt like those of human beings. He afforded them huge delight by taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> Norfolk <b>jacket</b> and pulling up the sleeves of his shirt to show them that his arms were the same color as his hands, and so elated were they with this exhibition that it was with great difficulty that he withstood their entreaties that he would disrobe entirely. Indeed, Ostik had at last to come to his rescue and carry him off from the laughing crowd by which he was surrounded.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth {{felt very}} feeble as he whirled the heavy axe about his head, for that mass of timber was impressively big. He had torn <b>off</b> <b>his</b> deer-hide <b>jacket,</b> and <b>his</b> soaked blue shirt gaped open {{to his waist}} at every heave of his shoulders. He stood in icy water, but the {{perspiration}} dripped from him as he swung with every blow. Though some men with good thews and sinews can never learn to use the axe to any purpose, he could chop, and the heavy blade he whirled rang with a rhythmic precision in the widening notch, then flashed about his head, and fell with a chunk that was sharp as a whip-crack into the gap again. In between Gordon's axe swept down, and the blades flashed athwart each other's orbits without a check or clash. It requires years to acquire that kind of proficiency with the axe, but {{the result is a}} perfecting of the co-operation between will and hardened muscle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Macklin is slippery, no {{two ways}} about it," [...] said Matt Gilroy, {{as he took}} <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and wrung the water out. [...] "I am not {{inclined}} to trust him, {{and that is all}} there is to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know there's no bog worth {{speaking}} of; the Hause is {{a regular}} tourist track," [...] he added, and suddenly stripped <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> [...] "First of all, you'll put this on; I'm sorry I didn't think of it before." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{a little}} laughter, for if Jasper, who slowly took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> was not {{accustomed}} to stump-grubbing, {{he was at least}} a man of splendid physique, and Barbison felt uneasy when he laid a great hand on his shoulder.|$|E

60|$|It {{was almost}} unpleasantly {{hot in the}} little iron-roofed room at the {{railroad}} depot, and the agent, who flung the door open, stood still {{a minute or two}} blinking into the darkness. A big lamp that flickered in the wind cast an uncertain gleam upon the slushy whiteness under foot, and the blurred outline of a towering water-tank showed dimly through the sliding snow. He could also just discern the great locomotive waiting on the side-track, and the sibilant hiss of steam that mingled with the moaning of the wind whirling a white haze out of the obscurity. Beyond the track, and showing only now and then, the lights of the wooden town blinked fitfully; on the other hand and behind the depot was an empty waste of snow-sheeted prairie. The temperature had gone up suddenly, but the agent shivered as he felt the raw dampness strike through him, and, closing the door, took <b>off</b> and shook <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and sat down by the stove again.|$|R
