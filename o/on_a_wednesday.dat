5|$|Despicable Me 2 is the twenty-sixth highest-grossing film, {{the fourth}} highest-grossing 2013 film, the sixth highest-grossing {{animated}} film, the seventh highest-grossing 3-D film, {{and the second}} highest-grossing Illumination Entertainment film. It is the sixth animated film to pass the $300 million mark. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 40 million tickets in North America. The film opened on Wednesday, July 3, 2013 at first place with $35.0 million (including $4.7 million from Tuesday night showings). Its opening-day gross stands as third highest for an animated feature, and the seventh highest among films opening <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wednesday.</b> The film then dropped 30% to $24.5 million on Thursday, marking the second-largest non-opening Thursday gross. Over the five-day Independence Day weekend (Wednesday-to-Sunday, including Tuesday night showings), the film earned $143.1 million, the highest five-day start for an animated film (ahead of Toy Story 3s $141.0 million five-day debut).

The film's three-day opening-weekend gross was the largest among Illumination Entertainment films, the third largest for an Independence Day holiday, the fourth largest among animated films, the seventh largest among films released in July, and the tenth largest among films not released on a Friday. The film remained in the first position {{at the box office}} for two consecutive weekends.|$|E
50|$|However, {{nowadays}} Independence Day {{is rarely}} celebrated on the 5th of Iyar itself, and on most years is moved forward or backwards {{by one or}} two days. According {{to the rules of}} the Jewish calendar explained in Days of week on Hebrew calendar, the 5th of Iyar can fall <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Monday, <b>a</b> <b>Wednesday,</b> <b>a</b> Friday or a Saturday. To avoid violation of Shabbat prohibitions, it was decided in 1951 that if the 5th of Iyar falls <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Friday or Saturday, the celebrations would be moved up to the preceding Thursday (3 or 4 of Iyar). Additionally, since 2004, if the 5th of Iyar is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Monday, the festival is postponed to Tuesday (6 of Iyar). Monday is avoided in order to avoid potential violation of Sabbath laws by preparing for Yom Hazikaron (which one day before Independence Day) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Shabbat. As a result, Independence Day falls between 3 and 6 of Iyar, and can be <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Tuesday, <b>Wednesday</b> or Thursday. It will only actually be on the 5th of Iyar when this date happens to be <b>a</b> <b>Wednesday.</b>|$|R

In this case, year 2 is extended by one day by postponing Rosh Hashanah in year 3 from Monday to Tuesday (the fourth deḥiyyah), and year 2 will have 383 days.|$|E
