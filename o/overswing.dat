50|$|While {{in class}} D, {{transistors}} and the load exist as two separate modules, class F admits imperfections like the parasitics of the transistor {{and tries to}} optimise the global system {{to have a high}} impedance at the harmonics. Of course there must be a finite voltage across the transistor to push the current across the on-state resistance. Because the combined current through both transistors is mostly in the first harmonic, it looks like a sine. That means that {{in the middle of the}} square the maximum of current has to flow, so it may make sense to have a dip in the square or in other words to allow some <b>overswing</b> of the voltage square wave. A class-F load network by definition has to transmit below a cutoff frequency and reflect above.|$|E

40|$|In a semiclassical view {{superconductivity}} {{is attributed}} {{exclusively to the}} advance of atoms' outer s electrons through the nuclei of neighbor atoms in a solid. The necessary progression of holes {{in the opposite direction}} has the electric and magnetic effect as if two electrons were advancing instead of each actual one. Superconductivity ceases when the associated lateral oscillation of the outer s electrons extends between neighbor atoms. If such <b>overswing</b> occurs already at T = 0, then the material is a normal conductor. Otherwise, lateral <b>overswing</b> can be caused by lattice vibrations at a critical temperature Tc or by a critical magnetic field Bc. Lateral electron oscillations are reduced - and Tc is increased - when the atoms of the outer s electrons are squeezed, be it in the bulk crystal, in a thin film, or under external pressure on the sample. The model is applied to alkali metals and alkali-doped fullerenes. Aluminum serves {{as an example of a}} simple metal with superconductivity. Application of the model to transition metals, intertransitional alloys and compounds of transition metals with other elements sheds light on the pattern of their critical temperature. More examples of the squeeze effect are provided by the superconductivity of PdH, MgB 2, borocarbides, ferropnictides, and organic charge-transfer salts. The model also provides the superconduction mechanism in the oxide superconductors, exemplified by YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7. Finally the model suggests which steps to take in order to reach superconductivity at room temperature and above. Comment: 72 pages, 40 figures, 3 table...|$|E

40|$|Emergence, {{development}} and cessation of superconductivity in three representative compounds of copper oxide families [...] -cation doped Ca_ 2 -xNa_xCuO 2 Cl 2 and La_ 2 -xAe_xCuO 4 (Ae = Ba, Sr), {{as well as}} oxygen enriched YBa 2 Cu 3 O_ 6 +x [...] -are explained with the Coulomb-oscillator model of superconductivity. By the model, non-resistive current is carried by axial Coulomb oscillations of s electrons through neighbor nuclei [...] -here excited 3 s electrons from O^ 2 - ions through next-nearest neighbor oxygen nuclei [...] -if their accompanying lateral oscillation is sufficiently confined to prevent lateral <b>overswing.</b> Cation doping {{gives rise to a}} superlattice in the layers that sandwich each CuO 2 plane. In Ca_ 2 -xNa_xCuO 2 Cl 2, having one CuO 2 plane per unit cell, superconductivity emerges when laterally confined Coulomb oscillators start connecting along 6 x 6 superlattice domains (in units of planar lattice constants) and it peaks at 4 x 4 domains when, at doping x = 1 / 8, the superlattice is completed. With further doping a new, off-set superlattice grows. Its frustrating effect gradually reduces superconductivity to cessation. The same mechanism holds for La_ 2 -xAe_xCuO 4 which has two, staggered CuO 2 planes per unit cell. The staggering causes superconducting frustration or boost between adjacent layer sandwiches. This results in a double hump of the transition temperature Tc(x), instead of a dome, with a deep furrow or dip at x = 1 / 8 for Ae = Ba or Sr, respectively. Oxygen enrichment of YBa 2 Cu 3 O_ 6 +x indirectly leads to effective doping in the CuO 2 planes themselves (Cu^ 2 + [...] > Cu^ 3 +). The ionization of copper ions at the corners of planar unit cells determines whether lateral oscillations between next-nearest neighbor O^ 2 - ions <b>overswing</b> (Tc = 0) or are confined to wide or narrow electron tracks. Their percolating connectivity gives rise to respective plateaus of Tc = 57 K and Tc = 90 K, and intermediate ramps. Comment: 37 pages, 20 figures.

The P seismogram shows an initial negative deflection followed by a broad positive deflection. Fig. l(b) shows the same P signal as Fig. l(a) except that the phase shifts due to the BB seismograph have been cancelled out: this was done by multiplying the spectrum of the recorded seismogram by ia(w) l/a(w) and transforming back into the time domain; a (o) is {{the response of the}} BB seismograph at frequency w.

40|$|Asymmetric {{scanning}} tunneling microscopy (STM) of the CuO 2 {{plane of}} Ca 2 -xNaxCuO 2 Cl 2, x = 0. 125, shows a square domain structure with edge length four times the compound's lattice constant a 0 (Cu-O-Cu distance). The domain structure is {{a direct consequence of}} the 4 a 0 by 4 a 0 superlattice formed by vertical Na+ pairs (oriented parallel to the crystal's c axis) that substitute Ca 2 + ions. The surrounding O 2 - ions are displaced away from, and the Cu 2 + ions toward the Na+ pairs. Contrary to the fourfold symmetry of the CuO 2 plane, the stable displacement configuration has a twofold symmetry, dominated by large and, respectively, small displacement of opposite O 2 - ions being nearest neighbors to each vertical Na+ pair. The ion displacements give rise to sufficient squeeze of certain O 2 - ions that, by the Coulomb-oscillator model of superconductivity, prevents lateral <b>overswing</b> of their excited 3 s electrons. The axial 3 s oscillations are predominantly oriented in the directions of O 2 - ion displacements. The observed ladder pattern in the domains provides a direct imaging of the 3 s Coulomb oscillators. The 'sidepieces' of the ladders correspond to long unidirectional pathways for 3 s electrons in the CuO 2 plane. They account for superconductivity. The findings lend support to the validity of the Coulomb-oscillator model of superconductivity. Comment: 8 pages, 1 figur...|$|E
40|$|HCDstruct is a Matlab based {{software}} tool to rapidly build a {{finite element model}} for structural optimization of hybrid wing body (HWB) aircraft at the conceptual design level.

Upon {{the conclusion of the}} season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a [...]292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. [...] "It was just another blunder in a bad season that has been full of mistakes", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, [...] "I'm going to show 'em I'm no flash in the pan. Last year I was <b>overswinging</b> and taking my eye of the ball. I'm {{not going to do that}} this season." [...] During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players and by the end of it, a statement of support from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low [...]219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{initiated}} to investigate {{if it could}} be feasible to supply offshore oil installations in the North Sea with electrical power from land. A prestudy of alternative converter topologies indicated that the most promising solution would be to investigate a conventional system with reduced synchronous compensator rating. The study starts with a summary of the state of power supply to offshore installations today, and a short review of classical HVDC transmission. It goes on to analyse how a passive network without sources influences the inverter. The transmission, with its current controlled rectifier and large inductance, is simulated as a current source. Under these circumstances the analysis shows that the network frequency has to adapt {{in order to keep the}} active and reactive power balance until the controllers are able to react. The concept of firing angle for a thyristor is limited in a system with variable frequency, the actual control parameter is the firing delay time. Sensitivity analysis showed some astonishing consequences. The frequency rises both by an increase in the active and in the reactive load. The voltage falls by an increase in the active load, but rises by an increase in the inductive load. Two different control principles for the system of inverter, synchronous compensator and load are defined. The first takes the reference for the firing delay time from the fundamental voltage at the point of common coupling. The second takes the reference for the firing delay time from the simulated EMF of the synchronous compensator. Of these, the second is the more stable and should be chosen as the basis for a possible control system. Two simulation tools are applied. The first is a quasi-phasor model running on Matlab with Simulink. The other is a time domain model in KREAN. The time domain model is primarily used for the verification of the quasi-phasor model, and shows that quasi-phasors is still a valuable tool for making a quick analysis of the main features when the details of the transients are of less importance. The study indicates that power supply by HVDC transmission from land to offshore oil installations could be technically feasible, even without the large synchronous compensators normally required. It has been shown that in a network only supplied by an inverter, variations of active and reactive loads have significant influence on both voltage and frequency. Particularly it should be noted that the frequency shows a positive sensitivity to increases in load. This could make the system intrinsically unstable in the case of a frequency dependent load such as motors. It was not a part of the study to optimize controllers, but even with simple controllers it was possible to keep the frequency within limits given by norms and regulations, but the voltages were dynamically outside the limits, though not very far. These voltage <b>overswings</b> take place in the first few instances after a disturbance, so it takes unrealistically fast controllers to handle them. They are partly due to the model, where the land based rectifier and the DC reactors are simulated by a constant current source, but partly they have to be handled by overdimensioning of the system. The simulations indicate that it should be technically possible to supply an oil platform with electrical power from land by means of HVDC transmission with small synchronous compensators. Whether this is financially feasible has not been investigated. Neither has it been considered whether the necessary equipment can actually be installed on an oil platform. Recently both ABB and Siemens have presented solutions for HVDC transmission in the lower and medium power range based on voltage source converters based on IGBTs. Fully controllable voltage source HVDC converters have properties that may be better suited than conventional line commutated current source thyristor inverters, to supply weak or passive networks, such as offshore oil installations, with electrical power. But they also have some disadvantages, and a complete technical and financial comparison must be performed in order to decide about any potential project. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

T.), in 1946, that useful power might be generated from such reactions, pro-vided {{that the loss of}} energy to the walls could be sufficiently reduced by magnetic fields. Experiments were begun at Imperial College, London, in February 1947, to produce very large currents in a low-pressure gas discharge. The containment of the gas was to be achieved by the pinch effect and a toroidal discharge tube was used to eliminate end losses. Currents in the range 1 x 104 - 2 x 104 amp were induced in the gas by discharging a condenser of maximum energy 400 joules through a primary winding coupled with the gas. 1 These experiments were the first to demonstrate a marked pinch effect in a gas discharge, although inertial effects caused the contracting discharge to <b>overswing</b> and expand again, followed by further contractions and expansions. 2 In order to achieve {{temperatures of}} several million degrees and demonstrate a thermonuclear reaction it was clear from the Bennett 3 relation, 2 NkT = 72, that currents of the order 105 amp were required. (N is the total number of particles per unit length of the discharge, k Boltzmann's constant, T the tempera-ture and / the current.)
