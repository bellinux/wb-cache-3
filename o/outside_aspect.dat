We went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed apartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and twenty or twenty-five high. It was a well-lighted place. There was no carpet.

Seeing that it was only a very small house--which is usually called a 'cottage-residence'--situated in a remote hamlet, and that it was not {{more than a hundred years}} old, if so much, I was led to think in my progress through the hollow rooms, with their cracked walls and sloping floors, what an exceptional number of abrupt family incidents had taken place therein--to reckon only those which had come to my own knowledge.

We in England have our new streets, our new inn, our green shaven lawn, and our piece of ruin emergent from it--a mere specimen of the Middle Ages put on a bit of velvet carpet, to be shown; and which, but for its size, might as well be on a museum shelf at once, under cover;--but, on the Continent, the links are unbroken between the past and present; and, in such use as they can serve for, the grey-headed wrecks are suffered to stay with men; while, in unbroken line, the generations of spared buildings are seen succeeding, each in its place.

How {{far this}} manly power itself acted merely in the {{accumulation}} of memories, remains, as I said, a question undetermined; but at all events, Turner's mind is not more, in my estimation, distinguished above others by its demonstrably arranging and ruling faculties, than by its demonstrably retentive and submissive faculties; and the longer I investigate it, the more this tenderness of perception and grasp of memory seem to me the root of its greatness. So that I am more and more convinced of what I had to state respecting the imagination, now many years ago, viz., that its true force lies in its marvellous insight and foresight--that it is, instead of a false and deceptive faculty, exactly the most accurate and truth-telling faculty which the human mind possesses; and all the more truth-telling, because, in its work, the vanity and individualism of the man himself are crushed, and he becomes a mere instrument or mirror, used by a higher power for the reflection to others of a truth which no effort of his could ever have ascertained; so that all mathematical, and arithmetical, and generally scientific truth, is, in comparison, truth of the husk and surface, hard and shallow; and only the imaginative truth is precious. Hence, whenever {{we want to know}} what are the chief facts of any case, it is better not to go to political economists, nor to mathematicians, but to the great poets; for I find they always see more of the matter than any one else: and in like manner those who want to know the real facts of the world's <b>outside</b> <b>aspect,</b> will find that they cannot trust maps, nor charts, nor any manner of mensuration; the most important facts being always quite immeasurable, and that (with only some occasional and trifling inconvenience, if they form too definite anticipations as to the position of a bridge here, or a road there) the Turnerian topography is the only one to be trusted.|$|E

5000|$|At Leeds Ionescu designed, {{created and}} {{implanted}} in the mitral position in humans, {{for the first time}} ever, porcine aortic valves attached to a Teflon cloth collar, starting in February 1967. This was followed by the creation of the Dacron covered titanium frame for mounting the porcine aortic valves to be able to implant them in all three cardiac locations (mitral, aortic, tricuspid). With various modifications and improvements, these stent mounted valves had been implanted in 87 patients between February 1967 and March 1969. All these valves were treated with formaldehyde and this was the main reason for their limited durability.In a continuous search to create a tissue heart valve which could be used without anticoagulant treatment, Ionescu created a novel artificial valve. Using autologous fascia lata tissue (the fibrous membrane which covers the <b>outside</b> <b>aspect</b> of the thigh muscles) taken from the patient and used to construct the valve during the operation by mounting the living fascia on a Dacron-covered titanium frame {{in the shape of a}} three cusp valve. He began the clinical implantation of these valves in April 1969. This procedure of valve construction and implantation had been used in many centres in the world for about three years until it was realised that fascia lata did not perform well over longer periods of time in the high pressure environment of the left heart.These valves became incompetent after various durations post implantation - from 3 to 12 years. However, two important facts were established by the use of such valves. The haemodynamic performance in both mitral and aortic positions was superior to all known artificial heart valves and that the risk of thrombosis and embolisation was minimal when compared with mechanical valves. Freehand insertion of stentless fascia lata aortic valves was also used in a small number of cases with similar results.|$|E

40|$|When {{designing}} a new system, designers often immerse themselves inside their creations and become {{so focused on}} perfecting {{the inner workings of}} what they are building they often ignore how the system presents itself to the “outside ” world. This form of inner-focused design leads to the creation of obscure and hard to use systems, creating software interfaces that are difficult to understand, information systems that are nearly impossible to navigate, and service organizations that fail to provide service. To help designers focus on the <b>outside</b> <b>aspects</b> of their designs, usability testing and focus group analysis have recently become vital components to the software and computing system development. Usability testing, and especially focus group analysis, are also being employed in other forms of information and service organization construction. This paper looks at how basic usability testing and focus group analysis was incorporated into a web site redesign project, and then applied on a larger scale for a more extensive information system development project. Thinking of the “outside ” aspect of a system means designers understand that the iterative design process of design, development, testing, and re-development needs to be continually aware of the needs of the system’s user. Effective usability evaluation reveals how users interact with various system design choices. Ideally, the information gathered from a usability study helps to set guideposts for the redesign and development process to ensure that the needs of users are always being considered. To better explain what we mean by usability testing and focus group analysis in this paper, we focus on a basic usability test of a university web site aimed at a faculty audience and how this was then initiated a larger library information systems evaluation and redesign...|$|R

60|$|From {{talks with}} certain of our {{passengers}} whose home was Honolulu, {{and from a}} sketch by Mrs. Mary H. Krout, I was able to perceive what the Honolulu of to-day is, {{as compared with the}} Honolulu of my time. In my time it was a beautiful little town, made up of snow-white wooden cottages deliciously smothered in tropical vines and flowers and trees and shrubs; and its coral roads and streets were hard and smooth, and as white as the houses. The <b>outside</b> <b>aspects</b> of the place suggested the presence of a modest and comfortable prosperity--a general prosperity --perhaps one might strengthen the term and say universal. There were no fine houses, no fine furniture. There were no decorations. Tallow candles furnished the light for the bedrooms, a whale-oil lamp furnished it for the parlor. Native matting served as carpeting. In the parlor one would find two or three lithographs on the walls--portraits as a rule: Kamehameha IV., Louis Kossuth, Jenny Lind; and may be an engraving or two: Rebecca at the Well, Moses smiting the rock, Joseph's servants finding the cup in Benjamin's sack. There would be a center table, with books of a tranquil sort on it: The Whole Duty of Man, Baxter's Saints' Rest, Fox's Martyrs, Tupper's Proverbial Philosophy, bound copies of The Missionary Herald and of Father Damon's Seaman's Friend. A melodeon; a music stand, with 'Willie, We have Missed You', 'Star of the Evening', 'Roll on Silver Moon', 'Are We Most There', 'I Would not Live Alway', and other songs of love and sentiment, together with an assortment of hymns. A what-not with semi-globular glass paperweights, enclosing miniature pictures of ships, New England rural snowstorms, and the like; sea-shells with Bible texts carved on them in cameo style; native curios; whale's tooth with full-rigged ship carved on it.
