25|$|With {{the start}} of aerial {{operations}} by the Syrian Air Force, in August 2012, online publications probably overestimating rebels' claims {{on the number of}} destroyed aircraft, assumed that the Syrian Air Force was suffering significant technical difficulties, resulting in {{less than half of the}} best SAAF ground attack aircraft such as the Mi-25 Hind-D being serviceable. The publications reported that an increased number of conflict fronts and severe maintenance burdens dramatically worsened the situation, which was reportedly difficult before the war. These problems were thought to account for the use of L-39ZA (attack variant) jets, before further escalations. <b>Operational</b> <b>limitations</b> were overcome during 2013 as Syrian pilots and technicians with the assistance of foreign advisers and technicians began to improve their operational skills. In December 2013 Jane's reported that the Syrian Air Force had dramatically improved its operational capabilities during 2013, and was now frequently conducting up to 100 sorties per day with half of these constituting combat sorties.|$|E

50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of the ship's design is stability in rough seas and at high speeds. At 10 knots in calm sea states, the hull can roll {{up to four}} degrees to each side, while conventional ships would roll very little, which would increase if the ship goes faster in rougher conditions, raising the possibility of seasickness. To achieve its top speed, the ship has to be traveling in waters not exceeding sea state 3 (waves up to 1.25 m high). At sea state 4 it can travel up to 15 knots, travel only 5 knots in sea state 5, and has to hold position in any sea state higher; while this {{might be seen as}} an <b>operational</b> <b>limitation</b> that can delay its arrival to port facilities, the ship was intended to operate closer to shore rather than in blue-water conditions.|$|R
50|$|Short URLs, {{although}} {{making it}} easier to access what might otherwise be a very long URL or user-space on an ISP server, add an additional layer of complexity to the process of retrieving web pages.

Another <b>operational</b> <b>limitation</b> of URL shortening services is that browsers do not resend POST bodies when a redirect is encountered. This can be overcome by making the service a reverse proxy, or by elaborate schemes involving cookies and buffered POST bodies, but such techniques present security and scaling challenges, and are therefore not used on extranets or Internet-scale services.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we report}} on 100 dpi four hydro-genated {{amorphous}} silicon thin-film transistors (4 -a-Si:H TFTs) active-matrix organic polymer light-emitting display (AM-PLED).

Combining this result with the extracted pixel organic polymer light-emitting device (PLED) characteristics, {{we have found that}} the change of the AM-PLED pixel operating point, especially of a driving TFT, limits the operational range of AM-PLED pixel. The predicted results are compared with the measured data of 100 dpi monochromatic red light-emitting 4 -a-Si:H TFTs AM-PLED. For our AM-PLED, we obtained luminance up to 20 cd/m 2 and Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage color coordinates of (0. 67, 0. 33), which are calculated from the measured AM-PLED electroluminescence spectrum.

40|$|The {{demolition}} of a facility historically used for processing and handling transuranic materials is considered. Residual alpha emitting radionuclide contamination poses an exposure hazard if {{released to the}} local environment during the demolition. The process of planning for the {{demolition of}} this highly alpha contaminated building, 232 -Z, included a predemolition modeling analysis of potential exposures. Estimated emission rates were used as input to an air dispersion model to estimate frequencies of occurrence of peak air and surface exposures. Postdemolition modeling was also conducted, based on the actual demolition schedule and conditions. The modeling results indicated that downwind deposition is the main <b>operational</b> <b>limitation</b> for demolition of a highly alpha-contaminated building. During the demolition of 232 -Z, airborne radiation and surface contamination were monitored. The resultant non-detect monitoring results indicate a significant level of conservatism in the modeled results. This comparison supports the use of more realistic assumption in the estimating emission rates. The resultant reduction in modeled levels of potential exposures has significant implications {{in terms of the}} projected costs of demolition of such structures...|$|R

40|$|Case StudyOne of {{the most}} {{important}} compressor stations operated by Petrobras Transporte S. A. ? TRANSPETRO ? is called Catu Compressor Station, which operates for the GASENE gas pipeline, usually compressing gas in order to attend Brazilian Northeastern region demand. Catu Compressor Station has often presented outlet gas temperatures very close to its upper limit of 50 ?C, with some sporadic events of automatic station shutdown when surpassing this limit. Since they began, gas temperature profiles along the Catu compression process have been monitored and investigated. Depending on the pipeline flow direction and demand, this marginal operation could impact directly on the station?s compression versatility. Possible causes for this high outlet gas temperature problem are presented through a ?fishbone? analysis, leading to a master action plan. This plan mainly comprehended the analysis and check of design data and operational parameters of the centrifugal compressors and its downstream process heat exchangers, culminating in field tests to submit this equipment to the highest possible range of operational conditions. Despite the difficulties, mainly for field test accomplishment, the master plan revealed an incompatibility between the current operating profile of Catu compressors and the design thermal capacity of its heat exchangers. To better support this find and predict the possible operational limits, a compression process modelling effort was conducted utilizing dynamic process simulation. The simulation results showed the limitation extension imposed on the compressor?s operational envelope by its heat exchanger capacity, for a variety of operational conditions, such as different environmental and process gas temperatures. Finally, options for mitigating and solving the presented <b>operational</b> <b>limitation</b> are proposed and discussed...|$|R

40|$|CUBESATS are {{relatively}} new spacecraft platforms that are typically deployed from a launch vehicle as a secondarypayload, 1 providing low-cost access to {{space for a}} wide range of end-users. These satellites are comprised of building blocks having dimensions of 10 x 10 x 10 cm 3 and a mass of 1. 33 kg (a 1 -U size). While providing low-cost access to space, a major <b>operational</b> <b>limitation</b> is the lack of a propulsion system that can fit within a CubeSat and is capable of executing high ∆v maneuvers. This makes it difficult to use CubeSats on missions requiring certain types of maneuvers (i. e. formation flying, spacecraft rendezvous). Recently, work has been performed investigating the use of iodine as a propellant for Hall-effect thrusters (HETs) 2 that could subsequently be used to provide a high specific impulse path to CubeSat propulsion. 3, 4 Iodine stores as a dense solid at very low pressures, making it acceptable as a propellant on a secondary payload. It has exceptionally high ρIsp (density times specific impulse), making it an enabling technology for small satellite near-term applications and providing the potential for systems-level advantages over mid-term high power electric propulsion options. Iodine flow can also be thermally regulated, subliming at relatively low temperature (< 100 ◦C) to yield I 2 vapor at or below 50 torr. At low power, the measured performance of an iodine-fed HET is very similar to that of a state-of-the-art xenon-fed thruster. Just as importantly, the current-voltage discharge characteristics of low power iodine-fed and xenon-fed thrusters are remarkably similar, potentially reducing development and qualifications costs by making i...|$|R
