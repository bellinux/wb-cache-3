Most non-white groups were concentrated in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Welsh Asian and African communities developed mainly through immigration after the Second World War. In the early 21st century, parts of Wales saw an increased number of immigrants settle from recent EU accession countries such as Poland; though a 2007 study showed a relatively low number of employed immigrant workers from the former Eastern Bloc countries in Wales compared to <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Politics in the Bay Area {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most liberal in California and in the United States. Since the late 1960s, the Bay Area cemented its role as the most liberal region in California politics, supporting the center left Democratic Party's candidates for U.S. President and continued to support Democratic candidates more than <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the state, even as California trended towards the Democratic Party over time. According to research by the Public Policy Institute of California, the Bay Area and the North Coast counties of Humboldt and Mendocino were the most consistently and strongly liberal areas in California.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern United States {{is one of}} the world's best {{areas for}} insolation, and the Mojave Desert {{receives}} up to twice the sunlight received in <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the country. This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal. Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy, produce virtually no emissions, and consume no fuel other than sunlight. Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation, or rooftop solar.|$|E
5|$|Waterloo was {{a decisive}} battle {{in more than}} one sense. Every {{generation}} in Europe up to the outbreak of the First World War looked back at Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history. In retrospect, it was seen as the event that ushered in the Concert of Europe, an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress. The battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the world, since the French Revolution of the early 1790s. It also ended the First French Empire and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.|$|E

5|$|As the {{situation}} deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 {{men from the}} Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos. Paranhos, along with Tamandaré, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. It was apparent that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo whether they would provide military assistance {{to him and his}} government, none responded positively. João Propício Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Lucía River near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|At Valencia and <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> eastern Spain, {{the storm}} {{generated}} heavy precipitation, while six tornadoes touched {{down over the}} Balearic Islands. While approaching {{the coast of the}} Balearic Islands, the warm-core low induced a pressure drop of 11mbar (0.32inHg) at Palma, Majorca in advance of the tropical cyclone's landfall. Medicanes as small as the one that formed in September1996 are atypical, and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular Mediterranean tropical cyclone formation. Warm low-level advection–transfer of heat through air or sea–caused by a large-scale low over the western Mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection. The presence of a mid- to upper-level cut-off cold-core low, a method of formation typical to medicanes, was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone. In addition, interaction between a northeastward-drifting trough, the medicane, and the large-scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfall.|$|E
5|$|Because of poor-quality soil, much of Wales is {{unsuitable}} for crop-growing and livestock farming {{has traditionally been}} the focus of agriculture. The Welsh landscape (protected by three national parks) and 45 Blue Flag beaches, as well as the unique culture of Wales, attract large numbers of tourists, who play an especially vital role in the economy of rural areas. Wales has struggled to develop or attract high value-added employment in sectors such as finance and research and development, attributable in part to a comparative lack of 'economic mass' (i.e. population) – Wales lacks a large metropolitan centre. The lack of high value-added employment is reflected in lower economic output per head relative to <b>other</b> <b>regions</b> <b>of</b> the UK – in 2002 it stood at 90% of the EU25 average and around 80% of the UK average. In June 2008, Wales made history by becoming the first nation in the world to be awarded Fairtrade Status.|$|E

50|$|Reindeer {{have major}} {{cultural}} and economic significance for indigenous peoples of the North. The human-ecological systems in the North, like reindeer pastoralism, are sensitive to change, perhaps more than in virtually any <b>other</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> the globe, {{due in part to}} the variability of the Arctic climate and ecosystem and the characteristic ways of life of indigenous Arctic peoples.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{significant}} factors contributed to the higher rates of tenancy, rural indebtedness, and land rents {{in the north and}} central plains. It was found that the land holdings in the north were smaller than in any <b>other</b> <b>region</b> <b>of</b> the country, thus reducing efficiency. Farming was done on a much smaller scale, which combined with lower productivity, yielded low incomes.|$|R
