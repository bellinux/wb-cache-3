The library required $20,500 ($ today) for purchasing and renovating the building; it raised $14,000 ($ today) from village residents, with the remainder funded by the village board. On April 19, 1959, the refurbished building was dedicated and the village board named the street {{that led to the}} library Library Road. With its own space, the library increased its collection, hired more staff, and doubled its operating hours. Also in 1959, the library received its absolute charter, and transferred the charter in 1964 from a free library association to a fully tax-supported public library and thus changed its name from the Briarcliff Free Library to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library.|$|E

For the complete series box set, the first season would be redone again, this time to six DVDs, retaining all bonus features. The individual volume discs for the first season are still in print, but are rare for lack <b>of</b> <b>shelf</b> space and because the slimpacks are more popular.

"Get On Top", a song which {{contains}} significant {{use of a}} wah pedal, was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to Public Enemy: [...] "I came up with [...] {{on the way to}} rehearsal—just tapping it out with my foot." [...] The understated guitar solo played {{in the middle of the}} song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' [...] "Siberian Khatru": [...] "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort <b>of</b> <b>shelf.</b> For 'Get On Top' I wanted to play something that contrasted between the solo and the background." [...] "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay.

500|$|The Library {{became more}} {{important}} during the 18th century; {{prior to that}} it had been a small, little-used collection of books. In 1725 it was proposed by the Pension that [...] "a publick Library be sett up and kept open for ye use of ye society", and that more books be purchased. The first order of new books was on 27 June 1729 and consisted of [...] "a collection of Lord Bacon's works". In 1750 the Under-Steward of the Inn made a new catalogue of the books, and in 1789 the Library was moved to a new room between the Hall and the Chapel. In 1840 another two rooms were erected in which to store books, and in 1883 a new Library was constructed with space to store approximately 11,000 books. This was rapidly found to be inadequate, and in 1929 a new Library, known as the Holker Library after the benefactor, Sir John Holker, was opened. The library, although impressive looking, was not particularly useful; Francis Cowper wrote that: Though impressive to look at, the new building was something less than a success as a library. The air of spaciousness was produced at the expense <b>of</b> <b>shelf</b> room, and though in the octagon [...] the decorative effect of row upon row of books soaring upwards towards the cornice was considerable, the loftiest were totally inaccessible save to those who could scale the longest and dizziest ladders. Further, the appointments were of such surpassing mag-nificence that no ink-pots were allowed in the room for fear of accidents.|$|E
500|$|Ice {{shelves are}} not stable when surface melting occurs, and the {{collapse}} of Larsen Ice Shelf has been caused by warmer melt season temperatures that have led to surface melting and the formation of shallow ponds of water on the ice shelf. The Larsen Ice Shelf lost [...] of its area from 1995 to 2001. In a 35-day period beginning on January 31, 2002, about [...] <b>of</b> <b>shelf</b> area disintegrated. The ice shelf is now 40% the size of its previous minimum stable extent. In 2015 a study concluded that the remaining Larsen B ice-shelf will disintegrate {{by the end of the}} decade, based on observations of faster flow and rapid thinning of glaciers in the area. Jones Ice Shelf had an area of [...] in the 1970s but by 2008 it had disappeared. Wordie Ice Shelf has gone from an area of [...] in 1950 to [...] in 2000. Prince Gustav Ice Shelf has gone from an area of [...] to [...] in 2008. After their loss the reduced buttressing of feeder glaciers has allowed the expected speed-up of inland ice masses after shelf ice break-up.

Wilkins Ice Shelf is another ice shelf that has suffered substantial retreat. The ice shelf had an area of [...] in 1998 when [...] was lost that year. [...] In 2007 and 2008 significant rifting developed and led to the loss of another [...] of area and some of the calving occurred in the Austral winter. The calving seemed to have resulted from preconditioning such as thinning, possibly due to basal melt, as surface melt was not as evident, leading to a reduction in the strength of the pinning point connections. The thinner ice then experienced spreading rifts and breakup. This period culminated in the collapse of an ice bridge connecting the main ice shelf to Charcot Island leading to the loss of an additional [...] between February and June 2009.|$|E
40|$|Fetuses were {{obtained}} from CD-I mice at a time estimated to be 12 h prior to in vivo second-ary palate closure.

Single transverse cuts extending the width <b>of</b> the <b>shelf</b> were made at one of three positions along the longitudinal axis of the shelf: one-third, one-half or two-thirds the shelf length estimated from the rostral edge. Some specimens were cut in two places, dividing the shelf into three equal segments.
