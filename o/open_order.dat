5|$|Ever {{since the}} victory against an Egyptian army at the Battle of Tel-el-Kebir, the {{standard}} British tactic against an entrenched position was an approach march {{at night in}} close order to maintain cohesion, followed by deployment into <b>open</b> <b>order</b> within {{a few hundred yards}} of the objective and a frontal attack with the bayonet at first light. Methuen planned to bombard the Boer positions with artillery from 16:50 to 18:30 on 10 December. Following the barrage, the newly arrived Highland Brigade under Major General Wauchope was to make a night march that would position them to launch a frontal attack on the Boers at dawn the following day. Wauchope had argued for a flanking attack along the Modder River, but had been unable to convince his superior.|$|E

Surprised and outmanoeuvred, the Romans {{did not have time}} to draw up in battle array, and were forced to fight a desperate hand-to-hand battle in <b>open</b> <b>order.</b> The Romans were quickly split into three parts.

The centre, including Flaminius, stood its ground, but was cut down by Hannibal's Gauls after three hours of heavy combat.|$|E

25|$|Peltasts {{were armed}} {{with a number of}} {{javelins}} and a sword, carried a light shield but wore no armour, though they sometimes had helmets; they were adept at skirmishing and were often used to guard the flanks of more heavily equipped infantry. They usually adopted an <b>open</b> <b>order</b> when facing enemy heavy infantry. They could throw their javelins at will at the enemy and, unencumbered by armour or heavy shields, easily evade any counter-charges made by heavily equipped hoplites. They were, however, quite vulnerable to shock-capable cavalry and often operated to particular advantage on broken ground where cavalry was useless and heavy infantry found it difficult to maintain formation.|$|E
25|$|Wilson’s brigade was {{amongst the}} troops sent to Natal – by late November it was encamped on the Mooi River, 509 miles from besieged Ladysmith. Wilson’s brigade {{took part in}} the Battle of Colenso (15 December), in which British troops, {{advancing}} after an inadequate artillery bombardment, were shot down by entrenched and largely hidden Boers armed with magazine rifles. Wilson later drew to the attention of Leo Amery, who was writing the ‘’Times History of the War in South Africa’’ of how Hildyard’s 2nd brigade had advanced in <b>open</b> <b>order</b> and had suffered lighter casualties than Hart’s 5th (Irish) brigade's close order attack. After Gatacre’s defeat at Stormberg (10 December) and Methuen’s defeat at Magersfontein (11 December), the battle was the third defeat of Black Week.|$|E
25|$|The main {{projectile}} weapon used in Goguryeo was the bow. The bows were {{modified to}} be more composite and increase throwing ability on par with crossbows. To a lesser extent, stone-throwing machines and crossbows were also used. Polearms, used against the cavalry and in <b>open</b> <b>order,</b> were mostly spears. Two types of swords were used by Goguryeo warriors. The first was a shorter double-edged variant mostly used for throwing. The other was longer single-edged sword with minimal hilt and ring pommel, of obvious eastern han influence. The helmets were similar to helmets used by Central Asian peoples, decorated with wings, leathers and horsetails. The shield was the main protection, which covered most of the soldier's body. These cavalry were called Gaemamusa (개마무사, 鎧馬武士), which is similar type with that of Cataphract.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Durutte {{supervised}} the attack of his 1,700-man 2nd Brigade {{on the extreme}} right. About 1:30 PM, he sent his troops into the little valley in front of Papelotte and La Haye, covered by 18 horse artillery pieces and Jacquinot's cavalry. The original skirmish line recoiled before enemy fire and Durutte quickly reinforced it with battalions in <b>open</b> <b>order.</b> He also sent a horse battery to take Smohain under point-blank fire. Two battalions soon overran Papelotte and victory seemed to be at hand. At this moment, Durutte rode back to the ridge and found to his dismay that the 1st Brigade was crushed and the ground to his left covered with rampaging British cavalry. With the Dutch-Belgian cavalry brigade of Charles Étienne de Ghigny advancing downhill toward them, he had {{the men of the}} 2nd Brigade execute a hasty retreat covered by one of Jacquinot's regiments. The brigade was able to withdraw behind a battalion square from the VI Corps. These troops drove off Ghigny's light horsemen {{with the help of a}} nearby artillery battery.|$|E
25|$|Weapons, battle {{formations}} and deployment. As noted previously, Kongo region battle formations were {{in relatively}} <b>open</b> <b>order.</b> This allowed the peculiar dodging, twisting and leaping noted in Portuguese accounts as warriors {{tried to avoid}} arrows and spears delivered by their opponents. A battle generally opened with a brief volley of arrows from relatively weak bows. Indeed, the bravest soldiers went into battle {{with only a few}} arrows, which were poisoned in some cases by a potent mixture called cabanzo. Once these were released, the contenders closed for a decision by hand-to-hand combat. Several thousand men could take place in these set-piece battles, and the affair was usually decided by superior skill and aggression. Basic formations were known, and three divisions were sometimes used- a center and two wings. A complex system of drums, horns and signals aided in maneuver of the warrior hosts, and distinctive battle-flags and pennants identified the location of elite troops or their commanders. See the Battle of Mbwila for a detailed example of a Kongo army in action, including the 3-part division of the host, and its use of reserves.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July, Archduke Charles {{finally decided}} not to fight the enemy near the Danube and retreated to the higher ground {{overlooking}} the Marchfeld. This was a major decision, as it meant that the earlier plan to man the 16 redoubts next to the Danube and fight the enemy there was abandoned. Instead, Archduke Charles occupied both the Bisamberg heights and the Wagram plateau behind the Russbach river, covering the retreat routes to Bohemia and Moravia respectively, thus occupying a sound strategic position. Although the army was {{not strong enough to}} occupy both positions and no earthworks were provided for the new position, it was thought that, given that the two heights were placed at an angle to one another, any enemy force attacking would find itself placed between two pincers. There was perhaps further justification for this choice on a tactical level: the broken and wooded terrain in the immediate proximity of the Danube was adapted to fighting in <b>open</b> <b>order</b> formations, which were insufficiently mastered by his men, and at which the French were adept. This was, without a doubt, one of the bitter lessons that the Austrians learned at Aspern and Essling. But above all, the cautious Archduke Charles was unwilling to take the risk of committing his forces in such an advanced position, knowing that he {{would have a hard time}} extricating them, should retreat have become necessary. He also planned not to face the enemy on the flat plains of the Marchfeld, an ideal cavalry terrain, where the numerically superior French horse would quickly gain the upper hand. The two influential staff officers, Wimpffen and Grünne, had been actively advocating for this position for weeks and this time Charles finally acquiesced to their point of view.|$|E

500|$|Their Boer opponents taught {{not only}} the cavalry but the whole army some lessons. In one {{engagement}} at Dronfield, 150 Boers held off the British cavalry division, which was then supported by several artillery batteries, and at Bergendal seventy-four men held up the entire British Army. So effective were their tactics that they forced the British cavalry, {{if only for a}} short time, to leave their swords and lances behind and concentrate on their firepower. This proved to the British Army the value of a full size rifle over a carbine. Soon the cavalry were practising working dismounted and advancing in <b>open</b> <b>order.</b> Their change in tactics was evidenced during the charge at Klip Drift. On their way to relieve the siege of Kimberley, the cavalry used their horses and rifles instead of swords and lances to get behind the defending Boers. The charge was later described as [...] "an ideal cavalry operation, but not a cavalry charge as the term is generally understood." [...] Nevertheless, it would prove to be the last time that a full British cavalry division conducted a mounted charge.|$|E
2500|$|Faced {{with a heavy}} French concentration, Colli {{abandoned}} the Corsaglia River line {{on the night of}} 20/21 April. But the vigorous French pursuit soon overran the Sardinian rearguard.

The French general formed his least experienced troops into three columns and covered them with his veterans in <b>open</b> <b>order.</b> Then, leading his central column, Sérurier launched a charge with Masséna's division in support. Brushing aside spotty resistance, the French broke the Sardinian lines and forced them to abandon Mondovì. Dichat was killed. Stengel received a mortal wound while leading a force of dragoons in pursuit.|$|E
40|$|The Weimar Republic is {{analysed}} {{within the}} concept of limited and <b>open</b> access <b>orders.</b> Before World War I, Imperial Germany had developed into a mature limited access order with {{rule of law and}} open economic access but lack of competition in politics. After World War I and inflation, Weimar Germany developed toward an open access order; open access was not, however, sustainable and collapsed in 1930 – 31. This case of a failed <b>open</b> access <b>order</b> suggests refining the framework of limited and <b>open</b> access <b>orders</b> in further work. It shows that the political process of “creative destruction” might result in dissolution of open access and that the political system needs the capacity of efficiently creating legitimacy in order to sustain openness. The failure of Weimar Germany also indicates that the international political system might work as a destabilizing factor of open access and that the nation-state perspective of the limited and <b>open</b> access <b>order</b> framework needs to be supplemented by an international perspective...|$|R
