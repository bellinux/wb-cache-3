5|$|Home Pong was {{an instant}} success {{following}} its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000units were sold that holiday season. The game became Sears' most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones {{to capitalize on the}} home console's success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their <b>Odyssey</b> <b>system</b> with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey. The dedicated Pong consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's Pong consoles are common, while APF Electronics' TV Fun consoles are moderately rare. Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.|$|E

The {{existence of this}} algorithm was reported {{in a number of}} publications as the work progressed (White, 1978; Chrisman, 1979; Dougenik, 1979; Lab for Computer Graphics, 1983), but the details of the actual algorithm and data structures were not reported for institutional reasons (Chrisman, 1988). The original authors of the WHIRLPOOL algorithm here present the polygon overlay algorithm used by WHIRLPOOL, in greater detail than presented before. ODYSSEY is not being presented as the most current software system, yet its polygon overlay processor offers important lessons for current research. Background: A Brief History of Polygon Overlay Software Polygon overlay has been a key problem to be addressed in software for handling spatial data.

40|$|Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) é uma bactéria associada à Periodontite Agressiva (PA). Ela invade tecidos moles, com ocorrência de lisogenia e bacteriófagos presentes em até 69 % das subespécies. Estudos {{in vitro}} sugerem que a indução do bacteriófago (Aa 17) ocorre numa co-cultura de Aa lisogênico com fibroblastos humanos. Se esta interação ocorre in vivo, com liberação do vírus, uma reação imunológica contra o Aa 17 aconteceria. O objetivo deste estudo é constatar se anticorpos (AC) contra proteínas do Aa 17 existem e estão associados à doença periodontal. Um objetivo adicional foi testar a resposta de AC contra os sorotipos do Aa. 52 indivíduos participaram: 31 com PA, 5 com Periodontite Crônica (PC) e 16 com Periodonto Saudável (PS). Soro foi coletado após a classificação clínica. As proteínas do Aa 17 foram obtidas de preparações purificadas. As subespécies do Aa utilizadas para amostras de proteínas através de sonicação foram: 43717 (American Tissue Culture Collection - ATCC) sorotipo A, 43718 (ATCC) sorotipo B, 33384 (ATCC) sorotipo C, IDH 781 sorotipo D, NJ 9500 sorotipo E and CU 1000 sorotipo F. As proteínas foram separadas em géis de poliacrilamida e transferidas para membranas de nitrocelulose. As reações de Western-blotting ocorreram com o AC primário sendo o soro de cada indivíduo. Todas as membranas foram lidas pelo sistema Odyssey que captura sinais no AC secundário (antihumano). A resposta de AC contra ao menos uma proteína do Aa 17, assim como pelo menos um sorotipo do Aa foi observado em todos, com exceção de dois indivíduos (com PS), participantes. Um indivíduo do grupo PC e três do PA tiveram resposta de AC contra alguns, mas não todos os sorotipos do Aa. A resposta de AC contra todos os sorotipos foi o achado mais comum nos grupos PA (28 / 31), PS (14 / 16) e PC (4 / 5). A resposta de AC contra o complexo de proteínas do Aa 17 foi observado em 7 indivíduos com PA, 2 com PC e 6 com PS. A presença de AC contra qualquer proteína do Aa 17 tem significância estatística (p= 0, 044), assim como a resposta de AC contra o sorotipo C (p= 0, 044). Reações intensas foram vistas quando o soro reagiu contra proteínas do sorotipo C; em alguns casos um sinal tão forte que cobriu a maioria da faixa. Essa resposta intensa esteve presente em 17, 3 e 1 dos indivíduos com PA, PC e PS e tem significância estatística entre os grupos PA e PS (p= 0, 001). A resposta de AC contra uma proteína do Aa 17 ou seu complexo foi observado em todos os grupos. Esse achado sugere que a indução in vitro do Aa 17 poderia também ocorrer in vivo, embora não sendo necessariamente associada à periodontite. A resposta de AC contra vários sorotipos do Aa foi um achado comum e não associado com a doença. Entretanto, a presença e a intensidade da resposta de AC contra o sorotipo C está associada à PA. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) is a {{bacteria}} associated with Aggressive Periodontitis (AP). It invades soft tissues, with occurrence of lysogeny and bacteriophage presence up to 69 % of Aa subspecies. In vitro studies suggested that bacteriophage (Aa 17) induction occurs upon co-culture of Aa lysogens subspecies with human fibroblasts. If such an in vivo interaction resulted in Aa 17 induction and release of virions, an immunologic reaction to Aa 17 proteins could ensue. The {{purpose of this}} investigation was to learn whether serum antibodies (AB) to Aa 17 proteins are found in human sera, and whether they are associated with periodontal disease. An additional purpose was to test the AB response against known Aa serotypes. 52 individuals took part: 31 with AP, 5 with Chronic Periodontitis (CP) and 16 with a Healthy Periodontium (HP). Serum was collected after clinical classification. Aa 17 proteins were obtained from purified Aa 17 preparations. The Aa strains used for protein sampling through sonication were: 43717 (American Tissue Culture Collection - ATCC) serotype A, 43718 (ATCC) serotype B, 33384 (ATCC) serotype C, IDH 781 serotype D, NJ 9500 serotype E and CU 1000 serotype F. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western-blotting reactions were carried out with the primary AB being each subjects serum. All membranes were read through the <b>Odyssey</b> <b>system</b> which captures signals from a dye in a secondary (antihuman) AB. AB response against at least one Aa 17 protein, as well as a response to at least one Aa serotype, was observed in all but two individuals (with HP) who participated in the study. Serum from one individual from the CP group and three from the AP group had AB response to some, but not all Aa serotypes. AB response against all Aa serotypes was the most common finding in AP (28 / 31), HP (14 / 16) and CP (4 / 5) groups. AB response to the full complex of Aa 17 proteins was observed in 7 individuals with AP, 2 with CP and 6 with HP. Chi-square tests comparing the AP with HP groups indicated that the presence of AB against any Aa 17 protein is statistically significant (p= 0, 044), as well as AB response against serotype C (p= 0, 044). Intense reactions were seen when sera reacted with proteins from serotype C; in some cases the signal was so strong that it covered much of the lane. This intense response was present in 17, 3, and 1 of the AP, CP and HP subjects, respectively and was statistically significant (p= 0. 001) between the AP and HP groups. AB response against a Aa 17 protein or its whole complex was observed in all groups. This finding suggests that the in vitro Aa 17 induction could also be occurring in vivo, although it is not necessarily associated with periodontitis. AB response against multiple Aa serotypes was a common finding and is not associated with disease. However, the presence and intensity of AB response against Aa serotype C, is associated with AP...|$|E

Antisense-mediated targeted exon skipping {{has been shown}} to restore dystrophin expression both in DMD patients and in the mdx mouse, the murine model of DMD, but the ineffective delivery of these molecules limits their therapeutic use. We demonstrated that PMMA/N-isopropil-acrylamide (ZM 2) nanoparticles (NPs), administered both intraperitoneally and orally, were able to deliver 2 'OMePS antisense inducing various extents of dystrophin restoration in the mdx mice. Defining NP biodistribution is crucial to improve effects on target and dose regimens; thus, we performed in vivo studies of novel ZM 4 NPs. ZM 4 are conjugated with NIR fluorophores as optical probes suitable for studies on the <b>Odyssey</b> Imaging <b>System.</b> Our results indicate that NPs are widely distributed in all body muscles, including skeletal muscles and heart, suggesting that these vehicles are appropriate to deliver antisense oligonucleotides for targeting striated muscles in the DMD animal model, thus opening new horizons for Duchenne therapy...|$|R
