At the next Olympiad in Dresden the story repeated itself: Sargissian won team gold medal and Akobian won team bronze.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>student</b> {{organizations}} ANAK {{claims to}} have established include a chapter of the YMCA in 1910 and the Ramblin' Reck Club in 1930. The former claim, however, contradicts evidence of a YMCA chapter existing before 1908, and possibly as early as 1901. In 1912, ANAK additionally formed the Koseme Society, a comparable honor society geared towards sophomores and juniors at Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|As the ANAK Society is ostensibly {{a student}} {{organization}} at Georgia Tech, it {{is subject to}} the same rules and regulations as <b>other</b> <b>student</b> organizations. The society files paperwork with Georgia Tech administration and the Student Government Association, holds elections for each of its four mandatory officer positions (president, vice president, treasurer, and secretary) and is formally advised by a Georgia Tech faculty member. The president's name must be kept on file in the Office of Leadership and Civic Engagement, available to any student who seeks it. As of 2007, the society's current faculty advisor is Gary S. May, the dean of the College of Engineering and an ANAK member since 1985.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, McGill premiered its Office of Sustainability {{and added}} a second {{full-time}} position in this area, the Director of Sustainability {{in addition to the}} Sustainability Officer. Recent efforts in implementing its sustainable development plan include the new Life Sciences Center which was built with LEED-Silver certification and a green roof, as well as an increase in parking rates in January 2008 to fund other sustainability projects. <b>Other</b> <b>student</b> projects include The Flat: Bike Collective, which promotes alternative transportation, and the Farmer's Market, which occurs during the fall harvest. The Farmer's Market and many other initiatives came out of student collaboration during the Rethink Conference 2008.|$|E
5|$|Suzuki's working {{title for}} this second {{autobiography}} was The Outsider, a title intended {{to express the}} author's view of his own role in society. The origin of this outsider feeling comes from isolation suffered at a Japanese Canadian internment camp during World War II. He was imprisoned there for being Japanese but shunned by other Japanese for being a third generation Canadian, speaking only English. His feeling of isolation continued during his early school years when the only <b>other</b> <b>student</b> of Japanese heritage was his twin sister. Suzuki's daughters acknowledged this perception of himself as an outsider but insist that the public views him very differently, {{as one of their}} own, leading to the simple The Autobiography title.|$|E
5|$|The {{college and}} university-based {{chapters}} of the College Republicans operate in a dual capacity as student clubs associated with a particular campus and as members of their state federation and the College Republican National Committee. Like the state federations and national committee, the campus chapters are affiliated with their local Republican Party, but are not official arms of that organization. The chapter chairperson and leadership team are responsible for maintaining the campus club's credentials and constitution, and representing the College Republicans when dealing with university administration, <b>other</b> <b>student</b> groups, and in the surrounding community. The campus chapter leadership team might include many members, with administrative responsibilities delegated to dormitory and Greek chapter chairpersons.|$|E

In this test of actual behavior, the economics students returned a significantly larger percentage of lost letters, exhibiting more cooperative behavior than <b>other</b> <b>students.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|The {{group was}} {{struggling}} to find space to rehearse and perform by 1989. The Students' Building where Philaletheis had once performed had been transformed into the All Campus Dining Center and the old performance space was neither replaced nor replicated elsewhere on campus. To rememdy this, in 1993 and 1994, Vassar invested in the renovation {{of one of its}} disused buildings, a former functioning coal bin, into the Coal Bin Theater to be used by Philaletheis and the <b>other</b> <b>student</b> theatre and comedy groups that had been created by this time.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010â€“2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. Among {{the groups}} are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations {{run the gamut from}} sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances <b>other</b> <b>student</b> life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E
5|$|In 1733 the {{requirements}} for {{a call to the}} Bar were significantly revised in a joint meeting between the Benchers of Inner Temple and Gray's Inn, revisions accepted by Lincoln's Inn and Middle Temple, although they were not represented. It is not recorded what these changes were, but after a further discussion in 1762 the Inns adopted a rule that any student with a Master of Arts or Bachelor of Laws degree from the universities of Oxford or Cambridge could be called to the Bar after three years as a student, and any <b>other</b> <b>student</b> could be called after five years. An attempt was made to increase the quality of legal education at Gray's Inn; in 1753 a barrister, Danby Pickering, was employed to lecture there, although this agreement ended in 1761 when he was called to the Bar.|$|E

40|$|College {{students}} attribute {{more conservative}} {{attitudes and behaviors}} concerning alcohol use to themselves and progressively less conservative attitudes and behaviors to their friends and more distal peers. We examined whether a similar social-distancing effect would occur with adolescents in America and Ireland. Students (n = 2, 554) attributed the most conservative drinking frequency to themselves and progressively less conservative frequencies to their best friends, other good friends, <b>other</b> <b>students</b> their age at their own school, and <b>other</b> <b>students</b> their age at other schools, respectively. Similarly, adolescents attributed more disapproval of drinking to their best friends and progressively less conservative disapproval to other good friends, <b>other</b> <b>students</b> their age at their own school, and <b>other</b> <b>students</b> their age at other schools, respectively. As predicted, more social distancing occurred among Americans (relative to Irish) and girls (relative to boys) ...|$|R
5|$|More than 400 student {{clubs and}} {{organizations}} operate on Duke's campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. Duke Student Government (DSG) charters and provides {{most of the}} funding for <b>other</b> <b>student</b> groups and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. The Duke University Union (DUU) is the school's primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life. Cultural groups are provided funding directly from the university via the Multicultural Center {{as well as other}} institutional funding sources. One of the most popular activities on campus is competing in sports. Duke has 37 , and several intramural teams that are officially recognized. Performance groups such as Hoof 'n' Horn, the country's second-oldest student-run musical theater organization, a cappella groups, student bands, and theater organizations are also prominent on campus. As of the 2016â€“2017 school year, there are seven a cappella groups recognized by the Duke University A Cappella Council: Deja Blue, Lady Blue, Out of the Blue, the Pitchforks, Rhythm & Blue, Something Borrowed Something Blue, and Speak of the Devil. The Duke University mock trial team won the national championship in 2012.
