25|$|The Clerk of Parliament is the Chief Executive of the Secretariat. As of 2009, the Clerk is Ms. Ng Sheau Jiuan. She is the {{principal}} adviser to the House on parliamentary procedures and practices. When Parliament is sitting, she is stationed at the Clerk's Table below the Speaker's Chair, and reads the <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> The Clerk is appointed by the President after consultation with the Speaker and the Public Service Commission. She {{is supported by a}} Deputy Clerk, Principal Assistant Clerks and Assistant Clerks. The independence of the Clerk and her staff are protected to some extent by the Constitution. The Clerk can only be removed from office on the grounds of inability to discharge the functions of the office (whether arising from an infirmity of body or mind or any other cause) or for misbehaviour, and a parliamentary resolution that has received the affirmative votes of not less than two-thirds of all MPs is required. Further, the staff of Parliament are not eligible for promotion or transfer to any other office in the public service without the Speaker's consent.|$|E
25|$|Following VE-Day on 7 May, the {{battalion}} was tasked with guarding German prisoners, slowly transitioning to more general occupation duties before being withdrawn to Germany in late July {{to prepare for}} demobilization. The battalion was eventually shipped to New York three months later, where it was finally inactivated on 30 October. During its 297 days on active service, it had lost twenty-three men killed on active service, along with eight tank destroyers (four M10s and four M36s). In return, it had destroyed twenty-three German tanks (one a Tiger heavy tank) and ten self-propelled guns, along {{with a large number}} of light vehicles and fixed positions, this was around average for a tank destroyer battalion, with perhaps lighter than usual casualties. During the war, men of {{the battalion}} were awarded nine Silver Stars and seventy-two Bronze Stars, whilst two more men were awarded the French Croix de Guerre. The battalion as a whole was mentioned in the Belgian Army <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> for its service in the Ardennes, whilst the Distinguished Unit Citation was awarded to the 1st Platoon, Company A, for its service.|$|E

2500|$|General Humbert, then commandant of Brest, {{estimated}} in a mémoire to the Minister of War on 8 October 1800 {{that the number}} of Irish who had taken refuge in France after the failure of the French expeditions was between 1,000 and 1,500, and proposed their absorption into an Irish legion. [...] The old Irish brigade had been disbanded {{at the beginning of the}} revolution. In 1803, however, war was resumed with England and Napoleon turned his attention to re-organising the military. On 13 August Napoleon signed a decree at Saint-Cloud for the formation of an Irish battalion. The colonel of the battalion, ‘named by the first consul’, was the now 43-year-old James Bartholomew Blackwell. However John G. Gallaher argues that: “Despite his title and rank, it was not Blackwell, but MacSheehy, who ran the Irish Legion. MacSheehy issued the <b>orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> secured promotions for the men, communicated with army headquarters, and made all serious decisions affecting the battalion.” ...|$|E

On April 19, 1783, his General <b>Orders</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> announced the end of hostilities against Great Britain. [...] Congress thereafter ordered him to disband the army, since everyone agreed that a large army of 10,000 men was no longer needed, and the men were eager to go home. Congress gave each soldier three months pay, but since they had no funds Robert Morris issued $800,000 in personal notes to the soldiers. [...] Many soldiers sold these notes to speculators, some even before they left camp, {{in order to be able}} to make their way home. [...] Over the next several months, much of the Continental Army was furloughed, although many of the rank and file realized it was effectively a disbandment. The army was formally disbanded in November 1783, leaving only a small force at West Point and several scattered frontier outposts.|$|E
