Typically, five to 12 beetles will be within the spathe throughout the night. Rarely, cases of 200 beetles at a time have been observed and almost always the beetles are of the same species. Another interesting feature of this symbiotic relationship, less well understood, is the series of events in which the spadix begins to heat up prior to the spathe opening up for the beetles. This process is known as thermogenesis. By the time the spathe is open and the beetles have arrived, the spadix is usually quite hot; up to around 46°C in some species, but usually around 35°C. [...] The thermogenesis coincides {{with the arrival of}} the beetles and appears to increase their presence. The maximum temperature reached by the spadix remains about 20°C higher than the <b>outside</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> The time dependence of the temperature can vary from species to species. In some species, the temperature of the spadix will peak on the arrival of the beetles, then decrease, and finally increase reaching a maximum once again when the philodendron is ready for the beetles to leave. Other species, though, only show a maximum temperature on the arrival of the beetles, which remains roughly constant for about a day, and then steadily decreases. A few species will show three peaks in temperature during the flowering. The increased temperature increases the metabolism of the beetles, causing them to move about more within the spathe and increasing the likelihood they will be sufficiently coated with pollen. A sticky resin is also produced in drops attached to the spadix which help to keep the pollen attached to the beetles. This resin producing quality is unique to Philodendron and Monstera, as other genera of Araceae do not produce it on their spadices. The resin is also found on the stems, leaves, and roots of philodendrons. Its color can be red, orange, yellow, or colorless when it is first produced. Yet, over time, it will turn brown as it is exposed to air. Also, some evidence suggests the thermogenesis triggers the beetles to mate. It also appears to distribute the pheromones into the air. The reason for the spadix being held at 45° relative to the spathe may be to maximize the heat's ability to waft the pheromones into the air. Oxidizing stored carbohydrates and lipids has been found to be the energy source for thermogenesis. The part of the spadix that heats up is the sterile zone. As it heats up, carbohydrates are used, but once the spadix has reached its maximum temperature, lipids are oxidized. The lipids are not first converted to carbohydrates, but rather are directly oxidized. The thermogenic reaction is triggered when concentrations of acetosalicytic acid form in the sterile zone. The acid sets off the mitochondria in the cells that make up the sterile zone to switch to an electron transport chain called the cyanide-resistant pathway, which results in the production of heat. Philodendrons consume oxygen during thermogenesis. The rate at which oxygen is used is remarkably high, close to that of hummingbirds and sphinx moths. The spadix has been shown to generate infrared radiation. As the beetles home in on the inflorescence, they first move in a zig-zag pattern until they get reasonably close, when they switch to a straight-line path. [...] The beetles may be using scent to find the inflorescence when they are far away, but once within range, they find it by means of the infrared radiation. This would account for the two different types of paths the beetles follow.|$|E

These systems are providing low-cost cooling for distribution centers, warehouses, and other non air-conditioned industrial assembly plants {{with little or}} no internal loads. The evaporative roof cooling system keeps the building from heating up during the day by misting the roof surface with a fine spray of water -just enough to evaporate. This process keeps the roof surface at 90 ? levels instead of 150 ? and knocks out the radiant heat transfer from the roof into the building. The system is controlled by a thermostat and automatically shuts off at night or when the roof surface cools below the set point. The same control system turns on exhaust fans to load the building with cool night air. Air circulators are installed to provide air movement on workers during the day. Best results are achieved by closing dock doors and minimizing hot air infiltration during the day. The typical application will maintain inside temperatures that will average 84 ? - 86 ? when <b>outside</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> range from 98 ?- 100 ?. Many satisfied users will attest to marked improvements in employee moral and productivity, along with providing safe storage temperatures for many products.

Using the current set-up which employs the use of an HD satellite dish (81 cm × 55 cm) and the much larger dish (89 cm × 99 cm), a technique was successfully developed to use solar energy to provide enough thermal heat to perform transesterification reactions to produce biodiesel on the millimolar and molar scale. Furthermore, it appears that <b>outside</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> does not affect whether or not the dish is capable of being used in a chemical reaction.

30|$|Above treeline, where {{seedlings}} did {{not suffer}} from drought stress, photosynthetic rates were increased by elevated temperatures. The seedlings above treeline, {{both inside and outside}} the greenhouse, had foliar nitrogen levels close to what is considered an adequate level (1.45 %, Carter 1992), yet the seedlings <b>outside</b> at <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> did not photosynthesize as much as the seedlings at high temperatures, indicating that higher temperatures increased photosynthesis rates when N was not limiting. Higher temperatures could increase either activity or production of Ribulose 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and other Calvin cycle enzymes, which would amplify carboxylation capacity. Plants tend to produce more Rubisco than needed, particularly when nitrogen is abundant (Stitt and Schulze 1994). The high foliar nitrogen concentration suggests abundant Rubisco. Therefore, it appears that an increased amount of Rubisco allows the seedlings under high temperatures to fix more carbon and allocate enough photosynthates for both height and needle growth.|$|R

SETTING [...] The study included all deaths and hospital admissions due to hypothermia (1979 - 85) in the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland, population 3. 5 million. SUBJECTS [...] All deaths coded {{during the study period}} as being due to hypothermia and all persons admitted to hospital during the study period for whom hypothermia was recorded as a discharge diagnosis in HIPE data. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Demographic data and date of death/diagnosis were obtained from both data sets. Complete national temperature records were obtained from the meteorological service and a temperature was assigned to each case representing <b>ambient</b> <b>outside</b> <b>temperature</b> at which hypothermia developed. Risk of hypothermia at a given temperature was obtained by dividing the number of cases at that temperature by the appropriate person-years of exposure of the entire national population. Incidence of and mortality from hypothermia doubled with each 5 degrees C and 4 degrees C fall in temperature respectively; the majority of deaths and hospital admissions occurred between October and March. Incidence and mortality increased with age and men had 30 % higher case fatality than women. Single men had four times the incidence and 6. 5 times the mortality, and single women had double the incidence and four times the mortality of married men and women respectively. Low population density was also an important risk marker.

On the low side of the ground temperature relative to the ambient, it can be utilized for space cooling by means of ground passive cooling (GPC) technique. GPC technique is a method requires a pipe or several pipes buried below the ground surface at which temperatures are lower than <b>outside</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> By circulation ambient air inside the pipe, heat will be rejected from the air inside the pipe to the ground surrounding. Performance of the GPC is crucial and it is depend on the local ground temperature, ground thermal properties and the GPC’s pipe specification. Since the ambient temperature in Malaysia during the daytime is ranging from 30 to 35 °C, thus it has a great potential for implementing GPC as an alternative method in building cooling. Ground temperature in Malaysia has been analyzed and it is depend on depth, thermal diffusivity and time and it is lower than the ambient temperature at certain depth. Therefore, it has capability to serve cooling by mean of GPC. This paper presents the performance of GPC in term of outlet temperature and rate of heat transfer based on mathematical model and experimental study. Different input parameters have been investigated such as depth of the ground, input temperature and flowrate of the air inside the pipe. Experimental rig of the GPC has been developed with the main purpose to create actual ground condition. A PCV pipe with 8. 7 m length has been used in the experiment. Results show that flowrate at 0. 03 kg/s and Tg = 23 °C gives great temperature reduction in the pipe compared with higher flowrate and ground temperature. Highest rate of heat transfer of 473 W occurred at flowrate of 0. 07 kg/s and Tg = 23 °C. The experimental results also have been validated with mathematical model and obtained close agreement...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a long history of {{attempts}} to promote subsistence rural aquaculture within South Africa. Many of these attempts have failed due to inadequate support from government and support agencies. There {{has been a}} recent revived interest in promoting rural aquaculture development. Presented in this project are six scenarios demonstrating the potential application of thermal modelling techniques to improving subsistence rural aquaculture. These scenarios were based on a model validated against a real life system, and run with environmental data for the year 2005. Bovine manure, grass thatch, cereal straw and Typha spp. water reeds were tested for thermal performance. These results were then applied to the scenarios. The open and kraal enclosed pond scenarios yielded the widest deviation in temperatures throughout the year, with an average temperature of 3. 8 oC and 6. 0 oC above ambient and a temperature range of 10. 6 oC and 12. 4 oC for the year respectively. Eliminating solar radiation and reducing wind speed resulted in an average difference of 1. 5 oC below ambient and a temperature range of 7. 5 oC for the year. When completely enclosed in a well-sealed traditional Xhosa style hut, the pond had an average difference of 5. 6 oC below <b>outside</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> with a range of 7. 8 oC for the year. A passive solar heating scenario added to the sealed hut scenario, which when run continuously maintained an average difference of 34. 7 oC above outside ambient temperatures, with a range of 56 oC for the year. When a hypothetical 25 oC temperature control was included in the model, the system maintained an average of 7. 1 oC above ambient outside temperatures, with a temperature range of 0. 8 oC throughout the year. The wider range of temperatures made available through the use of thermal modelling approaches provides a more diverse range of species available for subsistence rural aquaculture at any site, significantly improving its potential...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{buildings}} {{are a significant}} source of energy consumption (about 50 %) and carbon emissions (about 40 %), and providing conditioning to building interiors is a major portion of that expenditure. Improving building envelope performance can reduce the amount of energy used for heating and cooling, since external walls provide an important barrier between occupied building spaces and variable ambient conditions. In general, multi-layer exterior walls tend to perform better than single-layer walls, even for the same overall R-value and thermal capacitance. This work addresses practical choices in multi-layer wall design to minimize internal temperature swings that result from <b>outside,</b> or <b>ambient,</b> <b>temperature</b> fluctuations. An electrical analogy is used to model one-dimensional heat conduction using RC circuits. A frequency response analysis is conducted based on a period of one day. For a fixed wall thickness, four features are optimized: materials, proportion of materials, number of layers, and material distribution. Key design features include pairing insulating and thermally massive materials, distributing layers evenly, and positioning the insulating layers at the inner- and outer-most layers of the wall (i. e., near the indoor and outdoor environments). Methods for determining the optimal proportion of each material and number of layers are also presented. Combined, these easily implemented features can reduce interior temperature fluctuations by several orders of magnitude compared to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> variations. This helps maintain steady indoor temperatures, which is more comfortable for building occupants, and supports energy management strategies, like reducing peak heating and cooling loads...|$|R

The Climatic Wind Tunnel (CWT) is a facility used by the motor industry to test vehicles under climatic extremes {{without the need for}} expensive overseas test programs. This work focuses on the application of computer simulation to the Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) plant that makes up a CWT facility. The objective being to reduce its operational costs through the identification of energy saving operational strategies. When in operation the CWT has a peak power consumption of 3 MW. The implementation of any measures that would reduce this peak load would give rise to considerable savings in the operating costs of the facility. Computer simulation is an accepted technique for the study of systems operating under varying load conditions. Simulation allows rapid analysis of different strategies for operating plant and the effectiveness of achieving the desired effect without compromising the buildings performance. Models for the components of the CWT have been developed and coded in Neutral Model Format. These models have then been linked together in a modular simulation environment to give a model of the complete plant. The CWT plant naturally decomposesin to four major subsystems these being the test chamber, the soakroom, air make-up and refrigeration system. Models of all the primary and secondary HVAC plant are described as is how they constitute the systems that make up the CWT. Validation tests for individual components {{as well as for the}} systems have been carried out. To illustrate the potential of the application of computer simulation into finding improved modes of operation that would reduce the energy consumption of the facility, four studies have been carried out. The studies involve the possibility of scheduling the operation of condenser fans as a function of refrigeration load and <b>outside</b> <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> methods for the pre-test conditioning of a vehicle, a reduction in the secondary refrigerant flow temperature and an increase in the thickness of the insulated panels from which the facility is constructed.

They shade buildings from solar radiation, absorb solar radiation for photosynthesis and evapo-transpiration, reduce solar reflection and re-radiation to atmosphere. Green façade and roof has been included as one of major green building evaluation criteria for many sustainable cities in the world nowadays. This research aims to study the use of climbing plants as vertical shading devices, “biofacade”, for naturally ventilated building with windows facing west. Blue trumpet vine (Thunbergia grandiflora) was selected due to its fast growth and consistently full leave coverage. Two experiments were carried out to compare air temperature of a room with biofacade and a room without. Natural ventilation were added to both rooms and the thermal performances were compared. It {{has been found that}} biofacade performance increased when room air velocity was high from the case with natural ventilation. The room air temperature was reduced from <b>outside</b> <b>ambient</b> air <b>temperature</b> to the maximum of 9. 93 °C, with an average of 3. 63 °C during day time (9 : 00 a. m. - 8 : 30 p. m.). When air velocity was low, the temperature difference had maximum of 6. 72 °C, average of 0. 91 °C lower than normal room. At night (9 : 00 p. m. - 8 : 30 a. m.), however, biofacade had slightly higher air temperature than normal room and <b>outside</b> <b>ambient</b> air in both cases. Unexpectedly, leaves of the selected climbers did not obstruct wind when cross ventilation was provided and air velocity inside room with biofacade was higher than room without biofacade especially in the daytime. Besides, in tropical climate, air behind leaves always maintain lower <b>temperature</b> than <b>ambient</b> air <b>temperature,</b> which is different from research in temperate climate where air behind leaves can sometime obtain higher temperature. From the 2 experiments, the room temperature with biofacade reduced significantly but still could not reach comfort zone (22 - 28 °C) during the day time.

40|$|The article {{presents}} numerical analysis of exergy for air-conditioning influenced by <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> The model of numerical simulation uses an integrated {{air conditioning system}} exposed in varied <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> to observe change of the four main devices, the compressor, the condenser, the capillary, and the evaporator in correspondence to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> The analysis devices of the four devices’s exergy influenced by the varied <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> {{and found that the}} capillary has unusual increasing exergy loss vs. increasing <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> in comparison to the other devices. The result shows that reducing exergy loss of the capillary influenced by the <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> is the key for improving working efficiency of an air-conditioning system when influence of the <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> is considered. The higher <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> causes the larger pressure drop of capillary and more exergy loss...|$|R

40|$|Effects {{of initial}} <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> on {{combustion}} and soot emission characteristics of diesel fuel were investigated through experiment conducted in optical constant volume chamber and simulation using phenomenological soot model. There are four difference initial <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> adopted in our research: 1000 K, 900 K, 800 K and 700 K. In {{order to obtain}} a better prediction of soot behavior, phenomenological soot model was revised {{to take into account}} the soot oxidation feedback on soot number density and good agreement was observed in the comparison of soot measurement and prediction. Results indicated that ignition delay prolonged with the decrease of initial <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> The heat release rate demonstrated the transition from mixing controlled combustion at high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> to premixed combustion mode at low <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> At lower <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> soot formation and oxidation mechanism were both suppressed. But finally soot mass concentration reduced with decreasing initial <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> Although the drop in <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> did not cool the mean in-cylinder temperature during the combustion, it did shrink the total area of local high equivalence ratio, in which soot usually generated fast. At 700 K initial <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature,</b> soot emissions were almost negligible, which indicates that sootless combustion might be achieved at super low initial temperature operation conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Gas turbine is {{sensitive}} to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> Different <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> could change {{the state of the}} inlet air of compressor and make the gas turbine work in off design conditions. Research the effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on gas turbine performance is valuable to the long-term safe operation of gas turbine. In this paper, a thermodynamic model of a simple cycle gas turbine which has three shafts was established, and steady-state performance simulation under different <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> was carried out. In the two conditions of 1. 0 and 0. 35 work states, the effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on thermodynamic parameters, specific power and thermal efficiency of gas turbine were analyzed. The result shows that: effect of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> on three-shaft gas turbine is different under different work state, and relevant factors must be considered to select the appropriate control strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{the health}} effects of {{extremely}} low/high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) on mortality as representative indices of temperature variability is growing. Although numerous studies have reported on these indices independently, few studies have provided the attributes of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and DTR related to mortality, concurrently. In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare the mortality risk attributable to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and DTR. The study included data of 63 cities in five East-Asian countries/regions during various periods between 1972 and 2013. The attributable risk of non-accidental death to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> was 9. 36 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 8. 98 – 9. 69 %) and to DTR was 0. 59 % (95 % CI: 0. 53 – 0. 65 %). The attributable cardiovascular mortality risks to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> (15. 63 %) and DTR (0. 75 %) are higher than the risks to non-accidental/respiratory-related mortality. We verified that <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> plays a larger role in temperature-associated mortality, and cardiovascular mortality is susceptible to <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> and DTR...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a CFD {{model was}} {{developed}} to investigate the effect of high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> field on the supersonic oxygen jet behaviour. The results were compared with available experimental data by Sumi et al. (2006) and a jet model proposed by Ito and Muchi (1969). The CFD simulation with k-e turbulence model including compressibility terms was found to under predict potential flow core length at higher <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> At high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures,</b> {{the density of the}} ambient atmosphere is low which results in reduction of the growth rate of mixing. The k-e turbulence model with compressibility correction can duplicate the reduction in growth rate of mixing at low <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> but fails to accurately model the decrease in growth rate of mixing at high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> A modified k-e turbulence model was presented which modifies the turbulent viscosity {{in order to reduce the}} growth rate of mixing at high <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The CFD simulation was performed by using commercial CFD software AVL FIRE 2008. 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper analyzes, {{given the}} large {{variation}} in {{turbine discharge pressure}} with changing <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures,</b> whether variable-speed radial-inflow turbine operation has a similar benefit for Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) power recovery systems as variable-speed centrifugal compression has for chiller applications. The benefit of variable-speed centrifugal compression over fixed-speed operation is a reduction in annual electricity consumption of almost 40 %. Air-conditioning systems are by necessity always designed for the highest possible <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature.</b> This is not necessary for ORC systems. Lower cost ORC systems are obtained when the design point is selected at moderate <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> However, these systems show reduced power output at higher <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The more expensive ORC systems designed to achieve full power at higher <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures</b> will produce constant power independent of <b>ambient</b> <b>temperature</b> but consume more heat and require a control mechanism to prevent overloading the turbine at lower <b>ambient</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The benefit of variable-speed ORC turbine operation over fixed-speed {{is an increase in}} annually averaged ORC power output and/or a reduction in annually averaged thermal heat input demand. However, the variable-speed benefit is as, will be explained in the paper, inherently smaller for ORC systems than for centrifugal chillers...|$|R
