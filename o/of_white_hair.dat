500|$|Dominant {{white is}} a group of genetically related coat color {{conditions}} in the horse, best known for producing an all-white coat, but also for producing some forms of [...] white spotting and white markings. Dominant white horses are born with unpigmented pink skin and white hair with dark eyes, although the amount <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> or spotting can vary depending on which genetic mutation is involved. Dominant white is a rare condition, and under normal conditions, at least one parent must be dominant white to produce dominant white offspring. [...] However, most of the currently-known alleles of dominant white can be linked to a documented spontaneous mutation in a single ancestor.|$|E
500|$|Depp {{created his}} own image of Todd. Heavy purple and brown make-up was applied around his eyes to suggest fatigue and rage, as if [...] "he's never slept". Burton said of the {{character}} Sweeney Todd, [...] "We always saw him as a sad character, not a tragic villain or anything. He's basically a dead person when you meet him; the only thing that's keeping him going is the one single minded thing which is tragic. You don't see anything else around him." [...] Depp said of the character, [...] "He makes Sid Vicious look like the innocent paper boy. He's beyond dark. He's already dead. He's been dead for years." [...] Depp also commented on the streak of white in Todd's hair, saying, [...] "The idea was that he'd had this hideous trauma, from being sent away, locked away. That streak <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> became the shock of that rage. It represented his rage over what had happened. It's certainly {{not the first time}} anyone's used it. But it's effective. It tells a story all by itself. My brother had a white spot growing up, and his son has this kind of shock of white in his hair." ...|$|E
500|$|Dominant white {{horses are}} born with pink skin and a white coat, which they retain {{throughout}} their lives. Although the term [...] "dominant white" [...] is typically associated with a pure white coat, such horses may be all-white, near-white, partially white, or exhibit an irregular spotting pattern {{similar to that of}} sabino horses. The amount <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> depends on which mutation of W is involved. Non-white areas of skin and hair are most commonly seen along the dorsal midline of the horse, known as the topline, and are especially common in the mane and on the ears. They may also have interspersed specks or spots of non-white skin and hair. In addition, the hooves are most often white, but may have striping if there is pigmented skin on the coronary band just above the hoof. In some cases, foals born with residual non-white hair may lose some or all of this pigment with age, without the help of the gray factor. Dominant white spotting does not affect eye color, and most dominant white horses have brown eyes. The pink skin is devoid of pigment cells (melanocytes), and appears pink from the underlying network of capillaries. White hair is rooted in unpigmented pink skin. There are many other genetic factors that produce white, near-white, and off-white coat colors in horses, some of which are visually very similar to dominant white.|$|E

500|$|From 1968, Ted Kennedy was {{the most}} {{prominent}} living member of the Kennedy family, and the last surviving son of Joseph P. Kennedy and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy. John F. Kennedy had said in 1957, [...] "Just as I went into politics because Joe died, if anything happened to me tomorrow, my brother Bobby would run for my seat in the Senate. And if Bobby died, Teddy would take over for him." [...] However, Ted {{was never able to}} carry on the [...] "Camelot" [...] mystique {{in the same way that}} both of his fallen brothers had, with much of it disappearing during his failed 1980 presidential bid. His negligence in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne at Chappaquiddick and his well-documented later personal problems further tarnished his image in relation to the Kennedy name, and significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming president. The Associated Press wrote that, [...] "Unlike his brothers, Edward M. Kennedy has grown old in public, his victories, defeats and human contradictions played out across the decades in the public glare." [...] But Kennedy's legislative accomplishments remained, and as The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "By the early 21st century, the achievements of the younger brother would be enough to rival those of many presidents." [...] His death prompted the realization that the [...] "Camelot era" [...] was truly over. Kennedy's New York Times obituary described him via a character sketch: [...] "He was a Rabelaisian figure in the Senate and in life, instantly recognizable by his shock <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> his florid, oversize face, his booming Boston brogue, his powerful but pained stride. He was a celebrity, sometimes a self-parody, a hearty friend, an implacable foe, a man of large faith and large flaws, a melancholy character who persevered, drank deeply and sang loudly. He was a Kennedy." ...|$|E

"A large shapeless figure [...] a pile <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> {{dominated}} by a bun on the top, which usually slid {{over to the side}} of her head by the end of the day," [...] Fine was, despite her appearance, a loved and respected figure. [...] John Finley, editor of The New York Times during the 1910s, wrote of her, [...] "So was the school under her wise and gentle rule a place where happy children grew into her spirited likeness." [...] Fine retired in 1931 and died two years later.|$|E
2500|$|One {{pattern of}} roaning is rabicano, also called white ticking. [...] While true roans {{have an even}} intermixture of white hairs {{throughout}} the body, except the extremities, the white hairs of a rabicano are densest {{around the base of}} the tail and the flank. Rabicano roaning frequently forms rings <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> {{around the base of the}} tail, and in extensively roaned rabicanos, the white hairs may converge to form vertical stripes over the ribcage. Rabicano is found in many breeds, and may account for some [...] "roan" [...] Arabians.|$|E

2500|$|In The Uncanny X-Men #173, October 1983, Claremont {{and artist}} Paul Smith {{created a new}} look for Storm, abandoning her old costume for black leather top and pants, and {{changing}} her former veil <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair</b> into a punk mohawk. The change in appearance {{was inspired by the}} decision of colleague Walt Simonson to shave off his beard and mustache while on vacation with his wife, X-Men editor Louise Simonson. Upon their return, Simonson's daughter, Julie, upset at her father's new appearance, ran from the room. When the editors decided to change Storm's appearance, Smith submitted a number of designs to them, explaining in a 2008 interview: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1843, the Act for Regulating the Theatres {{came into}} force, {{bringing}} {{an end to}} the monopolies of the two existing companies and, by doing so, increased the number of theatres in London. At the same time, the fashion in theatre was [...] "pictorial": valuing visual spectacle above plot or characterisation and often required lengthy (and time consuming) scene changes. For example, Henry Irving's 1892 King Lear offered spectacles such as Lear's death beneath a cliff at Dover, his face lit by the red glow of a setting sun; at the expense of cutting 46% of the text, including the blinding of Gloucester. But Irving's production clearly evoked strong emotions: one spectator, Gordon Crosse, wrote of the first entrance of Lear, [...] "a striking figure with masses <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair.</b> He is leaning on a huge scabbarded sword which he raises with a wild cry in answer to the shouted greeting of his guards. His gait, his looks, his gestures, all reveal the noble, imperious mind already degenerating into senile irritability under the coming shocks of grief and age." ...|$|E
2500|$|Storm's ancestry {{supports}} {{the use of}} magic and witchcraft. Many of her ancestors were sorceresses and priestesses. [...] Storm's matrilineal powers have even {{been linked to the}} real-world Rain Queens of Balobedu, the region from which her Sorceress Supreme ancestor, Ayesha, hails. [...] The Mystic Arcana series deals with Storm's ancestor Ashake, who worships the Egyptian goddess Ma'at, also known as Oshtur — the mother of Agamotto. Oshtur appears to have strong favor for the bloodline of Ororo. For some unknown reason, since the dawn of Atlantis, this line of African women has been given distinguishing features <b>of</b> <b>white</b> <b>hair,</b> blue eyes, and powerful magic potential. Although Storm has not developed her magical potential, it has been hinted at. [...] The Mystic Arcana series lists the characters with magic potential according to the Marvel Tarot deck. [...] The Tarot asserts Storm as being [...] "High Priestess", the First Tarot's choice one-third of the time. [...] The other draws were the Scarlet Witch and Agatha Harkness. [...] These three characters split the High Priestess card equally. [...] A timeline-divergent Storm became the sorceress who taught sorcery to Magik and some of Storm's alternate universe selves possess considerable magical talent. [...] On a separate note, it has been stated that Storm's spirit is so strong {{that she was able to}} host the consciousness of an avatar (or [...] "manifestation body") of Eternity; in a gathering consisting of herself, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Silver Surfer and the Fantastic Four, she and Doctor Strange were the only viable candidates.|$|E
