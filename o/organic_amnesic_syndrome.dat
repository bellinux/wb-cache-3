Intraoperative observation and multiple CT scans did not reveal focal brain damage. Arteriography showed that both patients had arterial vasospasm. The amnesia has persisted over three years since the surgery. Study of the characteristics of their amnesia showed several features in common with other <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> including severely depressed free recall, and less depressed recognition of visual and verbal material.

40|$|From {{a review}} of the {{literature}} on the consequences of thalamic infarctions, it may be concluded that memory problems taking the form of an <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome</b> are dependent upon the integrity of the mammillo-thalamic tract (MTT). Memory problems incompatible with an <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome</b> however, appear to result from thalamic infarctions involving other areas of the thalamus but which leave MTT intact. In contrast, executive dysfunctions could not be shown so readily to depend upon a single structure of the thalamus. The results indicate that damage to the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, the midline nuclei or the intralaminar nuclei, or a combined lesion of these structures may be responsible for deficits of executiv...|$|R
40|$|In humans lacunar infarcts in the mesial and {{anterior}} {{regions of}} the thalami are frequently associated with <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes.</b> In this review paper, we scrutinized 41 papers published between 1983 and 2009 that provided data on a total of 83 patients with the critical ischemic lesions (i. e. 17 patients with right-sided lesions, 25 with left-sided lesions and 41 with bilateral lesions). We aimed to find answers to the following questions concerning the vascular thalamic amnesia syndrome: (i) Which qualitative pattern of memory impairment (and associated cognitive and behavioral deficits) do these patients present? (ii) Which lesioned intrathalamic structures are primarily responsible for the <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome?</b> (iii) Are the recollection and familiarity components of declarative memory underlain by the same or by different thalamic structures? Results of the review indicate that, similar to patients with <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes</b> due to mesio-temporal lobe damage, patients with vascular thalamic amnesia display a prevalent deficit of declarative anterograde long-term memory, a less consistent deficit of declarative retrograde long-term memory and substantially spared short-term and implicit memory. Unlike mesio-temporal lobe patients, however, vascular thalamic amnesics often present dysexecutive and behavioral deficits similar to those observed in patients with frontal damage. The presence of an <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome</b> in patients with thalamic lacunar infarcts is strongly predicted by involvement of the mammillo-thalamic tract, which connects the anterior nuclei complex to the hippocampus proper via the fornix and the mammillary bodies. Finally, data reported in a few single cases provide support for the hypothesis that thalamic regions connected to distinct areas of the mesio-temporal lobe play differential roles in recollection and familiarity processes. The mammillo-thalamic tract/anterior nuclei axis seems primarily implicated in recollective processes, whereas the ventroamygdalofugal pathway/medio-dorsal axis primarily underlies familiarity processes...|$|R
40|$|Bilateral {{damage to}} the medial {{temporal}} lobe, including the hippocampus, in man {{is associated with a}} severe <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome.</b> It is still not clear whether the hippocampus (or its output pathways and related target projection sites) is the critical structure in producing this syndrome, especially as more severe learning deficits in animals are found with lesions in the anterior inferotemporal cortex than with hippocampal lesions per se. But the problem of trying to relate memory deficits in man and animals depends on the characterization of the <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome</b> itself. It was originally thought to be a failure of input into long-term memory store or a failure of consolidation. Medial temporal and hippocampal lesions in animals do not produce results that fit such a characterization. On re-examination of the human syndrome, however, for which some of the evidence is reviewed, it appears that the amnesic patients can learn and remember over long intervals if certain testing paradigms are used. The results are more readily matched to some of the results of hippocampal lesion studies in animals. Two main classes of current theories of the <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome</b> are discussed. A somewhat different approach is suggested here, based on the dissociation between human amnesic subjects' commentaries and their objective performance, which suggests a dissociation between levels of processing rather than a failure on any particular level...|$|R

40|$|Bilateral {{damage to}} either the medial {{temporal}} lobe or the diencephalic midline causes an <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> i. e. a global impairment {{in the ability to}} acquire new memories regardless of sensory modality, and a loss of some memories, especially recent ones, from the period before amnesia began. The memory deficit can occur against a background of intact intellectual and perceptual functions. Two themes have been prominent in recent work. First, the <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is narrower than once believed in the sense that a number of learning and memory abilities are preserved (e. g. skill and habit learning, simple forms of conditioning and the phenomenon of priming). Second, the brain system damaged in amnesia has only a temporary role in memory.

40|$|M. A. (Psychology) The Post Traumatic <b>Amnesic</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> {{which follows}} a mild closed head injury, {{seems to be}} a common {{occurrence}} in the field of neuropsychology. The syndrome is primarily characterised by a transient memory loss of daily events, normally commencing within days after the injury. The symptoms include absent-mindedness, an inability to remember names, dates, numbers and faces, commands and orders given at work. Due to the relatively uncomplicated nature of a mild closed head injury, the syndrome is often overlooked and underestimated in terms of its intensity and psychological damage. Patients are sent home after a brief observation period and medical staff are of the opinion that the patients will recover successfully, without experiencing much psychological or cognitive strain. It is usually thought that the syndrome does not last for more than three to four months.

40|$|Transient <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes</b> are {{striking}} clinical phenomena that are commonly encountered by physicians in acute medical settings. Diagnosis of such syndromes can be challenging, and their causes have been debated for over 50 years. Critical clinical distinctions, such as between transient global amnesia (TGA) and transient epileptic amnesia (TEA), {{as well as}} important clues to the underlying pathophysiology, have recently been revealed. TGA {{is characterized by the}} sudden onset of a profound anterograde and retrograde amnesia that lasts for up to 24 h, with neuroimaging after an acute TGA event showing transient perturbation of specific hippocampal circuits that are involved in memory processing. Some cases of transient amnesia are attributable to focal seizure activity and are termed TEA, which has a clinical presentation similar to that of TGA, but can be distinguished from the latter by the brevity and frequency of amnesic attacks. Moreover, TEA carries a risk of persistent memory impairment that can be mistaken for dementia. Here, we summarize clinically relevant aspects of transient <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> giving practical recommendations for diagnosis and patient management. We describe results from imaging and epidemiological studies that have shed light on the functional anatomy and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these conditions. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{important}} advances {{have been made}} in reconciling some of the conflicting evidence regarding the contribution of the medial temporal lobe [...] hippocampal structures to long-term memory in man compared with laboratory animals. Despite the severe amnesic state that is seen clinically in patients, it has nevertheless emerged that both in animals and man damage to the structures leaves learning and retention of certain types of long-term memory tasks intact. The evidence from man suggests that in the <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome</b> the integrity is preserved of those forms of long-term memory that do not depend on the operation of a 'mediational' memory system. In particular, items stored in semantic memory can be facilitated by repetition, and simple associations can be formed if no mediating links are required, but impairments are seen in tasks in which memory depends upon the stored benefits of matching, reordering and comparing. A similar characterization seems possible for the results of animal studies. One interpretation of the differential sensitivity of memory tasks in the <b>amnesic</b> <b>syndrome</b> is in terms of a disconnection syndrome which a semantic memory system is detached from a mediational system. The disconnection is postulated to be caused by interruption of those temporal-frontal pathways in which pathology has been found in the brains of amnesic patients, namely the mammillary bodies and the subependymal zone of the thalamus...|$|R

40|$|There {{have been}} many reports of global memory {{disorder}} following rupture and repair of intracranial aneurysms.

Unlike in most films in this genre, this amnesic character retains his identity, has little retrograde amnesia, and shows several of the severe everyday memory difficulties associated with the disorder.
