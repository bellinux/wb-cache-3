5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable <b>of</b> <b>explaining</b> the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: For {{survival}} data {{the coefficient of}} determination cannot be used to describe how good a model fits to the data. Therefore, several measures <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation for {{survival data}} have been proposed in recent years. Methods: We analyse an existing measure <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation with regard to minimisation aspects and demonstrate {{that these are not}} fulfilled for the measure. Results: In analogy to the least squares method from linear regression analysis we develop a novel measure for categorical covariates which is based only on the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Hence, the novel measure is a completely nonparametric measure with an easy graphical interpretation. For the novel measure different weighting possibilities are available and a statistical test of significance can be performed. Eventually, we apply the novel measure and further measures <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation to a dataset comprising persons with a histopathological papillary thyroid carcinoma. Conclusion: We propose a novel measure <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation with a comprehensible derivation as well as a graphical interpretation, which may be used in further analyses with survival data...|$|R

5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task <b>of</b> <b>explaining</b> {{the failure}} to the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the {{hydrogen}} bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E

5|$|The first {{proposal}} that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morré and Mollenhauer in 1974.

The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was {{an alternative to the}} various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.|$|E

5|$|From September 1610, Galileo {{observed}} that Venus exhibited {{a full set}} of phases {{similar to that of the}} Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. On the other hand, in Ptolemy's geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun. Traditionally, the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases. It was, however, also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun, where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases. After Galileo's telescopic observations of the crescent, gibbous and full phases of Venus, therefore, this Ptolemaic model became untenable. Thus in the early 17th century, as a result of his discovery, the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo-heliocentric planetary models, such as the Tychonic, Capellan and Extended Capellan models, each either with or without a daily rotating Earth. These all had the virtue <b>of</b> <b>explaining</b> the phases of Venus without the vice of the 'refutation' of full heliocentrism's prediction of stellar parallax. Galileo's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two-stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo-heliocentrism.|$|E

The numerical results i) confirm the superiority of block optimization over deflation for the determination of group-sparse loadings, and the importance of group information when available, and ii) show that ranking of algorithms according to explained variance is essentially independant of the definition <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variance.

40|$|Simulated {{data sets}} {{are used to}} {{evaluate}} conditional and unconditional maximum likelihood estimation in an individual case-control design with continuous covariates when there are different rates of excluded cases and different levels of other design parameters. The effectiveness of the estimation procedures is measured by method bias, variance of the estimators, {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) for logistic regression and the percentage <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation. Conditional estimation leads to higher RMSE than unconditional estimation in the presence of missing observations, especially for 1 : 1 matching. The RMSE is higher for the smaller stratum size, especially for the 1 : 1 matching. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation appears to be insensitive to missing data, but is generally higher for the conditional estimation than for the unconditional estimation. It is particularly good for the 1 : 2 matching design. For minimizing RMSE, a high matching ratio is recommended; in this case, conditional and unconditional logistic regression models yield comparable levels of effectiveness.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of anomaly detection algorithms is finding samples deviating from the majority. Although {{a vast number}} of algorithms designed for this already exist, almost none <b>of</b> them <b>explain,</b> why a particular sample was labelled as an anomaly. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called Explainer, which returns the explanation of sample’s differentness in disjunctive normal form (DNF), which is easy to understand by humans. Since Explainer treats anomaly detection algorithms as black-boxes, it can be applied in many domains to simplify investigation of anomalies. The core <b>of</b> <b>Explainer</b> is a set of specifically trained trees, which we call sapling random forests. Since their training is fast and memory efficient, the whole algorithm is lightweight and applicable to large databases, datastreams, and real-time problems. The correctness <b>of</b> <b>Explainer</b> is demonstrated {{on a wide range of}} synthetic and real world datasets...|$|R
40|$|The {{coefficient}} of determinant, {{also known as}} the R 2 statistic, is widely used as a measure of the proportion <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation {{in the context of a}} linear regression model. In many real life events, interests may lie on measuring the proportion <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation, 2, <b>of</b> a latent scale dependent variable U which follows a multiple regression model. But in practice, U may not be observable and is represented by its binary proxy. In such situations, use of logistic regression analysis is a popular choice. Many analogues to R 2 type statistics have been proposed to measure explained variation in the context of logistic regression. McFadden’s R 2 measure stands out from others because of its intuitive interpretation and its independence on the proportion of success in the sample. It, however, severely underestimates the proportion <b>of</b> <b>explained</b> variation <b>of</b> the underlying linear model. In this research we present a method for estimating the explained variation for the underlying linear model using the McFadden’s R 2 statistics. When used in a real life dataset, our method estimated 2 of the underlying model within an acceptable margin of error...|$|R
