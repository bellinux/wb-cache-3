5|$|Fleas {{arose in}} the early Cretaceous, most likely as ectoparasites of mammals, {{before moving on to}} other groups {{including}} birds. Each species of flea is more or less a specialist on its host animal species: many species never breed on any other host, though some are less selective. Some families of fleas are exclusive to a single host group: for example, the Malacopsyllidae are found <b>only</b> <b>on</b> armadillos, the Ischnopsyllidae <b>only</b> <b>on</b> bats, and the Chimaeropsyllidae <b>only</b> <b>on</b> elephant shrews. The oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, is a vector of Yersinia pestis, the bacterium which causes bubonic plague. The disease was spread by rodents such as the black rat, which were bitten by fleas that then infected humans. Major outbreaks included the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, both of which killed a sizeable fraction of the world's population.|$|E
