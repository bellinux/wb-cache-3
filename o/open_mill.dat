40|$|Abstract. Graphene nanoplatelets (GnP) {{reinforced}} {{styrene-butadiene rubber}} (SBR) nanocomposites were produced by two different methods. For reference purpose carbon black (CB) reinforced formulations served. In {{the first method}} the components were mixed on a two roll <b>open</b> <b>mill</b> directly. In the second method, GnP was subjected to milling in an attritor mill together with cyclic butylene-terephthalate oligomer (CBT) powder prior to the mixing on two roll mill. Samples were cured in a hot press. The rubber sheets were characterized by tensile and tear tests, and their fracture surfaces inspected in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that GnP outperformed CB with respect to reinforcing effect. Previous co-milling of GnP with CBT caused a slight decrease in mechanical properties. SEM images proved, that the co-milling process did not affect significantly the dispersion of GnP, its particles were shredded into smaller pieces, which caused the slight decrease in the mechanical properties...|$|E

40|$|Several {{formulations}} containing EPDM and LDPE were prepared. EPDM was {{blended with}} LDPE in different weight ratios of LDPE/EPDM (40 / 60, 30 / 70, 20 / 80, 10 / 90). These compounds were mixed at 150 ºC in <b>open</b> <b>mill</b> for 10 min {{at a speed}} of 19. 03 rpm and then mixed with phenolic resin. Here, phenolic resin grade SP- 1068 used which work as a tackifier resin. The mechanical, thermal, morphological, dynamical and electrical properties of polymeric insulators will be tested and reported in thesis. In future, the result of mechanical measurement shows that mechanical properties such as tensile strength, modulus and elongation-at-break of blends can be enhanced with increase in LDPE in the formulation.

40|$|Zinc disorbate (ZDS) was in situ {{formed by}} the {{reaction}} between sorbic acid (SA) and zinc oxide (ZnO) in nitrile rubber (NBR). The effects of SA amount on the curing characteristics, crosslink density and mechanical properties of peroxide- cured NBR were studied. The results showed that ZDS was generated mainly during the rubber vulcanization, rather than the <b>open</b> <b>mill</b> compounding phase. The results from the crosslink density determinations showed that the formation of ZDS significantly increased the ionic bond content in the vulcanizates. In addition, the formation of ZDS greatly enhanced the mechanical properties of NBR vulcanizates. The modulus, tensile strength, tear strength and hardness {{were found to be}} increased with the loading of ZDS. Preheating the compounds before compression moulding was beneficial to the formation of ZDS, and consequently the increases in mechanical properties. At 40 parts per hundred rubber (phr) of SA and 16 phr ZnO, five to six folds of tensile strength and tear strength of the neat NBR vulcanizate were achieved. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirmed the nano-dispersion structure of the polymerized ZDS in the NBR matrix...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to study the influence of utilization of sulphur and reclaim rubber on the characteristics of ebonite rubber, and also to determine the optimum utilization of reclaim rubber and sulphur which yield good physical properties. Ebonite rubber was made by special natural rubber of RSS I (Ribbed Smoke Sheet I) mixed with reclaimed rubber at ratio 80 / 20, 70 / 30 and 60 / 40 part hundred rubber/part hundred rubber (phr/phr) and utilization of sulphur 30, 40, and 50 phr and also additives respectively. Mixing was done by using <b>open</b> <b>mill,</b> and vulcanization was conducted at early temperature 1200 C for 2 hours, and it was continued by post curing at temperature 1500 C for 2 hours. The physical properties such as tensile strength, elongation at break, D shore hardness, and izod impact of ebonite rubber vulcanized were determined. The result indicated that characteristics of ebonite rubber was significantly influenced by the amount of added sulphur and 40 phr reclaim rubber or at ratio of RSS I to reclaim rubber 60 to 40 phr/phr. However, the physical properties of ebonite rubber was able to meet the standard quality of group 2 regarding to Classification Hard Rubber issued by ASTM D 213...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to obtain the rubber compound formulation with nano sulfur application in vulcanization process to produce vechicle rubber compound that will fulfill the standard specification. The experiment held by crushing the sulphr to covert intonano size through mechanical milling. Nano Sulphur were characterized with XRD method (X-RAY Difraction) and SEM method (Scanning Eletronical magnetic). The steps for making the rubber compound are mastication/milling the rubber and mixing with other supporting chemicals (activator, filler, softener, antioxidant, resin, accelerator) using the <b>open</b> <b>mill,</b> continued with vulcanization processwhich using nano sulphur as the vulcanization agent untilthe rubber compound ready to be molded. the experimental research used factorial completely randomized design with two factor as treatments, and each combination was replicated for three time. The first factor is the variation of vulcanization temperature (140 ˚C and 170 ˚C) and the second factor is the variation of suphur size (40 nm, 60 nm, 80 nm, and 400 nm). Tested parameters are modulus,elongation at break,tear strength and density of rubber compound from the vehicle. The result showed that the variation of vulcanization elongation at break,tear strength,and density of rubber compound of the vehicle. The best treatment is obtained in temperature variation 140 ˚C and sulfur size 60 nm (T 1 S 2),with compound rubber characteristic of vehicle for modulus 108 N/cm 2,elongation at break 565 % tear strength 90 kg/cm 2, and density 1, 220 g/cm 2...|$|E
