40|$|The {{transverse}} 'Sillaro line' {{is merely}} the outcrop line of the north-west dipping <b>overthrust</b> <b>plane</b> of the Liguride Complex. The anti-Apenninic strike of this <b>overthrust</b> <b>plane</b> {{is the result of}} the 'Sillaro flexure', a large synsedimentarily developed flexure of the basement of the Northern Apennines. The Liguride Complex overlies to the north-east progressively younger deposits dating from Early Miocene to eventually Pliocene: the Liguride overthrust is tectonically transgressive. The Liguride Complex is made up largely of clay, the Argille Scagliose; the overthrusting was gravitational. Just like glaciers and ice-sheets the Liguride Complex is a plastic mass capable of spreading under the influence ofgravitation. Olistostromization played a role ofvarying importance in the advance of the Liguride Complex. During the Pliocene, when a shallow molasse basin was invaded, it was the dominating mechanism. Locally the Liguride Complex interfingers with autochthonous deposits, as a result of a temporary standstill of the thrust sheet. The deposits just below the <b>overthrust</b> <b>plane</b> often show the influence of the approaching Liguride Complex. The Marnoso Arenacea is a turbidite formation of Miocene age. The configuration of its sedimentation basin was influenced strongly by an anticline that developed synsedimentarily, resulting in the Castel Vecchio 'high'. This 'high' divided the basin into an inner and outer basin in the south-west and north-east respectively, each with its own sedimentary history. The position of the inner basin axis was defined by the Rovigo syncline, which was also synsedimentary. A 'klippe sedimentaire', the Casaglia Member, invaded the basin from the south-west, and carne to a standstill near the basin axis. It proved impossible to describe the turbidites in terms of inner and outer fan and basin plain deposits by analogy with recent turbidite sedimentation in oceanic environments. A purely descriptive classification in facies associations is introduced here. The thickest and coarsest turbidites were usually deposited in the deepest parts of the basin. Towards the 'high' they became thinner and finer grained, until only marls were deposited. Upon the Castel Vecchio 'high' moluscs are found in living position, indicating that occasionally this 'high' approached sea-level. The Castel Guerrino Formation which constitutes a separate tectonic unit, was probably deposited in a more internal part ofthe Marnoso Arenacea basin. This formation thrust from the south-west upon the Marnoso Arenacea, after which it overthrust 5 km further to the north-east over a thin slice of Liguride rocks which had already overthrust the Marnoso Areacea...|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{works for}} the design of the Konjsko Tunnel with two pipes, part of the Split-Zagreb Motorway, {{provided}} relevant data on rock mass and soil properties for construction of the prognose engineering-geological longitudinal sections. West tunnel portals are situated in tectonically deformed and partly dynamically metamorphosed Eocene flysch marls, while east ones are located in Senonian limestones. There is an overthrust contact between flysch marls and limestones. With the beginning of the excavations, rock mass characteristics were regularly registered after each blasting and actual longitudinal engineering-geological cross-sections were constructed as well as cross-sections of the excavation face. There were some differences between prognosticated and registered sections since it was infeasible to accurately determine the dip of the <b>overthrust</b> <b>plane</b> that was at shallow depth below the tunnel grade line and also due to the occurrence of transversal faults that intersected the overthrust. Data collected before and during the tunnel construction complemented the knowledge on geological structure of the surroundings and physical-mechanical characteristics of strata (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|E
40|$|The crustal {{structure}} of the transition zone between the Eastern Alps and {{the western part of}} the Pannonian depression (Danube basin) is traditionally interpreted in terms of subvertical Tertiary strike-slip and normal faults separating different Alpine tectonic units. Reevaluation of approximately 4000 -km-long hydrocarbon exploration reflection seismic sections and a few deep seismic profiles, together with data from approximately 300 wells, suggests a different structural model. It implies that extensional collapse of the Alpine orogene in the Middle Miocene was controlled by listric normal faults, which usually crosscut Alpine nappes at shallow levels, but at depth merge with <b>overthrust</b> <b>planes</b> separating the different Alpine units. The alternative structural model was tested along a transect across the Danube basin by gravity model calculations, and the results show that the model of low-angle extensional faulting is indeed viable. Regarding the whole lithosphere of the western Pannonian basin, gravity modelling indicates a remarkable asymmetry in the thickness minima of the attenuated crust and upper mantle. The approximately 160 km lateral offset between the two minima suggests that during the Miocene extension of the Pannonian basin detachment of the upper crust from the mantle lithosphere took place along a rheologically weak lower crust...|$|R
40|$|Contact {{between the}} Upper Cretaceous rocks of the Subsilesian Nappe and the {{overthrust}} Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Silesian Nappe is uniquely exposed at locality Ostravice River Chanell. The deposits of the Silesian Nappe {{in the zone}} of <b>overthrust</b> <b>plane</b> that belong to the Hradiště Formation are tectonically affected. The more exact age of the mentioned rocks has never been documented earlier. The most significant stratigraphic data were obtained by the analysis of calcareous nannofossils. The sediments of the Hradiště Formation in the zone of overthrust of the Silesian Nappe belong to two partial tectonic slices. Sediments of slice on the contact between both the Nappes is, according to calcareous nannoplankton, of latest Hauterivian to Early Barremian age. In {{the area of the}} rapids, the other slice lying on it is of Late Hauterivian age. Micritic limestones occurring in the Late Hauterivian slice indicate basinal sedimentation above the carbonate dissolution level. Character of intercalated sandstones indicates of its turbiditic origin. Limestone interclasts in layers of gravelly sandstones document the erosion of the Upper Jurassic to early Lower Cretaceous carbonate platform by turbiditic currents. Further up the river, deposits belonging to higher, partial tectonic slices and stratal members of the Silesian Nappe were identified. At the beginning, {{a small part of the}} Veřovice Formation of Late Aptian age is exposed. After interruption, a huge outcrop of the Lhoty Formation of Middle and Late Albian age follows and then again the higher part of Hradiště Formation of Early Aptian age.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. The {{most important factor}} in the area to influence both structure and stratigraphy is the Santa Susana overthrust. Overthrusting along the Santa Susana fault has in many cases taken place along more than one plane producing an imbricate structure. Structurally the period of orogeny which culminated in this overthrusting resulted in close and overturned folding and faulting. The most prominent anticlinal fold is that which extends in a nearly east-west direction across the entire width of the area and passes just below the Holt Ranch, in Browns Canyon. Faults which are older than the Santa Susana orogeny are found, and include both the normal and reverse types. Some of these earlier faults have cut out varying thicknesses of formation, introducing local stratigraphic gaps. Several periods of folding, uplift arid erosion, indicated by unconformities, are evident, and provide lines of weakness which have been influential in guiding and controlling the later folding. Thin development of formations and the numerous unconformities point to a very unstable area. Recent diadtrophic movement is indicated by folding and faulting of the (Pleistocene) Santa Susana <b>overthrust</b> <b>plane.</b> Through the medium of this overthrusting, an entirely different stratigraphy from that native to the area has been introduced. Above the thrust, a thick section composed of Modelo shale, (lower Monterey) (Valvulineria californica zone) shale, and non-marine Topanga sandstone, conglomerate, and basalt is found, This section, which has been overthrust from the north, presents an entirely different environmental lithology. The lithology below the thrust, and native to the area, is much less well-developed, and differs considerably from the introduced section found above the thrust. The poor development of these formations, {{and the fact that they}} thicken northward and that they are nearly all separated by unconformities, suggests a marginal oscillating environment in the old Miocene-Pliocene depositional basin. The overthrust section and sections to the north, as at Pico and Elsmeree canyons, are much thicker and lack many of the unconformities present in this area. These areas undoubtedly occupied a position nearer the center of the Miocene-Pliocene depositional basin. The oldest rock native to this area is the great thickness of Chico (Upper Cretaceous) sandstone, which makes up the boldly outcropping Simi Hills. Unconformably overlying this is the basal Martinez conglomerate (lower Eocene), which, in the particular area mapped, is in fault contact with younger Eocene to Pliocene formations. The only other Eocene formation mapped was the thick section (1300 feet [ [...] . ]) of Llajas (middle Eocene) shales and silts, which grade downward to sandstone and conglomerate near the base of the formation. The Llajas is abundantly fossiliferous. A big stratigraphic break separates the Liajas from an unconformably overlying upper Topanga conglomerate and silt, 50 to 100 feet thick. This thin section of marine fossiliferous Topanga, limited above and below by unconformities, is a marked contrast to the thick section of non marine sandstone, conglomerate, and basalt which lies above the thrust and was introduced from an area to the north by overthrusting. Disconformably above the Topanga, in the section native to the area, is found a thin section of argillaceous Modelo shale, varying in thickness from about 25 feet in the southern part of the area to more than 100 feet in the northern portion, where sandstone lenses and layers are found interbedded. This relatively thin section is in marked contrast to the thick overthrust section of Modelo, which is in excess of a thousand feet thick. The Valvulineria californica shale section found between the Topanga non-marine and Modelo shale lying above the thrust is not found in the section below the thrust. Disconformably above the "native" Modelo shale is found a late lower and early middle Pliocene concretionary silt which is equal in age to about the middle of the Pico formation at the type section in Pico Canyon. This partial equivalent of the type Pico has been designated as the Pico formation in the area mapped. An unconformity separates these Pico silts from an overlying sandstone, conglomerate and fossil reef formation which has been designated the San Diego formation because of the similarity of its abundant fossil content with that of the type San Diego. This 75 to 100 foot thickness of upper middle Pliocene-San Diego strata is, however, an age equivalent of the upper Pico formation at its type locality. Both mega- and micro- fossil evidence points to this. Thus it may be said that the time represented in the accumulation of the strata at the type locality of the Pico formation has its equivalent in the Aliso and Browns Canyons area. This time equivalent is represented by the San Diego formation, the so-called Pico silts of the area, the unconformity separating the two, and by part of the time represented in the unconformity below the Pico silts and above the Miocene Modelo formation. The San Diego formation grades upward into brackish and non-marine Saugus deposits composed of 500 feet of sands, conglomerates and mudstones. All of these previously mentioned formations were involved in the latest severe folding which culminated in the Santa Susana overthrust. Lying on the erosion surface formed by the partial beveling of these folded deposits are found younger Pleistocene terrace and river channel deposits consisting of large, hard, sandstone boulders, mud, and Modelo shale fragments...|$|E
