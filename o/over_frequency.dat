40|$|International {{audience}} This paper {{introduces a}} novel technique for reconstructing {{the phase of}} modified spectrograms of audio signals. From the analysis of mixtures of sinusoids we obtain relationships between phases of successive time frames in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. To obtain similar relationships <b>over</b> <b>frequencies,</b> in particular within onset frames, we study an impulse model. Instantaneous frequencies and attack times are estimated locally to encompass the class of non-stationary signals such as vibratos. These techniques ensure both the vertical coherence of partials (<b>over</b> <b>frequencies)</b> and the horizontal coherence (over time). The method is tested {{on a variety of}} data and demonstrates better performance than traditional consistency-based approaches. We also introduce an audio restoration framework and observe that our technique outperforms traditional methods. </p...|$|R

40|$|Proc. of the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), Toulouse, France, May 2006 In modern DSL systems, {{multi-user}} crosstalk is a {{major source}} of performance degradation. Optimal spectrum balancing (OSB) is a centralized algorithm that optimally allocates the available transmit power <b>over</b> <b>frequencies,</b> thereby mitigating the effect of crosstalk. OSB uses Lagrange multipliers to enforce constraints that are coupled <b>over</b> <b>frequencies.</b> However, finding the optimal Lagrange multipliers can become complex when more than two users are considered. This paper presents a number of properties of the Lagrange multipliers which lead to an efficient search algorithm. Simulations show that the required number of Lagrange multiplier evaluations is independent of the number of users and much smaller compared to the number of evaluations of currently known search algorithmsstatus: publishe...|$|R
