In 1991 she received the Goldman Environmental Prize in San Francisco and the Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership in London. CNN aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out.

25|$|In 1987 the United Nation's World Commission <b>on</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development</b> (the Brundtland Commission), in {{its report}} Our Common Future {{suggested}} that development was acceptable, {{but it must be}} sustainable development that would {{meet the needs of the}} poor while not increasing environmental problems. Humanity’s demand on the planet has more than doubled over the past 45 years as a result of population growth and increasing individual consumption. In 1961 almost all countries in the world had more than enough capacity to meet their own demand; by 2005 the situation had changed radically with many countries able to meet their needs only by importing resources from other nations. A move toward sustainable living by increasing public awareness and adoption of recycling, and renewable energies emerged. The development of renewable sources of energy in the 1970s and '80s, primarily in wind turbines and photovoltaics and increased use of hydroelectricity, presented some of the first sustainable alternatives to fossil fuel and nuclear energy generation, the first large-scale solar and wind power plants appearing during the 1980s and '90s. Also at this time many local and state governments in developed countries began to implement small-scale sustainability policies.|$|E

In 1992, the first UN Earth Summit resulted in the Rio Declaration, Principle 3 of which reads: [...] "The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations."

These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment {{of the degree to}} which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice. In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests.

His issue is not with the reality of climate change, but rather with the economic and political approaches being taken (or not taken) {{to meet the challenges of}} that climate change. He is a strong advocate for focusing attention and resources on what he perceives as far more pressing world problems, such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition. In his critique of the 2012 United Nations Conference <b>on</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>and</b> <b>Development,</b> Lomborg stated: [...] "Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat."

Subsequently, the Group of 77 argued in the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF) and then the 2001 Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF), for affordable access to environmentally sound technologies without the stringency of intellectual property rights; while developed states there rejected demands for a forests fund.
