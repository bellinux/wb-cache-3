5|$|Because the {{previous}} two installments of the Final Fantasy series had not been localized and released in North America at the time, Final Fantasy IV was distributed as Final Fantasy II to maintain naming continuity. This remained the norm until the release <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VII in North America (after the release <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VI under the title <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy III) and subsequent releases of the original Final Fantasy II and III on various platforms. Final Fantasy II has since gone under the title Final Fantasy IV.|$|E

5|$|The initial concept talks for Final Fantasy VII {{began in}} 1994 at Final Fantasy {{developer}} Square, following the completion <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VI. As {{with the previous}} installment, series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi reduced his role to that of producer and granted others {{a more active role}} in development: these included Yoshinori Kitase, who had been one of the directors <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VI. The next installment was initially planned as a 2D game for Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). After creating an early 2D prototype <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VII for the SNES, the team postponed development to help finish Chrono Trigger.|$|E
5|$|The {{timeline}} of Ivalice {{as presented}} in the games was left quite vague, and formerly other official sources had said little on the matter.

5|$|Although it is {{predominantly}} populated by humans, Spira features {{a variety of}} races. The people of Spira mainly reside in small towns and villages and cities like Bevelle and Luca. The Al Bhed is a unique ethnic group which {{plays an important role}} in the storyline and world of the games with distinctive green eyes with spiral-shaped pupils. The culture and conflicts of the Al Bhed permeate the games. The main characters Rikku, is Al Bhed, and Yuna is part Al Bhed on her mother's side; and assistance in gained through a cast of supporting Al Bhed character's, prevalent in Final Fantasy X-2. With the collapse of the teachings of Yevon and the wider acceptance of machina at the end <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy X, prejudice against the Al Bhed seems to have eased significantly by the time <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy X-2, though it is still present.|$|E

5|$|Another {{departure}} from the gameplay <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy X is in its world navigation system: players can visit almost every location in Spira from early in the game, transported via the airship Celsius.

5|$|Development <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy X-2 {{began in}} late 2001 in {{response}} to the success <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy X, particularly fan reaction to the Eternal Calm video included in the Japanese version <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy X International. It was released in Japan shortly before the merger between Square and Enix. The game's eventual name, X-2, was initially not liked by the production team, but it was eventually accepted since the story was a direct continuation of X and thus could not be the next numbered title in the series. Kazushige Nojima, the previous game's writer, was also skeptical about the creation of a sequel. Something he was particularly averse to originally was the happy ending, which he felt was wrong for the story. The production team was one third the size of the previous installment. This was because the team was already familiar with the material and it allowed them to give a hand-crafted feel to the game. In designing the game, a significant number of character models, enemies, and location designs from Final Fantasy X were reused. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura has explained that this allowed the game to be developed in one year and at half the normal scope Final Fantasy titles are normally produced. Maya and Softimage 3D were the two main programs used to create the graphics.|$|E
5|$|During {{one of the}} cutscenes <b>of</b> <b>Final</b> Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by the Edea in battle. This {{created a}} theory that Squall dies in battle. When asked about this, Kitase laughed at this and denied this theory. However, he found it {{interesting}} if a remake of the game was ever proposed and the staff would think of changing elements from the story.|$|E
