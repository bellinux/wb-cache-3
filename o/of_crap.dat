We used to do the voices, {{everything}} – it saved 'em money. We even did the female backing vocals.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{rated the}} pilot episode 10th on {{its list of}} the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, writing that [...] "The smooth {{introduction}} to all things Veronica makes you care for her instantly. Anyone wrestling with creating a female character who is multifaceted and real needs only to study Veronica. We see many different sides, and there isn't any stereotyping. They sell her tough exterior so well that even though Veronica has been through a pile <b>of</b> <b>crap,</b> you don't pity her – which is good, because she doesn't want it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|NME {{gave it a}} mixed review, {{and said}} [...] "new ballad [...] "Headlines" [...] is {{functional}} but lacks a certain, ahem, zig-a-zig aaaaaaargh." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it a mixed review, as he commented that, along with [...] "Voodoo", it was [...] "forgetable" [...] and a [...] "sleepy" [...] song. The reviewer {{also said that the}} song [...] "isn't as self-referential or clever as its title suggests". However, Rosie Swash from The Guardian provided a negative review, stating, [...] "the Spice Girls have never been the most sincere bunch of women and between an entirely forgettable melody and lyrics that go round in circles <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> about reaching into your soul and the time being now or never", completing that the biggest sound the song made was [...] "the echo of total hollowness".|$|E

5000|$|In {{the game}} <b>of</b> <b>craps,</b> a dice roll of two sixes (value 12) on the come-out roll {{constitutes}} a “craps” and the shooter (dice thrower) loses immediately.|$|R
500|$|Like {{other black}} {{players in the}} 1940s and 1950s, Motley faced racist attitudes {{both on and off}} the field. Paul Brown would not {{tolerate}} discrimination within the team; he wanted to win and would not let anything get in his way. Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would just stand right there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd see those guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and just turn their backs. That kind <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> went on for two or three years until they found out what kind of players we were." [...] Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down.|$|E
2500|$|Biologist Kevin Padian {{from the}} University of California, Berkeley, said {{people who had}} {{received}} copies were [...] "just astounded at its size and production values and equally astonished at what a load <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> it is." [...] adding that [...] " [...] does not really {{have any sense of}} what we know about how things change through time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting {{on some of}} the {{reaction}} to the book, David Mitchell noted in The Guardian that [...] "The amount <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> we expect prime ministers' wives to endure, unpaid, for having the temerity to be married to the country's most successful politician is a national disgrace", and The Lady magazine concluded that [...] "whatever reviewers say, she is a natural heroine to the Mumsnet demographic".|$|E
50|$|Yo-leven (commonly {{referred}} to as Yo) is the outcome of rolling an 11 in the game <b>of</b> <b>craps.</b> The term was coined to prevent confusion with seven, which has a similar sound.|$|R
50|$|If {{the game}} is played {{repeatedly}} until someone wins, then the conditional probability above is the probability that the player wins the game. This is illustrated below for the original game <b>of</b> <b>craps,</b> using an alternative proof.|$|R

2500|$|Fox News Channel's Chew On This {{enacted a}} blind taste test for Mac n' Cheetos {{in the streets}} of New York City. Reception proved positive. In the web series Juggalos Review Foods, two Insane Clown Posse fans (or Juggalos) tried the Mac n' Cheetos with a more mixed reception. One of the hosts {{appraised}} the food product with [...] "this tastes like processed weird gross mac and cheese-like gimmicky piece <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> food item from Burger King".|$|E
2500|$|There {{is never}} {{complete}} agreement about music as controversial as City of Glass, only {{a consensus on}} either side. [...] Asked by English record aficionado Colin Goodall, trumpeter Buddy Childers was explicit: [...] "Either you do have the intellectual capacity to appreciate the music, or it is bullshit,"...so Childers was asked his opinion, [...] "It's bullshit." [...] Stan Kenton adamantly defended Graettinger's music but later had his doubts. [...] Stan Kenton, [...] "Well, I tell ya, it was either the greatest music the band ever presented, or the biggest pile <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> we ever played, and I {{still do not know}} which." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some scenes used {{documentary}} recordings {{which were}} made by Bakshi and edited to fit the scene; these were used because Bakshi wanted the film to [...] "feel real". According to Bakshi, [...] "I made tons and tons of tapes.... When I went to have the film mixed, the sound engineers gave me all kinds <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> about the tracks not being professionally recorded; they didn't even want to mix the noise of bottles breaking in the background, street noise, tape hiss, all kinds of shit. They said it was unprofessional, but I didn't care." [...] Although the sound designers insisted that Bakshi needed to re-record the dialogue in the studio, Bakshi persisted on their inclusion.|$|E
50|$|Cream <b>of</b> the <b>Crap!</b> Vol. 1 is {{the first}} of two {{compilation}} albums by Swedish rock band The Hellacopters which contains rare singles, B-sides, EP selections, and other non-album tracks by the band.

50|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{about whether or}} not an advantage can be gained at some other games. One example is dice control. Authors Stanford Wong and Frank Scoblete believe that by setting and throwing the dice in a certain way players can alter the odds at the game <b>of</b> <b>craps</b> enough to gain an advantage.|$|R
2500|$|Anderson was {{originally}} approached {{to be involved}} in a live-action feature film adaptation of Thunderbirds as far back as 1996, but he was actually turned away by the producers of the 2004 film Thunderbirds, which was directed by Jonathan Frakes, after first being invited to meet with them. He distanced himself overtly from the project, later turning down an offer of $750,000 simply to write an endorsement of the film shortly before its release; Sylvia Anderson served as a consultant on the project and received a [...] "special thanks" [...] credit in the film. The film received poor critical reviews and was unsuccessful at the US box-office. Anderson disliked the film, describing it as [...] "the biggest load <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> I have ever seen in my life".|$|E
2500|$|In 1946, when he {{was barely}} four years old, Connolly's mother {{abandoned}} her children while their father was serving as an engineer in the Royal Air Force in Burma. [...] "I've never felt abandoned by her", Connolly explained in 2009. [...] "My mother was a teenager. My father was in Burma, fighting a bloody war. The Germans were dropping all kinds <b>of</b> <b>crap</b> on the town. We lived at the docks, so that's where all the bombs were happening. She was a teenager with two kids in a slum. A guy comes along and says, 'I love you. Come with me.' Given the choice, I think I'd have gone with him. It looks as though it might all end next Wednesday, from where you're standing. I don't have an ounce of feelings that she abandoned me. She tried to survive." ...|$|E
2500|$|MTV {{rejected}} {{other black}} artists' videos, such as Rick James' [...] "Super Freak", {{because they did}} not fit the channel's carefully selected album-oriented rock format at the time. The exclusion enraged James; he publicly advocated the addition of more black artists' videos on the channel. Rock legend David Bowie also questioned MTV's lack of black artists during an on-air interview with VJ Mark Goodman in 1983. MTV's original head of talent and acquisition, Carolyn B. Baker, who was black, had questioned why the definition of music had to be so narrow, as had a few others outside the network. [...] "The party line at MTV was that we weren't playing black music because of the 'research, said Baker years later. [...] "But the research was based on ignorance... we were young, we were cutting edge. [...] We didn't {{have to be on the}} cutting edge of racism." [...] Nevertheless, it was Baker who had personally rejected Rick James' video for Super Freak [...] "because there were half-naked women in it, and it was a piece <b>of</b> <b>crap.</b> [...] As a black woman, I did not want that representing my people as the first black video on MTV." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and they can say {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind <b>of</b> <b>crap.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In Sabrina, Billy Wilder {{wished to}} cast Cary Grant {{as the older}} male lead. Unable, he chose Bogart to play the elder, {{conservative}} brother who competes with his younger playboy sibling (William Holden) for the affection of the Cinderella-like Sabrina (Audrey Hepburn). Bogart was lukewarm about the part, but agreed to it on a handshake with Wilder, sans finished script but with the director's assurances he would {{take good care of}} Bogart during the filming. Nevertheless, Bogart got on poorly with his director and co-stars. He complained about the script and its last-minute drafting and delivery, and accused Wilder of favoring Hepburn and Holden on and off the set. At the root was Wilder being the opposite of Bogart's ideal director, John Huston, in both style and personality. Bogart groused to the press that Wilder was [...] "overbearing" [...] and [...] "is the kind of Prussian German with a riding crop. He is the type of director I don't like to work with... the picture is a crock <b>of</b> <b>crap.</b> I got sick and tired of who gets Sabrina." [...] Wilder later claimed, [...] "We parted as enemies but finally made up." [...] Despite the acrimony, the film was successful. The New York Times crowed that Bogart was [...] "incredibly adroit... the skill with which this old rock-ribbed actor blends the gags and such duplicities with a manly manner of melting is one of the incalculable joys of the show." ...|$|E

50|$|Wong wrote Wong on Dice which {{purports to}} show how the game <b>of</b> casino <b>craps</b> can be beaten through {{controlled}} dice throwing. Many blackjack experts are skeptical <b>of</b> Wong's <b>craps</b> claims, and this is a hotly disputed issue—unlike card counting in blackjack, which can be mathematically proven.
