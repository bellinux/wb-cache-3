A numerical solution of laminar wall boundary layer from Navier-Stokes equations shows the same observation that a lower <b>order</b> <b>scheme</b> is more accurate on a coarse grid.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a wide class of discrete diffusion load balancing algorithms. The problem {{is defined as}} follows. We are given an interconnection network {{and a number of}} load items, which are arbitrarily distributed among the nodes of the network. The goal is to redistribute the load in iterative discrete steps such that at the end each node has (almost) the same number of items. In diffusion load balancing nodes are only allowed to balance their load with their direct neighbors. We show three main results. Firstly, we present a general framework for randomly rounding the flow generated by continuous diffusion schemes over the edges of a graph in order to obtain corresponding discrete schemes. Compared to the results of Rabani, Sinclair, and Wanka, FOCS' 98, which are only valid w. r. t. the class of homogeneous first <b>order</b> <b>schemes,</b> our framework can be used to analyze a larger class of diffusion algorithms, such as algorithms for heterogeneous networks and second <b>order</b> <b>schemes.</b> Secondly, we bound the deviation between randomized second <b>order</b> <b>schemes</b> and their continuous counterparts. Finally, we provide a bound for the minimum initial load in a network that is sufficient to prevent the occurrence of negative load at a node during the execution of second <b>order</b> diffusion <b>schemes.</b> Our theoretical results are complemented with extensive simulations on different graph classes. We show empirically that second <b>order</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are usually much faster than first <b>order</b> <b>schemes,</b> will not balance the load completely on a number of networks within reasonable time.

The second part deals with the extension to system of equations, in particular we will compare the performances of 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th <b>order</b> <b>schemes.</b> The first part is subdivided in four chapters: The aim of the second chapter is to present the multidimensional upwind residual distributive schemes and to explain what was the status of their development {{at the beginning of this}} work. The third chapter is dedicated to the first contribution: the design of 3 rd and 4 th <b>order</b> quasi non-oscillatory <b>schemes.</b> The fourth chapter is composed of two parts: we start by understanding the non-uniformity of the accuracy of the 2 nd <b>order</b> <b>schemes</b> for advection-diffusion problem. To solve this issue we use a Finite Element hybridisation. This deep study of the 2 nd <b>order</b> <b>scheme</b> is used as a basis to design a 3 rd <b>order</b> <b>scheme</b> for advection-diffusion. Finally, in the fifth chapter we extend the high <b>order</b> quasi non-oscillatory <b>schemes</b> to unsteady problems. In the second part, we extend the schemes of the first part to systems of equations as follows: The sixth chapter deals with the extension to steady systems of hyperbolic equations. In particular, we discuss how to solve some issues such as boundary conditions and the discretisation of curved geometries. Then, we look at the performance of 2 nd and 3 rd <b>order</b> <b>schemes</b> on viscous flow. Finally, we test the space-time schemes on several test cases.
