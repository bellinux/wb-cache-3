500|$|On May 23, 2016, it was {{reported}} that Miramax and Blumhouse Productions were developing a new Halloween film, which they would co-finance. John Carpenter is set to executive produce the project and act as creative consultant. Carpenter said, [...] "Thirty-eight years after the original Halloween, I'm going to help {{to try to make the}} 10th sequel the scariest of them all." [...] On February 9, 2017, Carpenter announced that the new Halloween film would be released on October 19, 2018 and was going to be written by David Gordon Green and Danny McBride, and directed by Green. It will be a direct sequel to the original film and will ignore all the sequels. In September 2017, Jamie Lee Curtis confirmed that she would reprise her role as Laurie Strode. In October, Judy Greer entered negotiations to play Laurie's daughter Karen Strode. The film will be distributed by Universal Pictures, their first involvement in the franchise since distributing 1982's Halloween III: Season of the Witch. On October 17, 2017, Carpenter announced that he would be returning to score the upcoming film, saying [...] "I’ll be consulting with the director to see what he feels. I could create a new score, we could update the old score and amplify it, <b>or</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> combine those two things. I’ll have to see the movie to see what it requires." ...|$|E

It scooped dirt and started {{sampling}} the Martian soil for ice after days of testing.

It was later shown to be ice.O at the Phoenix Landing Site. [...] Science: 325, 58-61.

2500|$|The songwriting {{for a new}} album, Start {{from the}} Dark, began early in 2003. [...] "It {{was just a matter}} of moving forward and writing songs for the new album," [...] Tempest said, [...] "That was always our intention. We thought that if we were gonna make a comeback, we wanted to do it properly, and that meant we wanted to write and record some new songs, a new album." [...] For the {{recording}} of Start from the Dark, the band decided to work with producer Kevin Elson, who had also produced The Final Countdown. [...] "We could either go with a younger producer, <b>or</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go with someone that we knew, someone experienced who is on the same wavelength as the band," [...] Tempest said, [...] "So in the end we decided that Kevin would be the perfect choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Here’s an example: Suppose we {{see before}} us {{a parking lot}} full of {{hundreds}} of cars. We decide {{to go around the}} entire lot looking for: “Cars with flat (bad) tires”. After an hour or so we have found two “cars with bad tires.” We can now say with certainty that “Some cars have bad tires”. <b>Or</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> say: “It’s not true that ‘All the cars have good tires’”. Or: “It is true that: ‘not all the cars have good tires”. Let us go to another lot. Here we discover that “All the cars have good tires.” We might say, “There’s not a single instance of a car having a bad tire.” [...] Thus we see that, if we can say something about each car separately then we can say something about ALL of them collectively.|$|E

It should have art-muslin curtains and a flag, and the flowers about it should be wild roses and forget-me- nots. I could work all the morning on the roof, with an awning over me to keep off the sun, while Ethelbertha trimmed the roses and made cakes for tea; and in the evenings we would sit out on the little deck, and Ethelbertha would play the guitar (she would begin learning it at once), <b>or</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> sit quiet {{and listen to the}} nightingales.|$|E

The person who owned one was a curiosity, too. But now it is the other way about: the person who DOESN'T own one is a curiosity. I saw a type-machine for the first time in--what year?
