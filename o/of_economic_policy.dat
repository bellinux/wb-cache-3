Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising essential characteristics that fascist nations shared. Payne, Paxton, Sternhell, et al. argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization. Feldman and Mason argue that fascism is distinguished by an absence of coherent economic ideology and an absence of serious economic thinking. They state that the decisions taken by fascist leaders cannot be explained within a logical economic framework.|$|E
25|$|Before World War II, the Nazis placed non-Nazi Party {{professionals}} in charge <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy.</b> Hitler appointed Hjalmar Schacht, {{a former member}} of the German Democratic Party, as Chairman of the Reichsbank in 1933, and minister of economics in 1934. At first, Schacht continued the economic policies introduced by the government of Kurt von Schleicher in 1932 to combat the effects of the Great Depression. These policies were mostly Keynesian, relying on large public works programs supported by deficit spending—such as the construction of the Autobahn—to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment (which stood at 30% in early 1933). There was a major reduction in unemployment over the following years, while price controls prevented the recurrence of inflation.|$|E
25|$|In 1903, Wieser {{was awarded}} a chair at his alma mater, the University of Vienna, as a full professor, where he taught a new {{generation}} of outstanding economists, including Ludwig von Mises, Joseph Alois Schumpeter, and his most faithful disciple, Friedrich August von Hayek. He developed a monetary theory inspired by the research of Carl Menger, and he applied himself during the following years to the problems of the quantity theory of money. In his last 25 years he dedicated himself to sociology, which he believed must go hand-in-hand with economics for the fullest understanding of human society. By combining these disciplines he was able to forge a new vision <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E

Strauß was also unable to defeat the coalition of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Unlike Kohl, Strauß {{did not want to}} continue {{as the leader of the}} CDU/CSU and remained Minister-President of Bavaria. Kohl remained as leader of the opposition, under the third Schmidt cabinet (1980–82). On 17 September 1982, a conflict <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> occurred between the governing SPD/FDP coalition partners. The FDP wanted to radically liberalise the labour market, while the SPD preferred greater job security. The FDP began talks with the CDU/CSU to form a new government.|$|E
25|$|Keynes was {{the first}} {{economist}} to popularize macroeconomics and also the notion that governments can and should intervene in the economy to alleviate the suffering caused by unemployment. Before the Keynesian Revolution that followed Keynes's 1936 publication of his General Theory, the prevailing orthodoxy was that the economy would naturally establish full employment. So successful was the revolution that the period spanning the aftermath of World War II to about 1973 {{has been referred to}} as the Age of Keynes. Stagnating economic performance in the early 1970s successfully shattered the previous consensus for Keynesian economics and provided support for a counter revolution. Milton Friedman's monetarism school was prominent in displacing Keynes' ideas both in academia and from the practical world <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> making.|$|E

But President García guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. No one has yet been able {{to explain why he}} decided to do so. It would not seem to have been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|When he was {{appointed}}, {{all other}} justices {{had been appointed}} by Democrats, Franklin D. Roosevelt or Truman, and all were committed New Deal liberals. But they disagreed about {{the role that the}} courts should play in achieving liberal goals. The Court was split between two warring factions. Felix Frankfurter and Robert H. Jackson led one faction, which insisted upon judicial self-restraint and insisted courts should defer to the policymaking prerogatives of the White House and Congress. Hugo Black and William O. Douglas led the opposing faction; they agreed the court should defer to Congress in matters <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy,</b> but felt the judicial agenda had been transformed from questions of property rights to those of individual liberties, and in this area, courts should play a more activist role. Warren's belief that the judiciary must seek to do justice placed him with the activists, although {{he did not have a}} solid majority until after Frankfurter's retirement in 1962.|$|E
25|$|In , Stiglitz, José Antonio Ocampo (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (Managing Director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC) and Deepak Nayyar (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) {{discuss the}} current debates on macroeconomics, capital market {{liberalization}} and development, {{and develop a}} new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the Washington Consensus has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith {{in the role of}} markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.|$|E
500|$|Membership {{of the new}} House of Commons was {{overwhelmingly}} made up of pro-coalition MPs, {{and there}} was therefore {{a large number of}} eligible members for the government posts to be filled. In Dutton's phrase, [...] "it would have been easy for Dunglass to have languished indefinitely in backbench obscurity". However, Skelton, appointed as Under-secretary at the Scottish Office, offered Dunglass the unpaid post of unofficial parliamentary aide. This was doubly advantageous to Dunglass. Any MP appointed as official Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to a government minister was privy to the inner workings of government but was expected to maintain a discreet silence in the House of Commons. Dunglass achieved the first without having to observe the second. He made his maiden speech in February 1932 on the subject <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy,</b> advocating a cautiously protectionist approach to cheap imports. He countered Labour's objection that this would raise the cost of living, arguing that a tariff [...] "stimulates employment and gives work [...] increases the purchasing power of the people by substituting wages for unemployment benefit".|$|E

500|$|Historians {{have taken}} {{different}} approaches to analyzing {{the effect of the}} Board on traditional Westminster parliamentary governance. C. B.

[...] Elliott and Miller take a similar approach to MacPherson's, suggesting that [...] "Aberhart and his cabinet... were in a position, strange in a cabinet system of government, of being ruled in the matter <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> by a board of private members that would be under the influence of Social Credit 'experts'." [...] Barr disagrees, arguing that the Board was [...] "still under the control of cabinet" [...] and pointing out that [...] "the cabinet was left with the power", through its privileged position in introducing legislation, [...] "to supplement or alter the provisions of the Alberta Social Credit Act" [...] under which terms the board was constituted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to analyze the effects <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> implemented in Turkey for the period after 2000. Therefore, firstly the theoretical and empirical literature has been done for <b>economic</b> <b>policies,</b> and then an econometric analysis was conducted to determine the effects <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> on macroeconomic indicators and the relationship between with each other. The study consists of three parts. In the first part, general information about <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> is presented and some definitions were made. In the second part, theoretical debates for <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> and macroeconomic models in open economy were examined. In the third section, the historical development <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policies</b> implemented in Turkey economy and empirical literature was reported and a general assessment has made with the findings obtained by using the VAR method. The results obtained from this study can be summarized as follows: monetary policy overrides about solving the inflation problem in Turkey economy in the period after 2000 but fiscal policy is more effective than monetary policy on the real economy. Additionally, a substituent feature between monetary and fiscal policy was appeared and it was observed that monetary policy located in a position following fiscal policy in terms of Turkey economy.
