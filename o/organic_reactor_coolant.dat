40|$|The {{purpose of}} the RHR System in MODE 6 is to remove decay heat and {{sensible}} heat from the <b>Reactor</b> <b>Coolant</b> System (RCS) to provide mixing of borated coolant and to prevent boron stratification (Ref. 1). Heat {{is removed from the}} RCS by circulating <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> through the RHR heat exchanger(s), where the heat is transferred to the Component Cooling Water System. The coolant is then returned to the RCS via the RCS cold leg(s). Operation of the RHR System for normal cooldown or decay heat removal is manually accomplished from the control room. The heat removal rate is adjusted by controlling the flow of <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> through the RHR heat exchanger(s) and the bypass. Mixing of the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> is maintained by this continuous circulation of <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> through the RHR System. If the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> temperature is not maintained below 200 0 F, boiling of the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> could result. This could lead to a loss of <b>coolant</b> in the <b>reactor</b> vessel. Additionally, boiling of the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> could lead to a reduction in boron concentration in the coolant due to boron plating out on components near the areas of the boiling activity. The loss of <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> and the reduction of boron concentration in the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> would eventually challenge the integrity of the fuel cladding, which is a fission product barrier. One train of the RHR System is required to be operational in MODE 6, with the water level> 23 ft above the top of the reactor vessel flange, to prevent this challenge. The LCO does permit removal of the RHR loop from operation for short durations, under the condition that the boron concentration is not diluted. This conditional removal from operation of the RHR loop does not result in a challenge to the fission product barrier...|$|R

50|$|In a {{pressurized}} water reactor plant, the pressurizer is basically a cylindrical pressure vessel with hemispherical ends, mounted with the long axis vertical and directly connected by a single run of piping to the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> system. It is located inside the reactor containment building. Although {{the water in the}} pressurizer is the same <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> as {{in the rest of the}} <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> system, it is basically stagnant, i.e. <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> does not flow through the pressurizer continuously as it does in the other parts of the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> system. Because of its innate incompressibility, water in a connected piping system adjusts equally to pressure changes anywhere in the connected system. The water in the system may not be at the same pressure at all points in the system due to differences in elevation but the pressure at all points responds equally to a pressure change in any one part of the system. From this phenomenon, it was recognized early on that the pressure in the entire <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> system, including the reactor itself, could be controlled by controlling pressure in a small interconnected area of the system and this led to the design of the pressurizer. The pressurizer is a small vessel compared to the other two major vessels of the <b>reactor</b> <b>coolant</b> system, the <b>reactor</b> vessel itself and the steam generator(s).|$|R

But early awareness of a reduction of coolant level (or a loss of coolant) is important to the safety of the reactor core.
