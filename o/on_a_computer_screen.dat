5|$|When Tomoyo After was ported to the PlayStation 2 (PS2), {{improvements}} to the game were included. This edition's scenario was expanded by the original staff after {{the removal of the}} adult content consisting of sex scenes. Yūto Tonokawa wrote some of the additional story for Takafumi and Kanako. With the added scenario and visuals combined, the PS2 edition is 1.5 times longer than the Windows edition. In the original version, the entire cast excluding Tomoya Okazaki, had full voice acting; this was not changed for the PlayStation 2 version. Added support was included so as to make the visuals on the television sharper than in the past with visual novels played on a consumer console rather than <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> The PS2 version also reduced flickering of the picture, reducing eyestrain.|$|E
25|$|The {{story is}} {{primarily}} {{presented to the}} player via the voiceover of the game's narrator, who explains that the protagonist Stanley works in an office building, tasked to monitor data coming <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> and press buttons appropriately without question. One day that screen goes blank. Stanley, unsure what to do, starts to explore the building and finds it devoid of people.|$|E
25|$|Two PDF {{files that}} look similar <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> {{may be of}} very {{different}} sizes. For example, a high resolution raster image takes more space than a low resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may {{increase the size of}} a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.|$|E

25|$|Donoghue's group {{reported}} training rhesus monkeys {{to use a}} BCI to track visual targets <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> (closed-loop BCI) with or without assistance of a joystick. Schwartz's group created a BCI for three-dimensional tracking in virtual reality and also reproduced BCI control in a robotic arm. The same group also created headlines when they demonstrated that a monkey could feed itself pieces of fruit and marshmallows using a robotic arm controlled by the animal's own brain signals.|$|E
25|$|Online magic tricks were {{designed}} to function <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> The computer essentially replaces the magician. Some online magic tricks recreate traditional card tricks and require user participation, while others, like Plato's Cursed Triangle, are based on mathematical, geometrical and/or optical illusions. One such online magic trick, called Esmeralda's Crystal Ball, became a viral phenomenon that fooled so many computer users into believing that their computer had supernatural powers, that Snopes dedicated a page to debunking the trick.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{models and}} {{computer}} models have partially complementary strengths and weaknesses. Physical models {{can be used}} by those without access to a computer and now can be made cheaply out of plastic materials. Their tactile and visual aspects cannot be easily reproduced by computers (although haptic devices have occasionally been built). <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen,</b> the flexibility of molecules is also difficult to appreciate; illustrating the pseudorotation of cyclohexane {{is a good example of}} the value of mechanical models.|$|E

25|$|A {{controlled}} size comparison task can {{be employed}} to evaluate objectively whether a person is experiencing hemimicropsia. For each trial, a pair of horizontally aligned circles is presented <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen,</b> and the person being tested is asked to decide which circle is larger. After a set of trials, the overall pattern of responses should display a normal distance effect where the more similar the two circles, the higher the number of errors. This test is able to effectively diagnose micropsia and confirm which hemisphere is being distorted.|$|E
25|$|Optical {{or light}} {{microscopy}} involves passing visible light transmitted through or reflected {{from the sample}} through a single lens or multiple lenses to allow a magnified view of the sample. The resulting image can be detected directly by the eye, imaged on a photographic plate, or captured digitally. The single lens with its attachments, or the system of lenses and imaging equipment, along with the appropriate lighting equipment, sample stage, and support, makes up the basic light microscope. The most recent development is the digital microscope, which uses a CCD camera {{to focus on the}} exhibit of interest. The image is shown <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen,</b> so eye-pieces are unnecessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the questions in a random sequence <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E

25|$|The first beam was {{circulated}} {{through the}} collider {{on the morning}} of 10 September 2008. CERN successfully fired the protons around the tunnel in stages, three kilometres at a time. The particles were fired in a clockwise direction into the accelerator and successfully steered around it at 10:28 local time. The LHC successfully completed its major test: after a series of trial runs, two white dots flashed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> showing the protons travelled the full length of the collider. It took less than one hour to guide the stream of particles around its inaugural circuit. CERN next successfully sent a beam of protons in an anticlockwise direction, taking slightly longer at one and a half hours due to a problem with the cryogenics, with the full circuit being completed at 14:59.|$|E
25|$|In film-screen radiography, an X-ray tube {{generates a}} beam of X-rays, which is aimed at the patient. The X-rays that pass through the patient are {{filtered}} through a device called an grid or X-ray filter, to reduce scatter, and strike an undeveloped film, which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a light-tight cassette. The film is then developed chemically and an image appears on the film. Film-screen radiography is being replaced by phosphor plate radiography but more recently by digital radiography (DR) and the EOS imaging. In the two latest systems, the X-rays strike sensors that converts the signals generated into digital information, which is transmitted and converted into an image displayed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> In digital radiography the sensors shape a plate, but in the EOS system, which is a slot-scanning system, a linear sensor vertically scans the patient.|$|E
25|$|Later {{experiments}} by Nicolelis using rhesus monkeys {{succeeded in}} closing the feedback loop and reproduced monkey reaching and grasping movements in a robot arm. With their deeply cleft and furrowed brains, rhesus monkeys {{are considered to}} be better models for human neurophysiology than owl monkeys. The monkeys were trained to reach and grasp objects <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen</b> by manipulating a joystick while corresponding movements by a robot arm were hidden. The monkeys were later shown the robot directly and learned to control it by viewing its movements. The BCI used velocity predictions to control reaching movements and simultaneously predicted handgripping force. In 2011 O'Doherty and colleagues showed a BCI with sensory feedback with rhesus monkeys. The monkey was brain controlling the position of an avatar arm while receiving sensory feedback through direct intracortical stimulation (ICMS) in the arm representation area of the sensory cortex.|$|E

25|$|Both {{indirect}} reciprocity {{and costly}} signaling {{depend on the}} value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions. One is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later, is publicly announced, is discussed, or is simply being observed by someone else. This have been documented in many studies. The effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> Weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects. Public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic. People who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns.|$|E

[...] It was particularly popular with online viewers, an NBC researcher said, because as an episode-driven sitcom without special effects it was easy to watch on smaller monitors such as those found on laptops and iPods. Between the online viewings and those who use digital video recorders, 25–50% of the show's viewers watch it after its scheduled airtime.|$|E
40|$|In our {{research}} we examined 10 - 14 years old students' music reading skills with eye tracking analysis in different music schools in Luxembourg, Germany and Hungary. Our aims were to explore certain music reading strategies, find possibilities of teaching them, reveal {{the characteristics of}} expert sight-reading strategy users and also to find gender differences. During the examination students got six different musical examples (3 for rythm reading, 3 for singing from Zoltán Kodály) that appeared <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer's</b> <b>screen,</b> and after one minute silent reading they performed them. The {{results suggest that the}} knowledge of musical patterns strongly influences not only the duration and accuration of a musical performance, but the fixation counts, and also several gender differences were revealed. Our further aim is examining the relationship between the development of reading and music reading skills...|$|R

500|$|In 1987, {{astronomer}} David Jewitt, then at MIT, {{became increasingly}} puzzled by [...] "the apparent emptiness {{of the outer}} Solar System". He encouraged then-graduate student Jane Luu to aid him in his endeavour to locate another object beyond Pluto's orbit, because, as he told her, [...] "If we don't, nobody will." [...] Using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, Jewitt and Luu conducted their search {{in much the same}} way as Clyde Tombaugh and Charles Kowal had, with a blink comparator. Initially, examination of each pair of plates took about eight hours, but the process was sped up with the arrival of electronic charge-coupled devices or CCDs, which, though their field of view was narrower, were not only more efficient at collecting light (they retained 90% of the light that hit them, rather than the 10% achieved by photographs) but allowed the blinking process to be done virtually, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>computer</b> <b>screen.</b> Today, CCDs form the basis for most astronomical detectors. In 1988, Jewitt moved to the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Luu later joined him to work at the University of Hawaii's 2.24m telescope at Mauna Kea. Eventually, the field of view for CCDs had increased to 1024 by 1024 pixels, which allowed searches to be conducted far more rapidly. Finally, after five years of searching, Jewitt and Luu announced on August 30, 1992 the [...] "Discovery of the candidate Kuiper belt object" [...] Six months later, they discovered a second object in the region, (181708) 1993 FW.|$|E
