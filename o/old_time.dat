5|$|Many American {{cities and}} towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Along with musical centers such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Austin, and Los Angeles, many smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the bluegrass and <b>old</b> <b>time</b> music of the Southeastern states are {{a few examples of}} diversity in American music. Modern day music is heavily influenced by previous and present African-American music genres.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Knight visited the Bertram Mills Circus at Olympia in West London. Mills' circus {{was a highly}} {{polished}} show with internationally renowned performers. Knight painted some of these performers, such as the clown Whimsical Wilson, several times. Charivari or The Grand Parade, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1929, depicts practically the entire circus cast of performers and animals. Throughout 1929 and 1930 Knight went {{on a tour of}} British towns with the combined Bertram Mills and Great Carmo's Circus. Painting within a working circus forced Knight to paint at great speed, as the performers rarely had much time to pose. Knight responded by painting directly onto the canvas without any preliminary drawing. Whilst this led to some of her circus scenes appearing 'flat', her paintings of small groups of clowns, such as The Three Clowns (1930) and <b>Old</b> <b>Time</b> Clowns (1957), were much more successful. Knight's Circus Folk exhibition, at the Alpine Club in 1930, was heavily criticised in art journals, but her paintings of more mundane subjects, such as domestic interiors and London streets, were highly praised. Notable works from this period include Susie and the Wash-basin (1927), Blue and Gold (1927), A Cottage Bedroom (1929) and Spring in St. John's Wood (1933). In 1934 Knight developed a series of circus designs for the Modern Art for the Table tableware range produced by Clarice Cliff.|$|E
