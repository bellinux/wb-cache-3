5|$|The edmontosaurs {{also showed}} enriched carbon isotope values, which for modern mammals would be {{interpreted}} as a mixed diet of C3 plants (most plants) and C4 plants (grasses); however, C4 plants were extremely rare in the Late Cretaceous if present at all. Thomas and Carlson put forward several factors that may have been <b>operating,</b> <b>and</b> found the most likely to include a diet heavy in gymnosperms, consuming salt-stressed plants from coastal areas adjacent to the Western Interior Seaway, and a physiological difference between dinosaurs and mammals that caused dinosaurs to form tissue with different carbon ratios than would be expected for mammals. A combination of factors is also possible.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, NSB {{announced}} {{that they wanted to}} discontinue their operations in Narvik, hoping they could leave operation of passenger trains on the Ofot Line to Ofotbanen. In May, NSB signed an agreement with Ofotbanen, where the latter would take over NSB's responsibilities to operate trains from Narvik to Riksgränsen along the Ofot Line. The initial contract would last until 2006, and NSB paid NOK 13 million for the service. From 15 June, Ofotbanen took over all passenger transport on the line, including employing all former NSB employees in Narvik. On the same day, Connex Tåg took over the operations on the Swedish side of the border after winning a public service obligation contract with the Swedish government, and dismissing SJ of the right to offer the service. An <b>operating</b> <b>and</b> security license was granted from the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate to Ofotbanen on 11 June.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three Allis Chalmers built Francis turbine-{{generator}}s, all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were <b>operating,</b> <b>and</b> the dam's power plant became the largest hydroelectricity facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time. Original plans called for 16large generators, eight {{on each side of the}} river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable. The present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{did nothing}} to prevent the killing of Jews and other civilians in the areas where his units were <b>operating,</b> <b>and</b> in which his Eleventh Army {{actively}} participated. That Manstein {{was well aware of}} the Einsatzgruppen massacres is demonstrated by a 1941 letter he sent to Otto Ohlendorf, in which Manstein demands Ohlendorf hand over the wristwatches of murdered Jews. Manstein felt his men deserved the watches, since they were doing so much to help Ohlendorf's men with their work. Smelser and Davies note that this letter was the only time that Manstein ever complained about the activities of the Einsatzgruppen. Manstein later stated that he felt the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust was exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|Plug-in {{cars have}} several {{benefits}} compared to conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. They have lower <b>operating</b> <b>and</b> maintenance costs, and produce little or no local air pollution. They reduce dependence on petroleum and may reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the onboard source of power, depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation to charge the batteries. Plug-in hybrids capture most of these benefits when they are operating in all-electric mode. Despite their potential benefits, market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles has been slower than expected as adoption faces several hurdles and limitations. The global market share of the light-duty plug-in vehicle segment achieved 0.86% of total new car sales in 2016, up from 0.62% in 2015 and 0.38% in 2014. However, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just 0.15% of the 1.4 billion motor vehicles on the world's roads {{by the end of}} 2016.|$|E
