5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>shoulder.</b> Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven raffia mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>shoulder.</b> She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E

In Yemen standard dress is a calf-length, wraparound skirt, the futah. The Palestinians of the Eastern Mediterranean traditionally wear the qumbaz, an ankle-length unisex garment, which opens all the way down the front with the right side brought over the left, under the arm, and then fastened.|$|E

The Welshman obviously knew enough about Campese to realise it was useless to try and tackle him front-on. Instead, he did what I suggested earlier that any defender should do against Campese – he ran with him. It was then that Campese began to zigzag, forcing Ackerman to zigzag, too, looking <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>shoulder</b> after another to see which way Campese was heading. I was following about 20 metres behind and could not believe what was happening. I {{have no doubt that}} Campese turned it on to make a personal point with Ackerman. When the defence eventually closed in on him, Campese flicked a pass over his shoulder to Michael Hawker, who scored the try.|$|E
500|$|Kenyatta {{assembled}} the seminar papers on Kikuyu society {{that he had}} written for Malinowski's class, publishing these as Facing Mount Kenya in 1938.

The book was published under the name [...] "Jomo Kenyatta", {{the first time that}} he had done so; the term Jomo was close to a Kikuyu word describing the removal of a sword from its scabbard. Facing Mount Kenya was a commercial failure, selling only 517 copies, but was generally well received; an exception was among white Kenyans, whose assumptions about the Kikuyu it challenged.|$|E

Small canoes can be portaged by carrying them inverted <b>over</b> <b>one's</b> <b>shoulders</b> and the center strut may be designed {{in the style of}} a yoke to facilitate this. Historically, voyageurs often employed tump lines on their heads to carry loads on their backs.|$|R
5000|$|Regardless of a {{definitive}} etymology, the phrase [...] "cold shoulder" [...] {{has been used}} in many literary works, and has entered into the vernacular.

Overall, it remains widely popular as a phrase for describing the act of ignoring someone or something, or giving an unfriendly response.|$|R

50|$|There {{is a set}} {{etiquette}} {{to wearing}} the grand boubou, primarily in place to keep the over-gown above the ankles at any one time, in keeping with Islamic traditions of avoiding impurity (see Najis). This can include folding the open sleeves of the boubou <b>over</b> <b>one's</b> <b>shoulders,</b> normally done while walking or before sitting down, to ensure the over-gown does not rub against the ground, or by folding/wrapping each side over the other with the hand, narrowing the gown's space toward the ankles (as done by the Tuareg). Thus, it is rare to see the grand boubou's square shaped gown completely unwrapped.|$|R

2500|$|Attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, {{perhaps the}} most heavily {{symbolic}} portrait of the queen is the Rainbow Portrait at Hatfield House. It was painted around 1600–1602, when the queen was in her sixties. [...] In this painting an ageless Elizabeth appears dressed as if for a masque, in a linen bodice embroidered with spring flowers and a mantle draped <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>shoulder,</b> her hair loose beneath a fantastical headdress. [...] She wears symbols out of the popular emblem books: the cloak with eyes and ears, the serpent of wisdom, the celestial armillary sphere, and carries a rainbow with the motto non sine sol iris ("no rainbow without the sun"). [...] Strong suggests that the complex [...] "programme" [...] for this image may {{be the work of}} the poet John Davies, whose Hymns to Astraea honouring the queen use much of the same imagery, and suggests it was commissioned by Robert Cecil as part of the decor for Elizabeth's visit in 1602, when a [...] "shrine to Astraea" [...] featured in the entertainments of what would prove to be the [...] "last great festival of the reign".|$|E
2500|$|The statue has {{the compact}} and robust {{structure}} which {{is typical of}} this period in Attica {{and goes back to}} the [...] (Pergamon Museum SK 1800, first quarter of the sixth century). Ionian characteristics are clear, notably the costume, composed of a chiton with long sleeves and a himation pinned diagonally <b>over</b> <b>one</b> <b>shoulder.</b> In sculpture and Attic black figure pottery, contemporary women wear the sleeveless Doric peplos over a light chiton and the himation, when it is present at all, is pinned at both shoulders. The sole archaic Attic representation with wears the chiton without the peplos over it is the Berlin Goddess, but she wears the himation in the traditional symmetric manner. In Ionia on the other hand, the diagonal himation is very well attested from the second quarter of the 6th century BC, e.g. on the statues dedicated by Cheramyes; not only is the origin of this garment Ionian, but also the treatment of the drapery, which is found in the representations of the columnae caelatae of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (generally dated to 560 BC). Another stylistic element of the Kore of Lyons is the curve of the himation above the buttocks which is not subsequently imitated by Attic sculptors, but is fairly frequent in contemporary vase painting and marble sculpture of the Greek East.|$|E

Therefore, the ball must be very durable and easy to hold on to. The basketball is also used to perform tricks (sometimes called freestyling), the most common of which are spinning the ball on the tip of one's index finger, dribbling in complex patterns, rolling the ball <b>over</b> <b>one's</b> <b>shoulder,</b> or performing aerobatic maneuvers with the ball while executing a slam dunk, most notably {{in the context of a}} slam dunk contest.|$|R
