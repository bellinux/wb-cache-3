The smoothly paved loops of roadway lend themselves to bicycling, rollerblading, etc. Most of the trees were spared during the rebuilding so that many sites have full or partial shade. There are two, large, newly built shower house/restroom structures. There is a short, level forest path to the swimming beach.|$|R

50|$|The park {{consists}} of two separate units along the shore of Bear Lake. The north unit, along {{the north shore of}} the lake, is for day use only.

The park office is located in nearby Montpelier, approximately 20 mi north.|$|R
40|$|A {{fuel cell}} {{technology}} program {{which was established}} to advance the state-of-the-art of hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells using the P and WA PC 8 B technology as the base is reported. The major tasks of this program consisted of (1) fuel cell system studies of a space shuttle powerplant conceptual design (designated engineering model - 1, EM- 1) supported by liaison with the space shuttle prime contractors; (2) component and subsystem technology advancement and; (3) a demonstrator powerplant test. Fuel cell system studies, with the EM- 1 as {{the focal point of}} design activities, included determination of voltage regulation, specific reactant consumption, weight, voltage level and performance characteristics. These studies provided the basis for coordination activities with the space shuttle vehicle prime contractor. Interface information, on-board checkout and in-flight monitoring requirements, and development cost data were also provided as part of this activity. Even though the two vehicles primes had different voltage requirements (115 volts in one case and 28 volts in the other), it was concluded that either option could be provided in the fuel cell power system by the <b>electrical</b> <b>hook-up</b> of the cells in the stack...|$|R
50|$|An all-systems {{test version}} of Apollo/Saturn V first stage, S-IC-T, {{went into the}} B-2 test stand at the Mississippi Test Facility on December 17, 1966. Stage <b>electrical</b> and {{mechanical}} <b>hook-up</b> to the test stand began immediately. Static firing would occur in early 1967 to demonstrate the facility checkout system.|$|R

40|$|AbstractElectrodermal {{screening}} (EDS) {{is based}} on three commonly held assumptions: acupuncture points (APs) have lower electrical resistance than non-APs; resistance at APs varies with health and disease; and effective acupuncture treatments are associated with normalization of resistance at APs. Although evidence confirming these assumptions is limited, EDS is frequently practiced worldwide. Researchers are also beginning to assess EDS' utility as an outcome measure in acupuncture trials. Fundamental in developing EDS as a research tool {{is the need for}} an accurate and reliable measurement. We developed an automated multichannel prototype system, the <b>Octopus,</b> and recorded <b>electrical</b> resistance and capacitance at eight skin sites in 33 healthy participants over 2 hours. The Octopus accurately measured against known resistors (within 2. 5 % of the mean value) and capacitors (within 10 % of the mean value), and yielded repeatable readings at all eight skin sites: LR 1 (r= 0. 79), SP 1 (r= 0. 79), toe non-AP (r= 0. 77), LU 9 (r= 0. 97), PC 6 (r= 0. 96), wrist non-APs (r= 0. 97), SP 6 (r= 0. 96), and leg non-APs (r= 0. 97). Resistance at APs was significantly lower than the nearby non-APs in one out of three comparisons...|$|R
