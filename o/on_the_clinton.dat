M-97 crosses Interstate 696 (I-696) at an interchange located on the Warren–Roseville line. This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile Road System. M-97 crosses through {{the southeast corner of}} Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township. There is a major intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, which is a limited access county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile Road System. Between this intersection and Harrington Street, Groesbeck Highway curves around to the north, crossing the Clinton River and the railroad then entering Mt. Clemens. M-97 continues to curve around the west side of downtown Mt. Clemens before re-entering Clinton Township.

500|$|At {{the start}} of then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton's presidential primary campaign, Emanuel was {{appointed}} to direct the campaign's finance committee. Emanuel insisted that Clinton schedule time for fundraising and delay campaigning in New Hampshire. Clinton embarked on an aggressive national fundraising campaign that allowed the campaign to keep buying television time as attacks on Clinton's character threatened to swamp the campaign during the New Hampshire primary. Clinton's primary rival, Paul Tsongas (the New Hampshire Democratic primary winner), later withdrew, citing a lack of campaign funds. Richard Mintz, a Washington public relations consultant who worked with Emanuel on the campaign, spoke about the soundness of the idea: [...] "It was that [...] million dollars that really allowed the campaign to withstand the storm we had to ride out in New Hampshire [...]" [...] Emanuel's knowledge of the top donors in the country, and his rapport with [...] "heavily Jewish" [...] donors helped Clinton amass a then-unheard-of sum of $72 million. While working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaign Emanuel was a paid retainer of the investment bank Goldman Sachs.|$|E
500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general {{of the intelligence community}} said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so {{at the time of their}} inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had said over a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.|$|E

He called Milošević a fascist and a [...] "national-socialist", and condemned his war crimes in the Yugoslav Wars. But he also considered the Croatian nationalist president Franjo Tudjman [...] "equally disgusting" [...] for colluding with Milošević on a partition of Bosnia and empowering Croatian war criminals. In God Is Not Great, he wrote about Christian Orthodox Serbian and Roman Catholic Croatian nationalism- and religion-inspired crimes against the Muslim Bosnians, {{at the hands of}} proponents of [...] "Greater Serbia" [...] and Croatian [...] "revived Ustashe formations" [...] during this period which are [...] "often forgotten". He was highly critical of Western inaction in protection of the Muslims, partially blaming this <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration and specifically Hillary Clinton.|$|E
2500|$|After Obama's upset win in Iowa, it {{appeared}} to many political observers that he would ride a wave of momentum through the New Hampshire primaries and then onward to win the Democratic nomination. Eulogies were published <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> campaign, as Obama surged to a roughly 10-point lead in the New Hampshire polls. However, the race turned quickly {{in the days before}} the primary, and the polls were slow to register a reversal toward Clinton. At the Saint Anselm College New Hampshire debate on [...] January 5, 2008, Edwards sided with Obama against Clinton. In one noted exchange, Edwards said that Clinton could not bring about change, while he and Obama could: [...] "Any time you speak out powerfully for change, the forces for status quo attack." [...] Clinton passionately retorted, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. It's about working hard. I'm not just running on a promise for change. I'm running on 35 years of change. What we need is somebody who can deliver change. We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] It came to be seen as the defining statement for her candidacy. The morning before the primary, Clinton became [...] "visibly emotional" [...] in response to a friendly question from a voter. Video of the moment was replayed on cable news television throughout the day, accompanied by pundit commentary that ranged from sympathetic to callous in tone. Voters rallied to Clinton's defense, and she won a surprising three-percent victory over Obama in the popular vote. They tied in the delegate count. Richardson withdrew from the race on January 10.|$|E

2500|$|By 2002, she {{was working}} for New York University (NYU). While at NYU, she {{played a central role}} in the {{university}} administration's efforts around union contracts with adjunct faculty and graduate students. The Washington Post reported in October 2015 that, during Mills' first four months at the State Department, she continued to work at NYU on a part-time basis, negotiating with officials in Abu Dhabi to build a campus in the United Arab Emirates city. She worked for no pay in those first months at the State Department, and was officially designated as a [...] "temporary expert-consultant", which allowed her to continue receiving outside income while serving as Clinton's Chief of Staff. On her financial disclosure forms, she reported $198,000 in income from NYU in 2009, during the period her university work overlapped with her time at the State Department, and that she collected an additional $330,000 in vacation and severance payments when she left the university’s payroll in May 2009. Additionally, Mills remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Foundation’s unpaid board for a short time after joining the State Department. Another Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, spent her final six months employed as Clinton’s deputy chief of staff in 2012, while also simultaneously employed by the Clinton Foundation. As has Abedin's, Mills’ employment arrangement has raised questions regarding potential conflicts of interest, in Mills' case about how one of the State Department’s top employees set boundaries between her public role and a private job that involved work on a project funded by a foreign government. Under Federal ethics laws, employees are prohibited from participating in matters that would have any direct and predictable effect on themselves or an outside employer. Mills told the Washington Post that she did not “recall any issues” at the State Department that would have required her recusing herself, and said she would have consulted with the ethics office if such an issue had come up. Nick Merrill, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, declined to comment.|$|E
