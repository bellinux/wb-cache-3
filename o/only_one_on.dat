5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.|$|E

5|$|As {{is typical}} for ceratosaurs, the abelisaurid hand had four basic digits. However, {{it is there}} that any {{similarity}} ends. No wrist bones existed, with the four palm bones (metacarpals) attaching directly to the forearm. There were no finger bones on the first or fourth digits, <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the second digit and two on the third digit. These two external fingers were extremely short and immobile. Manual claws were very small in Eoabelisaurus, and totally absent in carnotaurines.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan-based athlete Alfonso Martinez was {{the sole}} {{representative}} of Belize in taekwondo, and in any sport other than a track and field event, at the Beijing Olympics. Martinez {{took part in the}} men's under 58kilogram category, otherwise known as flyweight. At the Olympics Martinez was placed in the first round's seventh match, which took place on 20 August. His opponent was Juan Antonio Ramos, a taekwondo martial artist from Spain. In the course of the match Ramos scored two points on Martinez, while Martinez scored <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> Ramos. Thus Ramos defeated Martinez and advanced to the next round, while Martinez did not. Ramos ultimately placed fifth in the final round.|$|E
5|$|The {{next few}} months were spent on {{political}} maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. Jaruzelski barely won {{the vote in the}} National Assembly presidential election of 19 July 1989, even though his name was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong. Jaruzelski resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July.|$|E

5|$|The plank {{road was}} {{operational}} for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1, 1889 washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood, which killed over 2200 people. The Cogan House Covered Bridge was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> Larrys Creek {{to survive the}} flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream. The 90foot (27m) long Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today one of just three left in the county.|$|E
5|$|Morgaon is the adhya pitha – {{foremost}} {{centre of}} {{worship of the}} Ganapatya sect, which considers Ganesha as the Supreme Being. It attracts {{the greatest number of}} pilgrims in the Ashtavinayak circuit. Both the primary scriptures of the Ganapatya sect praise Morgaon. While Mudgala Purana dedicates 22 chapters to Morgaon's greatness, Ganesha Purana states that Morgaon (Mayurapuri) is among the three most important places for Ganesha and the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> earth (Bhuloka). The other locations are Kailash in heaven (actually Kailash is a mountain on earth in the Himalayas, believed to have the abode of Ganesha's parents Shiva and Parvati) and Adi-Shesha's palace in Patala (underworld). According to a tradition, the temple is without beginning and without an end. Another tradition maintains {{that at the time of}} pralaya (the dissolution of the world), Ganesha will enter yoganidra here. Its holiness is compared with Kashi, the sacred Hindu city.|$|E
5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed Richmond's tree preservation bylaw. He was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and the most ardent supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than the tax base, Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors to hire more police officers. He became the subject of a lawsuit, along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a rezoning allowing a controversial pub.|$|E

25|$|The {{fireball}} {{rose above}} the houses and moved toward the nearby Glasgow–Carlisle A74 dual carriageway, scorching cars in the southbound lanes and leading motorists and local residents {{to believe that there}} had been a meltdown at the nearby Chapelcross nuclear power station. Father Patrick Keegans, Lockerbie's Roman Catholic priest, was preparing to visit his neighbours Dora and Maurice Henry at approximately 7 pm that evening, after the aircraft wing destroyed their home; there was nothing left of their bodies to bury. Keegans' house at 1 Sherwood Crescent was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the street that was neither destroyed by the impact nor gutted by fire.|$|E

The World's Fair station was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the line.|$|E
25|$|As an MP Hughes {{worked on}} trade union legislation, {{but was not}} in a {{position}} to have major changes passed. He had greater success in improving the legal position of co-operatives, which in particular became able to operate as a limited company. The issue of legal obstacles to the operation of labour unions was topical, and in 1867 Hughes was made a member of a Royal Commission set up to consider the matter. Initially he was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the committee sympathetic to the union point of view; after some lobbying he was joined by Frederic Harrison, and a concession was made to union representatives, allowing them observer places in the proceedings. Hughes then worked with Harrison and Robert Applegarth to diminish the effect of some of the testimony from employers.|$|E
25|$|The Paul H. Jensen Arctic Museum was {{a museum}} {{focused on the}} culture and {{environment}} of the Arctic in Monmouth in the U.S. state of Oregon. Located {{on the campus of}} Western Oregon University (WOU), the museum opened in 1985 with 3,000 artifacts collected by its late founder and namesake. The museum housed 5,000 artifacts and had exhibits on the wildlife of the Arctic along with displays that demonstrate the culture of the Inuit and Eskimo peoples of Alaska. The museum was one of only two museums focused on life in the Arctic located in the lower 48 states, and the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the West Coast. In 2013, WOU announced that the Jensen Museum would close its doors and the collections would move to the Museum of Natural and Cultural History (MNCH) at the University of Oregon in Eugene, which also has substantial Arctic collections.|$|E

25|$|In {{the next}} year, Richelieu's {{position}} was seriously threatened by his former patron, Marie de Médicis. Marie {{believed that the}} Cardinal had robbed her of her political influence; thus, she demanded that her son dismiss the chief minister. Louis XIII was not, at first, averse to such a course of action, as he personally disliked Richelieu. Despite this, the persuasive statesman was able to secure the king as an ally against his own mother. On 11 November 1630, Marie de Médicis and the King's brother, Gaston, duc d'Orléans, secured the King's agreement for the dismissal. Richelieu, however, {{was aware of the}} plan, and quickly convinced the King to repent. This day, known as the Day of the Dupes, was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> which Louis XIII took a step toward dismissing his minister. Thereafter, the King was unwavering in his political support for him.|$|E
25|$|In April, Radwańska {{began her}} clay {{season at the}} Porsche Tennis Grand Prix as the 7th seed. She lost in {{straight}} sets to Ekaterina Makarova in the first round. She later withdrew from her forthcoming tournaments in Madrid and Rome, citing a foot injury. At the French Open Radwańska was seeded at No.9. In her first match after being sidelined for five weeks due to a right foot injury she eased past Fiona Ferro in straight sets in just over an hour. In the second round she defeated Belgium’s Alison Van Uytvanck to face Alizé Cornet in the third round. Radwańska had won seven of their eight previous matches, including the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> clay - at the French Open nine years ago - but this time lost to Cornet in two sets. Radwanska withdrew from the Ricoh Open and Aegon Classic Birmingham due to a viral illness. She came into the 2017 Aegon International as the No. 9 seed but fell to Lauren Davis. Radwańska then started her Wimbledon Championships campaign where she defeated Jelena Janković, Christina McHale and Timea Bacsinszky before falling to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round.|$|E
25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as he was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> his team to know anything about it, he had {{to spend a lot of}} time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E
