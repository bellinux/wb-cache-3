50|$|The Holden Racing Team's Garth Tander {{took his}} second win {{of the season}} in the 60/60 Sprint race at Phillip Island, ahead of Fabian Coulthard and Alex Davison, who scored his first podium of the season. The race {{included}} on a controversial incident between Craig Lowndes and Mark Winterbottom, who came together while battling for the lead on the last lap {{of the first half of}} the race, resulting in the pair dropping to fifteenth and fifth places respectively. <b>Other</b> <b>incidents</b> <b>during</b> the first half allowed Jamie Whincup, who had qualified poorly, to move up to sixth place. Whincup would go on to finish fourth in the race to retake the championship lead while Winterbottom finished fifth and Lowndes recovered to eighth. The race was marred by a major accident involving Alexandre Prémat and James Courtney. Prémat had a tyre failure going into turn three before sliding across the damp grass and hitting the driver's door of Courtney's car, causing significant damage to both cars while Courtney also suffered slight tissue damage on his right leg. Triple Eight Race Engineering dominated Sunday's races, with Lowndes winning the first race ahead of teammate Whincup and Shane Van Gisbergen. Whincup went on to win the final race ahead of Winterbottom and Lowndes. This left Whincup with a 20-point lead over Lowndes in the championship heading into the final round, with Winterbottom 124 points off the lead.|$|R

2500|$|Following Obama's election, many {{pondered the}} {{existence}} of a [...] "postracial America." [...] However, lingering racial tensions quickly became apparent, and many African-Americans expressed outrage over what they saw as [...] "racial venom" [...] directed at Obama's presidency. In July 2009, prominent African-American Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr., was arrested at his Cambridge, Massachusetts home by a local police officer, sparking a controversy after Obama stated that the police acted [...] "stupidly" [...] in handling the incident. To reduce tensions, Obama invited Gates and the police officer to the White House in {{what became known as the}} [...] "Beer Summit". Several <b>other</b> <b>incidents</b> <b>during</b> Obama's presidency sparked outrage in the African-American community and/or the law enforcement community, and Obama sought to build trust between law enforcement officials and civil rights activists. The acquittal of George Zimmerman following the shooting of Trayvon Martin sparked national outrage, leading to Obama giving a speech in which he noted that [...] "Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago." [...] The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri sparked a wave of protests. These and other events led to the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement, which campaigns against violence and systemic racism toward black people. Some in the law enforcement community criticized Obama's condemnation of racial bias after incidents in which police action led to the death of African-American men, while some racial justice activists criticized Obama's expressions of empathy for the police. Though Obama entered office reluctant to talk about race, by 2014 he began openly discussing the disadvantages faced by many members of minority groups. In a March 2016 Gallup poll, nearly one third of Americans said they worried [...] "a great deal" [...] about race relations, a higher figure than in any previous Gallup poll since 2001.|$|R

There was some societal mistrust and discrimination against members of some non-recognized religious groups, particularly those referred to as [...] "sects." [...] During 2006 there were 32 cases of discrimination based on religion brought before the Equal Rights Commissioner.

We studied all elective surgical operations performed in adults under general or regional anaesthesia between 2000 and 2004, in 24 hospitals collecting computerised clinical data on all anaesthetics since 1996. The focus was on cardiovascular <b>incidents,</b> though <b>other</b> anaesthesia-related <b>incidents</b> were also evaluated. Among 124, 939 interventions, 27, 881 (22 %) were performed in hypertensive patients. At least one cardiovascular incident occurred in 7549 interventions (6 % (95 % CI 5. 9 - 6. 2 %)). The average adjusted odds ratio of cardiovascular risk for chronic hypertension was 1. 38 (95 % CI 1. 27 - 1. 49). However, across hospitals, adjusted odd ratios varied from 0. 41 up to 2. 25. Hypertension did not increase the risk of <b>other</b> <b>incidents.</b> Hypertensive patients are still at risk of intra-operative cardiovascular incidents, while risk heterogeneity across hospitals, despite taking account of casemix and hospital characteristics, suggests variations in anaesthetic practices...|$|R

Hypertension did not increase the risk of <b>other</b> <b>incidents.</b> Conclusions: Hypertensive patients are still at risk of intra-operative cardiovascular incidents. The heterogeneity of the risk to develop cardiovascular incidents varied across hospitals, despite taking into account casemix and hospital characteristics.

5000|$|Several <b>other</b> <b>incidents</b> also {{happened}} <b>during</b> the race. Kyle Busch got tangled with Kasey Kahne, who was sent hard into the wall. Kahne, {{who was out}} for the day, maneuvered his wrecked {{car in front of}} Busch under caution. Kahne was later fined $25,000 and docked 25 points and was placed on probation {{for the remainder of the}} season. Later on, Michael Waltrip and Robby Gordon got together, ending Gordon's day. On the following caution lap, Gordon tried to ram Waltrip's car with his wrecked car and on the lap after that, Gordon threw his helmet at Waltrip's passing car. In the subsequent live interview on TNT, Gordon called Waltrip a [...] "piece of s**t", and TNT quickly ended the interview. Gordon was later fined $35,000, docked 50 points and like Kahne, was placed on probation for the remainder of the season for the two incidents. Waltrip was fined $10,000 and docked 25 points for apparently using an obscene gesture, but Waltrip and DEI contested the fine with NASCAR and it was overturned. Following that incident, NASCAR waved the red flag to stop the field and clean the track, but also warned all teams and crew chiefs to restrain themselves from further retributive incidents.|$|R

40|$|Sick sinus {{syndrome}} (SSS) is {{a common}} indication for pacemaker implantation. Limited information exists on the association of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) with mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. We studied 19, 893 men and women age 45 and older in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), two community-based cohorts, who were without a pacemaker or atrial fibrillation (AF) at baseline. Incident SSS cases were validated by review of medical charts. Incident CVD and mortality were ascertained using standardized protocols. Multivariable Cox models were used to estimate the association of incident SSS with selected outcomes. During a mean follow-up of 17 years, 213 incident SSS events were identified and validated (incidence, 0. 6 events per 1, 000 person-years). After adjustment for confounders, SSS incidence was associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1. 39, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 14 - 1. 70), coronary heart disease (HR 1. 72, 95 %CI 1. 11 - 2. 66), heart failure (HR 2. 87, 95 %CI 2. 17 - 3. 80), stroke (HR 1. 56, 95 %CI 0. 99 - 2. 46), AF (HR 5. 75, 95 %CI 4. 43 - 7. 46), and pacemaker implantation (HR 53. 7, 95 %CI 42. 9 - 67. 2). After additional adjustment for <b>other</b> <b>incident</b> CVD <b>during</b> follow-up, SSS was no longer associated with increased mortality, coronary heart disease, or stroke, but remained associated with higher risk of heart failure (HR 2. 00, 95 %CI 1. 51 - 2. 66), AF (HR 4. 25, 95 %CI 3. 28 - 5. 51), and pacemaker implantation (HR 25. 2, 95 %CI 19. 8 - 32. 1). Individuals who develop SSS {{are at increased risk}} of death and CVD. The mechanisms underlying these associations warrant further investigation...|$|R
