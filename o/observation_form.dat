The data from the questionnaires are transcribed or key-punched on to magnetic tape, or disks or input directly into the computer. Verification ensures that {{the data from the}} original questionnaires have been accurately transcribed, while data analysis, guided by the plan of data analysis, gives meaning to the data that have been collected. Univariate techniques are used for analyzing data when there is a single measurement of each element or unit in the sample, or, if there are several measurements of each element, each RCH variable is analyzed in isolation. On the other hand, multivariate techniques are used for analyzing data when there are two or more measurements on each element and the variables are analyzed simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} a {{replication}} of an investigation on the effective teaching of singing in the elementary general music classroom, using the technique of classroom observation. The purpose was to confirm or refute {{the results of the}} original study that investigated the relationship of some observational varia-bles to the teaching of singing. The results of the study partially confirmed the results of the original study: (1) the observational form used for the in-vestigation contained a sufficient number of reliably observed variables that discriminated between performance qualities; and (2) in both studies rhythmic reading activities were found {{to be the most important}} discrimi-nators of differentially effective teaching procedures. Key Words: elementary education, musical ability, performance ability, teach-ing method, vocal instruction. In 1975 a project was undertaken to investigate variables that might contribute to the effective teaching of singing in the elementary general music classroom. The investigation used classroom observation, a technique that allowed the researcher (1) to observe, classify, and quantify classroom activities and events that occurred during the teaching of singing in a selected number of music lessons, and (2) to investigate the effectiveness, or superiority of one teaching procedure over another. The results and conclusions of that study were reported in this journal (Froehlich, 1977, pp. 115 - 130). It was the purpose of this study to replicate the first study in order to confirm or refute its results. Researchers who use the technique of classroom observation for a specific research purpose need to make use of a measurement tool (<b>observation</b> <b>form)</b> to observe and quantify ongoing activities in a classroom.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) (Coursework) [...] University of Melbourne, 2005 This {{research}} evolved out of {{the need}} to design and validate an instrument for the assessment of competencies within the specialised area of the Operating Suite. The study represents an attempt to develop an instrument underpinning the unit of competency NR 4 - The Instrument Nurse from the Australian College of Operating Room Nurses standards (2004). Both holistic and analytical rubrics were developed that were aligned to the ACORN Standard and underpinned by the Dreyfus (1981) model in accordance with the rules established by Griffin and colleagues (2001). Three video clips that captured the varying performances of instrument nurses in the operating suite were recorded and used as prompts for rating. Forty raters were required to judge the performance of the candidates in each video clip using an Analytical <b>Observation</b> <b>Form,</b> Holistic Performance Level Rubrics and Holistic Competence Rubrics. The study found that the holistic rubrics led to more consistent judgements than the analytical rubrics, yet the latter provided more diagnostic information for intervention purposes. Despite less consistency, the results revealed that the Analytical <b>Observation</b> <b>Form</b> had sufficient construct validity as determined by the Item Separation Index (Rasch, 1960). The study also revealed that the Analytical <b>Observation</b> <b>Form</b> had high internal consistency and greater inter-rater reliability when average ratings were used.
