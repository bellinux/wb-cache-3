They {{were born and}} bred in this era and some hold important positions in high places.

5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt as if his own life was fake and all he wanted was to be acknowledged for his <b>own</b> <b>existence.</b> He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E

Therefore, leadership should have a legitimate acknowledgment and support from his followers.

25|$|Many other Python {{sketches}} and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life ("Always Look on the Bright Side of Life") and other meaning-of-life related questioning.

50|$|Besides the evident surreal humour {{in these}} pieces, Reekie's work {{displays}} a sympathetic 'self mockery' and casts a sidelong, rather amused {{look back at}} itself.

25|$|Both {{the dream}} {{argument}} and the simulation hypothesis {{can be regarded}} as skeptical hypotheses; however in raising these doubts, just as Descartes noted that his own thinking led him to be convinced of his <b>own</b> <b>existence,</b> the existence of the argument itself is testament to the possibility of its own truth. Another state of mind in which some argue an individual's perceptions have no physical basis in the real world is called psychosis though psychosis may have a physical basis in the real world and explanations vary.|$|E
25|$|Moraldo Rubini (Franco Interlenghi), Sandra's {{brother and}} the {{youngest}} of the five vitelloni, uncomfortably observes Fausto's womanizing as he ponders his <b>own</b> <b>existence,</b> dreaming of ways to escape to the big city. Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini), the baritone, nourishes unrealistic ambitions to sing and act. Alberto (Alberto Sordi), the daydreamer, is supported by his mother and self-reliant sister, Olga (Claude Farell). Vulnerable and effeminate, he's unhappy that Olga is secretly dating a married man. Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste), the aspiring dramatist, writes a play that he discusses with Sergio Natali (Achille Majeroni), an eccentric stage actor he hopes will perform in it.|$|E
25|$|Following Husserl, Sartre views absurdity as {{a quality}} of all {{existing}} objects (and of the material world collectively), independent of any stance humans might take with respect to them. Our consciousness of an object does not inhere in the object itself. Thus in the early portions of the novel, Roquentin, who takes no attitude towards objects and has no stake in them, is totally estranged from the world he experiences. The objects themselves, in their brute existence, have only participation in a meaningless flow of events: they are superfluous. This alienation from objects casts doubt for him, in turn, on his own validity and even his <b>own</b> <b>existence.</b>|$|E

He likewise warns Fry against visiting his grandfather, Enos, who is stationed at the base, as he might kill Enos and erase his <b>own</b> <b>existence.</b> Rather than persuading him to avoid his grandfather, the professor's warning causes Fry to become obsessed with protecting Enos from possible harm and encouraging his copulation with his fiance Mildred. Fry finally resorts to locking Enos in an abandoned house to prevent his coming to harm. The house is located {{in the middle of a}} nuclear weapon testing range, and Enos is shortly killed by one of the tests.|$|E
25|$|The Terminator is a 1984 {{science fiction}} film {{released}} by Orion Pictures, co-written {{and directed by}} James Cameron and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn. It is the first work in the Terminator franchise. In the film, machines {{take over the world}} in the near future, directed by the artificial intelligence Skynet. With its sole mission to completely annihilate humanity, it develops android assassins called Terminators that outwardly appear human. A man named John Connor starts the Tech-Com resistance to fight the machines, defeat Skynet and free humanity. With a human victory imminent, the machines' only choice is to send a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, Sarah Connor, and prevent the boy's birth, thereby handicapping the resistance from ever being founded in the first place.

It was released on October 26, 1984 to critical acclaim and grossed $78.4 million worldwide.|$|E
25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a personal being, a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my <b>own</b> <b>existence,</b> since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

25|$|The Star Sapphires {{are first}} {{mentioned}} {{in the context of}} a group during a conversation between Carol Ferris and Hal Jordan immediately after Ferris has just recovered from having been possessed by the Star Sapphire stone during Mystery of the Star Sapphire. Ferris explains that while under the possession of the stone, she learned a number of things about its history and capabilities. She says that it told her that billions of years ago, when the Guardians of the Universe decided to form the Green Lantern Corps, a tribe of women left Oa because they did not agree with the Guardians' belief in living a life without emotion. They said they would continue on their <b>own</b> <b>existence</b> living with emotions, starting with love. They searched the universe for billions of years for the thing the Guardians feared, and eventually found it on a planet called Zamaron. They learned of love from the first Star Sapphire gem, which was discovered locked between the embrace of two crystallized skeletons inside a cave. She explains to him that despite the fact that he had been able to defeat the various incarnations of the Star Sapphire he'd encountered up until then, other Green Lanterns had not been as fortunate. She describes another Star Sapphire falling in love with a Green Lantern and encasing his world in violet crystal so that the two could be together forever. She also mentions that the Star Sapphire gem is like the green power rings used by Green Lanterns and the yellow power rings used by Sinestro Corps members.|$|E
500|$|According to the Museum of Modern Art, {{the dark}} ambiance of The Kiss is {{representative}} of Munch's ambivalence regarding romance. In the 1897 painting, art historian Reinhold Heller finds it [...] "virtually impossible" [...] to separate the two figures, particularly where their faces meet and become one. He considers the depiction of the lovers to represent their unity {{while at the same}} time representing a threatening [...] "loss of individuality, a loss of one's <b>own</b> <b>existence</b> and identity" [...] which hints at death.|$|E
500|$|Among other Harrison biographers' {{interpretations of}} the lyrics, Ian Inglis writes of Harrison's unwelcome [...] "evangelical" [...] message {{regarding}} [...] "the consequences of a life of selfishness and greed which finds no place for 'the Lord'". In contrast, Leng views the verses as [...] "the singer's inner conversation", in which Harrison acknowledges the futility of his <b>own</b> <b>existence,</b> {{at a time when}} he felt overwhelmed by his success as a solo artist following the Beatles' break-up in 1970. Of the apparent sermonising in the choruses, Leng concludes: [...] "'The Lord Loves the One' conveys the same basic message as 'what you put in is what you get out,' so, at one level, it's more a matter of common sense than divine revelation." ...|$|E
50|$|In his <b>own</b> {{literary}} <b>existence</b> he also constantly strove for independence.

500|$|Curtis P. Iaukea {{was celebrated}} as a Hawaiian {{who survived the}} monarchy and lived to tell about it. He was also {{regarded}} as representing all that was apparently good about becoming American, even though {{until the end of}} his life the photos of my great-great-grandfather show him proudly wearing the uniforms and medals that accompanied his trips to faraway places as a diplomat for the Hawaiian Kingdom. He was never pictured wearing his uniforms, after the fact, for the Republic of Hawai‘i as its official diplomat. Even so, the territorial government regularly drew on his memories to close the gap between the Hawaiian Kingdom and the territory and in order to legitimize its <b>own</b> <b>existence</b> in the process. It needed to insert its inevitability into the historical narrative, and used my great-great-grandfather’s public memories to represent its [...] "evidence of inheritance." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrnes {{found that}} Departures used {{the symbol of}} the cherry blossom, a flower which blooms after the winter only to wither soon afterwards, to {{represent}} the transience of life; through this understanding, he wrote, Japanese people attempt to define their <b>own</b> <b>existence.</b> Natural symbols are further presented through the changing seasons, which [...] "suggest delicate emotional changes" [...] in the characters, as well as the letter-stones, which represent [...] "love, communication, [...] the baton being passed from generation to generation". The film's settings are used to convey various sensations, including the solitude of the countryside and the intimacy of the public bath house. The colour white, manifested through snow, chrysanthemums, and other objects, is prominent in the film; Okuyama suggests that this, together with the classical music and ritualized hand gestures, represents the sacredness and purity of the death ceremonies.|$|E
500|$|In {{the receipt}} of an {{impression}}, the soul is purely passive and the impression reveals not only its <b>own</b> <b>existence,</b> but that also of its cause—just as light displays itself and the elements that are in it. The power to name the object resides in the understanding. First must come the impression, and the understanding—having the power of utterance—expresses in speech the affection it receives from the object. True presentations are distinguished from those that are false {{by the use of}} memory, classification and comparison. If the sense organ and the mind are healthy—and provided that an external object can be really seen or heard—the presentation, due to its clearness and distinctness, has the power to [...] the [...] that always lies in our power, to give or to withhold.

"As to animals, {{we fully}} {{admit that they}} may possess all the first four groups of actions--that they may have, so to speak, mental images of {{sensible}} objects combined in all degrees of complexity, as governed {{by the laws of}} association. We deny to them, on the other hand, the possession of the last two kinds of mental action. We deny them, that is, the power of reflecting on their <b>own</b> <b>existences,</b> or of inquiring into the nature of objects and their causes. We deny that they know that they know or know themselves in knowing. In other words, we deny them reason. The possession of the presentative faculty, as above explained, in no way implies that of the reflective faculty; nor does any amount of direct operation imply the power of asking the reflective question before mentioned, as to 'what' and 'why.'"
