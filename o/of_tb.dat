30|$|In {{the present}} study, MD {{simulations}} are performed {{to address the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>TBs</b> on the compression of nanospheres. The elastic response of twinned nanospheres under compression is determined mainly by the local elastic properties under indenter and still can be captured by the classical Hertzian contact model. Compared to the twin-free sample, the existence <b>of</b> <b>TBs</b> in nanospheres greatly increases the strain hardening in plastic deformation, depending on the twin spacing and loading direction. As the tilt angle between compression plane and TBs increases from 0 ° to 75 °, the strengthening <b>of</b> <b>TBs</b> declines, while increases again as the tilt angle approaches to 90 °. Correspondingly, the plastic deformation mechanism switches from intersecting with TBs, slipping parallel to TBs, and then to being restrained by TBs, as the tilt angle increases. Moreover, the enhancement <b>of</b> <b>TBs</b> increases evidently as the twin spacing decreases, obtaining its maximum at a critical twin spacing, and then declines.|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases <b>of</b> <b>TB</b> infections.

Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E

40|$|Inspired by {{experimental}} {{observations of}} the enhancement of superconductivity at the twin-boundary (TB) in slightly electron doped Ba(Ca) (FeAs) _ 2 where a strong 2 × 1 antiferromagnetic (AF) collinear order is in presence, we investigate theoretically the effects <b>of</b> <b>TBs</b> on the complex interplay between magnetism and superconductivity using a minimum phenomenological two-orbital model. The magnetic order can be simulated from an onsite Coulomb interaction U and the Hund's coupling J_H, while the effective pairing interaction yields the superconductivity with s± wave symmetry. The spatial distributions of the magnetic, superconducting and charge density orders near two different types <b>of</b> <b>TBs</b> are calculated. Each <b>of</b> the <b>TBs</b> has two different orientations. We find that the first type TBs, which corresponds to a 90 ^∘ lattice rotation in the a-b plane, enable magnetic domain walls (DWs) to be pinned at them, and that superconductivity is enhanced at such TBs or DWs. This result is consistent with experiments for a TB with an orientation of 45 ^∘ from the x-axis. Contrastingly, we predict that superconductivity is suppressed at the second type <b>of</b> <b>TBs</b> which correspond to an asymmetrical placement of As atoms on the opposite sides <b>of</b> the <b>TB.</b> Furthermore, the lattice-mismatch effect across the TBs is investigated. The comparison of our results with the observations from the nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) experiments are also discussed. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1211. 285...|$|R

5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain <b>of</b> <b>TB.</b> A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E

5|$|Treatment <b>of</b> <b>TB</b> uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
