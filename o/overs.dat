5|$|After bowling 54 <b>overs</b> at Headingley, Johnson was rested as Australia {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an {{innings in}} a match {{that started the}} day after the Fourth Test. He bowled the most <b>overs</b> upon his return in the following match against Glamorgan, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings. Johnson sent down 28.4 <b>overs</b> and took 3/58 as the hosts were bowled out for 197; Australia reached 3/215 when the weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|The matches {{were played}} {{according}} to the standard rules of a One Day International (ODI). Each side batted for a maximum of 50 <b>overs,</b> and fielding restrictions applied for the bowling side. For the first 15 <b>overs</b> only two fielders were allowed outside the infield, {{and for the rest}} of the innings four fielders (including a bowler and the wicket-keeper) had to be deployed in the infield. No player was allowed to bowl more than 10 <b>overs</b> in an innings.|$|E
5|$|After the MCC {{had reached}} 2/91, Toshack {{broke through the}} middle order. He had Compton caught behind by Don Tallon for 26, before {{trapping}} the incoming batsman Martin Donnelly—a New Zealand Test player—leg before wicket for five, and then having Hutton caught by vice-captain Lindsay Hassett for 52 a run later, leaving the hosts at 5/104. After the hosts recovered to 6/148, Toshack removed Test all rounder Ken Cranston, Test wicket-keeper Billy Griffith and spinner Jack Young to leave the MCC at 9/166. The MCC were eventually dismissed for 189, conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs. Toshack had taken 6/51 from 27 <b>overs,</b> and Bradman only allowed him four <b>overs</b> of rest. The Australian captain opted to enforce the follow on and allowed Toshack a lighter load in the second innings, bowling 15 <b>overs</b> and taking 1/43. He removed Edrich as the MCC fell for 205 in 60.2 <b>overs</b> to lose by an innings and 158 runs. Toshack had sent down the most <b>overs</b> by any Australian bowler in both innings. Bradman regarded Toshack's first innings performance as his best of the tour. Toshack again focused on the leg stump, which some English observers decried as being negative. However, former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack's line {{was close enough to}} leg stump that most balls had to be played.|$|E

5|$|After the break, Hassett {{reached his}} century after 305 minutes of batting, his first in Tests in England. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. The {{dismissal}} ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall, who {{was caught by}} Evans down the leg side four runs later, having scored 42 with seven fours. Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner, before Bedser trapped Toshack to end the innings at 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 <b>overs,</b> the longest innings in terms of <b>overs</b> and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed {{the majority of the}} bowling load on his spinners; Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) delivered 60 and 55 <b>overs</b> respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 <b>overs,</b> taking 3/113. The part-time seam bowlers, Edrich, Barnett and Yardley, bowled 18, 17 and 17 <b>overs</b> respectively. Australia had scored slowly but they had no need to take risks when there was so much time remaining. Yardley's leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience.|$|E
5|$|Australia then {{proceeded}} to victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour. Loxton was not required to bowl in the first innings as the hosts fell for 83 in 36.5 <b>overs.</b> In the second innings, Loxton was given the new ball and bowled 12 <b>overs</b> without success, conceding 28 runs before Essex were all out for 187.|$|E
5|$|Australia's lower order batted the {{tourists}} into {{control on the}} second morning. Tallon batted on, supported by Johnston and Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston—who scored 29. Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston fell. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 <b>overs,</b> while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 <b>overs.</b>|$|E

5|$|England {{came out}} for their second innings, and with Bradman {{predominantly}} reliant on his seamers, Johnson bowled only seven <b>overs</b> on the third afternoon as the hosts closed at 3/174 from 69 <b>overs.</b> Late in the day, Johnson dropped Washbrook in the slips cordon from the bowling of Toshack when the batsman was on 80.

In the first innings, he bowled 28 <b>overs</b> and took 4/100 to help India restrict their arch-rivals to 407 and take a 268-run lead. After stand-in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on, Pathan tied the Pakistanis down, bowling 12 maidens in his 21 <b>overs</b> to end with 2/26 as India secured an innings win. Pathan then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order, helping India to recover to 287.
