50|$|Eyetalian {{magazine}} {{was launched in}} 1993 as a challenging, independent magazine of Italian-Canadian culture. It encountered commercial difficulty, and leaned towards a general lifestyle magazine format before concluding publication later in the 1990s. Italo of Montreal is published sporadically and is written in Italian, with some articles in French and English, dealing with current affairs and community news. La Comunità, while an <b>older</b> <b>publication,</b> {{was taken over by}} the youth wing of the National Congress of Italian Canadians (Québec chapter) in the late 1990s. It experimented with different formats but was later cancelled due to lack of funding. In the 1970s the trilingual arts magazine Vice Versa flourished in Montreal. In, 2003 Domenic Cusmano founded Accenti, the magazine with an Italian accent which focused on culture and Italian-Canadian authors.|$|E
50|$|Music {{magazines}} {{were very}} prolific in the United Kingdom, with the NME (short for New Musical Express) leading sales since its first issue in 1952. NME had a longstanding rival in Melody Maker, an even <b>older</b> <b>publication</b> that had existed since 1926; however, by 2001, falling circulation {{and the rise}} of internet music sites caused the Melody Maker to be absorbed into its old rival and cease publishing. Several other British magazines such as Select and Sounds also folded between 1990 and 2000. Current UK music magazines include Q, Kerrang! and Mojo (all published by EMAP). Magazines with a focus on pop music rather than rock and aimed at a younger market include the now-defunct Smash Hits and the BBC's Top of the Pops, which outlived the television show on which it was based.|$|E
5000|$|Under elected leadership, SCAN {{began to}} {{distance}} itself from LUSU {{for the sake}} of political and operational independence. Its slogan changed from “The Lancaster University Students’ Union Newspaper” to simply “The Voice of Lancaster University Students”. It also moved to its own campus headquarters in Slaidburn House in 1997, to which it would return in 2014.:260SCAN underwent perhaps its greatest changes, however, in the late 2000s and early 2010s. In 2008, editor Dan Hogan relaunched the paper as Student Comment and News, maintaining the original acronym while strengthening its brand culture. A year later SCAN switched publisher from Central Lancashire Printers to Trinity Mirror, going colour from cover to cover on 100% recycled paper. In 2010 the paper joined the Lancaster University ‘joint student media initiative’ sharing its membership, facilities, and coverage more closely with LA1:TV and Bailrigg FM, and editor Lizzie Houghton introduced arts & lifestyle section Carolynne as “SCAN’s stylish, more lighthearted sister”. The section is named after an <b>older</b> <b>publication</b> at Lancaster, founded in 1964 and rated second only to the magazines in Oxford, which publication was in turn named by Bowlander William Smethurst after his girlfriend, Carolynne Harmsworth. Most recently, in 2013, Rachel May Quin became SCAN’s first non-sabbatical editor. The position is now open to, and elected by, members of the joint student media initiative only, further improving the newspaper’s independence but resulting in a 97.3% drop in editorial election turnout from 2010 to 2015.For much of its history SCAN was not Lancaster University’s only student newspaper. It overlapped with historical titles like Carolynne and John O’Gauntlet, which provided far more comical, scandalous, and pointed coverage of student life at Lancaster but disappeared in 1971 and 1972 respectively.:87-107 In 1993 a short-lived parody of the paper, Self-Centred Arrogant Nonsense, was circulated around campus, and in 2012 a more elaborate imitation, SCAM: Student Comment and Moos, was “stealth-distributed” on the printers in the university library and online at scam.lusers.co.uk. More serious rivals in 2012 included The Whistleblower, which claimed to be “Lancaster University’s Only Independent Student Newspaper”, and Fritz, a high-tech magazine run by members of the Management School. Both ran on a platform of true political independence from LUSU, but neither could sustain the funds for more than four editions. SCAN now competes for readers with internet tabloid The Tab Lancaster and the Lancaster Despatch Box, a blog run with the Department of Politics, Philosophy, and Religion, both of which enjoy more national media connections than SCAN.. There were also college based newspapers, of which probably the most significant was Pendle Witch, which in the mid 1970s emerged from the new Pendle College and was the base for a serious challenge to the Students Union by an anti-establishment group. Ironically, its leader was Bob Lawrence who was then elected as editor of SCAN.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Google Scholar {{was used}} to locate free full-text {{versions}} of computer science research papers to determine what proportion could be freely accessed. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 1967 conference papers and periodical articles from 2003 - 2010, indexed in the ACM Guide to Computing Literature, was searched for manually in Google Scholar, using the paper or article title and the first author’s surname and supplementary searches as needed. Findings - Free full-text versions were found for 52 % of the conference papers and 55 % of the periodical articles. Documents with <b>older</b> <b>publication</b> dates {{were more likely to}} be freely accessible than newer documents, with free full-text versions found for 71 % of items published in 2003 and 43 % of items published 2010. Many documents did not indicate what version of the document was presented. Research limitations/implications - Results were limited to the retrieval of known computer science publications via Google Scholar. The results may be different for other computer science publications, subject areas, types of searches, or search engines. Practical implications - Users of Google Scholar for finding free full-text computer science research papers may be hindered by the lower access to recent publications. Because many papers are freely available, libraries and scholarly publishers may be better served by promoting services they provide beyond simple access to papers. Originality/value – Previous research showed lower levels of free access than we found for computer science, but the decline found in this study runs contrary to increases found in previous research...|$|E
40|$|The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife {{surveyed}} professional {{land use}} planners {{to identify the}} value they place on the Priority Habitat and Species (PHS) Management Recommendations. Results of a similar survey from 2003 (given to a similar group of users) were compared with current result. Overall use of PHS by this group increased dramatically between the survey periods. Problems with PHS identified in the earlier survey {{seemed to have been}} worked out. Specifically, respondents in 2003 pointed out that PHS did not provide adequate recommendations for conserving habitat in urban and suburban landscapes. Far fewer respondents expressed that same concern in the current survey. One reason for this change may be the recent release of a PHS publication that specifically addresses the management of wildlife in developing landscapes. In addition to these more general questions, we asked a series of questions focused on two PHS publications. One was the recently released Landscape Planning for Washington's Wildlife: Managing for Biodiversity in Developing Areas. Some respondents said they have used this new publication. Most who have used it said they found it to have value for answering land use planning-related questions. The other publication we assessed through the survey was WDFW’s Management Recommendations for Washington’s Priority Habitats: Riparian. This <b>older</b> <b>publication</b> (published in 1997) is one that WDFW is looking into possibly updating. To assess if an update is warranted, we wanted to know who was using it.

40|$|Objective – To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and efficiency of}} the copyright permission seeking process and to suggest improvements {{in order to improve}} outcomes. Design – Workflow study. Setting – Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Sample – A random sample of titles published 1999 - 2001 was selected from the library’s circulating collection. After eliminating duplicates, technical reports, theses, dissertations, and missing items, the sample comprised 337 titles. Of these titles, 70 % were books, and 56 % were from commercial publishers. From this a working sample of 273 titles was derived, comprising those titles protected by copyright and with the rights owner clearly indicated. About 73 % of this working sample appeared to be out-of-print; their median publication year was 1981. Method – In this two year study (1999 - 2001), a random sample of books was selected, and pertinent bibliographic and copyright holder information researched and recorded. Permission letters were sent and, six weeks later, follow-up letters were sent to nonrespondents. The letter allowed respondents four options: 1. Grant full permission to digitize the work and provide unrestricted Web access; 2. Grant permission to digitize the work and provide read-only Web access, limited to Carnegie Mellon University users; 3. Declare that they do not hold the rights, and hopefully provide information to identify and locate the actual rights holder; 4. Deny permission for digitization. Results were then recorded and analyzed. Main results – Of the 273 letters mailed, a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ reply was obtained for just over half (52 %) of the documents. Sixteen percent of the rights holders could not be found (the letter was returned, or a referral proved impossible to locate and contact). Another 25 % of the copyright holders simply did not reply, and 7 % were otherwise problematic. Of the 143 ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses, 54 % denied permission, while 46 % granted permission. (Note: these percentage figures appear to be erroneously reversed in Table 1 of George’s article.) Therefore, of the overall working sample of 273 titles, permission to digitize was obtained for only 24 % of the titles. A substantial portion of the permissions (41 of 66, or 62 %) carried some restriction. This represents 15 % of the total working sample. Only a few restriction requests were deemed too great {{to make use of the}} permission. Commercial publishers who made up 58 % of the working sample granted permission at the lowest rate (13 %). Response time averaged three months from the time the initial letter was sent until a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response was received. Negative responses averaged a bit longer than positive responses (101 days to 124 days). However, some of this time was attributable to delays in issuing follow-up or redirected request letters (a step required in 60 % of cases), owing to the limited staff resources at Carnegie Mellon. The copyright ownership had changed in 23 % of the sample, requiring more than one and up to three different addresses to be contacted before a response was received or the effort was terminated. Conclusions – The study concluded that the permission rate would remain low unless additional efforts were made in the permission-seeking process (e. g., personal contacts in addition to letters and emails), or unless more selective approaches were employed (e. g., targeting non-commercial publishers). It also concluded that the process to seek copyright permissions was neither quick nor easy, suggesting the need for dedicated staff time and a readily accessible database of publisher contact information. As a result, subsequent projects have improved their permission seeking process, focusing on more noncommercial publishers or <b>older</b> <b>publication</b> dates, and asking publishers for blanket consent for all of their out-of-print titles...|$|E
