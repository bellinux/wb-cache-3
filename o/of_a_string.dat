5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 {{was the culmination of}} a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that are held together by the strong nuclear force. The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>string.</b> In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings.

5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>string</b> gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

5|$|In Canada, the {{traditional}} ceremony for granting assent in parliament was regularly used until the 21st century, long {{after it had}} been discontinued in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth realms. One result, conceived as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>string</b> of acts intended to demonstrate Canada's status as an independent realm, was that King George VI personally assented to nine bills of the Canadian parliament during his 1939 tour of Canada—85 years after his great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had last granted royal assent personally in the United Kingdom. Under the Royal Assent Act 2002, however, the alternative practice of granting assent in writing, with each house being notified separately (the Speaker of the Senate or a representative reads to the senators the letters from the governor general regarding the written declaration of Royal Assent), was brought into force. As the act also provides, royal assent is to be signified—by the governor general, or, more often, by a deputy, usually a Justice of the Supreme Court, at least twice each calendar year: for the first appropriation measure and {{for at least one}} other act, usually the first non-appropriation measure passed. However, the act provides that a grant of royal assent is not rendered invalid by a failure to employ {{the traditional}} ceremony where required.|$|E

Around this time Maulay began work on Mulgrave Castle, in Yorkshire, which was part of his wife's inheritance. In June and July 1224, Maulay was present at on the royal side at the siege of Bedford Castle, which was held by de Breauté against the government. In 1225 Maulay claimed that he had sworn to King John that he would not give up custody of the royal castles until after John's son came of age. Maulay lost Upavon to the king again in 1229, with the king regranting Upavon to Gilbert Basset. This grant to Basset was by charter, with the lands to be held in fee.

5|$|The Mail coach service began {{towards the}} end of the 18th century, adding to the {{existing}} use of fast coaches. The horses required for fast coaches were mainly produced by outcrossing heavy farm mares to the lighter racing type of horse, as a combination of speed, agility, endurance and strength was required. While the aristocracy and gentry paid high prices for matched teams of quality horses, farmers sold the best of their animals at a good profit, keeping lower-quality animals for themselves, or for sale as saddle horses. The coaching trade grew from the trade in carriage of goods; some public transport was provided by farmers, who could keep large numbers of horses on their own farms more cheaply than those who had to buy in food and forage. However, proprietors of coaching inns accounted for most of the trade. In many cases a proprietor would work his horse teams only in his local district, but some owned many coaching establishments, and could provide transport over much greater distances. An advantage to proprietors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>string</b> of coaching inns was that passengers on their coaches also used and paid for the services offered by their inns, often including overnight accommodation.
