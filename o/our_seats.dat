25|$|The 1998 {{redevelopment}} caused controversy {{when the}} club informed 4,000 season-ticket-holding fans that their seat prices would be increased to corporate rates, with {{the option of}} paying these or being moved to seats in the proposed expanded sections. Half of these fans were 'bondholders', who had paid £500 in 1994 which they asserted guaranteed them an option on their specific seat for 10 years. Some fans resisted, and after two high-court cases and a Save <b>Our</b> <b>Seats</b> campaign, the club was allowed to move the fans, under an exceptional circumstances clause. As a gesture of goodwill, the club did not pursue the fans for legal costs awarded over their insured limit.|$|E
500|$|... "Essence" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", noting that {{while much of}} the episode was a [...] "blur", it was nonetheless exciting. Handlen was complimentary towards the installment's [...] "tremendous sense of purpose [...] builds to a fever pitch that makes questions of who exactly wants what largely irrelevant." [...] While he offered a pessimistic opinion in regards to the series' mythology as a whole, Handlen concluded that the eighth season's sense of purpose, as exemplified in [...] "Essence", made the episode successful. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of Contra Costa Times praised the episode, writing [...] "where have nifty episodes like [...] been the last two years?" [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Praising the storyline, he noted that [...] "Thanks to 'Essence', I've become a believer again." [...] John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "overall, this was a wonderful episode that served to prepare us for the final installment of the alien mythology (presumably) and managed to keep us in <b>our</b> <b>seats</b> the entire way." [...] Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both [...] "Essence" [...] and [...] "Existence". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote [...] "the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a B+.|$|E

In 2008, following further allegations (supported by documentary evidence) made by another anonymous student regarding the biased nature and reading list of a course on terrorism convened by politics lecturer Dr Marie Breen Smyth, as well as allegations by the same student regarding bias against Israel by Breen Smyth and her colleague Dr Richard Jackson, Phillips wrote to the Vice Chancellor of the University saying that Breen Smyth was a [...] "subversive" [...] who {{should not be allowed}} to teach.

60|$|The next {{passenger}} who got up {{and placed}} himself by my side was a florid, excitable, confused-looking gentleman, excessively talkative and familiar.

60|$|We waited, spell-bound--we {{could not}} speak. The void {{that he left}} behind him was dreary and dreadful. I was the first who moved. In silence, I led Lucilla back to <b>our</b> <b>seat</b> on the sofa, and beckoned to Oscar {{to go to her}} in my place.|$|R
