5|$|Free-fed feral {{cats and}} house cats tend to consume many small meals {{in a single}} day, {{although}} the frequency and size <b>of</b> <b>meals</b> varies between individuals. Cats use two hunting strategies, either stalking prey actively, or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured. Although it is not certain, the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area, with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows, but tending to actively stalk birds.|$|E
40|$|The classic {{analyses}} of the inhibitory effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) on meal size, conducted by Professor Gerard P. Smith {{and his colleagues at}} the Bourne Laboratory, inspired my initial interest in this field. My current research, which investigates the role of estradiol in the control <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> size, continues to be guided by Gerry’s thoughtful, scientific approach to the study of ingestive behavior. In 1996, the year I arrived as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Bourne Laboratory, Gerry published a new theory of the controls <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> size. In this important paper, Gerry proposed that the controls <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> size can be either direct or indirect. He argued that direct controls <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> size interact with peripheral, preabsorptive receptors that are sensitive to the chemical, mechanical, and colligative properties of ingested food and that indirect controls <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> size function to modulate the activity of direct controls. The purpose of this review is to illustrate how Gerry’s theory has guided much of what is known about the mechanism by which estradiol inhibits food intake in female rats. I will provide evidence, primarily from behavioral studies of gonadally intact and ovariectomized rats, that estradiol exerts phasic and tonic inhibitory effects on food intake by acting as a rhythmic, inhibitory, indirect control <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> size...|$|R
40|$|The thesis aims {{to analyze}} {{distributional}} impacts <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> voucher sys- tem in the Czech Republic, {{especially in the}} context of income inequality between different income groups. In the first part, we study the features <b>of</b> the Czech <b>meal</b> voucher scheme, relevant legislative framework and offer a comparison <b>of</b> the Czech <b>meal</b> voucher system with other European coun- tries. In the second part, we perform an analysis of the redistributive effects <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> allowances on various income deciles, quantify the impact <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> allowances tax exemption on the government budget and simulate replace- ment <b>of</b> current <b>meal</b> allowances by flat meal allowances according to several scenarios. Based on our analysis, the meal allowances tax relief represents burden of 11. 3 bn Kč for the state budget. Our findings suggest that current form <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> allowances widens the income gap between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries, within as well as across the income deciles. The aﬄuent households receive meal allowances more frequently, and moreover, nomin- ally and proportionately higher. We believe a replacement <b>of</b> current <b>meal</b> allowances scheme by one with a flat meal allowances (using the constant budget) would promote income equality. Then, the lower deciles would be- nefit, due to higher share of individuals entitled to the meal [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series <b>of</b> <b>meals</b> called the Dinner baskets were introduced. The dinner baskets included the Whopper Dinner Basket, Steak Sandwich Dinner Basket, Fried Chicken Dinner Basket, and Shrimp Dinner Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The dinner came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E

40|$|Whole-meal" is a {{term used}} for herring {{produced}} {{in such a way}} as to incorporate the solid matter of the "stick water" into the meal. Feeding experiments have showed that "whole meal" contains the same growth stimulating factors as "condensed fish-solubles", and thereby an increased interest for the production of this type <b>of</b> herring <b>meal</b> has arisen in Norway. This has led to the demand for an analytical method to differentiate between the two types <b>of</b> herring <b>meal.</b> We have not as yet information as to which growth promoting factor gives the best analytical indicator for the identification of the quality <b>of</b> the <b>meal.</b> The described method is merely an analytical means to differentiate between the two types <b>of</b> <b>meal.</b> The method employs determination of the content of "wather-soluble protein" <b>of</b> the <b>meals</b> which is found to be 17 - 24 g per 100 g protein of "whole meal", against 6 - 7 g per 100 g <b>of</b> common herring <b>meal.</b> Formoltitration <b>of</b> the water extracts <b>of</b> the <b>meals</b> was also found to be a useful method to identify the type <b>of</b> <b>meal.</b> Chemical determinations <b>of</b> riboflavin showed "whole meal" to contain 10 - 12 µg per gas against 5 - 6 µg per g <b>of</b> common herring <b>meal...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to its usual purpose as an edible vegetable, cabbage has been used historically as a medicinal herb {{for a variety of}} purported health benefits. For example, the Ancient Greeks recommended consuming the vegetable as a laxative, and used cabbage juice as an antidote for mushroom poisoning, for eye salves, and for liniments used to help bruises heal. In De Agri Cultura (On Agriculture), Cato the Elder suggested that women could prevent diseases by bathing in urine obtained from those who had frequently eaten cabbage. The ancient Roman nobleman Pliny the Elder described both culinary and medicinal properties of the vegetable, recommending it for drunkenness—both preventatively to counter the effects of alcohol and to cure hangovers. Similarly, the Ancient Egyptians ate cooked cabbage at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>meals</b> to reduce the intoxicating effects of wine. This traditional usage persisted in European literature until the mid-20th century.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of the Galilee is {{very similar}} to Lebanese cuisine, due to the {{extensive}} communication between the two regions before the establishment of Israel. The Galilee specializes in a number <b>of</b> <b>meals</b> based on the combination of bulgur, spices and meat, known as kubbi by Arabs. Kubbi bi-siniyee is a combination of minced lamb or beef mixed with pepper, allspice and other spices wrapped in a bulgur crust, then baked. Kubbi bi-siniyee could serve as the main dish during a Palestinian lunch. Kubbi neyee is a variation of kubbi, that is served as raw meat mixed with bulgur and a variety of spices. It is mostly eaten as a side dish and pita or markook bread is used for scooping the meat. Since the dish is raw, whatever is not eaten is cooked the next day in either the baked version or as fried kibbee balls.|$|E
5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>meals</b> served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or trays) of a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for their neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of milk withdrawal, stable routines and separation from dam on suckling behaviour of beef calves was tested in an 8 x 8 Latin square experiment. Length <b>of</b> the <b>meal</b> and length <b>of</b> the longest bout were measured {{to describe the}} meal as a whole. Length of pre-stimulation, increasing ejection, declining ejection, and afterstimulation were measured to describe the structure <b>of</b> <b>meal.</b> Eagerness <b>of</b> suckling was described as relative suckling time and non-suckling. Milk withdrawal increased length <b>of</b> <b>meal</b> and longest bout, but did not influence structure <b>of</b> <b>meal.</b> Milk withdrawal resulted in cistern-milk being available already before ejection and thereby in longer bouts during pre-stimulation. Milk withdrawal had no influence on eagerness of suckling. Stable routines had no influence on meal as a whole, but increased pre- and decreased after-stimulation and tended to result in somewhat longer bouts during pre-stimulation. There was no {{influence of}} stable routines on eagerness of suckling. Separation from dam had no influence on meal as a whole or structure <b>of</b> <b>meal,</b> but increased eagerness of suckling for the whole meal and for almost all periods.
