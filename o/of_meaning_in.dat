According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but {{are part of an}} underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> <b>In</b> The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E

25|$|In his {{philosophical}} work, Grayling connected {{solutions to}} the problem of scepticism in epistemology with the questions about assertibility and the problem <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> the philosophy of language and logic. A principal theme in his work is that considerations of metaphysics, which relate to what exists, has to be kept separate from the two connected questions of the relation of thought to its objects in the variety of domains over which thought ranges, and the mastery of discourses about those domains, where a justificationist approach is required.|$|E

As a scholar he contributed, by his profound philological researches, to {{the reconstruction of}} the language of the Bible, though his work is marred by prolixity and by his refusal to admit shades <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> synonyms. As a poet he possessed perfection of style, but lacked feeling and artistic imagination. No one exerted a greater influence than he on the dissemination of modern Hebrew, and no one, on the other hand, did more to retard the development of pure art and of poetic intuition. Because of his energetic commitment to the cause of Jewish emancipation, Wessely may be regarded as a leader of the Maskilim.|$|E

25|$|Bloomfield's work in Indo-European {{beyond his}} {{dissertation}} {{was limited to}} an article on palatal consonants in Sanskrit and one article on the Sanskrit grammatical tradition associated with Pāṇini, {{in addition to a}} number of book reviews. Bloomfield made extensive use of Indo-European materials to explain historical and comparative principles in both of his textbooks, An introduction to language (1914), and his seminal Language (1933). In his textbooks he selected Indo-European examples that supported the key Neogrammarian hypothesis of the regularity of sound change, and emphasized a sequence of steps essential to success in comparative work: (a) appropriate data in the form of texts which must be studied intensively and analysed; (b) application of the comparative method; (c) reconstruction of proto-forms. He further emphasized the importance of dialect studies where appropriate, and noted the significance of sociological factors such as prestige, and the impact <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> <b>In</b> addition to regular linguistic change, Bloomfield also allowed for borrowing and analogy.|$|E

500|$|Scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout cites [...] "The Couple" [...] as {{an example}} of Angelou's {{practice}} of subtly including more than one level <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> her poems, of her ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse, and her placement of themes of racism and liberation. [...] Angelou combines liberation ideology and poetic technique to challenge society's concepts of gender identity, especially in how it affects women. [...] She varies the length of the poem's lines, beginning in the first stanza and continuing throughout the poem, to convey ambiguity and doubt, and to demand that the reader question their perceptions of gender and power. [...] "The Couple", starting in its second stanza, attacks class-based ideals of masculinity in society. [...] The poem ends by demanding that the social constructs surrounding gender and class end, and insists that human survival depends upon recognizing shared emotions and experience, regardless of one's gender or position in society.|$|E
500|$|The {{analogy of}} games– most {{commonly}} associated with Ludwig Wittgenstein– has been proposed {{as a way of}} establishing meaning in religious language. The theory asserts that language must be understood in terms of a game: just as each game has its own rules determining what can and cannot be done, so each context of language has its own rules determining what is and is not meaningful. Religion is classified as a possible and legitimate language game which is meaningful within its own context. Various parables have also been proposed to solve the problem <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> religious language. R. M. Hare used his parable of a lunatic to introduce the concept of [...] "bliks"– unfalsifiable beliefs according to which a worldview is established– which are not necessarily meaningless. Basil Mitchell used a parable to show that faith can be logical, even if it seems unverifiable. John Hick used his parable of the Celestial City to propose his theory of eschatological verification, the view that if there is an afterlife, then religious statements will be verifiable after death.|$|E

500|$|Hamlet {{is often}} played with {{contemporary}} political overtones. Leopold Jessner's 1926 {{production at the}} Berlin Staatstheater portrayed Claudius's court as a parody of the corrupt and fawning court of Kaiser Wilhelm. In Poland, the number of productions of Hamlet has tended to increase at times of political unrest, since its political themes (suspected crimes, coups, surveillance) {{can be used to}} comment on a contemporary situation. Similarly, Czech directors have used the play at times of occupation: a 1941 Vinohrady Theatre production [...] "emphasised, with due caution, the helpless situation of an intellectual attempting to endure in a ruthless environment". In China, performances of Hamlet often have political significance: Gu Wuwei's 1916 The Usurper of State Power, an amalgam of Hamlet and Macbeth, was an attack on Yuan Shikai's attempt to overthrow the republic. In 1942, Jiao Juyin directed the play in a Confucian temple in Sichuan Province, to which the government had retreated from the advancing Japanese. In {{the immediate aftermath of the}} collapse of the protests at Tiananmen Square, Lin Zhaohua staged a 1990 Hamlet in which the prince was an ordinary individual tortured by a loss <b>of</b> <b>meaning.</b> <b>In</b> this production, the actors playing Hamlet, Claudius and Polonius exchanged roles at crucial moments in the performance, including the moment of Claudius's death, at which point the actor mainly associated with Hamlet fell to the ground.|$|E
500|$|John Bishop {{has been}} the most vocal {{supporter}} of treating Finnegans Wake absolutely, in every sense, as a description of a dream, the dreamer, and of the night itself; arguing that the book not only represents a dream in an abstract conception, but is fully a literary representation of sleep. On the subject Bishop writes: [...] The greatest obstacle to our comprehension of Finnegans Wake [...] the failure on the part of readers to believe that Joyce really meant what he said when he spoke of the book as a [...] "reconstruction of the nocturnal life" [...] and an [...] "imitation of the dream-state"; and as a consequence readers have perhaps too easily exercised on the text an unyielding literalism bent on finding a kind <b>of</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>in</b> every way antithetical to the kind of meaning purveyed in dreams [...] Bishop has also somewhat brought back into fashion the theory that the Wake is about a single sleeper; arguing that it is not [...] "the 'universal dream' of some disembodied global everyman, but a reconstruction of the night – and a single night – as experienced by 'one stable somebody' whose 'earwitness' on the real world is coherently chronological." [...] Bishop has laid the path for critics such as Eric Rosenbloom, who has proposed that the book [...] "elaborates the fragmentation and reunification of identity during sleep. The masculine [...] mind of the day has been overtaken by the feminine night mind. [...] The characters live in the transformation and flux of a dream, embodying the sleeper’s mind." ...|$|E
