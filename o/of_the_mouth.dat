5|$|The fold {{that connects}} {{the back of the}} sublingua and tongue to the rear floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> is called the plica sublingualis. In lemurs, this is an {{underdeveloped}} structure consisting of only a tiny outgrowth on the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> The point where the plica sublingualis attaches to the rear floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> marks the location of the submandibular salivary glands.|$|E

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue and other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance, a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to other}} iguanodonts, {{the teeth of}} Eolambia are {{arranged}} in tightly-spaced and interlocking rows. At any given time, each of the 32 maxillary tooth sockets holds three teeth, while each of the 30 dentary tooth sockets holds four teeth. Out of these, two of the teeth in each socket are replacement teeth like those of Probactrosaurus; the others are active teeth. Rvery active tooth has one wear facet. Like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids, each maxillary tooth crown has only one ridge, which is slightly offset towards the midline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> Meanwhile, each dentary tooth crown characteristically bears a primary ridge, and an accessory ridge closer to the midline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> a condition which is also present in Protohadros and other hadrosauroids. All of the crowns also bear small, denticle-like serrations {{on the front and}} rear edges, which is also seen in Probactrosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The Lobata have {{a pair of}} lobes, {{which are}} muscular, cuplike {{extensions}} {{of the body that}} project beyond the mouth. Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes (rather than trailing far behind, as in the Cydippida). Between the lobes on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> many species of lobates have four auricles, gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth. This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.|$|E
5|$|The reed is {{attached}} to the mouthpiece by the ligature, and the top half-inch or so of this assembly is held in the player's mouth. In the past clarinetists used to wrap a string around the mouthpiece and reed instead of using a ligature. The formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> around the mouthpiece and reed is called the embouchure.|$|E

The largely abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this area. To the west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by Rincon Bayou and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta.

5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E

5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that subjects are irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{extending from the}} mouth {{all the way to}} the rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, the cheek pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When the cheek pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E

People often experience red discoloration of the urine for a few days. Doxorubicin is in the anthracycline and antitumor antibiotic family of medications. It works in part by interfering with the function of DNA.|$|E

5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth),</b> sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced {{in order for the}} larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
