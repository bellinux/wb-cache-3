In February 1868, she was sentenced to four years of penal servitude for committing larceny in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|At 08:40, the {{opposing}} aircraft strike formations passed within sight <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Nine Zeros from Zuihō surprised and attacked the Enterprise group, attacking the climbing aircraft {{from out of}} the sun. In the resulting engagement, four Zeros, three Wildcats, and two TBFs were shot down, with another two TBFs and a Wildcat forced by heavy damage to return to Enterprise.|$|E

LaCôte d'Or was one of the restaurants visited by Brad Bird and others in France.|$|E

5|$|After the Nazis {{seized power}} {{the family moved}} first to Möhlstrasse in Munich, and in 1934 to Lake Tegern, where they bought a house.

The couple saw little <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as Himmler became totally absorbed by work. The relationship was strained. The couple did unite for social functions; they were frequent guests at the Heydrich home. Margarete saw it as her duty to invite the wives of the senior SS leaders over for afternoon coffee and tea on Wednesday afternoons.|$|E
5|$|All {{three letters}} of John were likely written {{within a few}} years <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and {{internal}} evidence indicates that they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them {{in the second half of}} the first century.

60|$|The outward {{relations}} between James {{and his son}} were marked {{by a lack of}} sentiment peculiarly Forsytean, but for all that the two were by no means unattached.

5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of the tree frog family, the green and golden bell frog spends much time basking in the sun on vegetation, rocks, and reeds, usually near water, or hopping around between such places. Unlike most frog species, it is often active during the day. When handled, this species secretes a slimy acrid mucus, which {{consists}} of 17 aurein peptides. Thirteen of these show broad-spectrum antibiotic and anticancer activity. The secretion makes the frog slippery and hard to grip, and is poisonous to some other species of frogs, so it is a useful defensive tool for green and golden bell frogs. Males often fight one another if they come within 1 m <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> frequently leading to injuries.|$|E

Much of the plot is constructed around the events precisely as they {{are believed to have}} occurred; lines of the gunmen's dialogue are often lifted verbatim from their writings or from their own home videos <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> In contrast to the 16-bit graphics are digitized photographs from the shooting or full voice samples from news reports; photos of the school are used as backdrops during battle scenes.|$|E
