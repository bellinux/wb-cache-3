Ringwald was offered a role in another John Hughes film called Some Kind <b>of</b> <b>Wonderful</b> (1987) but she turned down the role as she felt it was too similar to her other films she worked on with Hughes.

500|$|Winstead {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for her role.

Rolling Stone Peter Travers described Winstead's performance as [...] "unmissable and unforgettable", praising the comedy and intellect she simultaneously brought to the role.

[...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed described it as the epitome of the show's various themes, including childhood, art, and family, calling it [...] "a slightly nostalgic episode"; he considered it {{an excellent way to}} close the series, writing [...] "Acting as probably both a reflection of the show's staff at the time and a final send off, I can't think of a better way to send Brendon Small and Loren Bouchard's creation into the sunset." ...|$|E

500|$|McCay conferred {{with the}} American Historical Society in 1912, and {{announced}} plans for [...] "the presentation of pictures showing the great monsters that used to inhabit the earth". [...] He spoke of the [...] "serious and educational work" [...] that the animation process could enable. McCay had earlier introduced dinosaurs into his comic strip work, such as a March4, 1905, episode of Dream of the Rarebit Fiend in which a Brontosaurus skeleton {{took part in a}} horse race, and a May25, 1913, Rarebit Fiend episode in which a hunter unsuccessfully targets a dinosaur; the layout of the background to the latter bore a strong resemblance to what later appeared in Gertie. In the September21, 1913, episode of McCay's Little Nemo strip In the Land <b>of</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Dreams, titled [...] "In the Land of the Antediluvians", Nemo meets a blue dinosaur named Bessie which has the same design as that of Gertie.|$|E
500|$|In 1773 {{he married}} his cousin, Mary Kenyon, {{with whom he}} had three sons; Lloyd, who predeceased him, George, and Thomas.

He was noted as arrogant, despising things he did not understand and condemning any opinions he disagreed with regardless of his knowledge of them. He never attempted to reform the judicial system, and [...] "his habits of sordid parsimony brought discredit on the high station which he filled". Despite this, as a judge he was seen as [...] "profound in legal erudition, patient in judicial discrimination, and of the most determined integrity".|$|E

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented, [...] "We like Bart's fantasy of the radioactive Marie and Pierre Curie, and Smithers' fantasy of his loved one flying through the window. A collection <b>of</b> <b>wonderful</b> set pieces rather than a story, which fizzles out without any real attempt at an ending." [...] Empire placed the [...] "Mister Burns" [...] dance number as the show's fourth best film parody, [...] "the pick of a big bunch" [...] from the show's many Citizen Kane parodies, coming [...] "replete with Wellesian camera angles and subtly altered lyrics".|$|E
