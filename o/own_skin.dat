The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments upon her arms and head.

25|$|Complications of postsurgical wounds can {{be reduced}} before, during and after surgery. Before surgery, clinicians can treat the patient to reduce {{hemoglobin}} A1c levels to less than 7%. Those anticipating surgery can reduce their risk of complications by stopping smoking thirty days prior to surgery. The patient's skin can be evaluated {{for the presence of}} Staphylococcus areus prior to surgery since this bacterium causes wound infections in postoperative wounds. Treating any other infections prior to surgery also reduces the risks of a postoperative wound infection. Examples of these pre-existing infections are urinary tract infection or lower reproductive system infection. Removing the hair where the skin will be cut helps {{to reduce the risk of}} complications, though shaving is not considered to be appropriate and instead depilatories are used. Those who come in contact with the person who is receiving the surgery clean and disinfect their <b>own</b> <b>skin</b> surfaces. The patient's skin is also cleaned, scrubbed and treated with antiseptics. Patients undergoing surgery often receive antibiotics before surgery.|$|E

25|$|Seeds of a split {{seemed to}} appear in mid-2006 {{around the same time}} as the {{redevelopment}} of the ECW brand. During a tag-team match on Velocity the Mexicools faced the reigning tag champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Although both teams respected each other during the match, Psicosis used the ropes to pick up an illegal pinfall to win the match. This led to Super Crazy questioning Psicosis' actions. Next, during a SmackDown! broadcast, Psicosis left Crazy to be attacked by The Great Khali after a match, saving his <b>own</b> <b>skin</b> and leaving his tag team partner to fend for himself. Psicosis would later abandon Crazy during a handicap match against Khali. On the June 23 edition of SmackDown!, Super Crazy and Psicosis got into a fist-fight after various miscommunications throughout the match, marking the split of the team. The two were still billed as members of the faction in the following weeks, even though they were interfering in each other's matches, until they had a match on an episode of SmackDown! which was won by Super Crazy. After the split, Super Crazy was moved to the Raw brand, while Psicosis stayed on SmackDown. On November 1, 2006, Psicosis' WWE contract was officially terminated by WWE because of his arrest in Mexico for stealing a car from 23-year-old Alexander Valencia Ramirez.|$|E

Elspeth is also probably unfaithful to him on several occasions. Flashman notes that he has three [...] "prime talents, for horses, languages, and fornication"; he was also described by the master-at-arms of the 11th Hussars as a strong swordsman and was skilled with a lance, particularly at tent pegging.

In her review for Billboard, Megan Vick wrote: [...] "Over a breezy piano and vaguely hip-hop breakbeat, Mars professes his love for a beautiful girl who occupies his dreams [...] Mars pens lyrics that aim to make female listeners feel nothing short of perfect in their <b>own</b> <b>skin.</b> With its steady, danceable pulse and singalong chorus, Mars has created a feel-good jam that should establish him as a solo contender in his own right." [...] Nima Baniamer from Contactmusic.com felt that [...] "there is nothing about the single that makes Bruno Mars stand out from all the other RnB artists dominating the charts at the moment", and said, [...] "The song never builds to any climax and it simply falls a bit flat, coming across quite corny and cheesy." ...|$|E
