40|$|Pioneered by Clark’s {{microelectrode}} {{more than}} half a century ago, there has been substantial interest in developing new, miniaturized optical methods to detect molecular oxygen inside cells. While extensively used for animal tissue measurements, applications of intracellular optical oxygen biosensors are still scarce in plant science. A critical aspect is the strong autofluorescence of the green plant tissue that interferes with optical signals of commonly used <b>oxygen</b> <b>probes.</b> A recently developed dual-frequency phase modulation technique can overcome this limitation, offering new perspectives for plant research.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an alternative technique for measuring the matte level height in sulphide smelting furnaces. The initial studies involved applying electrochemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>probes</b> in a smelting furnace to measure the oxygen potentials of the matte and slag phases. However, these measurements were not successful as a result of low temperatures, preventing the reference electrode from attaining equilibrium during the measurements. These trials were followed up by using <b>oxygen</b> <b>probes</b> containing a (Mo + MoO 2) reference electrode instead of the (Cr + Cr 2 O 3) reference electrode used previously. It was shown that with some further development work, {{it should be possible to}} measure the oxygen potential of these mattes accurately. Further measurements were performed with a magnetic sensor in sulphide mattes. It was shown that an electronic signal, which is proportional to the magnetic susceptibility of the surrounding material, was generated during immersion into liquid matte. These measurements were extended and done in a smelting furnace. Initial results indicated that when the magnetic sensor was dipped through the slag layer into the matte, a signal was generated as soon as the sensor came in contact with the matte. Measurements are ongoing in order to record (on a computer for improved accuracy) the signal as a function of distance when the sensor is immersed through the slag layer into the matte phase. The magnetic sensor measurements may be the solution to a matte level measurement problem that has existed for a few decades in matte smelting furnaces...|$|R

It is generally accepted that tumour cells exhibit a more glycolytic phenotype than normal cells. In this study, we investigate the bioenergetic phenotype of two widely used cancer cell lines, RD and U 87 MG, by monitoring intracellular oxygen concentrations using phosphorescent Pt-porphyrin based intracellular probes. Our study demonstrates that cancer cell lines do not always exhibit an exclusively glycolytic phenotype. RD demonstrates a reliance on oxidative phosphorylation whilst U 87 MG display a more glycolytic phenotype. Using the intracellular <b>oxygen</b> sensing <b>probe</b> we generate an immediate readout of intracellular oxygen levels, with the glycolytic lines reflecting the oxygen concentration of the environment, and cells with an oxidative phenotype having significantly lower levels of intracellular oxygen.
