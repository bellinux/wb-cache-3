5|$|John Surratt stood {{trial in}} Washington in 1867.

5|$|Persian agents or Palmyrene traitors: the {{possibility}} of a Persian involvement exists but the outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> would not have served Shapur without establishing a pro-Persian monarch on the Palmyrene throne.

5|$|Altgens {{shared a}} story about Billy Lovelady for No More Silence: An Oral History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Assassination</b> of President Kennedy (1998).

Altgens was met instead by Lovelady's wife, who said her husband would never agree to be interviewed. The couple had moved several times, but they were still being harassed by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady was wearing when Kennedy was shot.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> remain disputed, the {{involvement}} of the Portuguese government, particularly Aginter Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E
25|$|That {{almost all}} the key {{military}} participants named as part of G30S were, either at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassinations</b> or just previously, close subordinates of Suharto: Lieutenant-Colonel Untung, Colonel Latief, and Brigadier-General Supardjo in Jakarta, and Colonel Suherman, Major Usman, and their associates at the Diponegoro Division’s HQ in Semarang.|$|R
25|$|LTTE sympathisers justify some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassinations</b> {{by arguing}} that the people {{attacked}} were combatants or persons closely associated with Sri Lankan military intelligence.

5|$|During Taraki's foreign {{visit to}} the non-aligned conference in Cuba, his Gang of Four had {{received}} an intelligence report that Amin was planning to arrest or kill them.

However, Akbari was not informed {{that he was the}} chosen assassin or that it was a secret mission, and he confided the information to contacts in the Soviet embassy. The embassy responded by warning Amin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> attempt, thereby saving him from certain death.|$|E
5|$|In early AD 41, Caligula {{was assassinated}} {{as a result}} of a {{conspiracy}} by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. The conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted, however. On the day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of Nero in AD 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassinations,</b> however, Major Gen. Suharto and his KOSTRAD (Army Strategic Reserves) {{units were}} closest to Jakarta. By default, Suharto became the field general in charge <b>of</b> prosecution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G30S. Later, at <b>the</b> insistence <b>of</b> Gen. Abdul Haris Nasution, Pranoto was removed and Suharto {{was promoted to}} Army Chief-of-Staff on 14 October 1965.|$|R
25|$|Nobody in SIDE has {{yet been}} charged with {{participating}} in the case.

5|$|Japanese {{newspapers}} cautioned {{about looking}} for an emigrating labor force in Japan, stating that their own country had large areas of available agricultural land that went untouched. A ball was planned in the king's honor by the Masonic Fraternity of Yokohama, which he bowed out of when he learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> of Alexander II of Russia. The Kalākaua group arrived in Kobe on March 18 for a sightseeing tour and lunch with the mayor. On March 22, they embarked on the steamship Tokio Maru bound for Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Nerva lacked {{widespread}} {{support in the}} Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist, his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> broke. The decision may have been hasty {{so as to avoid}} civil war, but neither appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{idea was to}} film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 aspect ratio in order to simulate the TV screens that were {{available at the time}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination,</b> then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} before the shooting, Vice President George H. W. Bush {{received}} the assignment of running crisis management in case of emergency despite Secretary of State Alexander Haig's objection. When the White House learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> attempt, however, Bush was over Texas aboard Air Force Two, which did not have secure voice communications, and his discussions with the White House were intercepted and given to the press. The vice president was notified in Fort Worth, Texas of the shooting within eight minutes, but relying on the initial reports that Reagan was unharmed his plane flew to Austin for a speech. After learning that the president was wounded, Air Force Two refueled in Austin before returning to Washington at what its pilot described as the fastest speed in the plane's history.|$|E
5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, which indicates {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, it would have been less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assassination</b> broke.|$|E
