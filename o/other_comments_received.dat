50|$|The {{members of}} the {{committee}} met six times as an advisory group and negotiated among themselves and with the Postal Service to reach a consensus on a new standard. Committee members were selected for the purpose of, and accepted the responsibility for, representing other interested individuals and organizations that were not present at committee meetings and to keep them informed of the committee’s proceedings. As part of the consensus process, the Postal Service agreed to use a recommendation by the committee as the basis of the revised standard. Standard 4C represents the committee’s recommendation. With one exception, each member of the committee signed the final agreement recommending adoption of this standard. That one committee member, a builders association, though supportive of the process and generally in concurrence with the new standard, declined to sign the agreement because a provision of the adopted standard establishes a minimum ratio of parcel lockers to customer compartments. This committee member stated its concerns in a comment submitted on the proposed rule, which the Postal Service will address with the <b>other</b> <b>comments</b> <b>received.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{outcome of}} a small inquiry {{exploring}} the use of blogs with a class of post-graduate students is presented. The exploration of blog uses was conducted {{in the class of}} postgraduate students over the period of one semester. The fundamental guiding question was that in what ways does a blog environment supplement classroom teaching and lead to an improved learning experience. The class under study was attending a course of the Master in Information Technology in Education program. Data was collected through observations and analysis of blog activities and artifacts, continuous teacher-reflection, interviews with selected students and a questionnaire. Student blogs, their posts, comments and learning artifacts presented also provided useful data contributing to an understanding of issues and activities. The study demonstrated that blogs can be effective educational technology and useful blog-based activities for learning include reading blogs of <b>others,</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>comments</b> and previewing tasks of others. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to address the dearth of research regarding media portrayals of minority and non-minority athletes in the National Hockey League (NHL). This study utilized both qualitative and quantitative analyses to determine whether media coverage of professional hockey players is different based on race. Comments (n= 1, 487) from 18 of the highest circulation newspaper publications in the United States and Canada reporting on regular and post-season play for the 2013 - 2014 NHL season were coded using a modified version of the Biased Coverage Index. Three statistically significant findings included a) players with five or more years of experience are portrayed more favorably, regardless of race; b) the percentage of physical and cognitive <b>comments</b> <b>received</b> by minority players was reduced in post-season newspaper coverage; and c) the valence of <b>comments</b> <b>received</b> by minority players during post-season newspaper coverage was more negative than the valence of <b>comments</b> <b>received</b> by non-minority players during the same time period. These findings reveal an association between post-season play and differential coverage of minority and non-minority athletes in newspaper coverage of NHL games...|$|R
