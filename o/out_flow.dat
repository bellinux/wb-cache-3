2500|$|Two rivers which {{feed the}} lagoon are the Arani river at the {{southern}} tip and the Kalangi River from the northwest, in addition to some smaller streams.

The lagoon's water exchange with the Bay of Bengal is through an inlet channel {{at the north end of}} Sriharikota and <b>out</b> <b>flow</b> channel of about [...] width at its southern end, both of which carry flows only during the rainy season. The lake acts as buffer to retain the accumulated flood water till the flood water is discharged gradually to the sea during the monsoon period and cyclones. The lake and its river basins are located both in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states. The lake and its drainage river basins become interstate river basin as per Interstate River Water Disputes Act 1956. Most of the lake area including its water outlet to the sea is located in Andhra Pradesh.|$|E
