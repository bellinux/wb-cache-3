5|$|Establishment of the C made Everglades National Park {{completely}} {{dependent upon}} another political entity for its survival. One of the C's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail {{on the northern}} border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through <b>open</b> <b>drain</b> pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne Aquifer—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C for assistance, the C offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the mangroves and into Florida Bay. Though the C refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering {{the east side of}} the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of outputs, {{comparators}} can also be classified as <b>open</b> <b>drain</b> or push–pull.

2500|$|At 11:47pm on {{the night}} of 30 March, {{ambulance}} services were called to a park in Lismore, in the far north of New South Wales. They found Solon next to an <b>open</b> <b>drain</b> in the park, suffering from head injuries. She also had difficulty moving her legs. She had most likely sustained these injuries after falling into the drain, although some media reports speculated that she had been in a car accident. To this day she claims she was knocked off a pushbike by a passing car, but the medical view has always been that she was physically assaulted [...] She was taken to Lismore Base Hospital, where she was treated for her injuries. She was soon moved to the psychiatric ward because she was behaving aggressively towards hospital staff, presumably due to her head injuries. A social worker Guing Coop who visited Solon at the hospital identified that she was of Filipino background, and suspected that she was an illegal immigrant. On this basis the social worker contacted the local branch of the Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.|$|E

40|$|To remove body fluids, {{preventing}} {{an accumulation}} of fluid and assist wound healing. BACKGROUND INFORMATION A drain describes any material or equipment used to prevent {{the formation of a}} haematoma or to carry fluid from inside the body to the surface. Allowing unwanted fluid or blood to remain in a wound may be a potential source of infection and may also impede healing, or result in wound breakdown and dehiscence. Wound drains are classified as closed or open drainage systems. 1. Closed drains do not expose the contents to the atmosphere. They include vacuum drains which apply negative pressure such as the Redivac®, or non-vacuum systems such as the T-tube drain. 1 The drain is often secured with a suture. The use of a closed drain system lowers the risk of potential infection for patients and reduces staff contact with body fluids. 2. <b>Open</b> <b>drains</b> allow communication with the atmosphere. These drains include corrugated drains, the Penrose drain and sump <b>drains.</b> 1 <b>Open</b> <b>drains</b> are inserted directly into the wound bed and they drain into a dressing. As they have an open end there is the potential for infection. <b>Open</b> <b>drains</b> are usually secured by a suture and may have a safety pin attache...|$|R
