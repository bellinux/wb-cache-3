50|$|Butyric acid or {{fermentation}} {{butyric acid}} {{is also found}} as a hexyl ester hexyl butyrate in the oil of Heracleum giganteum (a type of hogweed) and as the octyl ester <b>octyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> in parsnip (Pastinaca sativa); {{it has also been}} noticed in skin flora and perspiration.|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oil {{obtained from the}} fruits of hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium subsp. ternatum) growing in central Apennines (Italy) was analysed for chemical composition by gas chromatographic-flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The oil was composed mainly of aliphatic esters (86. 9 - 89. 5 %), among them octyl acetate (54. 9 - 60. 2 %) and <b>octyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> (10. 1 - 13. 4 %) were the most abundant. The oil and its two major esters, octyl acetate and <b>octyl</b> <b>butyrate,</b> were tested for in vitro biological activity, namely antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic, by microdilution, DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulphonic acid)) and MTT (3 -[4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assays. Worthy of mention was only the cytotoxic activity of the oil against two tumour cell lines, i. e. A 375 (human malignant melanoma) and HCT 116 (human colon carcinoma) cells, with IC 50 values of 48. 69 and 95. 83 μg/mL, respectively; the major compound responsible for this effect was <b>octyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> which displayed IC 50 values of 20. 19 μg/mL (100. 8 μM) and 55. 35 μg/mL (276. 3 μM) on the same cells, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Two mirid bugs, Stenotus rubrovittatus and Trigonotylus caelestialium (Heteroptera: Miridae), are {{important}} pests that infest rice crops {{in many regions}} of Japan. Males of each species were attracted to traps baited with conspecific, unmated females. Hexyl butyrate, (E) - 2 -hexenyl butyrate, and (E) - 4 -oxo- 2 -hexenal were identified as possible female-produced sex pheromone components for S. rubrovittatus, whereas hexyl hexanoate, (E) - 2 -hexenyl hexanoate, and <b>octyl</b> <b>butyrate</b> {{were found to be}} sex pheromone components for T. caelestialium. Pheromone doses and ratios were optimized for attraction of males of each species. Sticky traps set up close to or below the top of the plant canopy were optimal for monitoring these species, and trap catches were almost constant when traps were placed 7 or more meters in from the edge of a paddy field. Mixed lures, in which the six compounds from both species were loaded onto a single septum, or separate lures for each species, deployed in a single trap, were equally effective for monitoring both species simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Heracleum persicum {{is known}} as Persian Hogweed. H. persicum {{extracts}} and essential oil are important areas in drug development with numerous pharmacological activities in the Middle East especially in Iran. For a long time H. persicum {{has been used in}} traditional medicines for the relief of flatulence, stomachs as well as flavoring, as a digestive and an antiseptic. H. persicum has recently been shown to have antioxidant, anticonvulsant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. Pimpinellin, isopimpinellin, bergapten, isobergapten and sphondin are furanocoumarins which are reported from roots of this plant. Hexyl <b>butyrate,</b> <b>octyl</b> acetate and hexyl- 2 -methylbutanoate were identified as the major constituents for H. persicum essential oil. Due to the easy collection of the plant and being widespread and also remarkable biological activities, this plant has become both food and medicine in Iran. This review presents comprehensive analyzed information on the botanical, chemical and pharmacological aspects of H. persicum...|$|R
