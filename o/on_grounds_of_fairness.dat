40|$|This paper uses simple {{economic}} theory {{to examine the}} effects of various policies that are intended to level the playing field in international trade. That is, when foreign producers are given advantages over domestic producers by government subsidies or other interventions that lower their costs, domestic firms may argue that their own governments should either provide comparable assistance or should protect them from competing with the foreign firms <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fairness.</b> Economic analysis easily shows that granting these requests is usually harmful for the domestic economy as a whole, but that may not prevent such policies from being implemented.

The more important inadequacy of the traditional Ramsey tax models is the selective modelling of incentive effects of tax reforms and their limited applicability for designing tax policy in developing countries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the problem of}} selecting a number of candidates to receive a good (admission) from a pool {{in which there are}} more qualified applicants than places. I observe that it is rarely possible to order all candidates according to some relevant criterion, such as academic merit, since these standards are inevitably somewhat vague. This means that we are often faced with the task of making selections between near-enough equal candidates. I survey one particular line of response, which says that we should allow our choice of borderline candidates to be guided by non-relevant criteria such as gender-balancing. I argue that this would not, as commonly objected, be a case of sex discrimination {{if it is to be}} applied either in favour of men or women. Nonetheless, I argue that such policies are problematic because they violate the demand for publicity, which is required for legitimacy and to assure everyone that discrimination has not in fact taken place. Instead, I suggest that, if we are concerned to avoid discrimination, there may be a case for using lotteries as tie-breakers, not <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fairness</b> but to prevent taint of bias...|$|E

40|$|Olympic style {{games were}} first held for athletes {{with disabilities in}} Rome in 1960. Today the Paralympic Games (parallel Olympics) feature {{competition}} for athletes from six disability groups, including amputee, visually impaired, and spinal cord injury. Olympic hosts, both summer and winter, are now contractually obliged to organize the Paralympics in the same venue. The size and popularity of the games have grown exponentially since their inception, but they remain largely separate from the Olympics themselves. Recently, a very successful Paralympic athlete from South Africa, Oscar Pistorius, {{made it clear that}} despite his double below-the-knee amputation he wanted to compete in his event (400 m) at the Olympics. Initially, however, Oscar Pistorius was prohibited from competing at any International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) competition <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fairness.</b> On the basis of biomechanical and physiological evidence, the IAAF argued that his highly specialized prosthetic limbs gave him an advantage and were therefore in contravention of Rule 144. 2. This rule forbids the use of any technical device (such as prosthetic limbs) that provides the user with an advantage over another athlete not using such a device. This decision was subsequently overturned by the Court of Arbitration for Sport following an appeal by Pistorius. Using this case as an example, the aim {{of this paper is to}} highlight the empirical and ethical difficulties associated with the application of the principle of fairness in sport. In particular, we discuss both the complexity of identifying the nature and size of athletic advantage and the basis for determining its validity. Moreover, we explore how similar difficulties arise when attempting to establish criteria for relevant athletic performance. We argue that reasonable rules and norms for competition are not simply inferred from the principle of fairness. Such rules and norms should result from careful judgements informed by scientific, conceptual, and ethical evidence, and be guided by the standards of excellence that best characterize the sport in question...|$|E

40|$|Aristotle {{claims that}} in some extenuating circumstances, the correct {{response}} to the wrongdoer is sungnōmē rather than blame. Sungnōmē has {{a wide spectrum of}} meanings that include aspects of sympathy, pity, fellow-feeling, pardon, and excuse, but the dominant interpretation among scholars takes Aristotle’s meaning to correspond most closely to forgiveness. Thus, it is commonly held that the virtuous Aristotelian agent ought to forgive wrongdoers in specific extenuating circumstances. Against the more popular forgiveness interpretation, I begin by defending a positive account of sungnōmē as the correct judgment that a wrongdoer deserves excuse since she was not blameworthy. I then argue that since sungnōmē is merited <b>on</b> the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> this shows that both the forgiveness interpretation and a third, alternative interpretation of sungnōmē as sympathy mischaracterize both the justification for sungnōmē and its nature.

One is that he installs legally required Grade 5 insulation in everyone 2 ̆ 7 s home save one. The second is that on his own ceiling light circuits he uses Grade 4 insulation, which cheaper to acquire and, in his professional judgment, it is safe. In fact, the Wise Electrician would install Grade 4 in those houses, too, but for one fact: it would be illegal. What makes our man so interesting is that it is illegal to install Grade 4 in his house too. The law says: Grade 5 for 2 ̆ 2 all home wiring 2 ̆ 2 and that 2 ̆ 7 s that. No exceptions listed. Endicott says that the Wise Electrician breaks the law at home because it 2 ̆ 2 cannot help him to act for the common good (or for any more particular good). 2 ̆ 2 Out and around the Wise Electrician adheres to the building code even though he considers it to be–indeed, he knows it to be–overprotective. Why? The Wise Electrician obeys the law outside his home to avoid scandalizing the law-abiding. Endicott also asserts that code compliance is an implicit term of his agreement with customers. This Response offers the preceding observations as matters of fact about social attitudes towards the law, and not as an argument for breaking laws. In fact, this Response argues against these attitudes below: people have a moral obligation to obey the law as such. Insofar as Endicott justifies the Wise Electrician 2 ̆ 7 s law abidingness outside the home by fear of scandal, this Response argues that the justification is weak. Law-abidingness as social habit or attitude is not that brittle, and thus this Response argues against the Wise Electrician law-breaking at home <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> not social consequences...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{explore a}} new {{approach}} to the problem of determinism and moral responsibility. This approach involves asking when someone has a compelling claim to exemption against other members of the moral community. I argue that it is sometimes fair to reject such claims, even when the agent doesn’t deserve, in the sense of basic desert, to be blamed for her conduct. In particular, when an agent’s conduct reveals that her commitment to comply with the standards of the moral community is deficient, and when her demand for exemption further exemplifies this deficiency, she cannot complain of unfair treatment if her demand is rejected. To support this contention, I argue that we are sometimes justified in rejecting otherwise valid moral appeals <b>on</b> the <b>grounds</b> that they are cynically motivated, especially when an agent merely seeks to exploit our commitment to comply with reasonable interpersonal standards. An advantage of this approach is that it affords compatibilists a middle path, allowing them to defend our practice <b>of</b> blaming <b>on</b> non-consequentialist <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>fairness,</b> even as they acknowledge the force of arguments for incompatibilism about basic deser...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{from the}} Piovego, the fraud magistracy of early modern Venice, offers a {{critical}} {{perspective on the}} documentary record of credit {{and the ways in}} which this was used in practice. Although it was formally illegal to charge interest on personal loans, a variety of legal fictions were employed to evade the ban. Such fictions significantly reduced the transparency and certainty of exchange, pushing personal loans into a world of semi-legality. This was a ‘baroque economy’, in which people were aware of the potential discrepancy between surface form and underlying substance, and private agreements might be contested <b>on</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> substantive <b>fairness.</b> The ‘hidden transcripts’ presented by litigants indicate that the formal record must be interpreted through a ‘thick description’ that considers its role as a resource in a broader process of negotiation. Far from being a ‘market’, characterized by price competition, choice, and transparency, the informal economy of credit was embedded in long-term power relationships. Rather than celebrating intermediaries such as brokers and notaries as facilitators of ‘market’ relations, we need to understand them as part of a hierarchical network of power and wealth., embedded in long-term relationships...|$|R

Finally, this Article notes that even if the sort of protection provided by the GCRA may be justified under some conditions of market failure, there is no empirical evidence that government contractors in the Gulf Coast have experienced such conditions, and there are superior alternatives to the GCRA that could provide such protection while preserving a path for victim compensation.

40|$|Many {{thousands}} of children experience serious disabling conditions such as autism and debilitating chronic illnesses such as asthma. Caring for these children is often so demanding that caregiving parents cannot remain employed outside the home. Parental resources available to these children are also limited because an unusually high percentage of them live with only one parent. Nonetheless, surprisingly few cases involving families with a disabled or chronically ill child appear in the family law case law or scholarly literature. Even where child support and alimony are concerned, these families are seen only at the margins. In my recent article, I propose addressing some of the resource problems of families with disabled and chronically ill children {{through the creation of}} a new inter-parental financial remedy which I call chalimony. The remedy would highlight the interdependent reality of disabled and chronically ill children with the caregivers whose market activity is limited because of their unusual caregiving responsibilities. Caregivers would be entitled to the remedy if three conditions are met. First, meeting the child’s reasonable caregiving needs would have to be incompatible with full market participation by the caregiving parent. Second, the child’s other parent would not be meeting enough of the child’s caregiving needs to permit the primary caregiving parent to engage fully in the market. And, third, the economic resources of the paying parent would have to sufficient to provide chalimony in addition to child support and alimony. In the article, I distinguish chalimony from child support and alimony on both theoretical and practical grounds. Then I justify chalimony <b>on</b> the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> economic <b>fairness</b> to the payor parent, gender fairness to the caregiving parent, and the value of chalimony to the child, especially in terms of the child’s access to additional parental time and economic resources...|$|R
