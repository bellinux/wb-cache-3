Voltage clamp methods were optimized for the fast MEPC rising phase using custom electronics. From 0 - 43 degrees C, A(c) increased by approximately 4. 2 -fold, while t(r) and t(f) decreased by approximately 3. 6 - and approximately 9. 5 -fold, respectively. Arrhenius plots were smoothly curved, with small apparent Q(10) (A(c)) or (Q(10)) (- 1) (t(r) and t(f)) values mostly well below 2. 0. Nearly identical extracellular and voltage clamp results ruled out measurement artifacts, {{even for the}} shortest t(r) values (< 60 microseconds).

Silicon is used because it offers the possibility of realising small, light, low cost and high performance mechanical sensors.

From an analysis it appears that high capacity silicon load cells need a spring element which is compressed, because otherwise the chip will break under loading. In order to eliminate for the effect of changes of the position of the loading point on the chip, the choice is made to make a sensing system which integrates the force distribution on the chip (distributed sensing).

The ability to thermally acclimate to <b>offset</b> <b>temperature</b> effects on physiological function is prevalent in ectotherms that are unable to thermoregulate year-round to maintain performance. In this study we examined the physiological and behavioural consequences of long-term exposure to different water temperatures in the aquatic snake Acrochordus arafurae. We hypothesised that long dives would benefit this species by reducing the likelihood of avian predation. To achieve longer dives at high temperatures, we predicted that thermal acclimation of A. arafurae would reduce metabolic rate and increase use of aquatic respiration. Acrochordus arafurae were held at 24 or 32 A degrees C for 3 months before dive duration and physiological factors were assessed (at both 24 and 32 A degrees C). Although filesnakes demonstrated thermal acclimation of metabolic rate, use of aquatic respiration was thermally independent and did not acclimate. Mean dive duration did not differ between the acclimation groups at either temperature; however, warm-acclimated animals increased maximum and modal dive duration, demonstrating a longer dive duration capacity.

Samples of the middle Miocene to Pliocene were analyzed for alkenone-based (U 37 K", SSTUK) and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) based (TEX 86, TempTEX) water temperature proxies. In concordance with global cooling during the Miocene, SSTUK and TempTEX exhibit a decline of about 8 °C and 16 °C, respectively. The temperature trends suggest an inflow of cold Antarctic waters triggered by Antarctic ice sheet expansion and intensification of Southern Hemisphere southeasterly winds. A <b>temperature</b> <b>offset</b> between both proxies developed {{with the onset of}} upwelling, which can be explained by differences in habitat: alkenone!producing phytoplankton live in the euphotic zone and record sea surface temperatures, while GDGT!producing Thaumarchaeota are displaced to colder subsurface waters in upwelling!influenced areas and record subsurface water temperatures.

Also, the torsional beam is designed as a double-beam structure, which is a symmetrical structure formed by two torsional beams separated by a certain distance. The device area of the novel accelerometer is more than 50 times smaller than that of a traditional double differential torsional MEMS accelerometer.
