5|$|Ahead of the Australians' {{visit to}} England in 1930 {{there was some}} {{confidence}} in English cricketing circles, since Chapman's victorious 1928–29 side was largely intact and <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> looked formidably strong, especially in batting. England duly won the first Test, at Trent Bridge, by 93 runs, despite a second-innings century from Bradman that for a time threatened to turn the match. Larwood's active participation was curtailed by an attack of gastritis; he took 2 wickets in the match for 21 runs.|$|E
30|$|Authors with {{addresses}} in Spain made-up {{the largest}} number of authors listed <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about the relationship between athletic performance and ACTN 3 (Table  3). Authors with Spanish addresses were equally likely to be listed <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about the relationship between ACTN 3 and athletic performance as they were <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about ACTN 3 independent of athletic performance (Tables  3, 4). The achieved statistical power of these tests was low (1 – β[*]=[*] 0.069).

Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further <b>on</b> <b>paper</b> than she could have done through normal social intercourse.|$|E

30|$|First, authors with {{addresses}} in Norway {{were never}} listed <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> {{about the relationship}} between MSTN and athletic performance (Table  4). Consequently, they were disproportionately found listed <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  4). However, the sample size of authors with addresses in Norway was small (n[*]=[*] 10). Second, authors with addresses in the United Kingdom were equally likely as those with addresses in the USA to be found <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> {{about the relationship between}} DR and athletic performance (Table  6). However, probably because of small sample sizes, the difference was not statistically significant (Table  6). Third, authors that listed addresses in Germany were never found <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  3). As a consequence, authors with addresses in Germany were less likely than authors with USA addresses to be found <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about the relationship between MSTN and athletic performance (Table  5). This was the only instance of authors with USA addresses having a significantly greater proportional representation <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about the relationship between an innate factor and athletic performance. Last, authors with Japanese addresses were about twice as likely to be found <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about the innate factors independent of athletic performance than <b>on</b> <b>papers</b> about the relationship between the innate factors and athletic performance (Table  4). Nevertheless, authors with Japanese addresses were more likely than those with USA addresses to be found on the pooled sample of papers that examined the relationship between the innate factors and athletic performance (Table  6). Taken together, these patterns suggest that authors based in these countries were more likely than authors with USA addresses to publish papers that examined questions about the roles of these innate factors in athletic performance.|$|R
