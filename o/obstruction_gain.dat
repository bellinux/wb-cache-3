40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] {{purpose of this study}} is to characterize the indoor and indoor–outdoor propagation in different scenarios, using monopole antennas working at 410 and 890 MHz. Propagation of narrow band and wide bands have been studied. In scenarios with a continuous variation of the distance between the transmitter and receiver antenna (1 D scenarios), we use a log-distance path loss model to determine the equations that describe the mean value of the path loss. In scenarios where the position of the receiver is not a uniform function of the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, we represent the basic propagation gain as a function of the measurement point index. Results show that the indoor propagation gain can be described using two slopes propagation model. For the multiwall attenuation loss it is shown that each wall has an attenuation of almost 2. 5 dB at 410 MHz increasing to almost 4 dB at 890 MHz. The <b>obstruction</b> <b>gain</b> (loss) due to human beings shows that this can be within a 40 dB interval...|$|E
2500|$|The advance into Belgium {{took place}} in suffocatingly hot weather; roadblocks slowed German progress; cavalry found that the bridge at Visé had been blown and were engaged by small-arms fire from the west bank. Jäger pushed the Belgians out of the village but the {{bridging}} train of the 34th Brigade was delayed and fire from the Liège forts made the area untenable. The 27th, 14th and 11th brigades reached their objectives from Mortroux to Julémont, Herve and Soiron. The 9th Cavalry Division followed by the 2nd and 4th Cavalry divisions, advanced south of the Vesdre river, though many <b>obstructions,</b> <b>gained</b> footholds over the Ourthe and captured the bridge at Poulseur. The 38th Brigade reached Louveigne and Theux and the 43rd Brigade reached Stoumont and La Gleize. During a night made difficult by sniping from [...] "civilians" [...] and bombardment by the forts, the brigades prepared to close up to the jumping-off points for the attack next day. The cavalry of Division Garnier was unable to cross the river at Lixhe until [...] due to artillery fire from Liège and the 34th Brigade managed to cross by [...] only by leaving behind the artillery and supplies.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{much has}} been made of the fact that the Republic decidedly came off second best (the taunt by the French negotiator, Melchior de Polignac, [...] "De vous, chez vous, sans vous", meaning that the Peace Congress had decided over the Dutch {{interests}} in their own country, but without them, still rankles), they actually attained most of their war aims: the desired codominion over the Austrian Netherlands, and the Barrier of fortresses in that country, were attained under the Austro-Dutch Treaty of November, 1715 (France already having acquiesced at Utrecht), though the Dutch, due to British <b>obstruction,</b> did not <b>gain</b> all they had hoped for.|$|R
40|$|Post-radiation {{stricture}} {{is a rare}} complication after pelvis irradiation, {{but must}} be {{in the mind of the}} clinician evaluating a lower gastrointestinal <b>obstruction.</b> Endoscopy has <b>gained</b> an important role in chronic radiation proctitis with several therapeutic options for management of intestinal strictures. The treatment of rectal strictures has been limited to surgery with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a less invasive therapeutic approach for benign rectal strictures, endoscopic balloon dilation with or without intralesional steroid injection, has become a common treatment modality. We present a case of benign post-radiation rectal stricture treated successfully with balloon dilation and adjuvant intralesional triamcinolone injection. A 70 -year-old woman presented to the emergency room complaining for 2 weeks of diarrhea and meteorism, 11 years after radiation of the pelvis due to adenocarcinoma of the uterus. Colonoscopy revealed a stricture at the rectum and multiple endoscopic biopsies were obtained from the stricture. The stricture was treated with endoscopic balloon dilation and intralesional triamcinolone injection. The procedure appears to have a high success rate and a very low complication rate. Histologic examination of the biopsies revealed non-specific inflammatory changes of the rectal mucosa and no specific changes of the mucosa due to radiation. All biopsies were negative for malignancy. The patient is stricture-free 12 months post-treatment...|$|R
5000|$|The lob wedge can be {{used for}} any shot {{requiring}} a short carry distance (typically 10-50 yards), and/or a very high launch angle, which also results in high backspin and thus little rolling distance after impact. Such shots include tight approaches to the green, shots from close to a tree or other tall <b>obstruction,</b> shots to <b>gain</b> a more favorable lie on the fairway, and certain bunker shots. The high launch angle and thus long carry time can be an impediment in high winds, but skilled golfers can use the long [...] "hang time" [...] of a lob wedge shot {{to take advantage of a}} favorable wind. The wedge typically has low to moderate bounce (0-4°) for fairway and other firm lies, but because of its high loft even 2-3° of bounce will counterbalance the downward force of the wedge's striking face, making a club with this configuration useful in sand as well. Players will often use a lob wedge to play from a sand trap adjacent to the green, instead of [...] "opening" [...] a sand wedge (a more difficult shot to make accurately). It {{can be used}} with a full swing from the fairway or rough to carry about 40-60 yards, but it's more commonly used with a chip shot from very close to the green, to carry 10-40 yards and [...] "drop" [...] the ball into an exact spot on the green.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2007. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 59 - 62). x, 62 leaves, bound 29 cmPeriodic motion, {{such as that}} {{resulting from}} cardiopulmonary activity, can be measured with a microwave Doppler radar system. This thesis focuses on the assessment of radio system requirements and critical specifications for such radar sensing systems. The fundamental limitations for transmit power, receive power and range for a functional 2. 40 Hz IMS band cardiopulmonary radar system were computed and measured, including free space losses, noise, and fundamental heart rate detection limits. The minimum required power for close range rate detection was also assessed. Heart rates for subjects holding their breath or breathing normally were successfully tracked for signal power levels as low as 20 nW. This is the lowest power ever reported for an ISM band CW Doppler radar for heart rate detection. These results can be extrapolated to higher power systems where <b>obstructions</b> and antenna <b>gain</b> similarly impact the signal power available for heart motion detection. A 2. 40 Hz microwave Doppler radar system was designed for the required assessments, with several transceiver variations fully integrated on printed circuit boards using various antenna configurations. The transceiver boards were 101. 6 [mm] by 111. 6 [mm], and included a small on-board oscillator. A multiple antenna system was used to provide more comprehensive data for advanced signal processing, and the modular system could be easily expanded. Issues and means for performance improvement of the system are also reported. Sensitivity {{was found to be}} limited by direct conversion architecture and component issues. for which several circuit configurations were explored, achieving significant DC offset and LO leakage reduction. Using DC offset cancelling, flicker noise reduction was also achieved, which significantly affects the SNR at baseband and improved the system sensitivity...|$|R
