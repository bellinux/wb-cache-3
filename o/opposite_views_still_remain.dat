2500|$|The Court {{also found}} that the death penalty [...] "comports with the basic concept of human dignity {{at the core of the}} [...] Amendment". The death penalty serves two {{principal}} social purposes—retribution and deterrence. [...] "In part, capital punishment is an expression of society's moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct". But this outrage must be expressed in an ordered fashion, for America is a society of laws. Retribution is consistent with human dignity, because society believes that [...] "certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death". And although it is difficult to determine statistically how much crime the death penalty actually deters, the Court found that in 1976 there was [...] "no convincing empirical evidence" [...] supporting either the view that the death penalty is an effective deterrent to crime or the <b>opposite</b> <b>view.</b> <b>Still,</b> the Court could not completely discount the possibility that for certain [...] "carefully contemplated murderers", [...] "the possible penalty of death may well enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act".|$|R
2500|$|According to a sociological study {{published}} in 1981, the Swedish-speaking Finns meet the four major criteria for a separate ethnic group: self-identification of ethnicity, language, social structure, and ancestry. However, not all Swedish-speaking Finns are willing to self-identify as representatives of a distinct ethnicity. The major political organisation representing the Swedish-speakers in Finland, the Swedish People's Party, has defined the Swedish-speaking Finns as a people who express Finnish identity in the Swedish language. The issue is debated: an <b>opposite</b> <b>view</b> is <b>still</b> that the Swedish-speaking Finns are a sub-group of the ethnic Swedes, östsvenskar or [...] "East Swedes".|$|R

40|$|Accurately {{predicting}} {{the popularity of}} user generated content (UGC) is very valuable to content providers, online advertisers, {{as well as social}} media and social network researchers. However, it is also a challenging task due to the plethora of factors that affect content popularity in social systems. We here focus on the problem of {{predicting the}} popularity trend of a piece of UGC (object) as early as possible, as a step towards building more accurate popularity prediction methods. Unlike previous work, we explicitly address the inherent tradeoff between prediction accuracy and remaining interest in the object after prediction, since, to be useful, accurate predictions should be made before interest has exhausted. Moreover, given the heterogeneity in popularity dynamics across objects in most UGC applications, this tradeoff has to be solved on a per-object basis, which makes the prediction task harder. We propose to tackle this problem with a novel two-step learning approach in which we: (1) extract popularity trends from previously uploaded objects, and then (2) predict trends for newly uploaded content. The first step exploits a time series clustering algorithm to represent each trend by a time series centroid. We propose to treat the second step as a classification problem. First, we extract a set of features of the target object corresponding to the distances of its early popularity curve to the previously identified centroids. We then combine these features with content features (e. g., incoming links, category), using them to train classifiers for prediction. Our experimental results for YouTube datasets show that we can achieve Micro and Macro F 1 scores between 0. 61 and 0. 71 (a gain of up to 38 % when compared to alternative approaches), with up to 68 % of the <b>views</b> <b>still</b> <b>remaining</b> for 50 % or 21 % of the videos, depending on the dataset.

2500|$|Following a ratings success, What Not to Wear was {{promoted}} to BBC One in 2004 to air its fourth series. The format was changed slightly, where a 30-minute show with one makeover {{was replaced by a}} 60-minute show featuring two makeovers. The series that aired {{for the first time on}} BBC One began on 29 September 2004, and had success with viewing figures which peaked at 5.26 million during the episode aired on 20 October 2004. For a Christmas special aired on 22 December 2004, Trisha Goddard was madeover by Constantine and Woodall, where the episode generated 7.42 million viewers. Other What Not to Wear specials saw them giving David Baddiel and Ingrid Tarrant makeovers. Tarrant, however, did not wear what Constantine and Woodall had selected, and changed her dress in the back of the taxi whilst driving to the award ceremony. The fifth series began on 19 October 2005, where <b>viewing</b> figures <b>still</b> <b>remained</b> strong. On 16 November and 23, 2005 ratings reached 4.91 million and the series averaged with 4.8 million viewers. In 2005, Britney Spears revealed that she was a fan of the show when she commented [...] "The girls are so dramatic in the makeovers, you just get caught up in it. Would I go on the show?

40|$|In {{this paper}} I revisit my 1986 essay, “Professionalism and Archivists in the United States/” American Archivist 49 (Summer 1986) : 229 - 247, drawing upon sociological {{models of the}} traits and {{characteristics}} of professions {{as a means of}} drafting an agenda for developing the community of archivists and their status within society. Written {{in the midst of an}} intense period of professional planning and self-scrutiny, this article presented the normal call for improved disciplinary knowledge, education, and public awareness. However, in the thirty years since, with the emerging digital society, disciplinary convergence, increased cultural sensitivities and self-awareness, growing community and indigenous archives, and networked social media, does such a traditional <b>view</b> of professionalism <b>still</b> <b>remain</b> relevant as a discussion focus?

Bestuzhev's ruin appeared certain when, in 1743, the French agent, Jacques-Joachim Trotti, marquis de la Chétardie, arrived to reinforce his enemies. But Bestuzhev found a friend in need in Mikhail Illarionovich Vorontsov, the empress's confidant, who shared his political <b>views.</b> <b>Still</b> his position <b>remained</b> most delicate, especially when the betrothal between the grand-duke Peter and Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst (afterwards Catherine II) took place against his will, and Elizabeth of Holstein, the mother of the bride, arrived to promote Prussian interests. Frederick II, conscious of the instability of his French ally, now keenly wished to contract an offensive alliance with Russia. The first step to realising this plan required the overthrow of Bestuzhev, [...] "upon whom," [...] Frederick II wrote to his minister Axel von Mardefeld, [...] "the fate of Prussia and my own house depends." [...] But Bestuzhev succeeded, at last, in convincing the empress of Chétardie's dangerous intrigues, and on 6 June 1744, Chétardie received orders to quit Russia within twenty-four hours. Five weeks later Bestuzhev became grand chancellor (15 July 1744). Before {{the end of the year}} Elizabeth of Holstein also was expelled from Russia, and Bestuzhev remained supreme.|$|R
