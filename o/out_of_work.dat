40|$|The introduction, in Italy, of new {{regulations}} concerning the carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> {{in the public}} works field, has given the building contractors the possibility to use of several subcontractors‘ help. In such a situation, the safety planning during the carrying <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>works</b> is a complex activity that requires redefinition and control activities {{that have to be}} constantly revised. With this object in view the new safety regulations delegate many responsibilities and fulfilments to the top management of the direct building contractors.

In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos. In Colima, all coconut plantations were blown down {{and thousands of people}} were left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> That state's economy was damaged enough that officials thought it would take years to recover.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} {{human rights and}} {{development}} groups published in 2008 stated that Gaza had suffered a long term pattern of economic stagnation and dire development indicators, the severity which was increased exponentially by the Israeli and Egyptian blockades. The report cited a number of economic indicators to illustrate the point: In 2008, 95% of Gaza's industrial operations were suspended {{due to lack of}} access inputs for production and export problems. In 2009, unemployment in Gaza was close to 40%. The private sector which generates 53% of all jobs in Gaza was devastated and businesses went bankrupt. In June 2005, 3,900 factories in Gaza employed 35,000 people, by December 2007, only 1,700 were still employed. The construction industry was paralyzed {{with tens of thousands of}} laborers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The agriculture sector was hard hit, affecting nearly 40,000 workers dependent on cash crops.|$|E

Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E

5|$|As {{popular as}} their {{cartoons}} were with 1960s audiences, they were disliked by artists. Television programs had lower budgets than theatrical animation, and this economic reality caused many animation studios {{to go out}} of business in the 1950s and 1960s, putting many people in the industry <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Hanna–Barbera was key in the development of limited animation, which allowed television animation to be more cost-effective, but also reduced quality. Hanna and Barbera had first experimented with these techniques {{in the early days of}} Tom and Jerry. To reduce the cost of each episode, shows often focused more on character dialogue than detailed animation. The number of drawings for a seven-minute cartoon decreased from 14,000 to nearly 2,000, and the company implemented innovative techniques such as rapid background changes to improve viewing. Reviewers criticized the change from vivid, detailed animation to repetitive movements by two-dimensional characters. Barbera once said that their choice was to adapt to the television budgets or change careers. The new style did not limit the success of their animated shows, enabling Hanna–Barbera to stay in business, providing employment to many who would otherwise have been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> Limited animation became the standard for television animation, and continues to be used today in television programs such as The Simpsons and South Park.|$|E

5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the Tribune shut down the magazine, and Benchley was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> again. When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} at the magazine.|$|E

There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, transport links are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E

He played youth football for Newport Boys' Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the rudiments of the game using a small bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced his thinking in later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs, on smaller pitches, so {{they would be more}} adept in control when progressing to a bigger football.|$|E
5|$|The American Red Cross ran out {{of funds}} while {{responding}} {{to the effects of}} Juan and the mid-Atlantic flooding, following the previous responses to hurricanes Elena and Gloria, as well as flooding in Puerto Rico; this prompted an emergency fundraising appeal. The agency had provided about $8million worth of assistance to families in southern Louisiana. Along the Apalachicola Bay, the series of hurricane strikes severely damaged the local oyster industry, leaving hundreds of oystermen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work.</b> The high waves caused by Juan prompted the United States Minerals Management Service to recommend increased inspections on older rigs and improve evacuation plans. Hurricane Juan was one in a series of hurricanes that struck Louisiana coast over many years that contributed to the loss of the coastal wetlands.|$|E

For three weeks, the NFL staged games with hastily assembled replacement teams, made up principally of players cut during training camp and players left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>work</b> from {{the closure of the}} United States Football League two years prior (along with, to a lesser extent, the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL, who had folded just three months prior to the strike).
