5|$|The {{death of}} Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster in 1899 was a pivotal {{point in the}} {{development}} of Mayfair, following which all redevelopment schemes not already in operation were cancelled. In the following years, Government budget proposals such as David Lloyd George's establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> in 1909, greatly reduced the power of the Lords. Land value fell around Mayfair, and some leases were not renewed.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> was by 1957 {{accepted by}} both major parties. Diefenbaker promised {{to expand the}} national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with}} the cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E

25|$|By the 1950s, it {{appeared}} that absolute poverty was a minor problem although pockets did remain, for example among the elderly, but {{it was believed that}} increased welfare benefits would soon eradicate this lingering poverty. The conquest of poverty was put down to an expanding economy as the 1950s were the years of the 'affluent society', to government policies of full employment, and to the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> It was widely believed that the operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> had redistributed wealth from rich to poor and significantly raised working class living standards.|$|E

25|$|Increased {{inequality}} {{is attributed}} to the disappearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> and differences between coastal and interior provinces, the latter being burdened by a larger state sector.

25|$|Drawing {{on ideas}} of Adam Smith, {{classical}} liberals {{believed that it}} is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> as interfering in a free market. Despite Smith’s resolute recognition of the importance and value of labor and of laborers, they selectively criticized labour's group rights being pursued at the expense of individual rights while accepting corporations' rights, which led to inequality of bargaining power.|$|E
25|$|In general, Chrétien {{supported}} Pierre Trudeau's {{ideals of}} official bilingualism and multiculturalism, but his government oversaw the erosion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> established, and built, under William Lyon Mackenzie King, Louis St. Laurent, Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau. His government advocated neo-liberal policies {{on a number}} of economic fronts, cutting transfer payments to the provinces and social programs, supporting globalization and free trade and implementing large personal and corporate tax cuts. However, in 1999 his government negotiated the Social Union Framework Agreement, which promoted common standards for social programs across Canada.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} perspective {{focuses on}} the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> as an institution that improves quality of life not only by increasing {{the extent to which}} basic human needs are met, but also by promoting greater control of one's life by limiting the degree to which individuals find themselves at the mercy of impersonal market forces that are indifferent to the fate of individuals. This is the argument suggested by the U.S. political scientist Benjamin Radcliff, who has presented a series of papers in peer reviewed scholarly journals demonstrating that a more generous welfare state contributes to higher levels of life satisfaction, and does so to rich and poor alike.|$|E
