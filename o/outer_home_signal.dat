2500|$|The {{warning signal}} {{is the most}} unusual of {{the three types of}} British {{permissive}} signal. It is, like the shunt-ahead, placed under the signal governing entry to the section ahead, but its function is very different. For a signalman to accept a train, both his block section and the line for a quarter mile inside his <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> must usually be clear; the quarter mile is a precaution in case the driver fails to stop in time for the <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b> However, it is possible to accept a train under the [...] "Warning Arrangement" [...] if the block section, but not the quarter-mile overlap, is clear. As its name implies, the signalman must stop and caution the driver of the train concerned, and the warning signal simply replaces the signalman's caution where this operation is frequent. Because there is no margin for braking error, the warning arrangement cannot usually be applied to passenger trains: its commonest use is to allow a goods train to run into a section to shunt a siding {{in the middle of that}} section, while a train is still occupying the station ahead.|$|E
2500|$|During violent {{thunderstorms}} on {{the evening}} of 19 June 2007 the railway suffered major damage, much more extensive than any in its history. The line was damaged between Bridgnorth <b>Outer</b> <b>Home</b> <b>signal</b> and Northwood Halt, where the line suffered from numerous landslides with many sections of the line suspended in mid-air.

50|$|The 7:10 {{was stopped}} at the Ballymacarrett station at the <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> of the {{interlocking}} at Ballymacarrett Junction, which was beyond the station. It was while stopped at this signal that the train was hit. The rear of the train was near The Oval football stadium.|$|E

50|$|An <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> protects {{a neutral}} long {{of a quarter}} of a mile (440yards/400m) clear of any points or sidings. This allows trains to {{approach}} when the station or junction is obstructed. It is noted that the junction in the Sunshine rail accident did not have <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recent {{applications}} in the UK have, in conjunction with advanced SPAD protection techniques, used TPWS with <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> that protect junctions with a higher than average risk by controlling the speed of an approaching train an extra signal section in rear of the junction. If this fails the resultant TPWS application of brakes will stop the train before the point of conflict is reached. This system {{is referred to as}} TPWS OS (Outer Signal).|$|R
50|$|On 11 May 1887 the 5.30 p.m. {{train from}} Flinders Street station to Balaclava {{came to a}} {{standstill}} just before Windsor station because the <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> was at danger. When the signal changed to proceed, the train would not move because the air brake hose pipe between the locomotive and the first carriage had broken, meaning that the brakes could not be released.|$|E

50|$|Advance {{warning of}} the turnout was {{provided}} by a colour light distant signal showing double yellow, an <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> showing green, and two inner homes side by side showing the divergent route. The inspector {{pointed out that the}} double yellow indication was ambiguous and evidently did not alert the driver to the approaching diversion, but it was unclear why he failed to notice the diverging route at the inner home. Low sun shining directly in his face would have made observation tiring, but the signals were still clearly visible. (Accident report).|$|E
50|$|Phase One of the Ropley re-signalling project, {{construction}} of the new signal box, has been completed. Phase Two {{is expected to be}} completed in 2012. Phase Two will include installation of working distant signals, in place of the existing fixed distant signals. The new signals will be motorised semaphore signals as they are too far from the signal box to be operated mechanically without considerable physical effort by the signalman. The scheme will also include installing Advanced Starting and <b>Outer</b> <b>Home</b> <b>signals</b> in both directions.|$|R
5000|$|At some locations, {{more than}} one <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> might be {{provided}} on the same line. These will be identified by names such as <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> and inner home, or first home, second home [...] etc.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{a signal}} box with an {{intermediate}} block section {{will have a}} <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> (and associated distant signal), starting signal and an intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> {{which has its own}} distant signal. The line from the starting signal to the intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> is called the intermediate block home section. The line from the intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> to the <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> of the next signal box on the same line in the same direction of travel is the absolute block section. To clear the intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> a [...] "line clear" [...] is required from the signal box in advance.|$|R
5000|$|When the GWR goods passed Button's 'clearing point' signal (the {{end of the}} section) at 5:13 am, it {{released}} the treadle and thus allowed the section from Berkeley road to Charfield to be cleared. He then shouted to Gilbert and Sutton of the goods train to shunt and 'pulled off' his shunting disc signal. At this time, nothing {{was out of the}} ordinary. It was less than an hour before dawn, and the railway tracks were shrouded with fog. Due to the fog, Button could not see his down distant signal or his down <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> (both were connected to electrical repeaters which showed the signal position via an instrument in his box), but he could see his 'fog object' and therefore saw no need to call out fogmen. The section from Berkeley Road to Charfield was clear, and therefore Button could accept the LMS night mail from Smith. He was perfectly justified in doing so, given that had {{a quarter of a mile}} clear between the clearing point signal and his <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> (the first [...] "stop" [...] signal controlled by Charfield box)- there was plenty of space for the mail to stop. The station, however, was occupied by the shunting goods train and therefore his signals stood at danger. He accepted the mail at 5:14 am.|$|E

50|$|The signals at Charfield {{should have}} been at danger, since the block system {{employed}} left no room for human error on the signalman's part. The <b>outer</b> <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> (which was at danger) at Charfield, was fitted with a track circuit. The GWR goods train was nearly clear {{of the line and}} the Westerleigh empty up goods train was approaching from Wickwar, when Button happened to notice the indicator for this track circuit. It changed to 'occupied', but then Button then saw to his alarm the indicator fly back to 'clear' again. This could mean only one thing: the mail had failed to stop at the signal. Having not heeded the distant signal which {{should have been}} at caution, Aldington and Want of the mail had assumed the line to be clear and had passed the home signal at around sixty miles an hour. To make matters worse Button had accepted the up goods train, which was approaching the road bridge. There was no error in Button's part in doing this, but it meant that the mail was running into a bottleneck - the track was in a cutting with a road bridge spanning both main lines, the sidings cutting off at the road bridge. Both main lines were blocked.|$|E
2500|$|The Ministry of Transport {{report on}} the {{collision}} was written by Lieut-Col GRS Wilson, {{a senior member of}} the Railway Inspectorate and published in June 1953. The local train should have been protected by two semaphore home signals; the Up Fast Inner Home about [...] to its rear, and the Up Fast <b>Outer</b> <b>Home</b> a further [...] back. A colour distant signal (the Up Fast Distant) would show green if the <b>Outer</b> <b>Home</b> was ‘clear’, or yellow if the <b>Outer</b> <b>Home</b> was at ‘danger’ and was positioned [...] before the Up Fast Outer home; this being the full braking distance for an express at , the speed limit for this section of track.|$|R
50|$|The Ministry of Transport {{report on}} the {{collision}} was written by Lieut-Col GRS Wilson, {{a senior member of}} the Railway Inspectorate and published in June 1953. The local train should have been protected by two semaphore home signals; the Up Fast Inner Home about 190 yd to its rear, and the Up Fast <b>Outer</b> <b>Home</b> a further 440 yd back. A colour distant signal (the Up Fast Distant) would show green if the <b>Outer</b> <b>Home</b> was at ‘clear’ or yellow if the <b>Outer</b> <b>Home</b> was at ‘danger’ and was set 1474 yd before the Up Fast Outer home; this being the full braking distance for an express at 75 mph, the speed limit for this section of track.|$|R
50|$|A <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> (場内信号機, jōnai shingōki) permits {{trains to}} enter the station. A <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> is {{absolute}} (絶対信号機, zettai shingōki); therefore, non-blocking operation is always prohibited. Some stations have multiple <b>home</b> <b>signals,</b> due to station layout. In these cases, each <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> has an identification number which is counted from {{the outside of the}} station. In high-traffic areas, some operators install <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> {{in the center of a}} platform track to divide the block section. Some operators treat such signals as block signals. In non-interlocking stations, there may be a No.0 block signal (in some operations, a No.1 block signal or home-signal equivalent block signal) which alternates with the <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{intermediate}} block section {{means that a}} train can approach the {{intermediate block}} <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> {{while there is a}} train between the intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> and the <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> of the next signal box on the same line in the same direction of travel. Generally, all intermediate block <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> and their respective distants are colour-light signals, normally showing two aspects.|$|R

50|$|A {{distant signal}} (遠方信号機, enpō shingōki) is {{installed}} before a <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> with limited visibility and {{is linked to}} the <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b> Distant signals are primarily installed in non-automatic block sections on single-track lines. They may have two (caution and clear) or three (caution, reduced-speed and clear) displays. With multiple <b>home</b> <b>signals,</b> the distant signal applies to all.|$|R
50|$|In some cases, mostly {{entering}} stations, <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> {{and distant}} signals {{can be found}} on the same mast; in this case the distant signal is linked to the next <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are no speed {{signals in}} Western Australia's freight system {{operated}} by Brookfield Rail (unsure about Pilbara) {{and they are}} either Approach, <b>Outer</b> <b>Home,</b> Home, Departure and Starting signals.|$|R
50|$|If {{a distant}} signal {{is close to}} a {{following}} <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> (i.e. when the distance between two consecutive <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> is equal to or lower than 1,500 meters, or a maximum of 2,000 meters in special cases), the two signals are combined into a single <b>signal</b> with a <b>home</b> function {{as well as a}} distant <b>signal</b> for the <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> immediately following. These are called coupled distant signals (avviso accopiato).|$|R
50|$|The level {{crossing}} {{was protected by}} up and down stop semaphore <b>signals.</b> The up <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> at the Causeway Crossing Halt carried a fish-tailed distant signal that worked in conjunction with Chanters Lane's (The Lane) crossing <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|In both systems, {{as is true}} {{elsewhere}} in the world, a distant signal tells the driver the aspect of the following <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> according to the block system. The driver must act accordingly {{to prepare for the}} situation at the <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b> Distant signals are always square while <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> are round (N) or elongated (L). Signals are always placed on the left except on tracks normally operated in both directions or where visibility requires a different position.|$|R
50|$|If {{the train}} slows down much earlier, it reaches, {{given the right}} timing, the distant signal just when the <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> {{switches}} to green. This way, the train {{does not need to}} stop. Thus, wear on the brakes is reduced and the train uses less energy. But the main reason, especially for trains that accelerate slowly, is that the train passes the <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> at high speed, compared to the conventional case where the train often has to accelerate from standstill. This effectively increases track capacity, because the time it takes for the train to run from the distant signal (that has just turned green) to the <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> is often much less than the time it takes for a train to accelerate from the <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R

50|$|Distant {{signals are}} placed ahead of <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> at a {{distance}} of 800, 1000 or 1200 meters to allow braking from the maximum speed allowed (except on high-speed lines, which have longer distances). They give the operator a warning {{in order to be able}} to observe the instructions of the following <b>home</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Integra-Signum {{asks the}} train driver to confirm distant signals that show stop and distant or <b>home</b> <b>signals</b> that show caution. If {{he does not}} confirm or passes a <b>home</b> <b>signal</b> that shows stop, the train is stopped automatically. This is {{achieved}} by interrupting the power supply to the motors and applying the emergency brake.|$|R
