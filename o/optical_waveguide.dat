40|$|In modern {{electronic}} circuitry, electrical interconnects {{have not}} {{kept pace with}} increasing electronic processing speed. Various drawbacks of electrical domain viz. bandwidth limitation, signal delay, electromagnetic wave phenomenon propelled the use of <b>optical</b> fibers. <b>Optical</b> <b>waveguides</b> provide a novel solution because {{of the absence of}} these phenomena in the optical domain. Various materials like polymers, III-V semiconductor compounds, LiNbO 3 etc. have been analyzed for fabricating <b>optical</b> <b>waveguides.</b> We have chosen silicon as a material for <b>optical</b> <b>waveguides.</b> Silicon is extensively used for complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) transistor fabrication. Thus, to use silicon for fabricating optical components is highly favorable from a technological standpoint. In this thesis, we characterize silicon <b>optical</b> <b>waveguides.</b> Loss in 10 µm wide hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) strip <b>optical</b> <b>waveguides</b> is estimated to be 1. 5 dB/cm and 0. 1 dB/cm in rib type silicon on insulator (SOI) <b>optical</b> <b>waveguides.</b> Reflectivity of Bragg mirror on a-Si:H strip waveguides is in the range 49 - 86 %. We measured 0. 5 - 1 dB loss per etched mirror section for fundamental transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) modes propagating in SOI rib waveguide. A setup to measure birefringence in <b>optical</b> <b>waveguides</b> is discussed and its results are analyzed. Ellipsometry of 260 nm thick layer of a-Si:H, deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), is done to ascertain the material refractive index.

25|$|In optical tweezers, a {{continuous}} evanescent field {{can be created}} when light is propagating through an <b>optical</b> <b>waveguide</b> (multiple total internal reflection). The resulting evanescent field has a directional sense and will propel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first pioneered by S. Kawata and T. Sugiura, in 1992, who showed that the field can be coupled to the particles in proximity {{on the order of}} 100 nanometers.|$|E
25|$|Optical fibers are {{connected}} to terminal equipment by optical fiber connectors. These connectors are usually of a standard type such as FC, SC, ST, LC, MTRJ, MPO or SMA. Optical fibers may be connected to each other by connectors or by splicing, that is, joining two fibers {{together to form a}} continuous <b>optical</b> <b>waveguide.</b> The generally accepted splicing method is arc fusion splicing, which melts the fiber ends together with an electric arc. For quicker fastening jobs, a “mechanical splice” is used.|$|E
25|$|Fiber with a core {{diameter}} less than about {{ten times the}} wavelength of the propagating light cannot be modeled using geometric optics. Instead, it must be analyzed as an electromagnetic structure, by solution of Maxwell's equations as reduced to the electromagnetic wave equation. The electromagnetic analysis may also be required to understand behaviors such as speckle that occur when coherent light propagates in multi-mode fiber. As an <b>optical</b> <b>waveguide,</b> the fiber supports one or more confined transverse modes by which light can propagate along the fiber. Fiber supporting only one mode is called single-mode or mono-mode fiber. The behavior of larger-core multi-mode fiber can also be modeled using the wave equation, which shows that such fiber supports more than one mode of propagation (hence the name). The results of such modeling of multi-mode fiber approximately agree with the predictions of geometric optics, if the fiber core {{is large enough to}} support more than a few modes.|$|E

2500|$|Dispersion {{occurs when}} {{different}} frequencies of light have different phase velocities, due either to material properties (material dispersion) {{or to the}} geometry of an <b>optical</b> <b>waveguide</b> (waveguide dispersion). The most familiar form of dispersion is a decrease in index of refraction with increasing wavelength, which is seen in most transparent materials. This is called [...] "normal dispersion". It occurs in all dielectric materials, in wavelength ranges where the material does not absorb light. In wavelength ranges where a medium has significant absorption, the index of refraction can increase with wavelength. This is called [...] "anomalous dispersion".|$|E
2500|$|As {{in other}} lasers, the gain region is {{surrounded}} with an optical cavity {{to form a}} laser. In the simplest form of laser diode, an <b>optical</b> <b>waveguide</b> is made on that crystal's surface, such that the light is confined to a relatively narrow line. The two ends of the crystal are cleaved to form perfectly smooth, parallel edges, forming a Fabry–Pérot resonator. Photons emitted into a mode of the waveguide will travel along the waveguide and be reflected several times from each end face before they exit. As a light wave passes through the cavity, it is amplified by stimulated emission, but light is also lost due to absorption and by incomplete reflection from the end facets. Finally, if there is more amplification than loss, the diode begins to [...] "lase".|$|E
