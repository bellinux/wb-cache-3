40|$|International audienceDuring the Sporadic E Experiment over Kyushu 2 (SEEK- 2) campaign, field-aligned {{irregularities}} (FAIs) {{associated with}} midlatitude sporadic-E (E s) layers were observed with two backscatter radars, the Lower Thermosphere Profiler Radar (LTPR) and the Frequency Agile Radar (FAR), which were located 40 km apart in Tanegashima, Japan. We conducted observations of FAI echoes from 31 July to 24 August 2002, and the radar data {{were used to}} determine launch timing of two sounding rockets on 3 August 2002. Our comparison of echoes obtained by the LTPR and the FAR revealed that echoes often appeared at the FAR about 10 min earlier than they did at the LTPR and were well correlated. This indicates that echoing regions drift with a southward velocity component that maintains the spatial shape. Interferometry observations that were conducted with the LTPR from 3 to 8 August 2002, revealed that the quasi-periodic (QP) striations in the Range-Time-Intensity (RTI) plots were due to the apparent motion of echoing regions across the radar beam including both main and side lobes. In most cases, the echo moved to the east-southeast at an almost constant altitude of 100 ? 110 km, which was along the locus <b>of</b> <b>perpendicularity</b> <b>of</b> the radar line-of-sight to the geomagnetic field line. We found that the QP pattern on the RTI plot reflects the horizontal structure and motion of the (E s layer, and that echoing regions seemed to be in one-dimensionally elongated shapes or in chains of patches. Neutral wind velocities from 75 to 105 km altitude were simultaneously derived with meteor echoes from the LTPR. This is the first time-continuous simultaneous observation FAIs and neutral wind with interferometry measurements. Assuming that the echoing regions were drifting with an ambient neutral wind, we found that the echoing region was aligned east-northeast-west-southwest in eight <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ten QP echo events during the SEEK- 2 campaign.

50|$|At {{intermediate}} latitudes {{the rotation}} of the Earth is observable in relation to the plane of the pendulum swing but the time to observe a full rotation depends on the latitude of the location. The time to observe a full rotation is equal to one day at the North Pole with the time increasing with decreasing latitude and not observable at the Equator (infinite length of time). The time increases because the central axis of the pendulum is aligned with the axis of rotation of the Earth at the North Pole and then the angle of misalignment increases as the latitude decreases to the point <b>of</b> <b>perpendicularity</b> at the Equator. The angular velocity in relation to {{the rotation of}} the Earth's axis that is imparted to the pendulum bob decreases with the cosine of the degree of misalignment of the central axis of the pendulum in comparison to the axis of rotation of the Earth.

40|$|AbstractSeveral error sources can {{contribute}} to the global tracking error of heliostats. These sources can be, for instance, angular offset in the reference position of the tracking mechanisms, imperfect leveling of the heliostat pedestal, lack <b>of</b> <b>perpendicularity</b> between the tracking axes, lack of precise clock synchronization. All these possible errors are characterized by angles that have very specific numerical values for each heliostat in a central receiver installation. However, they are intrinsically random in nature, and the errors in different heliostats are independent from each other. In principle, the overall drift behavior of the heliostats can be characterized by a statistical distribution of tracking errors. This global distribution characterizes the angular deviation of the heliostat normal and is used in ray tracing simulations of heliostat fields. It is usually assumed to be Gaussian, although some authors argue in favor of other types of distributions. In the present work, the dependence of the global tracking error distribution on the above mentioned primary error sources is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Random values are assumed for the different error parameters, and the resulting global tracking error distributions are evaluated for different times of the year for a heliostat field...|$|R

The three main problems studied are {{how to keep}} the camera pointing {{at the center of the}} target, how to move the satellite so the camera can look at the target from a perpendicular orientation or maintain a fixed orientation, and how to maintain a nominal distance from the target. Visual target tracking within the image uses a statistical pressure snake algorithm, which tracks the outer contour of a target and allows geometric moments to be calculated. The attitude control is based off of tracking the center of the visual target, which is the first moment. The attitude control can treat the inertial target angular velocities as disturbances in the control for slow, smooth reference motions and still be stable. The skewness coefficient g 3, which is a non-dimensional form of the third moment, can be used as a measure <b>of</b> <b>perpendicularity</b> when certain information is known about the target.

Its structuring is based on certain considerations related to broader multi-criteria analysis, but it proposes ways to overcome some of the shortcomings of the well-established MCA methods. A basic concept of the proposed method is that equality holds in entities weighting among evaluation criteria. It introduces the utilisation weighting, which measures each project's grade-performance in a criterion in relation to {{its position in the}} whole grade-performance. Furthermore, it accepts that simple criteria may be classified in a broader criterion, {{on the basis of their}} performances within this broader criterion, and thus a representation between the evaluation criteria and the vectorial space is introduced lifting the constraint <b>of</b> <b>perpendicularity.</b> The method is introducing also for each evaluation criterion its particular rendering from a physical scale to an artificial one, which depends on criterion features. Thus, for each evaluation criterion the critical points (upper and lower limits) of physical scale must correspond to the artificial scale. A last feature of the proposed method is the introduction of the time dimension in the criteria values over the whole evaluation period.
