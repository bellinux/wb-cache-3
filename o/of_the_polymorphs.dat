The body-centered cubic form of curium trioxide exists below temperatures of 800 °C, the monoclinic form between 800 °C and 1615 °C, and the hexagonal form above 1615 °C.|$|E

40|$|Crystal polymorphism, where a {{molecule}} forms several different crystal lattices, is common, and often {{needs to be}} controlled. For example, crystalline drugs must be manufactured as one specified polymorph, so polymorph purity {{is essential to the}} pharmaceutical industry. This thesis is a quantitative study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crystallization <b>of</b> glycine from aqueous solution, which focuses particularly on polymorphism. Crystallization is observed within a 96 -well microplate, where each well is filled with 0. 1 mL of supersaturated solution. We address <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> obtaining reproducible nucleation data. This problem is difficult because induction times are extremely sensitive to factors such as how the crystallizing system is prepared, and small variations in the supersaturation. The appropriate statistical tests needed to show reproducibility are discussed. Glycine has two common polymorphs, alpha and gamma, the competition between these polymorphs is studied. We obtain data at multiple NaCl concentrations. Addition of NaCl is known to favour nucleation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gamma <b>polymorph.</b> <b>The</b> <b>polymorph</b> <b>of</b> crystals are individually identified in-situ using Raman spectroscopy.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the effect of degree of supersaturation, σ, on the crystallization of specific polymorphs of phenylbutazone from its methanolic solution at 20 °C. At low initial supersaturation, σ ≤ 2. 0, the fraction of the metastable α polymorph in the crystallized product exceeds that of the δ polymorph, while at σ ≥ 5. 0, the fraction of the stable δ polymorph increases in the crystallized product. The results are explained by the effect of supersaturation on the relative rates of nucleation and crystal growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polymorphs.</b> Furthermore, the mechanism of nucleation and crystal growth also change with supersaturation. Supersaturated methanolic solutions of phenylbutazone exhibit a critical temperature at which the nucleation rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polymorphs</b> decrease drastically. This effect is partly explained by the decreased mobility of phenylbutazone molecules at lower temperatures. Nucleation is most rapid when the crystallization temperature {{is close to the}} transition temperature, Tt(α↔δ), between the polymorphs, α and δ.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} <b>the</b> crystal {{structures}} <b>of</b> two polymorphs of scyllo-inositol. Crystallization of this inositol initially failed {{to yield a}} single crystal suitable for structure solution, so a computational prediction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low-energy forms was performed in parallel with the crystallization experiments. When a single crystal was finally grown, its structure failed to explain the powder X-ray diffraction pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulk material, which seemed to show a mixture <b>of</b> <b>polymorphs.</b> With <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest-energy predicted crystal structure from a lattice energy search and the DASH program for structure solution from powder data, we propose <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>polymorph.</b> <b>The</b> combined use <b>of</b> single-crystal structure solution, structure solution from powder diffraction data, and a lattice energy search for possible structures, which was necessary for <b>the</b> elucidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>polymorph</b> <b>of</b> scyllo-inositol, demonstrates <b>the</b> synergy between experimental and computational studies of molecular organic materials...|$|R
