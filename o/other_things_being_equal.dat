After having faced, in a third chapter, two methodological, embarrassing questions for kaleckian models of growth and distribution (not very plausible and unstable for the most plausible ones), we use, in a fourth chapter, a second macroeconomic approach (stock-flow consistent model) where conflict impacts distribution (conflict inflation) and accumulation (growth/profit trade-off). We show that dividends distribution and share buybacks allow, within the limits permitted by indebtedness, for a stimulation of rentiers’ consumption and for the realisation of profitability claims, in spite of the slowdown of accumulation...|$|R

40|$|Groundwaters feeding travertine-depositing {{rivers of}} the northeastern {{segment of the}} Barkly karst (NW Queensland, Australia) are of {{comparable}} chemical composition, allowing a detailed investigation of how the rate of downstream chemical evolution varies from river to river. The discharge, pH, temperature, conductivity and major-ion concentrations of five rivers were determined by standard field and laboratory techniques. The results show that each river experiences similar patterns of downstream chemical evolution, with CO₂ outgassing driving the waters {{to high levels of}} calcite supersaturation, which in turn leads to widespread calcium carbonate deposition. However, {{the rate at which the}} waters evolve, measured as the loss of CaCO₃ per kilometre, varies from river to river, and depends primarily upon discharge at the time of sampling and stream gradient. For example, Louie Creek (Q = 0 · 11 m³ s⁻¹) and Carl Creek (Q = 0 · 50 m³ s⁻¹) have identical stream gradients, but the loss of CaCO₃ per kilometre for Louie Creek is twice that of Carl Creek. The Gregory River (Q = 3 · 07 m³ s⁻¹), O'Shanassy River (Q = 0 · 57 m³ s⁻¹) and Lawn Hill Creek (Q = 0 · 72 m³ s⁻¹) have very similar gradients, but the rate of hydrochemical evolution of the Gregory River is significantly less than either of the other two systems. The results have major implications for travertine deposition: the stream reach required for waters to evolve to critical levels of calcite supersaturation will, all <b>others</b> <b>things</b> <b>being</b> <b>equal,</b> increase with increasing discharge, and the length of reach over which travertine is deposited will also increase with increasing discharge. This implies that fossil travertine deposits preserved well downstream of modern deposition limits are likely to have been formed under higher discharge regimes. 22 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to provide an econometric test to the relative validity of collective and unitary household behavior models, with the help of data of the 1994 _ 95 Burkina Faso household survey. Obtained results seem to justify conclusions of noncooperative approach where the well_being of the group is partly function of the identity of the income earner, the African anthropological literature and what one observes commonly as for the functioning of households on this continent. On the one hand, the estimation of demand functions indicates that the share of wives income influences significantly, positively food expenses and energy, and negatively expenses to cigarettes, tobacco and moving household equipment. The analysis shows {{that there would be no}} variation in food household expense if total expenses fell by 2, 6 percent, with respect to the average provided this was accompagnied by re_allocating all incomes to wives. On the other hand, reduced nutrition equations suggest that, all <b>others</b> <b>things</b> <b>being</b> <b>equal,</b> more the share of woman income of household grows, more the probability of malnutrition - height-for-age, weight-for-age and weight-for-height- of children of less of 60 month decreases. Furthermore, while the geographical location, the education of mothers, the structure by age of children and the access to collective health services and education influence the nutrition of children, coefficients of the weight_for_age and the chronic malnutrition appear statistically different according to the gender, and suggest an differential effect to the advantage of boys inherent to the share of wives income. Although of considerations of equity and efficiency could justify this situation, the adherence to rules of the game of the traditional society institutions is probably an explanation more convincing than the foundation in pure rationality terms, even if the connection between the two has to be kept in mind. Results of the present researches have economic policy implications, to the extent of the modification of intra_household distribution of income is a means to increase food expenses, to reduce relative expenses to the tobacco and to raise the nutritional status of children - although, in this last case, boys are relatively more favored than girls. Similarly, the increase of women education and the extension of collective goods concerning health and education, notably in rural areas, constitute powerful factors susceptible to contribute to a best antrhopometric status ofchildren.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{real-time}} quantification of the hardness {{of a rock}} or similar material involves measurement of the temperature, {{as a function of}} time, of the tool bit of an ultrasonic/sonic drill corer (USDC) that is being used to drill into the material. The method is based on the idea that, <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>being</b> about <b>equal,</b> the rate of rise of temperature and the maximum temperature reached during drilling increase with the hardness of the drilled material. In this method, the temperature is measured by means of a thermocouple embedded in the USDC tool bit near the drilling tip. The hardness of the drilled material can then be determined through correlation of the temperature-rise-versus-time data with time-dependent temperature rises determined in finite-element simulations of, and/or experiments on, drilling at various known rates of advance or known power levels through materials of known hardness. The figure presents an example of empirical temperature-versus-time data for a particular 3. 6 -mm USDC bit, driven at an average power somewhat below 40 W, drilling through materials of various hardness levels. The temperature readings from within a USDC tool bit can also be used for purposes other than estimating the hardness of the drilled material. For example, they can be especially useful as feedback to control the driving power to prevent thermal damage to the drilled material, the drill bit, or both. In the case of drilling through ice, the temperature readings {{could be used as a}} guide to maintaining sufficient drive power to prevent jamming of the drill by preventing refreezing of melted ice in contact with the drill...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this work is to gain a general insight into the key mechanisms involved in the impact of nudging on the large scales and the small scales of a regional climate simulation. A "Big Brother experiment" (BBE) approach is used where a "reference atmosphere" is known, unlike when regional climate models are used in practice. The main {{focus is on the}} sensitivity to nudging time, but the BBE approach allows to go beyond a pure sensitivity study by providing a reference which model outputs try to approach, defining an optimal nudging time. Elaborating upon previous idealized studies, this work introduces key novel points. The BBE approach to optimal nudging is used with a realistic model, here the weather research and forecasting model over the European and Mediterranean regions. A winter simulation (1 December 1989 - 28 February 1990) and a summer simulation (1 June 1999 - 31 August 1999) with a 50 km horizontal mesh grid have been performed with initial and boundary conditions provided by the ERA-interim reanalysis of the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecast to produce the "reference atmosphere". The impacts of spectral and indiscriminate nudging are compared all <b>others</b> <b>things</b> <b>being</b> <b>equal</b> and as a function of nudging time. The impact of other numerical parameters, specifically the domain size and update frequency of the large-scale driving fields, on the sensitivity of the optimal nudging time is investigated. The nudged simulations are also compared to non-nudged simulations. Similarity between the reference and the simulations is evaluated for the surface temperature, surface wind and for rainfall, key variables for climate variability analysis and impact studies. These variables are located in the planetary boundary layer, which is not subject to nudging. Regarding the determination of a possible optimal nudging time, the conclusion is not the same for indiscriminate nudging (IN) and spectral nudging and depends on the update frequency of the driving large-scale fields ta. For IN, the optimal nudging time is around t = 3 h for almost all cases. For spectral nudging, the best results are for the smallest value of t used for the simulations (t = 1 h) for frequent update of the driving large-scale fields (3 and 6 h). The optimal nudging time is 3 for 12 h interval between two consecutive driving large-scale fields due to time sampling errors. In terms of resemblance to the reference fields, the differences between the simulations performed with IN and spectral nudging are small. A possible reason for this very similar performance is that nudging is active only above the planetary boundary layer where small-scale features are less energetic. As expected from previous studies, the impact of nudging is weaker for a smaller domain size. However the optimal nudging time itself is not sensitive to domain size. The proposed strategy ensures a dynamical consistency between the driving field and the simulated small-scale field but it does not ensure the best "observed" fine scale field because of the possible impact of incorrect driving large-scale field. This type of downscaling provides an upper bound on the skill possible for recent historical past and twenty-first century projections. The optimal nudging strategy with respect to dynamic downscaling could add skill whenever the parent global model has some level of skill. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
