5|$|As {{successful}} as Kansas' offense was, {{it was the}} Jayhawks' special teams (beating Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer at his <b>own</b> <b>game)</b> that earned them the victory. Kansas blocked one Virginia Tech field goal, and caused Tech kicker Jud Dunlevy to miss another short. Kansas punter Kyle Tucker {{did an excellent job}} pinning Virginia Tech deep in its own end of the field, kicking the ball five times for a total of 250yards, averaging 50yards a punt. His longest punt, a 62-yard kick, was one of three punts that were downed inside Tech's 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Corporate {{support for}} the Heritage Classic {{exceeded}} expectations; Chief Operating Officer John Collins announced that the league had gained more sponsorship revenue for Calgary's game than it had the Winter Classic. While the league would not commit to holding a third Heritage Classic, Collins admitted that nearly every team had expressed interest in holding their <b>own</b> <b>game</b> and that title sponsor Tim Hortons had signed a multi-year deal with the league.|$|E
5|$|First {{requiring}} manual installation, DayZ {{can now be}} downloaded, for free, from Steam. On August 7, 2012, Dean Hall {{announced on}} the game's development blog that the mod {{was going to be}} made into its <b>own</b> <b>game,</b> with Bohemia Interactive as the developer, and himself as the project leader. On October 29, 2012, development of the mod officially transferred to a largely community driven effort with the release of version 1.7.3.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to accessories {{such as the}} Power Base Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their <b>own</b> <b>game</b> libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format. The second is the Sega 32X, a 32-bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges {{and serves as a}} pass-through for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals' large AC adapters. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} founded by Swedish {{programmer}} Magnus Högdahl. Högdahl was {{a former member of}} the PC demoscene group Triton, and specialized in making tech demos. He decided to leave the company after his project, an action role-playing game named Into the Shadows, was cancelled. He then decided to found his own studio and began crafting his <b>own</b> <b>game</b> engine. He actively recruited staff among his acquaintances and the studio was officially established in 1998 in Härnösand, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Conker the Squirrel {{also had}} its <b>own</b> <b>game.</b> Originally named Conker's Quest, {{the title was}} renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64. However, the new title was criticised for being too family-friendly and too similar to Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the team renamed the game to Conker's Bad Fur Day and was re-revealed again in 2000. Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was {{intended}} for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure as the game was released {{at the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle and the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo.|$|E

Mashatu Game Lodge has the largest elephant population on private land.|$|R
5|$|Development {{continued}} {{with a more}} experimental ethos until the company began {{to run out of}} capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization that preceded the Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their <b>own</b> <b>game,</b> Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{announced}} in 2009, The Witness had a lengthy development period. Blow started {{work on the}} title in 2008 shortly after releasing Braid. The financial success of Braid allowed him to hire a larger production team without ceding control over the final product. In order to create the game's visual language, the team developed their <b>own</b> <b>game</b> engine and retained artists, architects, and landscape architects to design the structures on the island. This required a protracted development process, and the game's release was delayed from 2013 to 2016. Original plans for release on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were abandoned as the game engine became more demanding, and the team ultimately opted for an initial release on Windows and the PlayStation 4, with support for other platforms following.|$|E
5|$|Ralph and Vanellope build a kart, {{and they}} flee to Diet Cola Mountain, an {{unfinished}} race track. Learning that Vanellope cannot drive, Ralph helps teach her. King Candy hacks the game's code, obtaining Ralph's medal, which he offers {{to him in}} exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her glitches would {{be brought to the}} attention of players, their game would be unplugged and Vanellope would die, unable to leave the game because she is a glitch. A reluctant Ralph agrees, trashing Vanellope's kart. He returns to his <b>own</b> <b>game,</b> but notices Vanellope's image on the side of the Sugar Rush cabinet, and realizes she was meant to be a playable character.|$|E

5|$|Sonic 2 is {{believed}} to have been planned to have time travel aspects and was originally developed alongside Sonic CD as the same game, but Sonic CD eventually became its <b>own</b> <b>game</b> over time. A demonstration cartridge of Sonic 2 was stolen at a New York City toy show early in 1992, which was later attributed to a lack of security. The prototype ROM was rediscovered by a fan named Simon Wai on a Chinese website, and features playable sections of two cut levels from the final release of the game: Wood Zone and Hidden Palace Zone. Hidden Palace Zone was in the game from the start, but removed because of a lack of time and capacity.|$|E
5|$|The Nomad {{does not}} have its <b>own</b> <b>game</b> library, but instead plays Genesis games. At {{the time of its}} launch, the Nomad had over 500 games {{available}} for play. However, no pack-in title was included. The Nomad can boot unlicensed, homebrew, and bootleg games made for the Genesis. Some earlier third-party titles have compatibility issues when played on the Nomad, but can be successfully played {{through the use of a}} Game Genie. Likewise, due to its lack of compatibility with any of the Genesis' add-ons, it is unable to play any games for the Sega Master System, Sega CD, or Sega 32X. The Nomad employs two different regional lockout methods, physical and software, but methods have been found to bypass these.|$|E
5|$|With Blood Money, Jones was {{determined}} to utilise the full colour range of the Amiga, opting to use the blitter {{as opposed to the}} hardware scrolling; the blitter allowed graphics to be drawn quickly. Tony Smith, who had worked on Menace, produced the graphics for Blood Money, while Jones began work on a new scrolling system. While developing his <b>own</b> <b>game,</b> Talisman, Mike Dailly created a compact method to move enemies on-screen, which Jones incorporated into Blood Money. The game's animations fascinated Jones' friend Gary Timmons, who then began experimenting with Deluxe Paint; his work on the program led to his employment at DMA Design, and inspired some of the animations used in DMA's next game, Walker (1993). The game's introduction required a star field, which Jones took from a quick demonstration that Dailly had been working on.|$|E
50|$|The first Bloons {{game was}} {{developed}} by Stephen and Chris Harris, two brothers from New Zealand. Prior to working on Bloons, the pair had released Cash Sprint - a successful racing game that incorporated weekly prizes. After the success of Cash Sprint, they developed their own web portal for flash games, but failed to gain the necessary traffic. Instead they decided to focus on their <b>own</b> <b>games,</b> and launched a website - Ninjakiwi.com - with five of their <b>own</b> <b>games.</b> The site was a success, and this led to their work on Bloons.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays. The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing. Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his <b>own</b> <b>game</b> he was making for a much lower price.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scene}} of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A nerve agent filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his <b>own</b> <b>game,</b> simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E
5|$|The Witness {{uses its}} own engine {{developed}} by Blow and his team, which took {{a significant portion}} of the development time. Blow was insistent on using his <b>own</b> <b>game</b> engine instead of an existing solution such as Unity, as he would be able to fully control every element of a game engine that he created himself. As a compact game world compared to open-world games, the whole of the island of The Witness was treated as one zone, simplifying the gameplay and engine development. This presented a secondary challenge to the team as to concurrently work on the project, they needed to find a means to allow multiple developers to edit areas without resorting to using locking on their version control system as well as being able to work without being connected to a central server. Blow and his team developed an unconventional means of serializing the game world into text files that would have revision control while at the same time making it easy for individuals to discover conflicting edits. They also converted the 10,000-some entities in the game world into their own individual files for tracking to further reduce conflict between edits. Other features of this system including using defined control points for terrain elements to automatically recalculate seamless connections between them within the game's rendering engine, and a built-in world editor within the game engine to easily access existing serialized elements and create new ones.|$|E
