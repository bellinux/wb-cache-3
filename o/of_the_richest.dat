The VAT reform with consumption tax being endogenous increases capital accumulation and <b>the</b> utility <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> and <b>the</b> poor.

40|$|This paper explores how income {{distribution}} influences market structure and affects <b>the</b> economic well-being <b>of</b> different groups. It shows that inequality {{may be good}} for the poor via a trickle-down effect operating through entry. I consider a general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition with free entry, heterogenous firms and consumers that share identical but non-homothetic preferences. The general model is solved. <b>The</b> case <b>of</b> two types of consumers, rich and poor, is considered in detail. I show that higher income inequality in the economy can benefit the poor. An increase in personal income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> raises welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor, while an increase in <b>the</b> fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> has an ambiguous impact on <b>the</b> poor: welfare <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor has an inverted U shape as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, an increase in <b>the</b> personal income <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> together with a decrease in <b>the</b> fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich,</b> keeping <b>the</b> aggregate income in the economy fixed, raises <b>the</b> well-being <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor. I also analyze <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> changes in market size and entry cost. I show that <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> gain more from an increase in market size and lose more from an increase in <b>the</b> cost <b>of</b> entry than <b>the</b> poor. ...|$|R
