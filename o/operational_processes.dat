25|$|A {{comprehensive}} programme {{of organizational}} reform and culture change began in 2008 {{after the release}} of an Independent External Evaluation. Headquarters restructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more responsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of administrative and <b>operational</b> <b>processes</b> took place. Improved internal teamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT infrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO's decentralized offices now allows the Organization to respond quickly where needs are greatest. As FAO is primarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a top priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee rotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual performance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent office of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and strengthened oversight.|$|E

40|$|An {{accident}} model {{which is}} used to describe accident causation and evolvement is the foundation for system safety research. Most traditional accident models just research into accident causation, and can not effectively conduct hazard analysis. The traditional hazard analysis methods are incomplete and can not implement comprehensive hazard analysis of a dynamic <b>operational</b> <b>process.</b> To address this need, the concept of <b>operational</b> <b>process</b> hazard analysis (OPHA) is presented. Based on cybernetics, system safety {{can be viewed as a}} control problem. For the purpose of modeling accidents, the concepts of energy-flow and information-flow are redefined. Employing the concepts, this paper considers energy-flow and information-flow as the two components that control human-machine-environment within an <b>operational</b> <b>process.</b> The cause of accidents is treated as safety-critical energy-flow or information-flow failure in an <b>operational</b> <b>process.</b> As a result, a novel accident model named energy-flow and information-flow failure accident model (EIFM) is proposed. Relying on EIFM, OPHA can be carried out. The result shows that the factors that contribute to failures of normal safety-critical energy-flow or information-flow are also the ones that result in <b>operational</b> <b>process</b> hazards even accidents. EIFM-based OPHA extends the traditional hazard analysis methods, and can effectively prevent accidents as well as support accident investigation. ...|$|R

25|$|The city of New York now {{hoped that}} the profits from the {{remaining}} formerly privately operated routes would support the expensive and deficit-ridden IND lines and simultaneously be able to repay the systems' debts, without having to increase the original fare of five cents. But during World War II, which gave a reprieve to the closure of most rail transit in the US, some closures continued, including {{the remainder of the}} IRT Second Avenue Line in Manhattan (1942) and the surviving BMT elevated services over the Brooklyn Bridge (1944). The Second World War also caused renewed inflation, which finally forced an increase to ten cents in 1947 and six years later finally to 15 cents. Because the consolidation dragged in the first years after unification, some improvements in <b>operational</b> <b>processes</b> were rather slow, soon the question of organization was raised. The outsourcing of subway operations to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey were favored at one point. On June 15, 1953, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) was founded with the aim of ensuring a cost-covering and efficient operation in the subways.|$|E
