5|$|In November 2008, {{the mayor}} of London, Boris Johnson {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} tunnel beneath the street, allowing land to be released for development and green spaces. The traffic improvements and remodelling have diminished the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, since it became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>busiest</b> and noisiest roads in central London. In 2011, Johnson introduced spot fines for coaches idling on Park Lane.
