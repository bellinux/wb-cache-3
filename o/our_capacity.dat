2500|$|Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist {{who held}} that {{absolutely}} {{everything that happens}} occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being <b>our</b> <b>capacity</b> to know we are determined and to understand why we act as we do. By forming more [...] "adequate" [...] ideas {{about what we do}} and our emotions or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.|$|E
