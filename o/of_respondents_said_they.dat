25|$|In the 1980s {{electronic}} typewriters and later personal computers provided people in China and Japan {{an alternative to}} writing by hand.

Today, increased computer usage and the use of SMS text-messaging, especially among young people, means that a large portion of those people's everyday use of Chinese characters is done using input methods, not by hand.

25|$|In the United States and Canada, Trainwreck {{opened on}} July 17, 2015, {{the same day}} as the superhero film Ant-Man. Initial {{projections}} had the film opening to around $20 million, with The Hollywood Reporter noting that it could overperform if it takes off among females or underperform given how R-rated comedies have struggled over the summer, with both Ted 2 and Magic Mike XXL failing to meet expectations. It made $1.8 million on Thursday night showings, which began at 8 p.m. from 2,363 theaters, and $10.7 million on its opening day. Through its opening weekend, it grossed $30.1 million from 3,158 theaters, exceeding expectations. This was Apatow's second-biggest debut as a director (just behind the $30.7 million debut of Knocked Up) and the sixth-biggest debut for a film that he was involved in as a writer, director or producer. The film played 69% female with 66% over 25 years old, which is typical for an R-rated comedy.

25|$|According to the 2007 {{study by}} Memorial and Demos human rights organisations, Russian policemen lose their {{qualifications}} and professional skills during their duty tours in Chechnya. This conflict {{was linked to}} the rising brutality and general criminalisation of the Russian police forces. According to human rights activists and journalists, tens of thousands of police and security forces that have been to Chechnya learned patterns of brutality and impunity and brought them to their home regions, often returning with disciplinary and psychological problems. Reliable numbers on police brutality are hard to come by, but in a statement released in 2006, the internal affairs department of Russia's Interior Ministry said that the number of recorded crimes committed by police officers rose 46.8% in 2005. In one nationwide poll in 2005, 71% <b>of</b> <b>respondents</b> <b>said</b> <b>they</b> didn't trust their police at all; in another, 41% Russians said they lived in fear of police violence. According to Amnesty International, torture of detainees in Russia is now endemic.
