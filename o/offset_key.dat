40|$|Abstract Background Femoral offset {{influences}} the forces {{at the hip}} and the implant stresses after revision THR. For extended bone defects, these forces may cause considerable bending moments within the implant, possibly leading to implant failure. This study investigates the influences of femoral anteversion and offset on stresses in the Wagner SL revision stem implant under varying extents of bone defect conditions. Methods Wagner SL revision stems with standard (34 mm) and increased offset (44 mm) were virtually implanted in a model femur with bone defects of variable extent (Paprosky I to IIIb). Variations in surgical technique were simulated by implanting the stems each at 4 ° or 14 ° of anteversion. Muscle and joint contact forces were applied to the reconstruction and implant stresses were determined using finite element analyses. Results Whilst increasing the implant's offset by 10 mm led to increased implant stresses (16. 7 % in peak tensile stresses), altering anteversion played a lesser role (5 %). Generally, larger stresses were observed with reduced bone support: implant stresses increased {{by as much as}} 59 % for a type IIIb defect. With increased offset, the maximum tensile stress was 225 MPa. Conclusion Although increased stresses were observed within the stem with larger offset and increased anteversion, these findings indicate that restoration of <b>offset,</b> <b>key</b> to restoring joint function, is unlikely to result in excessive implant stresses under routine activities if appropriate fixation can be achieved. </p...|$|E

Thus, in the proposed medical system, high power, a long length MBOK code, and scheme providing significant error protection schemes are employed for the transmission of medical messages that require a stringent bit-error rate (BER).

40|$|The {{difference}} in labor supply across countries is often decomposed into hours worked per year per employed {{person and the}} fraction of persons employed. The difference between hours worked per employed person in Europe and the United States is {{due in large part}} to more weeks of vacation, more holidays, and more sick days in Europe than in the United States. However, sizable differences in labor supply remain after adjusting for hours per year per employed person. These differences are due to Europeans starting the working life later and, more importantly, retiring earlier. We develop a framework that incorporates this feature. In equilibrium what gets determined is how much people work over their lifetime, not when they work. As a result, policies intended to induce people to work a larger fraction of their lifetime, such as retirement systems that weight the last years of employment more heavily in determining benefits, only impact on when people work and not how much.

40|$|Abstract—We study a {{multichannel}} sampling scheme, where different channels observe scaled and shifted {{versions of a}} common bandlimited signal. The channel gains and offsets are unknown a priori, and each channel samples at sub-Nyquist rates. This setup appears in many practical signal processing applications, including time-interleaved ADC with timing skews, unsynchronized distributed sampling in sensor networks, and superresolution imaging. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to efficiently estimate the unknown channel gains and <b>offsets.</b> <b>Key</b> to our algorithm is a novel linearization technique, which converts a system of trigonometric polynomial equations of the unknown parameters to an overparameterized linear system. The computation steps of the proposed algorithm boil down to forming a fixed data matrix from the discrete-time Fourier transforms of the observed channel samples and computing the singular value decomposition of that matrix. Numerical simulations verify the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed algorithm {{in the presence of}} noise. In the high SNR regime (40 dB and above), the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms a previous method in the literature in terms of estimation accuracy, at the same time being three orders of magnitudes faster.

Based on the representations of OQPSK and MIL-STD SOQPSK as trellis-coded modulations, we investigate the potential coding gains achievable from the application of simple outer codes to form a concatenated coding structure with iterative decoding. For MIL-STD SOQPSK, we describe the optimum receiver corresponding to its trellis-coded modulation form and then propose a simplified receiver. The bit-error-rate (BER) performances of both receivers for uncoded and coded MIL-STD SOQPSK are simulated and compared to those of OQPSK and Feher-patented quadrature phase-shift keying (FQPSK).

40|$|Headline issue: There are now {{a number}} of {{different}} emissions trading systems in operation around the world and more planned. Linking these systems together would make economic sense, since larger markets mean more buyers with access to more low-cost abatement opportunities in different geographical locations. It would also be good news for companies threatened by the high compliance costs of multiple emissions trading schemes. However, linking systems faces a number of practical challenges, including whether it is possible to successfully link systems with differing levels of ambition or a significantly different permit prices, differences in sector coverage and differences in the eligibility of <b>offsets.</b> <b>Key</b> points: Linking emissions trading systems is a good idea with a number of potential economic and non-economic benefits. However, successful linkage is likely to be difficult to achieve in practice. Linking is only likely to be successful if schemes under undergo a ‘linking partner match selection process’ to assess in detail whether schemes are compatible in a number of key aspects, including their ambition/cap, the price of permits, sector coverage, and the eligibility of offsets. To facilitate future linkages the United Kingdom government should work with partners in Europe to reform the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as quickly as possible and actively engage with countries and regions that are developing emissions trading systems to ensure that the option to link with the EU ETS is not closed. The design of the future Chinese emissions trading system, though not public, is likely to be well advanced. It is unlikely that it has been designed to harmonise with the EU ETS to any great extent. The long-term challenges of linking Chinese emissions trading system and the EU ETS make an ongoing dialogue between the UK and China particularly important...|$|R
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract In patients managed with opioids for chronic pain, opioid-induced bowel dysfunction—specifically, opioid-induced constipation (OIC) —is a common side effect, {{which has a}} significant impact on quality of life (QoL). The most recent developments for management of OIC are opioid antagonists, including naloxone, a com-petitive antagonist of peripheral opioid receptors that reverses opioid-induced peripheral gastrointestinal (GI) effects. A prolonged-release formulation of naloxone is available in combination with oxycodone (OXN PR). To review the specific role of OXN PR in the management of chronic pain and OIC and its impact on QoL and healthcare costs, a review of available relevant literature was con-ducted. Healthcare costs can be up to ten times higher for patients with GI events than for those without. Assessment of QoL in patients with OIC is essential, and multiple tools for its evaluation are available. The Bowel Function Index (BFI), a tool that was specifically developed and validated to measure bowel function in patients with OIC, can be an indication of QoL. In patients with moderate-to-severe chronic pain, randomized trials have demonstrated that OXN PR has equal analgesic efficacy and safety, but results in improved bowel function, compared with prolonged-release oxycodone (Oxy PR) alone. In conclu-sion, randomized studies using the BFI, as well as real-world clinical practice observations, have demonstrated improved QoL for patients taking OXN PR. This combi-nation should allow more patients to benefit from the analgesic efficacy of opioid therapy and should minimize the side effects of constipation that correspond to improvements in QoL and healthcare <b>offsets.</b> <b>Key</b> Points Opioid induced constipation is a medical condition that causes a substantial burden to the patient and the healthcare system. In clinical studies, oxycodone/naloxone has been shown to improve bowel function and is estimated to be cost-effective according to health economic models. ...|$|R

The method is also applicable to other spectrally efficient offset quadrature modulations.

That method was introduced {{more than a decade}} ago by the author of the present method as a means of improving performance relative to a traditional (two-symbol observation) differential-detection scheme. Instead of symbol-by-symbol detection, both that method and the present one are based on a concept of maximum-likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE). As applied to the modulations in question, MLSE involves consideration of (1) all possible binary data sequences that could have been received during an observation time of some number, N, of symbol periods and (2) selection of the sequence that yields the best match to the noise-corrupted signal received during that time.

40|$|Reaction time to stimuli offset {{is usually}} longer than to stimuli onset (offset {{disadvantage}}). According to V. Di Lollo et al.
