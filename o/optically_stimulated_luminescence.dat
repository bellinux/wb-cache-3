40|$|The Dinggye area (Southern Tibet) {{contains}} numerous aeolian sediments, including {{modern and}} ancient aeolian sand deposition. In this study, we determined the chronological sequences of several profiles of Holocene paleo-aeolian deposits using <b>Optically</b> <b>Stimulate</b> <b>Luminescence</b> (OSL) and radiocarbon (Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) C- 14 and conventional C- 14) dating. Using the grain size, magnetic susceptibility, organic content and chrome {{characteristics of the}} deposits, we reconstructed the Holocene aeolian processes in the Dinggye area. The results from the paleo-aeolian depositional record indicate multiple changes in the intensity of aeolian activity and soil fixing with alternations between cool-dry and warm-humid climate conditions in the Dinggye area during the Holocene. From 12. 8 ka B. P. to the present, the climate has fluctuated frequently. From 12. 8 to 11. 6 ka B. P. and from 9. 3 to 4. 9 ka B. P., the climate was warm and humid with weak aeolian activity, and a sandy paleosol developed. The peak Holocene megathermal period and the main period of pedogenesis {{in the study area}} was from 6. 6 to 4. 9 ka B. P. Between 11. 6 and 9. 3 ka B. P. and since 2. 0 ka B. P., the sandlot expanded due to a cool, dry and windy climate; aeolian activity was strong and caused the development of moving dunes. The period between 4. 9 and 2. 0 ka B. P. was relatively cool and dry with slightly strengthened aeolian activity that developed stationary and semi-stationary dunes. In general, the Holocene events recorded by the paleo-aeolian deposits correspond well with those interpreted by other methods, such as records from ice-cores, lacustrine deposits and tree rings, but there are minor discrepancies between the methods.

Our morphologic interpretations recognize at least three generations of fans in the study area, all of which have been displaced along the left-lateral strike-slip Astaneh fault. Because of the dry, loose, and sometimes complex juxtaposition of the target sediments, we collected the samples in total darkness beneath dark plastic layers placed atop the pit openings. Luminescence ages of the fans are ~ 55 ka, ~ 32 ka and ~ 16 ka. These ages are concurrent with periods of loess deposition and wet climatic conditions previously recorded in the Arabia-Iranian region. They allow estimation of a horizontal slip rate of ~ 2 mm/yr along the Astaneh fault, which is consistent with additional slip rates determined for the Holocene period along faults further west of the Astaneh fault...|$|R

It is established that the material of the wafer and {{the ratio of the}} amorphous and γ phase in Al 2 O 3 layers affect the yields of OSL and TL. Annealing at up to 970 K results in an increase of γ-phase concentration and OSL and TL responses.

2500|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{scientific}} dating {{methods have}} been used to determine the ages of the Bradshaw paintings. The methods have included, Accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dating (AMS) and <b>Optically</b> <b>stimulated</b> <b>luminescence</b> (OSL). This was used when mud wasp nests have been built over paintings, and it gives a minimum age rather than an actual age of the painting. The results of this have revealed some inconsistency with Walsh's chronology. Experimental OSL dates from a wasp nest overlaying a tassel Bradshaw figure has given a Pleistocene date of 17,500±1,800 years BP. The academic community generally accepts 5,000 BP {{for the end of the}} artistic style. If the date ranges are correct, this may demonstrate that the Bradshaw tradition was produced for many millennia. Geoarchaeologist, Alan Watchman posits that the red paint used on a tasselled Bradshaw image near the Drysdale River is [...] "likely to be only about 3,000 years old." [...] Using the AMS results from accreted paint layers containing carbon associated with another figure, gives a date of 3,880 BP making Bradshaw art contemporaneous with, and no older than, Wanjina art. Around 15,000 years ago, the archaeological record shows that Aboriginals in the Kimberleys began using stone points in place of multi-barbed spears, but there is no record of this change of technology in the Bradshaw paintings.

Remains include an “Acheulian” limestone “hand-axe,” and small chert, limestone or quartzite artifacts, knapped on site, often by bipolar reduction or repetitive centripetal flaking of small discoidal cores. Secondarily-flaked (“retouched”) artifacts include small irregular chert fragments, resembling chert at an adjacent conglomerate outcrop according to laser-ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass-spectrometry of 19 lanthanide elements, though some chert may have been obtained from up to 30 km away.

Evidence of fire in a deep, sealed layer includes thermally-altered, lustreless and shattered chert, and both charred and white calcined fragments of bone.
