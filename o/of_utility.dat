This contract, valued at $337 million, was awarded to S3, a joint venture of Schiavone Construction, Skanska USA Civil, and J.F. Shea Construction. A ceremonial groundbreaking took place on April 12, 2007, at the 99th Street tunnel segment built in the 1970s.

5|$|The cookiecutter shark {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle. The shark first secures itself to the body surface of its prey by closing its spiracles and retracting its basihyal (tongue) to create pressure {{lower than that of}} the surroundings; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal. It then bites, using its narrow upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp lower teeth slice into the prey. Finally, the shark twists and rotates its body to complete a circular cut, quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of its prey. The action of the lower teeth may also be assisted by back-and-forth vibrations of the jaw, a mechanism akin to that of an electric carving knife. This shark's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also <b>of</b> <b>utility</b> in capturing smaller prey such as squid.|$|E
5|$|The three circulars list {{various types}} of cost or expense item (such as travel expense, {{maintenance}} expense, payroll salaries, lobbying costs, purchase of materials, payment <b>of</b> <b>utility</b> bills, etc.), and establishes whether each is either allowable or unallowable. Allowable costs are those the federal government determines permissible for federal assistance. Unallowable costs are those the government prohibits incurring for federal assistance. Certain cost items are considered universally unallowable, such as cost related to illegal activities and lobbying costs, but others may be considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient. As a general rule, any assistance used inappropriately, such as incurring unallowable costs, requires reimbursement to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle <b>of</b> <b>utility</b> has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain actions are right or wrong.|$|E
5|$|When resting, lion {{socialisation}} occurs {{through a}} number of behaviours, and the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking, which have been compared with grooming in primates. Head rubbing – nuzzling one's forehead, face and neck against another lion – appears to be a form of greeting, as it is seen often after an animal has been apart from others, or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females. Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked, which may have arisen out <b>of</b> <b>utility,</b> as a lion cannot lick these areas individually.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} NY252 in Henrietta between Marketplace Drive and Ridgeland Road was widened {{from four to}} six lanes {{as part of a}} multi-year, $15.6million project that began in mid-2009. Phase one of the five-phase project, {{completed}} {{during the second half of}} 2009, involved the relocation <b>of</b> <b>utility</b> poles and water mains. The next four phases involved the actual widening of the highway. During phase two, all traffic on Jefferson Road was routed along the eastbound lanes while the westbound half of the road was reconstructed and widened; this was reversed during phase three. A raised median between the two directions, which prohibited left-hand turns at all points except signalized intersections, was constructed during phase four, and phase five covered the finishing touches of the project. As part of the project, the intersection between Jefferson Road and East Henrietta Road (NY15A) was widened to have two dedicated left turn lanes in all four directions. Work on the last four phases began on March29, 2010, and was expected to be fully completed in November 2011. Construction did get completed in November 2011, but at the cost of $16.5million (2012USD) instead of the original $15.6million.|$|E

25|$|Depending {{on which}} theory <b>of</b> <b>utility</b> is used, the {{interpretation}} of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility {{as if it were}} quantifiable, that is, as if different levels <b>of</b> <b>utility</b> could be compared along a numerical scale. This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts <b>of</b> <b>utility</b> allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.|$|E
25|$|In his 1881 work , Francis Ysidro Edgeworth {{presented}} the indifference curve, deriving its properties from marginalist theory which assumed utility to be a differentiable function of quantified goods and services.

The second concept is how to specify the recording <b>of</b> <b>utilities</b> exposed during their installation or during maintenance/repair operations so that future records are reliable. It is used primarily during utility installation. It is fundamentally a traditional survey and documentation function. Combining these concepts will lead to a continual reduction in the risks created by underground utilities during future projects involving excavation of any kind.|$|R
