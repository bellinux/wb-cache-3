PURPOSE The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Form EIA- 821, “Annual Fuel Oil and Kerosene Sales Report, ” is used to collect annual data on the sales of distillate and residual fuel oils, kerosene, motor gasoline, and propane to various categories of energy users at the State level. The data are used by EIA and the Department of Energy (DOE) in determining petroleum product supply and demand changes. In addition, the data are used by Federal, State, and local agencies, Congress, industry analysts, trade publications, academia, and the public to analyze, model and forecast petroleum product sales by State and energy use category. 3. WHO MUST SUBMIT The Form EIA- 821 is mandatory pursuant to Section 13 (b) of the Federal Energy Administration Act of 1974 (Public Law 93 - 275) and must be completed by two categories of companies, those classified as certainty and a selected sample of noncertainty fuel <b>oil</b> <b>distributors.</b> Samples are drawn using information gathered by the EIA- 863, “Petroleum Product Sales Identification Survey. ” Companies classified as certainty are: all refiners and gas plant operators; companies doing business in four or more States; companies accounting for 5 {{percent or more of the}} distillate or residual fuel oil volume for any target variable or particular energy use category sold in a State; companies accounting for 5 percent or more of the kerosene volume sold in a State in an earlier EIA- 821 survey; and augmented frame units for which no attribute data were available.

50|$|Other {{signs of}} the Morris origins of the design were the {{crankcase}} being cast with strengthening ribs (a feature not introduced to the A-Series until 1980) and the big end bearings being split diagonally rather than horizontally. The C-Series also had a hydraulic tensioning unit for its timing chain and had the <b>oil</b> pump and <b>distributor</b> driven via separate sets of skew-cut gears on the camshaft. This was relatively unusual for mass-produced engines of the time; the A- and B-Series engines, and most of their contemporaries, had both <b>oil</b> pump and <b>distributor</b> driven by one shaft driven from one skew gear. The C-Series' arrangement reduced load on the gears and therefore wear, preventing the ignition timing falling out of specification over time.|$|R
