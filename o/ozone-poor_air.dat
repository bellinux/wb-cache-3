40|$|International audienceIn late May 2005 unusual {{high levels}} of solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation were observed over central Europe. In Northern Germany the measured irradiance of erythemally effective radiation exceeded the climatological mean by more than about 20 %. An extreme low ozone event for the season coincided with high solar elevation angles and high pressure induced clear sky conditions leading to the highest value of erythemal UV-radiation ever observed over this location in May since 1994. This hereafter called "ozone mini-hole" was caused by an elevation of tropopause height accompanied with a poleward advection of <b>ozone-poor</b> <b>air</b> from the tropics.

40|$|Total {{column and}} stratospheric ozone levels at {{mid-latitudes}} often reveal strong fluctuations on time scales of days caused by dynamic processes. In {{some cases the}} total ozone column is distinctly reduced below climatological values. Here, a very low total ozone episode around 19 January 2006 over Western Europe is investigated when the observed total ozone column over Uccle (BE), measured by a Brewer spectrophotometer, reached a daily minimum of 200 DU, the lowest recorded value at this station. In order to investigate the mechanisms leading to the ozone minimum, the present study used data from (i) six ozone sounding stations in Western and Middle Europe, (ii) ECMWF meteorological fields, (iii) a simulation of the CLaMS model for January 2006, (iv) a multi-year run of the chemistry transport model KASIMA, and (v) a six-year run of the climate chemistry model ECHAM 5 /MESSy 1. The ozone decrease at different heights was quantified and it was determined to what extent different transport mechanisms, and instantaneous, in-situ chemical ozone depletion contributed to the event. All three models reproduced the evolution and formation of the event. The ozone column decrease between &Theta;= 300 and 750 K was strongest at Uccle (BE) and De Bilt (NL) with 108 and 103 DU, respectively, and somewhat lower at Hohenpeissenberg (DE), Payerne (CH), Prague (CZ) and Lerwick (UK) with 85, 84, 83 and 74 DU, respectively. This analysis demonstrated that mainly the displacement of the ozone depleted polar vortex contributed to the ozone column decrease. Advection of <b>ozone-poor</b> low-latitude <b>air</b> masses was important in the UTLS region. The vertical displacement of isentropes connected with divergence of {{air out of the}} column was found to be of minor importance compared to the horizontal transport processes.

40|$|Estimates of {{the ozone}} layer future {{evolution}} must consider both climate dependencies and interannual variability. These considerations imply analyses of transient-scenario realisations with chemistry-climate models (CCM) under realistic boundary conditions. In this context, investigations of ozone variability usually involve multiple regression analysis (MRA), a statistically efficient albeit complicated tool. However, a careful use of advanced regression approaches may improve the variability assessment considerably. The present study addresses climate dependencies in ozone transport, and adopts an advanced regression approach to both quantify deterministic ozone variability and trace it back to the scenario boundary conditions; the investigations refer to transient output of the CCM E 39 /C. Recent observations show a cooling of the tropical lower stratosphere, and CCMs suggest a spatial coincidence of the cooling with a stronger upward advection of <b>ozone-poor</b> tropospheric <b>air.</b> This advection increase appears to result from a currently unexplained strengthening of the planetary-wave driven mean meridional transport, arguably relating to the anthropogenic climate signal. The present study explores the strengthening by comparing realisations of two different scenarios. Both share the same boundary conditions including concentrations of ozone-depleting substances (ODS), but differ in their climate forcing via sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations (GHG). In the summer hemisphere tropics, higher SSTs for the warmer scenario amplify deep convection and hence the convective excitation of internal planetary waves. These waves travel upward through easterly winds while dissipating, but still carry enough of the signal into the lower stratosphere to intensify the mean meridional transport. The transport change in turn strengthens the input rate into the tropical lower stratosphere of <b>ozone-poor</b> tropospheric <b>air,</b> ultimately weakening lower-stratospheric ozone concentrations via higher tropical SSTs. The ozone variability assessment relates to monthly-mean total columns from three independent realisations of a 60 -year transient scenario with realistic boundary conditions. It focuses on three latitudinal bands: southern/northern midlatitudes (SH/NH) and tropics. Common ozone MRAs are linear and iterate to account for auto-regression-induced nonlinearity. The present MRA is nonlinear and the first to demonstrate the validity of such iterations with respect to the least-squares surface: it detects only a weak distortion of the surface associated with autocorrelation, at least for the ozone time series examined. Also, the present MRA is among the few to demonstrate sufficient compliance with the regression requirements, particularly with that of independent residuals. Additionally, the new approach of response confidence bands permits a correct attribution of individual anomalies to the scenario boundary conditions. As a consequence, the present MRA is the first to explain the year 1985 SH low-ozone event, here reproduced by E 39 /C. The MRA further captures, e. g., a similar anomaly for the year 1997, and verifies the total-ozone response to stratospheric-transport modulating boundary conditions: tropical-SST anomalies (ENSO) affect the tropics and NH, but not the SH; or, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) causes a seasonally synchronised ozone response at SH and more weakly at NH, but not in the tropics. While these features have already been reported for E 39 /C data, the present study establishes a firm statistical framework and discusses the physical background. Other responses refer to the 11 -year solar cycle (SSC), to sulfate aerosols, and to ODS concentrations. The present nonlinear regression approach provides ample potential for further development. For instance, nonlinear deterministic regression terms may examine the existence of interactions between the NH ENSO response with long-term changes in the probability for northern polar heterogenous ozone depletion. Last, accounting for moving-average regression parameters may improve the compliance with the inference requirements even further. In conclusion, the E 39 /C boundary conditions modulate the ozone layer as well as stratospheric mean meridional mass transport on long and short time scales. In this respect, the most important result is the universal significance of tropical SSTs controlling stratospheric transport by governing the deep-convective production of internal and, probably, external planetary waves. An important future research task is whether increasing tropical SSTs can cause ENSO-like changes in wintertime mid- and polar-latitude stratospheric planetary-wave activity; such changes could disturb the northern polar vortex against the effect of radiatively induced stabilisation by higher GHG concentrations. E 39 /C and other CCMS have certain weaknesses, one of which is an unrealistically consistent QBO-related modulation of the northern polar vortex. Keeping these weaknesses in mind, MRA may represent a helpful tool as it improves the statistical efficiency...|$|R

The observations are consistent with analyses of potential vorticity from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, which show smaller radial gradients at 380 K than at 450 K potential temperature. Ozone loss in the chemically perturbed region above 415 K averages 5 ppbv per day for mid-September to mid-October. Apparent ozone loss rates in the sub-vortex region are greater, at 7 ppbv per day. The data support, therefore, the existence of a sub-vortex region in which meridional transport is more efficient than in the vortex above.

The {{results indicate that the}} total column ozone low (TOL) over the TP during winter and spring is deepening over the recent decade, which is opposite to the recovery signal in annual mean TCO over the TP after mid- 1990 s. The TOL intensity is increasing at a rate of 1. 4 DU/decade and the TOL area is extending with 50, 000 km 2 /decade during winter for the period 1979 â 2009. The enhanced transport of <b>ozone-poor</b> <b>air</b> into the stratosphere and elevated tropopause due to the rapid and significant warming over the TP during winter reduce ozone concentrations in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere and hence lead to the deepening of the TOL.

The chemical initialization of the simulation is based on Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE) measurements. Because of its Lagrangian nature, CLaMS is well suited for simulating the small-scale filaments that evolve during this period. Filaments of vortex origin in the midlatitudes were observed by HALOE several times in October 2002. The results of the simulation agree well with these HALOE observations. The simulation further indicates a very rapid chlorine deactivation that is triggered by the warming associated with the split of the vortex. Correspondingly, the ozone depletion rates in the polar vortex parts rapidly decrease to zero.

Compared with the mean profile during the dry season at Watukosek, Indonesia (7. 5 S, 112. 6 E), this mid-tropospheric maximum is larger, and a sharp increase of ozone below the tropopause begins at a lower altitude for the Shoyo-Maru pro fi le. We frequently observed layers in which ozone and humidity are highly anti-correlated. These layers have vertical scales from several kilometers to several hundred meters. Horizontal scales of these layers are roughly 1000 km, which may correspond to time scales of about 2 days, since the vessel sailed about 500 km/day. These layers are related to northerly winds, which bring in wet and <b>ozone-poor</b> <b>air</b> from the inter-tropical convergence zone situated in the northern side of the main cruise track. Similar layers were observed in ozone pro fi les at San Cristo Ì bal and Watukosek, mostly during the dry season, suggesting the existence of layers advected without vertical mixing...|$|E
40|$|We have {{determined}} the vertical distribution of chlorine monoxide (ClO), from measurements of pressure-broadened molecular-emission spectra made over Thule, Greenland, during the 1993 Arctic spring. The measurements show a weak lower stratospheric layer of chlorine monoxide inside the vortex in late February, which was, however, significantly greater in mixing ratio than that seen in observations we {{made in the}} spring of 1992. ClO was also observed in much smaller quantities in early to mid-March 1993 when Thule was outside the vortex. The amount of ClO within the vortex was severely reduced by the time it returned over Thule in late March. This reduction occurred several weeks earlier relative to the winter solstice than the decline of ClO inside the Antarctic vortex in 1993. The enhanced Arctic lower stratospheric layer seen in late February 1993 at a nearly equivalent photochemical period, and beyond. We have calculated daily ozone loss rates, due primarily to the dimer chlorine catalytic cycle, from both sets of measurements. The vertical integral of the Arctic daily percentage ozone loss when the largest ClO levels were present, at the end of February, is found to be approximately one quarter of that in the Antarctic at a photochemical period only 1 week later. The relative weakness of daily ozone depletion, combined with the early disappearance of ClO in the Arctic, suggests that hemispheric dilution by <b>ozone-poor</b> <b>air</b> from within the Arctic vortex is unlikely to be sufficient to explain the historically extreme loss of midlatitude northern hemisphere ozone which began in 1992 and persisted throughout 1993...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{lifetime of}} N 2 O is about 150 years, {{which makes it}} an excellent dynamical tracer of air motion on the time scale of the ozone depletion event. For these reasons it was chosen to help test whether dynamical theories of ozone loss over Antarctica were plausible, particularly the theory that upwelling <b>ozone-poor</b> <b>air</b> from the troposphere was replacing ozone-rich stratospheric air. The N 2 O measurements were made with the Airborne Tunable Laser Absorption Spectrometer (ATLAS) aboard the NASA ER- 2 aircraft. The detection technique involves measuring the diffential absorption of the IR laser radiation as it is rapidly scanned over an N 2 O absorption feature. For the AAOE mission, the instrument was capable of making measurements with a 1 ppb sensitivity, 1 second response time, over an altitude range of 10 to 20 kilometers. The AAOE mission consisted {{of a series of}} 12 flights from Punta Arenas (53 S) into the polar vortex (approximately 72 S) at which time a vertical profile from 65 to 45 km and back was performed. Comparison of the observed profiles inside the vortex with N 2 O profiles obtained by balloon flights during the austral summer showed that an overall subsidence had occurred during the winter of about 5 to 6 km. Also, {{over the course of the}} mission (mid-August to late September), no trend in the N 2 O vertical profile, either upward or downward, was discernible, eliminating the possibility that upwelling was the cause of the observed ozone decrease...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} series of {{ozonesonde}} profiles measured from Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, during FebruaryÂ  2014, with new insights on the calibration of ozonesondes for measurements in the tropical troposphere. The experiment formed {{a part of a}} wider airborne campaign involving three aircraft based in Guam, to characterise the atmospheric composition above the tropical West Pacific in unprecedented detail. Thirty-nine ozonesondes were launched between 2 and 25 Â February of which 34 gave good ozone profiles. Particular attention was paid to evaluating the background current of the ozonesondes, as this can amount to half the measured signal in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL). An unexpected contamination event affected the measurements and required a departure from standard operating procedures for the ozonesondes. The most significant departure was not exposing the sondes to ozone during preparation, which meant that the background current remained stable before launch. Comparison with aircraft measurements allows validation of the measured ozone profiles and confirms that for well-characterized sondes (background current â¼[*]â¯ 50 â¯nA) a constant background current could be assumed throughout the profile, equal to the minimum value measured during preparation just before launch.

40|$|An {{idealized}} vertical-meridional zonally symmetrical {{version of}} the MÃ©so-NH model is used to study the response of tropospheric ozone to {{the dynamics of the}} West African monsoon, as well as surface emissions and NOx-production by lightning (LNOx). An O 3 -NOx-VOC chemical scheme has been added to the dynamical model, including surface emissions and a parameterization of the LNOx production. The model shows that the ozone precursors emitted at the surface are uplifted by deep convection and then advected in the upper branches of the Hadley cells {{on both sides of the}} Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The NOx produced by lightning promotes chemical ozone production in the middle and upper troposphere from the oxidation of CO and VOCs. The analysis of the convective and chemical tendencies shows that the ozone minimum at the ITCZ is induced by venting of <b>ozone-poor</b> <b>air</b> masses into the upper troposphere. The bi-dimensional model suffers from limitations due to the absence of exchange with the higher latitudes and ventilation in the zonal direction. Despite of these restrictions, sensitivity simulations show that the LNOx source and biogenic VOCs are necessary to create the meridional gradient of ozone observed by the Measurements of OZone and water vapor by in-service AIrbus airCraft (MOZAIC) aircrafts in the southern Hadley cell. The LNOx source is also required to maintain the meridional ozone gradient up to 24 Â°N in the northern Hadley cell. The modeled meridional gradient of O 3 in the upper troposphere ranges from 0. 22 to 0. 52 ppbv/deg without the LNOx source and from 0. 60 to 1. 08 ppbv/deg with the LNOx source, in the southern and the northern cells respectively...|$|E
