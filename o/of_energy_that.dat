5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12. The high pH is interpreted to be {{a consequence of}} serpentinization of chondritic rock {{that leads to the}} generation of H2, a geochemical source <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus's plumes.|$|E
5|$|At the 1932 occasion, Tesla {{claimed he}} had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays. In 1933, at age 77, Tesla told reporters that, after thirty-five years of work, {{he was on the}} verge of {{producing}} proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> was “violently opposed” to Einsteinian physics, and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat is a form <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on {{the temperature of the}} external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E

5|$|The {{total amount}} <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> a star can {{generate}} through nuclear fusion of hydrogen {{is limited by}} the amount of hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core. For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to first approximation, as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.|$|E
5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations may {{go into a}} torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day and}} feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between traveling and eating. Using torpor, bats can save around 90% <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to feed. It also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use torpor.|$|E

5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, {{meaning that}} it is small, emits reddish light, and has a {{relatively}} low temperature for a star. The star is 0.45 times the mass of and 0.43 times the radius of the Sun. Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, {{meaning that it}} radiates about 2% of the amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light years) away from Earth, a relatively close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial {{analysis of the data}} suggests that a secondary body of an unknown nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's.|$|E
5|$|Natural gas {{was first}} found in Indiana in 1876 {{but it was}} not until 1886 that the {{magnitude}} of the discovery was known; the Trenton Gas Field was the largest deposit of natural gas discovered in the 19th century and the first giant oil reserve found in the United States. As a professor at a university in the Trenton Field, Haynes offered his services to the drillers and worked to analyze soil samples, determine well pressure, and give estimates on the amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> could be created by the gas. He delivered several lectures to large crowds about the importance of the gas discovery and the many possible applications of this new source of fuel. He began a petition to have the local citizens create a corporation to pump the fuel from the ground and pipe it to area homes and businesses. His promotion was successful and Portland Natural Gas and Oil Company was formed; Haynes' father was named to the new company's board of directors.|$|E

5|$|The factor {{limiting}} {{this process}} is the amount <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> is released through fusion, which {{is dependent on the}} binding energy that holds together these atomic nuclei. Each additional step produces progressively heavier nuclei, which release progressively less energy when fusing. In addition, from carbon-burning onwards, energy loss via neutrino production becomes significant, leading to a higher rate of reaction than would otherwise take place. This continues until nickel-56 is produced, which decays radioactively into cobalt-56 and then iron-56 {{over the course of a}} few months. As iron and nickel have the highest binding energy per nucleon of all the elements, energy cannot be produced at the core by fusion, and a nickel-iron core grows. This core is under huge gravitational pressure. As there is no fusion to further raise the star's temperature to support it against collapse, it is supported only by degeneracy pressure of electrons. In this state, matter is so dense that further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states. However, this is forbidden for identical fermion particles, such as the electron – a phenomenon called the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
5|$|Using {{the device}} he created earlier, Doom betrays Hager and steals the board from the compound, killing {{most of the}} Army {{personnel}} there. The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer and pursue Doom in the Fantasticar, confronting him in Shanghai. During the battle, Sue is severely wounded. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the entire team in order to battle the now cosmic energy-empowered Doom. Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom's control over the Surfer's board, and Ben Grimm uses a nearby crane to knock Doom into the harbor. However, Galactus arrives and Sue appears to die in Reed's arms. The Surfer regains control of his board, restoring his power. He revives Sue and chooses to defend Earth, flying, with an extra boost from Johnny, into Galactus. The conflict results in a massive blast <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> engulfs Galactus, and apparently kills the Surfer as well. Johnny recovers his stable molecular state after touching the Surfer's board.|$|E

Gross primary production is a measure <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> a photoautotroph harvests from the sun. Take, for example, a blade of grass that takes in x Joules <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> from the sun. The fraction <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> is converted into glucose reflects the gross productivity of the blade <b>of</b> grass. The <b>energy</b> remaining after respiration is considered the net primary production. In general, gross production refers to the energy contained within an organism before respiration and net production the energy after respiration. The terms can be used to describe energy transfer in both autotrophs and heterotrophs.|$|R
