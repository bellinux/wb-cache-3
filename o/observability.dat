5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area {{from the perspective of}} a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar <b>observability.</b> Furthermore, the F-22's stealth contouring and radar absorbent materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's claim of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|<b>Observability</b> is {{a measure}} for how well {{internal}} states of a system can be inferred by knowledge of its external outputs. The <b>observability</b> and controllability of a system are mathematical duals (i.e., as controllability provides that an input is available that brings any initial state to any desired final state, <b>observability</b> provides that knowing an output trajectory provides enough information to predict the initial state of the system).|$|E
25|$|Controllability and <b>observability</b> are main {{issues in}} the {{analysis}} of a system before deciding the best control strategy to be applied, or whether it is even possible to control or stabilize the system. Controllability is related to the possibility of forcing the system into a particular state by using an appropriate control signal. If a state is not controllable, then no signal {{will ever be able to}} control the state. If a state is not controllable, but its dynamics are stable, then the state is termed stabilizable. <b>Observability</b> instead is related to the possibility of observing, through output measurements, the state of a system. If a state is not observable, the controller will never be able to determine the behavior of an unobservable state and hence cannot use it to stabilize the system. However, similar to the stabilizability condition above, if a state cannot be observed it might still be detectable.|$|E
25|$|J-11D – Variant with fixed {{electronically}} scanned array radar, IRST, and {{capability to}} fire heavier imaging/infrared (IIR) air-to-air missiles. The airframe makes {{greater use of}} composite materials, especially in the engine intakes for lower radar <b>observability.</b> The wings have three hardpoints each. Unconfirmed reports claim it has a new fly-by-wire control system, glass cockpit, improved EW systems, and an improved version of the WS-10A engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{manufacturers}} have carried out {{tests on the}} early Eurofighter prototypes to optimise the low <b>observability</b> characteristics of the aircraft from the early 1990s. Testing at BAE's Warton facility on the DA4 prototype measured the RCS of the aircraft and investigated {{the effects of a}} variety of RAM coatings and composites. Another measure to reduce the likelihood of discovery is the use of passive sensors, which minimises the radiation of treacherous electronic emissions. While canards generally have poor stealth characteristics, the flight control system is designed to maintain the elevon trim and canards at an angle at which they have the smallest RCS.|$|E
25|$|The Su-57's design {{emphasizes}} frontal stealth, with RCS-reducing features {{most apparent}} in the forward hemisphere; the shaping of the aft fuselage is much less optimized for radar stealth compared to the F-22. The combined effect of airframe shape and RAM of the production aircraft is estimated to have reduced the aircraft's RCS to a value thirty times smaller {{than that of the}} Su-27. Sukhoi's patent of the Su-57's stealth features cites an average RCS of the aircraft of approximately 0.1-1 square meters. However, like other stealth fighters, the Su-57's low <b>observability</b> measures are chiefly effective against high frequency (between 3 and 30 GHz) radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars, employed by weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the Su-57 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also large, susceptible to clutter, and are less precise.|$|E
500|$|Belevitch {{played a}} part in {{developing}} a mathematical test for determining the controllability of linear control systems. [...] A system is controllable if it can be moved from one state to another through the system state space in a finite time by application of control inputs. [...] This test is known as the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus, or PBH, test. [...] There is also a PBH test for determining the <b>observability</b> of a system – that is, the ability to determine the state of a system in finite time solely from the system's own outputs.Kisačanin and Agarwal, pp.50-58 ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1995 {{change-over}} from 48 to 64-bit {{required that}} all programs be 'observable', i.e. that the debugging information {{had not been}} stripped out of the compiled code.

2500|$|The {{limit of}} <b>observability</b> in our {{universe}} is set {{by a set}} of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the Universe. The most famous horizon is the particle horizon which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite age of the Universe. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the expansion of space), an [...] "optical horizon" [...] at the surface of last scattering, and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for neutrinos and gravitational waves.|$|E
2500|$|The B-2 Spirit was {{developed}} {{to take over the}} USAF's vital penetration missions, able to travel deep into enemy territory to deploy their ordnance, which could include nuclear weapons. The B-2 is a flying wing aircraft, meaning it has no fuselage or tail. [...] The blending of low-observable technologies with high aerodynamic efficiency and large payload gives the B-2 significant advantages over previous bombers. Low <b>observability</b> provides a greater freedom of action at high altitudes, thus increasing both range and field of view for onboard sensors. The U.S. Air Force reports its range as approximately [...] At cruising altitude the B-2 refuels every six hours, taking on up to [...] of fuel at a time.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{candidate}} for the alleged spy plane is a design from Teledyne Ryan, patented in the United States on April 26, 1977, under number 4,019,699. [...] This aircraft of low <b>observability,</b> as it is called, was invented by Robert W. Wintersdorff and George R. Cota, employees at Teledyne Ryan, a firm specialized in building unmanned reconnaissance aircraft. On May 10, 1977, a design of an aircraft was patented by Teledyne Ryan under number Des. 244,265, and closely resembles the earlier mentioned example. This design was made by Waldo Virgil Opfer. The first design is unmanned, the second one manned. Whether one of these designs {{is related to the}} above-mentioned TR-3 is not positively identified, but it is a coincidence that TR also stands for Teledyne Ryan. Teledyne Ryan was acquired by Northrop Grumman in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|His {{analysis}} {{proceeded with}} like seeming concepts repelling or unfolding {{but after a}} sufficient duration of interaction (he called this duration [...] "faith") a pair of similar or like-seeming concepts will always produce a difference and thus an attraction. Amity (availability for interaction), respectability (<b>observability),</b> responsibility (able to respond to stimulus), unity (not uniformity) were necessary properties to produce agreement (or dependence) and agreement-to-disagree (or relative independence) when Actors interact. Concepts could be applied imperatively or permissively when a Petri (see Petri net) condition for synchronous transfer of meaningful information occurred. Extending his physical analogy Pask associated the interactions of thought generation with radiation : [...] "operations generating thoughts and penetrating conceptual boundaries within participants, excite the concepts bounded as oscillators, which, in ridding themselves of this surplus excitation, produce radiation" ...|$|E
2500|$|To do this, a {{controller}} {{with the}} requisite corrective behaviour is required. This controller monitors the controlled process variable (PV), and compares {{it with the}} reference or set point (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the error signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are [...] controllability and <b>observability.</b> On this is based the advanced type of automation that revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries. This is feedback control, which is usually continuous and involves taking measurements using a sensor and making calculated adjustments to keep the measured variable within a set range {{by means of a}} [...] "final control element", such as a control valve.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2015, the USAF {{revealed}} that the LRS-B's development was much further along than had been publicly acknowledged, and more than usual before a contract award. [...] Final requirements had been finalized since May 2013. [...] Both competitors had mature proposals with prototyping activities and wind tunnel tests along with subsystems, although no demonstrator had been built. [...] The designs are [...] "very different" [...] from each other with different teams on subsystems such as engines, electronic warfare suites, and communications systems; subcontractors will likely not be announced when the winner is picked. [...] The bomber seems similar to the B-2, but more advanced using improved materials for superior low <b>observability,</b> similar to or smaller in size, and will operate alone {{or as part of}} a strike package with other airborne assets. [...] Conducting of tests and risk reduction this early in the acquisition process is in part because the program has been handled by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office since 2011, which has more freedom in how it procures technologies. [...] To reduce risk, the aircraft's production rate will probably remain steady and fairly modest {{over the course of the}} aircraft's production. In late September 2015, the contract award was again delayed.|$|E
