5|$|IAU {{protocol}} is that discovery {{credit for}} a minor planet goes to whoever first submits {{a report to the}} MPC with enough positional data for a decent <b>orbit</b> <b>determination,</b> and that the credited discoverer has priority in naming it. This was Ortiz et al., and they proposed the name Ataecina, an Iberian goddess of the underworld. She is the equivalent of the Roman goddess Proserpina, who was in turn one of Pluto's lovers. However, as a chthonic deity, Ataecina would only have been an appropriate name for an object in orbital resonance with Neptune, which Haumea was not.|$|E

500|$|The Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{has stated}} that {{according}} to their mission managers and <b>orbit</b> <b>determination</b> experts, the Cassini spacecraft is not experiencing unexplained deviations in its orbit around Saturn. William Folkner, a planetary scientist at JPL stated, [...] "An undiscovered planet outside the orbit of Neptune, 10 times the mass of Earth, would affect the orbit of Saturn, not Cassini ... This could produce a signature in the measurements of Cassini while in orbit about Saturn if the planet {{was close enough to}} the Sun. But we do not see any unexplained signature above the level of the measurement noise in Cassini data taken from 2004 to 2016." [...] Observations of Saturn's orbit neither prove nor disprove that Planet Nine exists. Rather, they suggest that Planet Nine could not be in certain sections of its proposed orbit because its gravity would cause a noticeable effect on Saturn's position, inconsistent with actual observations.|$|E

[...] The theory of <b>orbit</b> <b>determination</b> has subsequently been developed to the point where today it is applied in GPS receivers as well as the tracking and cataloguing of newly observed minor planets.|$|E
40|$|A moment {{approach}} for <b>orbit</b> <b>determinations</b> of astrometric binaries from astrometric observations alone has been recently studied for a low signal-to-noise ratio (Iwama et al. 2013, PASJ, 65, 2). With avoiding a direct {{use of the}} time-consuming Kepler equation, temporal information is taken into account to increase the accuracy of statistical moments. As numerical tests, 100 realizations are done and the mean and the standard deviation are also evaluated. For a semi-major axis, {{the difference between the}} mean of the recovered values and the true value decreases to less than a tenth in the case of $ 10000 $ observed points. Therefore, the present moment approach works better than the previous one for the <b>orbit</b> <b>determinations</b> when one has a number of the observed points. The present approach is thus applicable to Cyg X- 1. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figures, 4 table; accepted by PAS...|$|R

40|$|In January 2002, the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) {{promoted}} a fourth reentry test campaign, choosing an old Russian upper stage as a study case.

This was a good opportunity to investigate the behavior of the models available or developed at ISTI, in terms of atmospheric density description, extreme ultraviolet radiation input, ballistic parameter estimation and orbit propagation. In order to evaluate the intrinsic reentry prediction uncertainties, the orbital decay of the test object was fitted, and predictions were made for it, using three different thermospheric density models and two independent sets of <b>orbit</b> <b>determinations</b> (American and Russian two-line elements).

40|$|GNSS’s <b>orbit</b> <b>determinations</b> always rely {{on ground}} station or intersatellite links (ISL). In the {{emergency}} of satellite-to-ground links and ISL break-off, BeiDou navigation satellite system (BDS) satellites cannot determine their orbits. In this paper, we propose {{to add a}} spaceborne annular beam antenna for receiving the global positioning system (GPS) and global navigation satellite system (GLONASS) signals; therefore, the BDS satellites may be capable of determining their orbits by GPS/GLONASS signals. Firstly, the spectrum selection, the power isolation, the range of Doppler frequency shift, and changing rate {{are taken into account}} for the feasibility. Specifically, the L 2 band signals are chosen for receiving and processing in order to prevent the overlapping of the receiving and transmitting signals. Secondly, the minimum number of visible satellites (MNVS), carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N 0), dilution of precision (GDOP), and geometric distance root-mean-square (gdrms) are evaluated for acquiring the effective receiving antennas’ coverage ranges. Finally, the scheme of deploying 3 receiving antennas is proved to be optimal by analysis and simulations over the middle earth orbit (MEO), geostationary earth orbit (GEO), and the inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit (IGSO). The antennas’ structures and patterns are designed to draw a conclusion that installing GPS and GLONASS receivers on BDS satellites for emergent <b>orbits</b> <b>determination</b> is cost-effective...|$|R
40|$|For optimum {{utilization}} of satellite-borne instrumentation, {{it is necessary}} to know precisely the orbital position of the spacecraft. The aim of this thesis is therefore two-fold - firstly to derive precise orbits with particular emphasis placed on the altimetric satellite SEASAT and secondly, to utilize the precise orbits, to improve upon atmospheric density determinations for satellite drag modelling purposes. Part one of the thesis, on precise <b>orbit</b> <b>determinations,</b> is particularly concerned with the tracking data - satellite laser ranging, altimetry and crossover height differences - and how this data can be used to analyse errors in the orbit, the geoid and sea-surface topography. The outcome of this analysis is the determination of a low degree and order model for sea surface topography. Part two, on the other hand, mainly concentrates on using the laser data to analyse and improve upon current atmospheric density models. In particular, the modelling of density changes associated with geomagnetic disturbances comes under scrutiny in this section. By introducing persistence modelling of a geomagnetic event and solving for certain geomagnetic parameters, a new density model is derived which performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art models over periods of severe geomagnetic storms at SEASAT heights. This is independently verified by application of the derived model to STARLETTE <b>orbit</b> <b>determinations...</b>|$|R
