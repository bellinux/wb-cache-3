40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a generic, flexible and comprehensive solution for adding security to remote communications of legacy applications without modifying installed components - hardware, operating system or applications. The proposed solution, named Pes (Privacy Enhanced Sockets), operates at transport level and modifies socket data flows between remote applications. Pes acts {{by means of}} wrapping and mediation to replace normal, insecure data flows by other data flows with privacy and integrity control (secure channels). Pes components run at user level in several operating systems, and are easy to update or adapt {{in order to satisfy}} specific requirements of applications, users or organizations. This thesis also describes two new cryptographic algorithms - an error propagating block encryption mode and a stream cipher - which optimize the performance and increase the security of Pes. The cipher mode was mainly designed for optimizing integrity control, but it also improves the block cipher security. The stream cipher was designed to produce unique key streams, like <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>pads,</b> and to allow a flexible instantiation in order to defeat crypt analysis and balance several operational issues, such as performance, security and memory consumption.

40|$|It is {{the first}} scheme which allows the {{detection}} apparatus to achieve the photon number of arriving signals. Moreover, quantum bit error rates (QBERs) of multiphoton pulses can also be achieved precisely. Thus, our method is sensitive to the photon number splitting and resending (PNSR) attack, i. e., the eavesdropper (Eve) replaces one photon of the multiphoton pulse by a false one and forwards the pulse to the receiver, while the decoy-state protocols are not. In our scheme, Eve’s whatever attacks will be limited by using the improved decoy-state protocols and by checking the QBERs. Based on our multiphoton pulses detection apparatus, a quasi-single-photon protocol is presented to improve {{the security of the}} communication and the rate of the final key. We analyze that our scheme is optimal under today’s technology. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a physically secure method, by which private key can be created between two partners, Alice and Bob, who share a quantum channel and a public authenticated channel [1]. The key bits then be used to implement a classical private key cryptosystem, or more precisely called <b>one</b> − <b>time</b> <b>pad</b> algorithm, to enable the partners to communicate securely. An optical QKD system includes the photon sources, quantum channels, single-photon detectors, and quantum random-number generators. In principle, optical quantum cryptography is based on the use of single-photon Fock states. However, perfect single-photon sources are difficult to realize experimentally. Practical implementations rely on faint laser pulses in which photon number distribution obeys Possionian statistics. So, Eve can get benefits from the multiphoton pulses. If the quantum channel is high lossy, Eve can obtain full information of the final key by using photon number splitting (PNS) attack without being detected.

Its implementers may ultimately get {{a pat on the}} back, but only after disaster strikes. More frequently, security policies and the people who implement them are cursed. Nonetheless, security is absolutely essential to a network survival. It is important a company-wide security plan that takes into account the needs of every location, every department, and every machine and user within the enterprise, regardless of what type of system they may be using. In these articles we try to verify how implemented one time security encryption scheme is more lucid, effective, however it is more difficult in nature of attacker life point of view.

40|$|We {{present an}} optimal {{experimental}} scheme for the practical BB 84 {{quantum key distribution}} protocol. Information that Eve can gain is tightly limited in this scheme. Such scheme can help the receiver-Bob to distinguish how many photons are in the laser pulses, {{so that it could}} be implemented in the decoy-state protocols. Using N beam splitters together with N polarization beam spiltters and 2 N single photon detectors, Alice and Bob, can detect Eve’s various multiphoton attacks, especially the photon number splitting (PNS) attack and coherent multiphoton pulses (CMP) attack. The photon number resolving power in our scheme is approximate to 1 /N. Quantum bit error rates (QBERs) of multiphoton pulses can also be achieved in this experimental scheme. Novelly, we find that the rate of secure final key will increase if Alice and Bob discard some bits of their raw key. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a physically secure method, by which private key can be created between two partners, Alice and Bob, who share a quantum channel and a public authenticated channel [1]. The key bits then be used to implement a classical private key cryptosystem, or more precisely called <b>one</b> − <b>time</b> <b>pad</b> algorithm, to enable the partners to communicate securely. Security of QKD is founded on the fundamental law of physics: in any attempt to distinguish between two nonorthogonal quantum states, information gain is only possible at the expense of introducing disturbance to the signal, i. e., an eavesdropper, Eve, can not gain any information on the key without introducing errors in the correlations between Alice and Bob. Another equivalent representation is that Eve can not duplicate the signal and forward a perfect copy to Bob because of the non-cloning theorem of quantum mechanics. The first quantum key distribution protocol, proposed by Bennett and Brassard in 1984 (BB 84) [2], {{is expected to be the}} first practical quantum information processor [1]. In the pioneer BB 84 protocol, Alice transmits quantum bits in the basis {| 0 〉, | 1 〉} or the conjugate basis {|+〉, |−〉}, here |+ 〉 = 1 √ (| 0 〉 + | 1 〉), |− 〉...|$|R
40|$|It is {{the first}} scheme which allows the {{detection}} apparatus to achieve both the photon number of arriving signals and quantum bit error rate of the multiphoton pulses precisely. We show that the upper bound of the fraction of the tagged multiphoton pulses counts is µ, which is independent of the channel loss {{and the intensity of}} the decoy source. Such upper bound is inherent and cannot be reduced any longer as long as the weak coherent scouces and high lossy channel are used. We show that our scheme can be implemented even if the channel loss is very high. A stronger intensity of the pulse source is allowable to improve the rate of quantum key distribution. Both the signal pulses and decoy pulses can be used to generate the raw key after verified the security of the communication. We analyze that our scheme is optimal under today’s technology.
