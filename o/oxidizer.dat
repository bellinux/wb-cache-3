5|$|Once in the engine, the {{propellants}} {{flow through}} low-pressure fuel and <b>oxidizer</b> turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The <b>oxidizer</b> is split into four separate paths: to the <b>oxidizer</b> heat exchanger, which then splits into the <b>oxidizer</b> tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure <b>oxidizer</b> turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure <b>oxidizer</b> preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the hot gas manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} engine's output, the MEC {{operates}} five hydraulically actuated propellant valves on each engine; the <b>oxidizer</b> preburner <b>oxidizer,</b> fuel preburner <b>oxidizer,</b> main <b>oxidizer,</b> main fuel, and chamber coolant valves. In an emergency, the valves can be fully closed {{by using the}} engine's helium supply system as a backup actuation system.|$|E
5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding <b>oxidizer</b> and fuel preburner <b>oxidizer</b> valves. These valves are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The <b>oxidizer</b> and fuel preburner <b>oxidizer</b> valves increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The <b>oxidizer</b> and fuel preburner valves operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E

30|$|<b>Oxidizers</b> {{were not}} {{effective}} in removing the polymer residue, especially in horizontal intervals (TjonJoe-Pin et al. 1993). <b>Oxidizers</b> required an activator {{to start working}} at low temperature. In addition, <b>oxidizers</b> may be consumed in many different competing reactions occurring downhole, reducing their availability to break the polymer (Norman et al. 1989).|$|R
50|$|Common <b>oxidizers</b> include gaseous or liquid oxygen, nitrous oxide, and {{hydrogen}} peroxide. For a reverse hybrid, <b>oxidizers</b> such as frozen oxygen and ammonium perchlorate are used.|$|R
5|$|The {{low-pressure}} <b>oxidizer</b> turbopump (LPOTP) is an {{axial-flow pump}} which operates at approximately 5,150 rpm {{driven by a}} six-stage turbine powered by high-pressure liquid oxygen from the high-pressure <b>oxidizer</b> turbopump (HPOTP). It boosts the liquid oxygen's pressure from , with the flow from the LPOTP then being supplied to the HPOTP. During engine operation, the pressure boost permits the high-pressure <b>oxidizer</b> turbine to operate at high speeds without cavitating. The LPOTP, which measures approximately , {{is connected to the}} vehicle propellant ducting and supported in a fixed position by being mounted on the launch vehicle's structure.|$|E
5|$|The <b>oxidizer</b> {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and <b>oxidizer</b> enter the preburners and are mixed so that {{efficient}} combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The <b>oxidizer</b> preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the <b>oxidizer</b> preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow drives a turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{arsenite}} <b>oxidizers</b> {{in natural}} attenuation of arsenic pollution necessitates studies on their abundance and diversity in arsenic-contaminated aquifers. In this study, most probable number-polymerase chain reaction (MPN-PCR) and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) {{was applied to}} monitor depth-wise abundance and diversity of aerobic arsenite <b>oxidizers</b> in arsenic-enriched groundwater of Beimen, southwestern Taiwan. The results revealed that the abundance of arsenite <b>oxidizers</b> ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 22, and the lowest ratio was observed in the most arsenic-enriched and comparatively more reduced groundwater (depth 200 m) of Beimen 1. The highest ratio was observed in the less arsenic-enriched and less reduced groundwater (depth 60 m) of Beimen 2 B. DGGE profiles showed a shift in diversity of arsenite <b>oxidizers,</b> consisting of members of the Betaproteobacteria (61 %), Alphaproteobacteria (28 %) and Gammaproteobacteria (11 %), depending on mainly arsenic concentration and redox level in groundwater. Groundwater with the lowest arsenic and highest dissolved oxygen at Beimen 2 B harbored 78 % of the arsenite <b>oxidizers</b> communities, while groundwater with the highest arsenic and lowest dissolved oxygen at Beimen 1 and Beimen-Jinhu harbored 17 and 22 % of arsenite <b>oxidizers</b> communities, respectively. Pseudomonas sp. was found only in groundwater containing high arsenic at Beimen 1 and Beimen-Jinhu, while arsenite <b>oxidizers</b> belonging to Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria were dominated in groundwater containing low arsenic. ...|$|R

5|$|The Hiroc missile used {{liquid oxygen}} as its <b>oxidizer,</b> and alcohol for its fuel. The Hiroc missile {{did not have}} {{separate}} tanks for its fuel and <b>oxidizer,</b> which were instead contained in one tank separated by a bulkhead. The frame of the rocket {{was supported by the}} pressure of the gas inside the tank, which would be either propellant when used, or inert gasses when stored. Having gas pressure provide rigidity to the structure reduced the empty weight by requiring less metallic components for structural reinforcement, but made the missile very fragile because it required continuous pressurization.|$|E

5000|$|If any {{chemical}} is {{an electron}} donor (reducing agent), another {{must be an}} electron recipient (oxidizing agent). A reducing agent is oxidized because it loses electrons in the redox reaction. Thus reducers are [...] "oxidized" [...] by <b>oxidizers</b> and <b>oxidizers</b> are [...] "reduced" [...] by reducers; reducers are by themselves reduced (have more electrons) and <b>oxidizers</b> are by themselves oxidized (have fewer electrons). A reducing agent typically is {{in one of its}} lower possible oxidation states and is known as the electron donor. Examples of reducing agents include the earth metals, formic acid, and sulfite compounds.|$|R

5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, valves, and other components which work in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and <b>oxidizer</b> (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect valves {{and from there}} flowed through the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and <b>oxidizer</b> from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and <b>oxidizer</b> each branch out into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, the American {{scientist}} Robert H. Goddard {{became the}} first person to develop a rocket engine that burned liquid fuel; the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the <b>oxidizer.</b> Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56m at 97km/h on March 16, 1926 in Auburn, Massachusetts, US.|$|E
50|$|Nitrite {{oxidoreductase}} (NOR or NXR) is {{an enzyme}} involved in nitrification. It {{is the last}} {{step in the process}} of aerobic ammonia oxidation, which is carried out by two groups of nitrifying bacteria: ammonia <b>oxidizers</b> such as Nitrosospira, Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus convert ammonia to nitrite, while nitrite <b>oxidizers</b> such as Nitrobacter and Nitrospira oxidize nitrite to nitrate.|$|R
30|$|Certainly, it {{is clear}} that the fuel for ball lightning—in the form of aerosol {{submicron}} and nanoparticles—can only be made inside the local air volume with an initial deficiency of <b>oxidizers.</b> As is well known, such a local temporary deficiency of <b>oxidizers</b> can be spontaneously achieved by various means. For example, it can be achieved with the help of local “burning” <b>oxidizers</b> inside a confined space due to the substantial excess vapour of the future nanoparticle ball lightning fuel. Another probable means for the local temporary neutralization of the influence of atmospheric <b>oxidizers</b> during ball lightning formation is the accidental simultaneous process of the generation of a reducing atmosphere of additional gas reductants—hydrogen, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulphide etc. This essential requirement of nanotechnology of metals—the presence of an inert or reducing atmosphere at the manufacture of oxidable nanoparticles—is completely applicable to the technology of nanoparticle ball lightning [5].|$|R

5000|$|A chemolithotroph (named {{after the}} process of chemolithotropy) is able to use {{inorganic}} reduced compounds {{as a source of}} energy. This process is accomplished through oxidation and ATP synthesis. The majority of chemolithotrophs are able to fix carbon dioxide (CO2) through the Calvin cycle, a metabolic pathway in which carbon enters as CO2 and leaves as glucose. [...] For some substrates, the cells must cull through large amounts of inorganic substrate to secure just a small amount of energy. This makes their metabolic process inefficient in many places and hinders them from thriving.

5|$|In {{addition}} to fuel and <b>oxidizer</b> systems, the launch vehicle's {{main propulsion system}} is also equipped with a helium system consisting of ten storage tanks in {{addition to}} various regulators, check valves, distribution lines, and control valves. The system is used in-flight to purge the engine and provides pressure for actuating engine valves within the propellant management system and during emergency shutdowns. During entry, on the Space Shuttle, any remaining helium was used to purge the engines during reentry and for repressurization.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an ullage medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and <b>oxidizer</b> from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
