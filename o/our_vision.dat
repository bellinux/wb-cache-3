5|$|Infrared {{astronomy}} {{is founded}} on the detection and analysis of infrared radiation, wavelengths longer than red light and outside the range of <b>our</b> <b>vision.</b> The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust. The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies. Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.|$|E

25|$|JTS articulates {{a vision}} of Judaism that is learned and passionate, pluralist and authentic, {{traditional}} and egalitarian; one that is thoroughly grounded in Jewish texts, history, and practices, and fully engaged with the societies and cultures of the present. <b>Our</b> <b>vision</b> joins faith with inquiry; the covenant of our ancestors with the creative insights of today; intense involvement in the society and State of Israel with devotion to the flowering of Judaism throughout the world; service to the Jewish community, {{as well as to}} all of the communities of which Jews are a part: our society, our country, and our world.|$|E
25|$|Dennett {{claims that}} {{conventional}} {{explanations of the}} colour change boil down to either Orwellian or Stalinesque hypotheses, which he says {{are the result of}} Descartes' continued influence on <b>our</b> <b>vision</b> of the mind. In an Orwellian hypothesis, the subject comes to one conclusion, then goes back and changes that memory in light of subsequent events. This is akin to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, where records of the past are routinely altered. In a Stalinesque hypothesis, the two events would be reconciled prior to entering the subject's consciousness, with the final result presented as fully resolved. This is akin to Joseph Stalin's show trials, where the verdict has been decided in advance and the trial is just a rote presentation.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the Association of Independent Navigation Authorities (AINA) {{published}} a report called Demonstrating {{the value of}} waterways, in which they outlined methods for assessing restoration projects, and their likely social and economic benefits. British Waterways produced {{a report in the}} following year, called Waterways 2025 – <b>Our</b> <b>vision</b> for the shape of the Waterways Network, which used many of the methods suggested by the AINA report to identify 18 restoration schemes which they thought might be completed before 2025, and which they would support. The Wendover Arm appeared in the list, but the report was abandoned two years later, after other groups claimed that not being included undermined their ability to raise funds.|$|E

40|$|In {{the late}} 1990 s, we, Bronwyn Fredericks and Pamela Croft were both {{living in the}} Australian Central Queensland region. As two Australian Aboriginal women we were both engaged in the same areas of {{politics}} and activism and were both undertaking doctoral studies. At times during our studies, we would become frustrated {{with the lack of}} literature and scholarly leadership in our respective disciplines. We also knew we had lots to say that was inside and outside of the scope of our studies and our disciplines. We wanted to talk about history, health, education, culture, the manifestations of whiteness in Australia, the relationships between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians and much more. Through our joint history we knew we could work in a partnership with each other in ways that supported and respected one another and recognised each other’s skills and abilities. We began to share <b>our</b> <b>visions</b> and <b>our</b> ideas in ways that stimulated creativity and inspiration. We began to plan projects using Pamela’s art works and Bronwyn’s words. We came to find a space in which we could jointly work. This paper will share part of <b>our</b> <b>visioning</b> journey and highlight some of the aspects of how we work together in our creative partnership. It will demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} enact <b>our</b> <b>visions</b> and to realise our dreams and aspirations...|$|R
25|$|Our {{ideas about}} God are {{important}} indicators {{of how we}} view the world. According to Adler, these ideas have changed over time, as <b>our</b> <b>vision</b> of the world – and our place in it – has changed. Consider this example that Adler offers: the traditional belief that people were placed deliberately on earth as God's ultimate creation is being replaced {{with the idea that}} people have evolved by natural selection. This coincides with a view of God not as a real being, but as an abstract representation of nature's forces. In this way our view of God has changed from one that was concrete and specific to one that is more general. From Adler's vantage point, this is a relatively ineffective perception of God because it is so general that it fails to convey a strong sense of direction and purpose.|$|E

Fassbender's David is dressed similarly to other crew members, but his outfit was given finer lines to produce a more linear appearance. To create a casual, relaxed appearance, Marshall-Green's Holloway was dressed in hoodies, fisherman pants, and flip-flops, while Elba wore a canvas-greased jacket to represent his long career {{at the helm of}} a ship.|$|E

500|$|Scott Derrickson {{did not see}} a lookbook for Doctor Strange, instead putting {{together}} his own presentation, with concept art and storyboards by himself and professionals he hired, to sell himself and {{his vision of the}} film to Marvel. In contrast, Marvel shared several different ideas for what Thor: Ragnarok could be with prospective filmmakers, who then went away and developed what they thought the film should be from that. Taika Waititi created a sizzle reel using clips from other films to present his vision based on Marvel's ideas, a practice that Marvel discourages as they [...] "oftentimes can be really terrible". However, Marvel thought Waititi's was [...] "amazing". Derrickson and Waititi were both eventually hired for the films. For Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Joe and Anthony Russo met with the studio four times over two months before they were hired, during which they [...] "kept getting more and more specific about what <b>our</b> <b>vision</b> was", {{putting together}} [...] "reference videos, storyboards, script pages, you name it. We did like a 30-page book that had everything that we’d do with the character, from the theme of the movie to the tone of the film to the fighting style to what we liked about the character and what we didn’t like". This meant that {{by the time they were}} hired they had already [...] "figured the movie out".|$|E
500|$|The {{relationships}} between Betty and Rita, and Diane and Camilla have been variously described as [...] "touching," [...] "moving," [...] {{as well as}} [...] "titillating". Film critic Glenn Kenny, {{in a review of}} the film for Premiere, stated that the relationship between Betty and Rita is [...] "possibly the healthiest, most positive amorous relationship ever depicted in a Lynch movie", whereas the French critic Thierry Jousse, in his review for Cahiers du cinéma, noted that the love between the women depicted is [...] "of lyricism practically without equal in contemporary cinema". In the pages of Film Comment, Philip Lopate held that the pivotal romantic interlude between Betty and Rita was made so poignant and tender by Betty's [...] "understanding for the first time, with self-surprise, that all her helpfulness and curiosity about the other woman had a point: desire... It is a beautiful moment, made all the more miraculous by its earned tenderness, and its distances from anything lurid." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon magazine maintained that the scene's [...] "eroticism [...] so potent it blankets the whole movie, coloring every scene that came before and every one that follows". Betty and Rita were chosen by the Independent Film Channel as the emblematic romantic couple of the 2000s. Writer Charles Taylor states, [...] "Betty and Rita are often framed against darkness so soft and velvety it's like a hovering nimbus, ready to swallow them if they awake from the film's dream. And when they are swallowed, when smoke fills the frame as if the sulfur of hell itself were obscuring <b>our</b> <b>vision,</b> we feel as if not just a romance has been broken, but the beauty of the world has been cursed." [...] The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita–which borders on outright obsession–has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966) and Robert Altman's 3 Women (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merge: [...] "The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire".|$|E
