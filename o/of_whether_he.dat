5|$|In the serial, the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and {{his companions}} Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) are {{travelling}} back {{to the space station}} via transmat beam from a previous story to return to the TARDIS, when they are intercepted by the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, and are directed to Skaro to the time of the Daleks' creation. The Timelords want the Doctor to avert their future terrorisation of other species. The Doctor faces the dilemma <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> has the right to do so.|$|E
5|$|According to Moyzisch, the German Foreign Office did {{not make}} much use of the documents, because {{officers}} there were divided about their reliability for several reasons. There was {{a steady stream of}} documents, which was highly unusual. Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Cheney's long {{histories}} {{of cardiovascular disease}} and periodic need for urgent health care raised questions <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was medically fit to serve in public office. Having smoked approximately 3 packs of cigarettes per day for nearly 20 years, Cheney had his first of five heart attacks in 1978, at age 37. Subsequent attacks in 1984, 1988, 2000, and 2010 have resulted in moderate contractile dysfunction of his left ventricle. He underwent four-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting in 1988, coronary artery stenting in November 2000, urgent coronary balloon angioplasty in March 2001, and the implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in June, 2001.|$|E
50|$|At the funeral, Neely ends up {{forgiving}} coach {{after all}} those years <b>of</b> debating <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> likes or dislikes Eddie Rake.|$|R
60|$|James {{was amazed}} {{not to see}} the moody face clear up, and asked <b>of</b> Malcolm <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> were not gratified with this ample satisfaction.|$|R
500|$|Still, {{the writers}} {{had trouble with}} {{coming up with a}} story for Sideshow Bob since they had already {{explored}} several aspects of the character before. [...] "It's just that we've done so many angles <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's,</b> he's good, he's reformed and then his brother came to town..." [...] executive producer and former showrunner Mike Scully said about the difficulty of writing episodes about Sideshow Bob.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Nollette sneaks {{into the}} {{cryogenic}} facility and tampers with Grable's storage unit, thawing his remains. Roland {{returns to the}} lab {{and is in the}} process of pushing the prototype engine to mach 15 when Nollette enters. Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies' loss to Kansas {{lowered its}} bowl winning {{percentage}} since 1993 to 40percent. In the 15bowl games played between the 1993 Independence Bowl and the 2008 Orange Bowl, the Hokies amassed {{a record of}} sixwins and ninelosses. Despite the loss to the Jayhawks {{and the loss of}} several graduating players, Virginia Tech was a popular pick to repeat as ACC champions heading into the off-season. The seniors who graduated following the Orange Bowl game were the winningest team in Virginia Tech history, becoming one of just three teams in Division I to win at least 10 games each of the previous four years. Junior Sean Glennon's second consecutive failure to win a bowl game, however, re-opened the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> or Tyrod Taylor would be the Hokies' starter at quarterback in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{professorship}} {{was suspended}} for {{two years after the}} death of Robert Gandell in 1887. The electoral board had met to select a successor, but were unable to make a suitable appointment, and so obtained the permission of the university authorities to adjourn. When the board resumed in 1889, one of the previous applicants, David Margoliouth, re-applied for the position and was successful, even though none of the people recommending him made any mention <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> knew any Arabic. As professor, Margoliouth taught the syllabus for the final examinations in lectures over two years, regardless of the stage that students had reached, and regarded it as bad luck if a student had to tackle the more difficult texts in one year and the easier texts in the next.|$|E
50|$|There were {{contractual}} wrangles with Ronnie Peterson, reportedly discontent at Lotus and it {{was uncertain}} up until the start <b>of</b> practice <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would be driving for them or Shadow.|$|R

2500|$|Guy Williams was {{introduced}} to the Disney audience as Zorro in a segment of the Disney anthology television series, The Fourth Anniversary Show. During this episode, which starred the Mouseketeers and featured upcoming shows, Moochie (Kevin Corcoran) repeatedly asks Walt Disney, [...] "What about Zorro?" [...] Finally Zorro appears, but not in the same shot with the Mouseketeers. Zorro explains who he is, and coyly answers the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> [...] "real." ...|$|R
5|$|Iginla {{continued}} {{his pursuit of}} Fleury's franchise record of 830points in 2008–09. He recorded his 800th point with a first period assist against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 19, 2008. He ended 2008 with a career high five points in a New Year's Eve game against the Edmonton Oilers. He had 14 previous four point games. In January, he {{was named to the}} 2009 NHL All-Star Game in Montreal, his fifth such selection. Representing the Western Conference, Iginla scored his first career NHL All-Star Game goal in a 12–11 shootout loss. He passed Fleury as the Flames' all-time scoring leader on March 1, 2009, by recording five points, including his 400th career goal, in an 8–6 loss to the Lightning. He finished the season with 35goals and 89points, but a disappointing playoff performance led to questions <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had been playing with an injury. Iginla quickly denied the rumour, admitted that he had not played with the level of consistency he expected and stated that he would spend the summer focused on improving his play in 2009–10.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Byrne's early life beyond {{the fact that he}} was born in Ireland in 1806. His first fight, in 1825, was a loss to Mike Larking; it lasted 138 rounds spread over two and a half hours—despite the fact that at this time a round could vary in length, and usually only ended when a man was knocked down. His second fight was a draw against Jack Manning in 1826, earning Byrne £100. Next was Byrne's first match against the Scottish boxer Alexander McKay, which Byrne won easily in five rounds, earning him a further £100. This match was McKay's first ever prize-fight. This victory was soon {{followed}} by a win against Bob Avery, earning a further £50, then another win over Phil Samson in 1829, earning him £200. By the standards of the day these latter sums were enormous; it is therefore surprising that he was then offered £200 for a rematch, regardless <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> won or not, against the less experienced McKay, whom he had beaten so easily on the first occasion. As of 2008 that would be the equivalent of about £13,600.|$|E
25|$|Scopes never testified {{since there}} was never a factual issue as to whether he had taught evolution. Scopes later {{admitted}} that, in reality, he was unsure <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had taught evolution (another reason the defense did not want him to testify), but the point was not contested at the trial.|$|E
50|$|Jan Vilain {{was said}} to have been Castellan of Rupelmonde as well, and murdered there; he was also a lord <b>of</b> Sint-Jans-Steene; <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was the same as Jourdain is unclear.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas' career high {{in points}} came on November 28, 2008, when he scored 21 against Duquesne. His new career high broke his {{previous}} record of 15 points set on November 20, 2006. Thomas' ability to finish shots {{was a big}} staple of his improvement. It was said of him, [...] "If he gets the ball within three feet of the basket, chances are he's {{going to put the}} ball in the hoop — regardless <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> fouled." ...|$|R
60|$|The schipper, having {{delivered}} {{himself of}} his sentiments, to this effect, resumed his pipe, {{like a man}} who felt he deserved the meed <b>of</b> victory, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> were to receive it, or not.|$|R
25|$|In a September 2007 Republican primary presidential debate, Paul {{answered}} yes to {{the question}} <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would veto the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit discrimination in hiring and employment {{on the basis of}} sexual orientation by employers with at least 15 employees. This is consistent with his views of opposing any private sector anti-discrimination laws and his belief in freedom of association.|$|E
25|$|These {{cases were}} each {{filed in the}} United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the court decided them together, {{consolidating}} them under Rasul v. Bush. Each of the filings alleged {{that the government had}} not allowed the detainee to speak at all to friends, family or lawyers, and had not given him any hearing whatsoever on the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was an enemy combatant in the war.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the programmatic chansons {{for which he is}} most famous, he also wrote short and refined compositions more in the style of Claudin de Sermisy. For these he set texts by some of the prominent poets of the time, including Clément Marot. Late in his life he wrote the Psalm settings based on Genevan tunes. Since there is no documentary evidence, the question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> sympathized with the Protestants remains unanswered.|$|E
50|$|When {{asked by}} André S. Labarthe during the making <b>of</b> Faces <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had {{the desire to}} make a musical film, Cassavetes responded {{he wanted to make}} only one musical, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.|$|R

25|$|By {{the fall}} of 2008, a story broke that Rodríguez had {{wrestled}} a dark match for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) {{and that they had}} offered him a contract. Over the following months conflicting reports <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had signed or not arose, but he remained CMLL World Heavyweight Champion. When he lost the title to Último Guerrero it was believed that he had indeed signed with WWE, with him being rumored to be a surprise participant in the 2009 Royal Rumble. However, he remained with CMLL and stated that he signed a four-year deal and chose CMLL because they offered him a better deal than WWE.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} war, Léopold III, who had {{surrendered}} {{himself to the}} German army in 1940, was released; however, the issue <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had betrayed his country by surrendering, while most government ministers had escaped to the United Kingdom, presented an important constitutional dilemma. In particular, the Belgian public was concerned {{that he might be}} a collaborator with the Nazis. He had met Hitler in Berchtesgaden on November 19, 1940 and had even remarried (to Lilian Baels) during the war. Many Belgians, especially the Socialists, strongly opposed his return to power. He was kept in exile in Switzerland until 1950, while his brother Prince Charles presided as regent.|$|E
25|$|The {{significance}} of Bai Bureh's {{war against the}} British {{is not a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> won or lost the war but that a man who had none of what could be called formal military training was able to show that for a significant number of months he was able to take on the British who were very proud of their great military successes across the globe. The British troops were led by officers trained at the finest military academies where war is studied {{in the same way that}} one studies a subject at university. The fact that Bai Bureh was not executed after his capture has led some historians to claim that this was in admiration for his prowess as an adversary to the British.|$|E

25|$|While {{staying at}} a hotel in Eagle Pass, Moss discovers the {{tracking}} device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets and both are wounded. Moss flees to Mexico, stashing the case of money in weeds along the Rio Grande. Severely injured, he asks for help from some musicians, who take him to a hospital. Carson Wells, another hired operative, fails to persuade him to accept protection in return for the money. Chigurh cleans and stitches his own wounds with stolen supplies and kills Wells at his hotel. Moss telephones the room and Chigurh answers. Chigurh tells Moss that he will kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money; he remarks that he will kill Moss regardless <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> receives the money.|$|E
25|$|Price {{continued}} his cartage towards Fort Scott, Kansas. In {{the late afternoon}} of October 25, Price's supply train had difficulty crossing the Marmiton River ford and just as at Mine Creek earlier that afternoon, Price had to make another stand. Brig. Gen. John McNeil, commanding two brigades of Pleasonton's cavalry, engaged troops that Price and his officers had rallied from the earlier battles, including a sizable contingent of unarmed men. Observing the large Confederate force and not knowing that many were unarmed, McNeil refrained from an all-out assault. After about two hours of skirmishing Price recommenced his retreat, while McNeil could not mount an effective pursuit. Price's army was utterly broken by this time; now {{it was simply a}} question <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> could escape, and how many men he could successfully evacuate to friendly territory.|$|E
25|$|One Stone {{was placed}} at Angrenost (Isengard) in Orthanc, the great tower {{built by the}} Dúnedain in the Second Age at the {{southern}} end of the Misty Mountains. In T.A. 2759, Saruman obtained the keys of Orthanc from Beren, the ruling Steward of Gondor, possibly because Saruman desired to use the palantír to garner information on his neighbours and their activities. The stone was also partially responsible for Saruman's fall from grace, as he was using it when he came upon Sauron, and was ensnared by him, though his transformation to one of the fallen Maiar had undoubtedly begun much earlier. Saruman later used the stone to confer with Sauron through the Ithil-stone in Barad-dûr. By showing Saruman selective visions of his new armies, Sauron convinced the Wizard that he was going to win the War of the Ring, regardless <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> actually found the One Ring.|$|E
50|$|Justice Douglas, {{with the}} {{concurrence}} of Justice Reed, dissented, {{arguing that the}} Court of Claims {{should be allowed to}} reverse an official where his conduct is plainly out <b>of</b> bounds, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is fraudulent, perverse, captious, incompetent, or just palpably wrong.|$|R
