25|$|In the {{tropical}} greenhouse {{a variety of}} tropical and subtropical plants {{from all over the}} world can be found. Some of the plants include a variety of food and medicinal plants including Coffea arabica (coffee), Camellia sinensis (tea), Vanilla planifolia (vanilla), Saccharum officinarum (sugarcane), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (cinnamon), Oryza sativa (rice), Theobroma cacao (cacao), Siphonochilus aethiopicus (wild ginger), Warburghia salutaris (pepper bark tree) and Piper nigrum (pepper). The tropical greenhouse also houses many other exotic plants from a variety of families most notably the <b>Orchid</b> <b>family.</b> Many indigenous epiphytic orchids such as Ansellia africana (leopard orchid) and Mystacidium capense, can be found in this greenhouse. Other interesting plants on display include Amorphophallus titanum (giant corpse flower), Hydnophytum formicarum (ant plant), Heliconia humilis (lobster plant), Nepenthes alata (pitcher plant) and Ravenala madagascariensis (travelers palm). In 2010 Victoria cruziana (giant Amazon waterlily) was also successfully grown in {{the tropical}} greenhouse which drew numerous curious visitors to the Garden. This was the first successful recorded cultivation in many decades for South Africa.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the decades}} of the 1950s and 1960s while much of Mulford's time was spent exploring, collecting, writing, cultivating, and {{designing}} yards he also managed to paint. His final painting series was called Synthesis and was completed over the years 1950-1966. He continued to do sketches and smaller works but Palm Family, <b>Orchid</b> <b>Family</b> and Cactus Family were his last serious paintings. It is this last series that prompted the name [...] "passionate plant lover". He ultimately held a showing at the Art Center of Maitland in September 1975 exhibiting all his paintings including all the series from the Photographic to the Synthesis. The Foster estate donated Mulford's last series of paintings to the Harry P. Leu Gardens where {{they are part of}} a permanent art exhibit.|$|E
