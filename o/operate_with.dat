5|$|Crispy Gamer was an American {{video game}} website that {{published}} news, culture, reviews, comics, and videos.

The website continued to <b>operate,</b> <b>with</b> gamerDNA being acquired by Live Gamer in 2011. It was stated in 2012 that the website became defunct.|$|E
5|$|On the 31 July the Third Battle of Ypres {{began and}} the unit was heavily involved. 56 was tasked with air superiority {{operations}} to allow RFC bomber and reconnaissance units to <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> relative freedom. The Germans had adopted a defensive stratagem of massing their aircraft, now increasingly outnumbered, at critical {{points of the}} front. Their units were also a collection of highly successful aces. The S.E.5s engaged in battle with the German fighters throughout the summer.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing the {{practicality}} of this solution, Admiral Rodman {{requested that}} the Navy Department send another battleship to <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> his division. Specifically, Rodman requested the ship be New Yorks sister ship , to better match Grand Fleet policy, which encouraged the use of matched pairs to aid in rangefinding. Although there was some grumbling at the Navy Department that a five ship division was counter to U.S. Navy policy, they eventually agreed, and on 11 February 1918, Texas arrived at Scapa Flow.|$|E

5|$|The Admiralty's {{decision}} saddled the Royal Navy {{with a pair}} {{of ships}} that could not <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> the Warriors in a tactical squadron and were inferior to the French ironclads then under construction. The naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby, a future Constructor of the Navy, considered that a Defence-class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior in terms of combat, although they cost about two-thirds as much.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} carrier I {{was the first}} planned {{aircraft carrier}} conversion project of the German Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) during World War I. The Imperial Navy had experimented previously with seaplane carriers, though these earlier conversions were too slow to <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> the High Seas Fleet and carried an insufficient number of aircraft. I was intended to carry between 23 and 30 aircraft, including fighters, bombers, and torpedo-bombers.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} would not improve until 1942. Coastal Command did <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> effect alongside RAF Bomber Command in disrupting enemy shipping during the Battle of Britain in 1940. Coastal Command attacked shipping and mined waters around invasion ports. The German invasion of Britain in 1940, Operation Sea Lion, was eventually cancelled {{owing to the}} German defeat in the Battle of Britain.|$|E

5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that the tram company should not choose that solution. The goal was to decrease the weight so the trams could <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a full-scale model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E
5|$|Two of the lines, 400 and 500, are {{designated}} as providing inner services. These operate along the Drammen Line to Asker, along the Trunk Line to Lillestrøm and the Østfold Line to Ski, stopping at all stations. The six other line, {{which make up}} the outer services, only make occasional stops on these sections. The inner services <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> a normal headway of 30 minutes, with 15 minutes offered in one direction during rush hour. In late evening {{and parts of the}} weekend, this is further reduced to 60 minutes. NSB's outer routes <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> a normal headway of 60 minutes, with rush-hour services offered at 30-minute intervals and late evening service provided every 120 minutes. Services between Årnes and Kongsvinger is limited to five daily services, and from Mysen to Rakkestad with four daily services. The Gjøvik Line runs with a 40-minute headway, with three different stopping patterns. One calls at all stations until Hakadal, one calls at most stations until Jaren, while one is an express service that runs the line's full length to Gjøvik.|$|E
5|$|Among a small {{coterie of}} wartime RAAF commanders {{earmarked}} for further senior roles, McCauley retained his rank of air commodore following {{the cessation of}} hostilities. He served again as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff in 1946–47. Promoted to air vice marshal, he was Chief of Staff to Lieutenant General Horace Robertson at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan from June 1947 to June 1949. In this post he was preceded and succeeded by two other Duntroon graduates, Air Vice Marshals Frank Bladin and Alan Charlesworth respectively. Upon his return to Australia, McCauley was made Air Officer Commanding Eastern Area. During the Malayan Emergency, he formed RAAF aircraft assigned for deployment into No.90 (Composite) Wing, as directed by Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal George Jones, {{to ensure that they}} would <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> a degree of autonomy rather than be dispersed throughout other Allied groups. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1951 Birthday Honours.|$|E

5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board be abolished and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to <b>operate,</b> <b>with</b> a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E
5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced {{as if they were the}} length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Because of delays from Stadler's subcontractors, five {{instead of}} eight trams were {{available}} when the line opened on 22 June 2010. Skyss {{had planned to}} <b>operate</b> <b>with</b> a ten-minute headway until August, but had a 15-minute headway until 16 August. To compensate, none of the parallel bus routes ceased until then. On 7 June, two trams collided at low speed at Byparken, causing a derailment and forced the two trams to be repaired. This caused the summer schedule to {{be reduced to a}} 30-minute headway. From 1 November, the line started running every six minutes during the rush hour. On 22 June, {{the first part of the}} line was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway.|$|E
