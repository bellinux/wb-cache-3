40|$|This {{contribution}} first discusses end-to-end interworking {{in so-called}} ATM internets {{consisting of a}} concatenation {{of public and private}} ATM networks. It shows that in an ATM internet connection oriented interworking is likely to be achieved using normal ISDN signaling procedures, whereas connectionless interworking, if based on the I. cls draft [1], lacks a means to identify stations in the private components of ATM internets. In order to remedy the connectionless situation, a proposal is made to extend the current I. cls address format with an <b>optional</b> <b>sub-address</b> field. 1. Introduction This contribution first introduces the concept of ATM internets and discusses in a tutorial style (for a benefit to the author itself) how end-to-end interworking can be achieved in such networks both in case of connection oriented and connectionless mode of communication. Then, based on this discussion, the current draft on Connectionless Broadband Data Service (CBDS) on B-ISDN (I. cls) [1] is criti [...] ...|$|E
