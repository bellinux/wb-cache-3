2500|$|As {{the public}} sector {{expanded}} in importance through the 1950s-70s, and British Government legislation such as the Industrial Relations Act 1971 simultaneously sought to curb trade union powers, {{some parts of the}} union became more radicalised. [...] NALGO organised its first <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> in Leeds in 1970, and its first national strike, of social workers, was in 1978/79. [...] It also led the way as a campaigning organisation over equal pay and wider equality and international issues. [...] Total membership rose to over 700,000 by 1977, by which time it was by far the largest UK public sector union.|$|E
50|$|Whilst some {{trade unions}} make {{payments}} to {{members who are}} on an <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> there is no requirement to do so. The UK government makes the presumption that workers on <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> action are being paid strike pay, and so {{they may not be}} entitled to state benefits.|$|E

The aim of the thesis is analysis and analytical evaluation of bank officials {{at the beginning of the}} 1 st republic and in connection with brief sketch of interrelated events of this decade...|$|R
50|$|The Wilberforce Enquiry of 1972, which {{followed}} an <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> of that year, {{concluded that the}} mineworkers in the late 1960s had been overworked and underpaid under the National Power Loading Agreement of the first Wilson government.|$|E
50|$|In July 2013 HM Court Service {{announced}} {{it is to}} fully contract out {{the whole of the}} compliance and enforcement process to a private company; this would involve the transfer of over 500 of its employees.

50|$|It {{was then}} that the IOC and SWOC decided they must take action. A {{deadline}} of May 26 {{was given to the}} steel companies to sign the union contracts or endure a strike. After that day passed with no response from Little Steel, John L. Lewis made an <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> call and workers walked away from their positions just hours after the deadline, shutting down almost every mill of the three largest Little Steel companies.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{no police}} in the area when Bino was killed. Jean-Michel Pretre, a local Guadeloupean prosecutor, has speculated that the youths, who were {{operating}} independently from the <b>official</b> <b>strikes,</b> may have mistaken Bino for a plainclothes police officer when they opened fire. Point-à-Pitre Mayor Jacques Bangou noted following Bino's death that, [...] "For the past 48 hours the streets {{have been in the}} hands of groups of young people, completely out of control." ...|$|R

50|$|In July 1991, {{all of the}} company's 1,300 {{staff at}} its four garages went out on strike against these changes, leading to the {{suspension}} of services for two weeks. This was the first <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> by London bus drivers since 1958, and prompted Harry Cohen, the Member of Parliament for Leyton, to issue an Early day motion in the House of Commons. The company was forced to abandon the routes, with work taken on by Country Bus & Coach, Ensignbus and Thamesway.|$|E
50|$|On 20 May 1921, {{the workers}} in the Spinning Department of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills refused to work until the {{management}} agreed to discuss their wage rise demands. The protest reached serious proportions when an <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> was declared on 20 June. The striking workers were led by Congressman V. Kalyanasundaram Mudaliar. The Indian National Congress convened a meeting in Madras on 10 July 1921; in this meeting, C. Rajagopalachari moved for a resolution sympathizing with the workers of the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills and supporting their cause.|$|E
50|$|On {{the second}} day of the strike over 25,000 workers marched from the Brisbane Trades Hall to Fortitude Valley and back with over 50,000 {{supporters}} watching from the sidelines. The procession was described as being led by Labor parliamentarians, with the procession being eight abreast and two miles (3 km) long, with a contingent of 600 women. The strike spread throughout Queensland with many regional centres organising processions through their towns. The strike committee regularly issued an <b>official</b> <b>Strike</b> Bulletin to counter the expected anti-union bias in mainstream newspapers.|$|E

50|$|The 1972 UK miners' {{strike was}} a major strike {{involving}} a dispute between the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Conservative Edward Heath government over pay. It began on 9 January 1972 and ended on 28 February 1972, when the miners returned to work. The strike was called by the National Executive Committee of the NUM and ended when the miners accepted an improved pay offer in a ballot. It {{was the first time}} since 1926 that British miners had been on <b>official</b> <b>strike,</b> but there had been a widespread unofficial strike in 1969.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the coal}} mines in Britain were {{purchased}} {{by the government in}} 1947 and put {{under the control of the}} National Coal Board, with only the smaller mines left in private ownership. The NUM had campaigned for nationalisation for decades and, once it was achieved, sought to work with the NCB in managing the industry and discouraged strikes. Under the chairmanship of Alf Robens, pit closures became widespread as coal's place in energy generation declined. The NUM leadership continued to resist calls for strike action, but an unofficial strike began in 1969 after a conference pledge on the hours of surface-workers was not acted upon. This was a watershed moment that led to increased spending on the coal industry and a much slower rate of pit closures, as well as the election of more militant officials to the NUM leadership. Under the government of Ted Heath, an <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> in 1972 won increased wages after the Wilberforce Commission. Less than two years later, Heath called a general election over another <b>official</b> <b>strike,</b> called after an overtime ban had led to a Three Day Week in Britain, and lost the election to the Labour Party. The wage demands were then met and spending on the industry continued to increase, including the establishment of the new Selby Coalfield.|$|E

5000|$|There {{had been}} some {{violence}} on miners' picket lines during the unofficial strike of 1969 and the <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> of 1972. [...] Aware of the damage {{that could be done}} to the Labour Party's electoral prospects by media coverage of picket-line violence, the NUM instituted strict controls over pickets. [...] Pickets had to wear armbands saying [...] "Official picket" [...] and had to be authorised by areas. [...] Unlike in 1972, students were discouraged from joining miners' picket lines. [...] Every picket line had to be authorised by the local NUM area with a chief picket to ensure that no violence took place.|$|E
50|$|The <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> of Janitors for Justice in Los Angeles {{began on}} April 3, 1990. The janitors marched and held demonstrations during the daytime for the 3 weeks. To help their cause, many {{religious}} leaders, community leaders, and politicians joined {{the action of}} the janitors and supported their protests. The archbishop of Los Angeles, Cardinal Roger Mahony, held a special mass for the janitors. Also, mayor Richard Riordan joined the campaign by voicing his support for the janitors and their union.The janitors in Los Angeles stayed on strike until April 22. By this time, they had reached a contract that guaranteed at least a 22% raise over the next three years.|$|E
5000|$|The Gazette first {{appeared}} {{on the morning of}} 5 May. It was highly patriotic and condemnatory of the strikers, becoming a very effective means of propaganda for the government. The TUC produced its own paper, the British Worker (subtitled <b>Official</b> <b>Strike</b> News Edition) to attempt to counter it. The Gazette easily outsold its rival, with circulation rising from more than 200,000 copies for the first issue to more than 2,000,000. From issue 4, the masthead contained the invitation [...] "Please pass on this copy or display it". The Gazette ran to only eight editions before the strike collapsed; the last edition had the headline [...] "General Strike Off".|$|E

5|$|After her obverse {{design was}} approved, Goodacre visited the Philadelphia Mint {{engraving}} department {{six times in}} order to finalize the designs. Rogers' reverse design was also modified before production began. In his original proposal, mountainous scenery was depicted beneath the flying eagle; this was removed and the positions of other reverse design features were altered before Rubin gave final approval. The composition selected for the new coin included a cladding of manganese brass (containing about 77% copper, 12% zinc, 7% manganese, and 4% nickel) over a pure copper core. This composition was chosen because it would give the coin a distinctive golden color while being electromagnetically identical to its predecessor, the copper-nickel Susan B. Anthony dollar. The first <b>official</b> <b>striking</b> of the Sacagawea dollar took place on November 18, 1999, during a ceremony in which dignitaries and other invited guests each struck individual examples of the coins. Because the coins were struck before 2000, it was not legal to release them during the first strike ceremonies. Instead, the coins were saved and later sent to the dignitaries who struck them. Full-scale production began shortly after the ceremonial strikings.|$|R
5000|$|The strike {{began when}} irked umpires {{filed a lawsuit}} with the National Labor Relations Board Florida against PBUC in mid-March {{on the grounds that}} PBUC {{threatened}} to fire those umpires who decided to strike. There was some speculation that the AMLU union umpires intended to strike in early 2006, just after their contracts expired in late 2005. However, the rumors turned out to be insubstantial. When it was time to renew the expired contract, the AMLU umpires demanded salary increases which the PBUC was unwilling to pay. It was decided then that the umpires would go on strike. The umpires refused to report for Spring Training, marking the beginning of their <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> of 2006. The first game of Minor League Baseball on Thursday, April 4, 2006 began with a replacement umpire.|$|E
5000|$|One {{method of}} {{inhibiting}} or ending a strike is firing union {{members who are}} striking which can result in elimination of the union. Although this has happened it is rare due to laws regarding firing and [...] "right to strike" [...] having {{a wide range of}} differences in the US depending on whether union members are public or private sector. Laws also vary country to country. In the UK, [...] "It is important to understand that there is no right to strike in UK law." [...] Employees who strike risk dismissal, unless it is an <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> (one called or endorsed by their union) in which case they are protected from unlawful dismissal, and cannot be fired for at least 12 weeks. UK laws regarding work stoppages and strikes are defined within the Employment Relations Act 1999 and the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.|$|E
50|$|On Friday, April 5, 1968, the vigil {{began in}} front of the Duke Chapel on West Campus at noon. Three hours later, around 450 {{students}} and faculty marched through the rain to Duke President Douglas Knight’s house. Those protestors would remain in Knight’s house for the next several days. Saturday afternoon, they were joined by another group of about 350 faculty, workers, and students from Duke and North Carolina College, a black university. Later that evening, after multiple discussions with the students that lasted several hours, an exhausted President Knight was removed from all negotiations by his doctor due to fears of stress-related medical complications from his previous case of hepatitis. Acknowledging Knight’s illness, the protestors moved back to West Campus’ main quad on Sunday morning. Later that night, dining hall and custodial workers at Duke declared an <b>official</b> <b>strike</b> for the upcoming days. Protestors supported the strike and continued the Vigil on the main quad, camping out day and night, while boycotting classes and the dining hall. As more and more students joined the Vigil, professors helped them (and their grades) by holding their own classes on the quad.|$|E
