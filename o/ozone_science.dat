40|$|We {{now have}} several decades of {{experience}} in deriving vertical ozone profiles from the measurements of diffuse ultraviolet radiation by both ground and satellite-based instruments using Umkehr and BUV techniques. Continuing technological advances are pushing the state-of-the-art of these measurements to high spectral resolution and broader wavelength coverage. These modern instruments include the ground-based Brewer and satellite-based Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) instruments, as well as advanced instruments being developed by ESA(SCIAMACHY), Netherlands(OMI) and Japan(ODUS). However, {{one of the issues}} that remains unresolved is the 0 - 30 km ozone profile information retrievable from these measurements. Though it is commonly believed that both the Umkehr and the satellite-based BUV techniques have very limited profile information below 30 km, there are those who argue that the data from these instruments should continue to be reported in this altitude range for they compare well with ozonesondes and hence there is useful scientific information. Others claim that the limitations of the Umkehr and BUV techniques are largely due to their low spectral resolution, and that the profile information below 30 km can be greatly improved by going to high spectral resolution instruments, such as Brewer and GOME. The purpose of this paper is to provide a critical evaluation of the 0 - 30 km ozone profile information in the various UV remote sensing techniques. We use a database of individual ozone profiles created using ozonesondes and SAGE and 4 D ozone fields generated by data assimilation techniques to simulate radiances measured by the various techniques. We then apply a common inversion approach to all the methods to systematically examine how much profile information is available simply from the knowledge of total ozone, how much additional profile information is added by the traditional Dobson Umkehr and satellite buv techniques, and how much better one can do by adding additional wavelengths and by going to higher spectral resolution. An open and honest discussion of these issues is critical to provide the <b>ozone</b> <b>science</b> community a realistic assessment of the quality of data in the lower stratosphere and troposphere expected from both past and future instruments...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center TROPospheric OZone DIfferential Absorption Lidar (GSFC TROPOZ DIAL) is to measure the {{vertical}} distribution of tropospheric <b>ozone</b> for <b>science</b> investigations. Because of the important health and climate impacts of tropospheric ozone, {{it is imperative to}} quantify background photochemical ozone concentrations and ozone layers aloft, especially during air quality episodes. For these reasons, this paper addresses the necessary procedures to validate the TROPOZ retrieval algorithm and confirm that it is properly representing ozone concentrations. This paper is focused on ensuring the TROPOZ algorithm is properly quantifying ozone concentrations, and a following paper will focus on a systematic uncertainty analysis. This methodology begins by simulating synthetic lidar returns from actual TROPOZ lidar return signals in combination with a known ozone profile. From these synthetic signals, it is possible to explicitly determine retrieval algorithm biases from the known profile. This was then systematically performed to identify any areas that need refinement for a new operational version of the TROPOZ retrieval algorithm. One immediate outcome of this exercise was that a bin registration error in the correction for detector saturation within the original retrieval was discovered and was subsequently corrected for. Another noticeable outcome was that the vertical smoothing in the retrieval algorithm was upgraded from a constant vertical resolution to a variable vertical resolution to yield a statistical uncertainty of < 10 %. This new and optimized vertical-resolution scheme retains the ability to resolve fluctuations in the known ozone profile, but it now allows near-field signals to be more appropriately smoothed. With these revisions to the previous TROPOZ retrieval, the optimized TROPOZ retrieval algorithm (TROPOZ opt) has been effective in retrieving nearly 200 m lower to the surface. Also, as compared to the previous version of the retrieval, the TROPOZ opt had an overall mean improvement of 3. 5 %, and large improvements (upwards of 10 â€“ 15 % as compared to the previous algorithm) were apparent between 4. 5 and 9 km. Finally, to ensure the TROPOZ opt retrieval algorithm is robust enough to handle actual lidar return signals, a comparison is shown between four nearby ozonesonde measurements. The ozonesondes are mostly within the TROPOZ opt retrieval uncertainty bars, which implies that this exercise was quite successful...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{from the}} Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), both onboard the Aura spacecraft, {{have been used}} to produce daily global maps of column and profile ozone since August 2004. Here we compare and {{evaluate}} three strategies to obtain daily maps of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone from OMI and MLS measurements: trajectory mapping, direct profile retrieval, and data assimilation. Evaluation is based upon an assessment that includes validation using ozonesondes and comparisons with the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model (CTM). We investigate applications of the three ozone data products from near-decadal and inter-annual timescales to day-to-day case studies. Zonally averaged inter-annual changes in tropospheric ozone from all of the products in any latitude range are of the order 1 - 2 Dobson Units while changes (increases) over the 8 -year Aura record investigated [URL] vary approximately 2 - 4 Dobson Units. It is demonstrated that all of the ozone products can measure and monitor exceptional tropospheric ozone events including major forest fire and pollution transport events. Stratospheric ozone during the Aura record has several anomalous inter-annual events including stratospheric warming split events in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropics that are well captured using the data assimilation ozone profile product. Data assimilation with continuous daily global coverage and vertical ozone profile information is the best of the three strategies at generating a global tropospheric and stratospheric <b>ozone</b> product for <b>science</b> applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{thorough}} {{analysis of}} the ozone transport was carried out using the Transformed-Mean Eulerian (TEM) tracer continuity equation and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA- 40). In this budget analysis, the chemical net production term, which is calculated as the residual of the other terms, displays the correct features of a chemical sink and source term, including location and seasonality, and shows good agreement in magnitude compared to other methods of calculating ozone loss rates. This study provides further insight {{into the role of}} the eddy ozone transport and underlines its fundamental role in the recovery of the ozone hole during spring. The trend analysis reveals that the ozone hole intensification over the 1980 â€“ 2001 period is not solely related to the trend in chemical losses, but more specifically to the balance between the trends in chemical losses and ozone transport. That is because, in the Southern Hemisphere from October to December, the large increase in the chemical destruction of ozone is balanced by an equally large trend in the eddy transport, associated with a small increase in the mean transport. This study shows that the increase in the eddy transport is characterized by more poleward ozone eddy flux by transient waves in the midlatitudes and by stationary waves in the polar region. Overall, this study makes clearer the close interaction between the trends in ozone chemistry and ozone transport. It reveals that the eddy ozone transport and its long-term changes are an important natural mitigation mechanism for the ozone hole. This work also underlines the need for diagnostics of the eddy transport in chemical transport models used to investigate future <b>ozone</b> recovery. National <b>Science</b> Foundation (U. S.)

40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of atmospheric ozone (O 3) are performed routinely from many research aircraft platforms. The most common technique {{depends on the}} strong absorption of ultraviolet (UV) light by <b>ozone.</b> As atmospheric <b>science</b> advances to {{the widespread use of}} unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), there is an increasing requirement for minimizing instrument space, weight, and power while maintaining instrument accuracy, precision and time response. The design and use of a new, dual-beam, UV photometer instrument for in situ O 3 measurements is described. A polarization optical-isolator configuration is utilized to fold the UV beam inside the absorption cells, yielding a 60 -cm absorption length with a 30 -cm cell. The instrument has a fast sampling rate (2 Hz at < 200 hPa, 1 Hz at 200 â€“ 500 hPa, and 0. 5 Hz at â‰¥ 500 hPa), high accuracy (3 % excluding operation in the 300 â€“ 450 hPa range, where the accuracy may be degraded to about 5 %), and excellent precision (1. 1 Ã— 10 10 O 3 molecules cm âˆ’ 3 at 2 Hz, which corresponds to 3. 0 ppb at 200 K and 100 hPa, or 0. 41 ppb at 273 K and 1013 hPa). The size (36 l), weight (18 kg), and power (50 â€“ 200 W) make the instrument suitable for many UASs and other airborne platforms. Inlet and exhaust configurations are also described for ambient sampling in the troposphere and lower stratosphere (1000 â€“ 50 hPa) that control the sample flow rate to maximize time response while minimizing loss of precision due to induced turbulence in the sample cell. In-flight and laboratory intercomparisons with existing O 3 instruments show that measurement accuracy is maintained in flight...|$|R
