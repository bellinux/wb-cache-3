In onions, however, ethylene can suppress sprouting while the ethylene-binding inhibitor 1 - methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP) can also suppress sprout growth; yet, it is unknown how ethylene and 1 -MCP elicit the same response. In this study, onions were treated with 10 μL L(- 1) ethylene or 1 μL L(- 1) 1 -MCP individually or in combination for 24 h at 20 °C before or after curing (6 weeks) at 20 °C or 28 °C and then stored at 1 °C. Following curing, a subset of these same <b>onions</b> was <b>stored</b> separately under continuous air or ethylene (10 μL L(- 1)) at 1 °C. Onions treated with ethylene and 1 -MCP in combination after curing for 24 h had reduced sprout growth as compared with the control 25 weeks after harvest. Sprout growth following storage beyond 25 weeks was only reduced through continuous ethylene treatment. This observation was supported by a higher proportion of down- regulated genes characterized as being involved in photosynthesis, measured using a newly developed onion microarray. Physiological and biochemical data suggested that ethylene was being perceived in the presence of 1 -MCP, since sprout growth was reduced in onions treated with 1 -MCP and ethylene applied in combination but not when applied individually. A cluster of probes representing transcripts up-regulated by 1 -MCP alone but down-regulated by ethylene alone or in the presence of 1 -MCP support this suggestion.

GLC analysis of the methyl derivatives and NMR measurement of the saccharides confirmed the presence of two different structures: the structure of saccharide 1 is composed by two fructose moieties and linked by (2 → 1) linkage and was identified as inulobiose [-D-fructofuranosyl-(2 → 1) [...] D-fructopyranose].

40|$|Yellow dwarf {{of onions}} is a {{transmissible}} virus disease, of the mosaic group. The virus overwinters in the infected onion bulbs and in volunteer onion plants that live over {{winter in the}} fields. It probably is neither seed nor soil borne. Yellow dwarf symptoms are characterized by yellowing and crinkling of the leaves, which become more or less flat and droop over in the advanced stages. Flower stalks of infected mother on ion plants become yellow, twist, and curl and are shorter than normal plants. Masking of yellow dwarf symptoms occurs quite commonly in infected onion plants, and these plants {{are a source of}} inoculum for infecting healthy plants; bulbs from the plants masking symptoms when regrown produce infected plants that show disease symptoms. Plants grown from infected onion sets and those that become infected early in the growing season produce under-developed bulbs of little commercial value. Onion plants having masked infection throughout their growth period produce apparently normal plants and yields. Infected mother onion plants produce normal seed, but the seed yield is about 30 percent less than from healthy plants. Yellow Dwarf is transmissible by artificial inoculation and insect vectors. By artificial inoculations the incubation period is usually about 10 days. Onion bulbs hypodermically inoculated with juice extracted from the fleshy and dry scale leaves of infected onion bulbs failed to show infection. Inoculations made during retarded growth periods either fail to infect the plants or the symptoms are not manifested during the current growth period. Signs of the disease appear when the bulbs of such infected plants are regrown. The virus extracted from yellow dwarf infected onion leaves that mask the symptoms is infective. Yellow dwarf virus was transmitted under controlled conditions by the bean aphid (Aphis rumiscis Linn.), corn leaf aphid (Aphis maidis Fitch.), and the apple grain aphid (Rhopalosiphum prunifoliae Fitch). The yellow dwarf virus was inactivated when the viriferous juice was stored in vitro at 29 ° C. for a period of 112 hours. When infected <b>onion</b> leaves were <b>stored</b> in the open, at 29 ° C. for 100 hours, juice extracted from the leaves was non-infective. The infectivity of the virus was only slightly retarded when viriferous juice was heated 10 minutes at 70 ° C. At 75 ° C. for 10 minutes, 55 percent of the original virulence of the virus was lost. At 80 ° C. for 10 minutes, the virus was inactivated. With 10 -minute exposures the critical thermal point for the yellow dwarf virus lies between 75 and 80 ° C. Exposures as low as - 14 ° C. for 6 hours failed to inactivate yellow dwarf virus. Inoculations with dilutions of 1 - 10, 240 and above failed to infect any of the onion plants. Yellow dwarf virus inoculated into Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) bulbs, Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) bulbs and shallots (Allium sativum L.) visibly infected 60, 30 and 90 percent of the plants, respectively. Inoculations with other plant viruses, including mosaic of Chinese sacred lily (Narcissus tazetta L.) and Jonquil (Narcissus jonquilla L.) failed to infect onion plants. Only one (Riverside Sweet Spanish) of thirty-six onion varieties tested seemed to be markedly resistant. The combined effect of indexing all growing stocks of onion bulbs, producing the planting stock of bulbs in areas free from yellow dwarf and roguing out the infected volunteer onions in the fields reduced the percentage of yellow dwarf infection in the district from 40 percent in 1928 to a trace in 1933 and 1934...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 Observations of {{bacterial}} soft rot of onions in the Lake Labish area in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon showed that two distinct symptom types occur during the growing season. The most prevalent symptom type appears in infected plants as a wilting and chlorosis {{of two or more}} lower leaves which is followed closely by appearance of elongated lesions emerging from the neck and extending up the adaxial side of one or more young leaves. Although most infected plants showing these symptoms usually decay quickly, some plants may appear to partially recover if conditions unfavorable for disease development return. A second symptom type is evident in those infected plants in which the collapse of all emerged leaves occurs simultaneously. During leaf collapse, foliar color changes from dark green to grey-green and finally, with desiccation, to light tan. Two kinds of soft rot also occur commonly in <b>stored</b> <b>onions.</b> One kind of decay, commonly called "slippery skin, " is characterized by the progression of soft rot down through {{one or two of the}} outer fleshy scales. These scales turn yellowish, soft, and are foul smelling. A second kind of soft rot is characterized by the interior of the bulb being totally macerated and putrid, but only slightly discolored. Only one or two of the outer fleshy scales remain firm. This decay is commonly called "stinking rot" because of its very offensive odor. Initial appearance {{of bacterial}} soft rot in the third week of June is directly related to occurrence of rain and cool, cloudy weather in the previous week. Occurrence of such periods of inclement weather are found to be predictable when past records of local climatological conditions are analyzed. Area-wide outbreaks throughout the remainder of the growing season also are related to such periods of inclement weather. The relationship between weather and disease suggests that outbreaks of {{bacterial soft rot}} can be forecast by occurrence of such periods of inclement weather. Irrigation of onions with contaminated surface waters significantly increases the amount of bacterial soft rot in the field, at harvest time, and in storage, over that found when uncontaminated well water is used. Varying the frequency of irrigations, the rates of application, and the size of sprinkler nozzles affect the amount of soft rot in the field and in storage somewhat less than does the source of water. Longer and more frequent periods of irrigation increase the incidence of bacterial soft rot. Much of the decay seen at harvest is either soft rot which has totally decayed the bulbs and will not go into storage, or is fungal in origin. Including storage rots which are fungal in origin under the general grouping of "soft rots" inflates the estimation of losses due to bacterial soft rot. Three isolates of seventeen unknown isolates capable of decaying inoculated onion bulbs were identified as Pseudomonas cepacia. Five isolates which lack ability to produce a water-soluble fluorescent pigment and possess a nitrate reductase system were otherwise virtually identical to P. cepacia. Two additional isolates were identified as P. cichorii on the basis of physiological tests. Three other isolates were provisionally identified as members of the genus Erwinia on the basis of cell shape, flagellation, and pathogenicity. The remaining four isolates were not identified...|$|R
