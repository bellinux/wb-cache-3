40|$|Symptom {{control is}} {{fundamental}} to the nursing management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, symptom control can be problematic for individuals with IBD, which could result in symptom burden. Symptom burden is an evolving concept in the discipline of nursing and to date {{little is known about}} how the defining characteristics of this concept have been applied to symptom research in IBD. In this discussion paper, the concept <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> burden and the theory <b>of</b> unpleasant <b>symptoms</b> are explored as a basis for understanding symptom research in IBD. This is followed by a critical examination <b>of</b> previous <b>symptom</b> research in IBD. Our conclusion {{is that there is a}} need to rethink conceptual and theoretical underpinnings <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> burden when researching IBD to take account of its defining characteristics, namely symptom severity, frequency and duration, quality and distress.

5|$|Plasmapheresis and {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the {{two main}} immunotherapy treatments for GBS. Plasmapheresis attempts to reduce the body's attack on the nervous system by filtering antibodies out of the bloodstream. Similarly, administration of IVIG neutralizes harmful antibodies and inflammation. These two treatments are equally effective, but {{a combination of the}} two is not significantly better than either alone. Plasmapheresis speeds recovery when used within four weeks of the onset <b>of</b> <b>symptoms.</b> IVIG works as well as plasmapheresis when started within two weeks of the onset <b>of</b> <b>symptoms,</b> and has fewer complications. IVIG is usually used first because of its ease of administration and safety. Its use is not without risk; occasionally it causes liver inflammation, or in rare cases, kidney failure. Glucocorticoids alone have not been found to be effective in speeding recovery and could potentially delay recovery.|$|E

In this study, the outcomes of 43 consecutive cases, performed at one institution from October 1997 to October 2005, were analyzed. Mean stenosis was 84. 41 % pre-intervention and 6. 83 % post-intervention. Five of the procedures were angioplasty alone; 38 were angioplasty with stenting. Technical success was achieved in 42 out of 43 patients. The 30 -day mortality rate was 0 %. At one-month post intervention, all patients were symptom free. Ten patients redeveloped symptoms by one year. Demographic data, patient comorbidities, and indication to treat were analyzed.

Participants were recruited at admission to the hospital and provided extensive demographic and clinical data at baseline, including retrospective recall of childhood traumatic experiences using the Traumatic Antecedents Interview (TAI) and narrative responses to the Relationship Anecdote Paradigm (RAP) used to generate ratings on the Social Cognition and Object Relations Scale (SCORS). Participant symptoms were assessed at baseline and again every six to eight months for up to four years using the Symptom Checklist- 90 -Revised (SCL- 90 -R). Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was used to perform growth curve modeling <b>of</b> the <b>symptom</b> change data, which demonstrated an overall linear rate of decline and significant unexplained variability. The hypothesis that degree of childhood trauma would predict rates <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> change failed to receive support, as did other related hypotheses.

40|$|Where is the Person in Symptom Cluster Research? The Experience <b>of</b> <b>Symptom</b> Clusters in Patients with Advanced Lung Cancer This thesis {{describes}} a three-year qualitative study which {{aimed to explore}} the experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters in patients with advanced lung cancer. The study employed a patient-focused approach utilising Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) (Smith et al. 2009 a). This methodology (IPA), informed by a contextual constructionist stance, was selected to explore the experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters, for its focus on the lived experience, the context and meanings which surround such experiences and its idiographic approach. Ten patients (a sample size which is the upper limit {{of the number of}} participants advocated for studies employing IPA (Smith et al. 2009 b;Reid et al. 2005;Smith and Osborn 2004)) with advanced lung cancer took part in the study and data were collected using unstructured, in-depth interviews at two time points: on recruitment and three to five weeks later. Data were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, within the framework advocated by Smith and Osborn (2003). The study generated interesting and significant findings. The experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters in patients with advanced lung cancer was characterised by two super-ordinate themes: ‘The lived experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters and the role of context and meaning’ and ‘Symptom clusters and loss of sense of self’. The super-ordinate theme of ‘The lived experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters and the role of context and meaning’ in the first instance, illustrates that {{the participants in this study}} were experiencing symptom clusters and providing detail on the components, nature and patterning <b>of</b> the <b>symptom</b> clusters reported, particularly the way that one or two salient symptoms were commonly highlighted from all the other symptoms experienced. This super-ordinate theme also demonstrates the core role that context and meaning play in the lived experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters, with many of the participants in this study framing their experiences <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters within a fear of death, stigma and loss of sense of self. The second super-ordinate theme informing this thesis is ‘Symptom clusters and loss of sense of self’. This super-ordinate theme illustrates the impact <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters on the participants’ lives, and how this, in turn, impacted on their sense of self in a number of different ways. For some, their sense of self was compromised by the concurrent symptoms that they were experiencing, as they prevented them from undertaking roles and activities that they were accustomed to in the past. This super-ordinate theme also highlights the role of the body relative to the self, and describes how the participants’ sense of self was transiently lost during periods when they experienced <b>symptom</b> clusters <b>of</b> high severity. The findings presented also demonstrate the knock-on effect of loss of sense of self experienced, with the participants feeling like they were a burden due to their incapacitation, and at times hiding the multiple symptoms that they were experiencing, in a bid to protect their loved ones from their illness. In light of the loss of sense of self experienced, this super-ordinate theme also demonstrates how the participants employed various strategies in a bid to try and maintain a coherent and valued sense of self. The findings presented illustrate how the use of IPA facilitated the collection of data that provided an in-depth understanding of the complexity of the experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters in patients with advanced lung cancer, adding a unique contribution to this body of knowledge. The results of this study highlight the limitations of definitions that currently underpin the study <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters in patients with cancer and the current empirical base to date, particularly the way that they do not acknowledge the core role that context and meaning play in the lived experience of this phenomenon. This lack of recognition of these core elements of the patient experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters poses the risk of this body of research producing data that have limited relevance to the patient and therefore clinical practice. It is therefore proposed that the study <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters in patients with cancer needs to move away from the reductionist approach which currently dominates and to broaden its scope, to one that acknowledges the complexity of the experience <b>of</b> <b>symptom</b> clusters, the core role that context and meaning play in such experiences, and contributions that patient experience can make in advancing this important and emerging body of research...|$|R

40|$|Childhood oppositional defiant {{disorder}} (ODD) has commonly {{been thought}} {{to increase the}} risk of conduct disorder (CD) in late childhood and adolescence. However, <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CD may also emerge during preschool and middle childhood. The few studies that have examined whether ODD increases the risk of such early onset CD have produced equivocal results, potentially due to methodological issues. In this study, a community sample of Norwegian 4 -year-olds (n = 1042, 49. 9 % males) was examined bi-annually over four waves <b>of</b> data collection. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD, CD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depressive disorders were measured through interviews with parents and children using the Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment and the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment. The results showed that at all ages, more <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD predicted more <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CD at the next age of examination even after adjusting for previous CD and comorbid conditions. The effect of previous ODD on CD two years later did not differ according to gender, SES, or parental cohabitating status at any point in time. There was modest homotypical continuity in <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> CD and moderate homotypical continuity in <b>symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD. <b>Symptoms</b> <b>of</b> ODD increased from age 4 to 8 and declined to age 10.
