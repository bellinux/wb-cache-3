5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty. The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge that he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> away. The scene was popular with English artists as {{it was one of}} the few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.|$|E
25|$|The 1956 Suez Crisis {{suggested}} that Britain, financially weakened by two world wars, could not then pursue {{its foreign policy}} objectives {{on an equal footing}} with the new superpowers without sacrificing convertibility of its reserve currency as a central goal of policy. As the majority of World War II had been fought far from its national boundaries, the United States had not suffered the industrial destruction nor massive civilian casualties that marked the wartime situation of the countries in Europe or Asia. The war had reinforced the position of the United States as the world's largest long-term creditor nation and its principal supplier of goods; moreover it had built up a strong industrial and technological infrastructure that had greatly advanced its military strength into a primary position on the global stage. Despite attempts to create multinational coalitions or legislative bodies (such as the United Nations), it became increasingly clear that the superpowers had very different visions about what the post-war world <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like, and after the withdrawal of British aid to Greece in 1947, the United States took the lead in containing Soviet expansion in the Cold War.|$|E
500|$|The works Etty painted {{following}} his return {{began to show}} a departure in style from his previous efforts. While the figures in his previous original paintings had been painted from sketches of models made in the studio or life classes, from now on he began to work from memory, {{and as a consequence}} his figures began to appear more idealised; Farr (1958) describes his figures from now on as [...] less to a particular aspect of the model than to a preconceived notion of what the model <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> like".|$|E

500|$|During primary {{campaign}} speeches, Trump repeatedly called the judge a [...] "hater" [...] and {{described him as}} [...] "Spanish" [...] or [...] "Mexican" [...] (Curiel was born in Indiana to parents who had immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico). Trump also said that Curiel should recuse himself, although his attorneys {{said they did not}} plan to ask for the judge to be removed from the case. Curiel's only comment was to write in a procedural ruling that Trump has [...] "placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue". Trump's references to Curiel's ethnicity, as well as his comments that [...] "someone <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into" [...] the judge, alarmed legal experts, who expressed concern about the effects of the comments on judicial independence.|$|E

He continues, [...] "The Haustafel, therefore, is a manifesto for the new creation people of God and does not merely have the modern notion of the nuclear family in view, though certainly it includes this.

2500|$|When {{asking whether}} God's works are perfect, I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at all of}} them together, not at one isolation. [...] For {{something}} that seems imperfect when viewed alone might seem completely perfect when regarded as having a place in the world. [...] Of course, since calling everything into doubt, I haven't established that anything exists besides me and God. But, when I consider God's immense power, I can't deny that He has made — or, in any case, that He could have made — many other things, and I must therefore view myself as having a place in a universe.

2500|$|Epiphany {{is known}} in Latvia as Trijkungu diena (Three Kings Day) by Catholics or Zvaigznes diena (Star Day) by Lutherans after the custom of star singing, and the Star of Bethlehem which led the Magi to the Christ Child. In the past bright stars of fabric were sewn onto the {{background}} of dark colored quilts, representing the night sky. Epiphany was a day of enjoyment, spent in horse-drawn open sleighs, and these quilts would then be taken along to cover the laps of the merry riders. If Epiphany Day was bright and mild and the sun [...] "warmed the horses’ backs" [...] {{it was said that}} the coming year would bring only peace. If the night before Epiphany saw clear starry skies, it meant Latvia could expect a fine harvest in the coming Summer. Weaving and wood-cutting were [...] "bad luck", giving both men and women a proper holiday, and if a dog was heard barking on Epiphany one <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for his or her future spouse in that same direction. Special three corner apple cakes are eaten on this day, and as in other countries, star singing, visiting and house blessings have long been popular.|$|E

When the time comes to truly deliver to the American people, his [...] "billion dollar show" [...] will finally crumble beneath his feet," [...] Fox wrote, concluding his editorial with, [...] "I find quite sad that America, formerly the most open and cutting edge nation, has chosen to lock itself down inside concrete walls. It's tragic that fear, anger and wrath took over and pierced the hearts of their people. It will be hard to recover from this wound; but we better start working to heal as quickly as possible – and bring down the walls that blinded us in the beginning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Victor Seastrom, a {{respected}} Swedish director at MGM, {{was a good}} friend of Stiller and encouraged Mayer to meet him on a trip to Berlin. There are two recent versions of what happened next. In one, Mayer, always looking for new talent, had done his research and was interested in Stiller. He made an offer but Stiller demanded that Garbo be part of any contract, convinced that she would be an asset to his career. Mayer balked, but eventually agreed to a private viewing of Gösta Berling. He was immediately struck by Garbo's magnetism and became more interested in her than in Stiller. [...] "It was her eyes," [...] his daughter recalled him saying, [...] "I can make a star out of her." [...] In the second version, Mayer had already seen Gösta Berling before his Berlin trip, and Garbo, not Stiller, was his primary interest. On the way to the screening, Mayer said to his daughter [...] "This director is wonderful, but what we really <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at is the girl… The girl, look at the girl!" [...] After the screening, his daughter reported, he was unwavering: [...] "I'll take her without him. I'll take her with him. Number one is the girl." ...|$|E
