5|$|Undivided Keyser and Tonoloway Formations {{occur in}} the {{southern}} and southeastern parts of the Buffalo Creek watershed.

Undivided Onondaga and Old Port Formations also occur here, but take up a bigger area in the watershed. The Bald Eagle Formation occurs in small parts of the western and northwestern areas of the watershed. The Juniata Formation occurs in the same areas as the Bald Eagle Formation, as well as part of {{the northern part of the}} watershed. However, it takes up more area than the Bald Eagle Formation. The Reedsville Formation also occurs in the western and northwestern parts of the watershed. The undivided Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formations occur in a zigzagging band that goes from the northeastern to the southwestern part of the watershed. The Clinton Group <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> zigzagging band immediately north of the Bloomsburg and Mifflinville Formations. It also <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> few scattered areas in the northeastern and western parts of the watershed. The Tuscarora Formation <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> zigzagging band immediately north of the Clinton Group. The Wills Creek Formation occurs in parts of the southern and northeastern areas.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} ways of doing this: a {{two-stage}} process involving roasting followed by blast furnace extraction, carried out in separate vessels; or a direct {{process in which the}} extraction of the concentrate <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single vessel.

5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, and mice. The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|As atomic nuclei are fused in the core, they emit {{energy in}} the form of gamma rays. These photons {{interact}} with the surrounding plasma, adding to the thermal energy at the core. Stars on the main sequence convert hydrogen into helium, creating a slowly but steadily increasing proportion of helium in the core. Eventually the helium content becomes predominant, and energy production ceases at the core. Instead, for stars of more than 0.4 , fusion <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slowly expanding shell around the degenerate helium core.|$|E

5|$|Geometric {{designs on}} pottery {{of the eighth}} century BC depict scenes from the Trojan cycle, {{as well as the}} adventures of Heracles. These visual {{representations}} of myths are important for two reasons. Firstly, many Greek myths are attested on vases earlier than in literary sources: of the twelve labors of Heracles, for example, only the Cerberus adventure <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> contemporary literary text. Secondly, visual sources sometimes represent myths or mythical scenes that are not attested in any extant literary source. In some cases, the first known representation of a myth in geometric art predates its first known representation in late archaic poetry, by several centuries. In the Archaic (c. 750–c. 500 BC), Classical (c. 480–323 BC), and Hellenistic (323–146 BC) periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.|$|E

Those who have undergone pleurodesis may need two to three weeks off work to recover.|$|E

On the coast The striped honeyeater is found in swamp forests of paperbark and Casuarina, and in developed areas containing native and exotic trees and shrubs such as caravan parks, reserves, gardens, and farms and orchards.|$|E

5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge that <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> thunderstorm. It {{can be seen}} in the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E
5|$|N. menagensis {{is listed}} in CITES Appendix I, which {{prevents}} international commercial trade; it is also protected by Indonesian law. The species is often confused with other slow lorises in animal rescue centers, as it is not well-covered in field guides. The species <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of protected areas throughout its range, including some fragmented forests. Threats to the species include the illegal local exotic pet trade and habitat loss due to burning and conversion to palm oil plantations. Additionally, uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also {{a threat to the}} species.|$|E
5|$|Normal diving {{decompression}} procedures {{range from}} continuous ascent for no-stop dives, where the necessary decompression occurs during the ascent, which is {{kept to a}} controlled rate for this purpose, through staged decompression in open water or in a bell, to decompression from saturation, which generally <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decompression chamber {{that is part of}} a saturation system. Decompression may be accelerated by the use of breathing gases that provide an increased concentration differential of the inert gas components of the breathing mixture by maximizing the acceptable oxygen content.|$|E

5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|The hairpin banksia occurs {{along the}} east coast of Australia from the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, Victoria, north through New South Wales and into Queensland. It is common north to Maryborough, with disjunct populations {{occurring}} as far north as the Atherton Tableland near Cairns. It <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of habitats, from coastal heath (spinulosa and collina) and elevated rocky slopes (neoanglica and spinulosa) to inland dry sclerophyll forest dominated by eucalypts, where they form part of the understorey. Plants in exposed areas are generally considerably shorter than those in sheltered areas. It usually occurs on sand, but can be found in rocky clays or loams.|$|E
5|$|The oldest known blast {{furnaces}} in the West {{were built in}} Dürstel in Switzerland, the Märkische Sauerland in Germany, and at Lapphyttan in Sweden, where the complex was active between 1205 and 1300. At Noraskog in the Swedish parish of Järnboås, {{there have also been}} found traces of {{blast furnaces}} dated even earlier, possibly to around 1100. These early blast furnaces, like the Chinese examples, were very inefficient compared to those used today. The iron from the Lapphyttan complex was used to produce balls of wrought iron known as osmonds, and these were traded internationally – a possible reference <b>occurs</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> treaty with Novgorod from 1203 and several certain references in accounts of English customs from the 1250s and 1320s. Other furnaces of the 13th to 15th centuries have been identified in Westphalia.|$|E
