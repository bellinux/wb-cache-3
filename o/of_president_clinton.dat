25|$|Before it {{was turned}} off on May 2, 2000, typical SA errors were about 50m (164ft) {{horizontally}} and about 100m (328ft) vertically. Because SA affects every GPS receiver in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with an accurately known position can measure the SA error values and transmit them to the local GPS receivers so they may correct their position fixes. This is called Differential GPS or DGPS. DGPS also corrects for several other important sources of GPS errors, particularly ionospheric delay, so {{it continues to be}} widely used even though SA has been turned off. The ineffectiveness of SA in the face of widely available DGPS was a common argument for turning off SA, and this was finally done by order <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> in 2000.|$|E

2500|$|The Lewinsky scandal was an American {{political}} {{sex scandal}} that involved 49-year-old President Bill Clinton and 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. The sexual relationship {{took place between}} 1995 and 1996 and came to light in 1998. Clinton ended a televised speech {{with the statement that}} he did not have sexual relations with Lewinsky. [...] Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives. He was subsequently acquitted on all impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in a 21-day Senate trial. Clinton was held in civil contempt of court by Judge Susan Webber Wright for giving misleading testimony in the Paula Jones case regarding Lewinsky and was also fined $90,000 by Wright. His license to practice law was suspended in Arkansas for five years; shortly thereafter, he was disbarred from presenting cases in front of the United States Supreme Court.|$|E

On August 13, Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman privately intervened in the strike with the support <b>of</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton,</b> {{and was able to}} get the two sides talking again. Carey and the Teamsters also undertook a sophisticated public relations effort. They depicted the union members as average people (the union's spokespeople were often rank and file Teamsters), and mobilized the public's sympathy for UPS drivers by having strikers drive their regular delivery routes to give their customers information about the strike. They also made strategic use of the Internet, using the union's Web site to issue updates and put pressure on Congress. UPS also engaged in a strong public relations effort (using full-page newspaper advertisements and pressuring customers to ask the President to invoke Taft-Hartley), but most observers as well as some UPS officials agreed that the union had the better P.R. effort. A Gallup poll found that 55 percent of respondents supported the union.|$|E
