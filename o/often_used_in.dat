5|$|Rubidium and caesium are <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock {{had been}} made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions are <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> purple fireworks, and caesium is <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E

5|$|A numerically {{controlled}} oscillator (NCO) is a digital signal generator which creates a synchronous (i.e. clocked), discrete-time, discrete-valued {{representation of a}} waveform, usually sinusoidal.

5|$|Just as the Eiffel Tower is <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> {{popular culture}} to {{immediately}} locate {{a scene in}} Paris, France, the Tokyo Tower is <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the same way for Tokyo. It is used in anime and manga such as Tokyo Magnitude 8.0, Magic Knight Rayearth, Please Save My Earth, Cardcaptor Sakura, Digimon, Detective Conan, Sailor Moon, and Death Note. The tower is also frequently used in the Japanese kaiju (giant monster) film genre. It has been {{the location of the}} climactic 'battles' between Godzilla, Mothra, Gamera and King Kong (King Kong Escapes) wherein it is frequently destroyed and rebuilt. Based on the popular manga series by Ryōhei Saigan, the 2005 film Always Sanchōme no Yūhi was a nostalgic view of life in the neighbourhoods under the construction of the Tokyo Tower.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are useful for}} preventing further episodes of gout, including allopurinol, febuxostat, and probenecid. Long term medications are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout, unless destructive joint changes, tophi, or urate nephropathy exist. It is not until this point that medications are cost-effective. They are not usually started until one to two weeks after an acute flare has resolved, due to theoretical concerns of worsening the attack. They are <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> combination with either an NSAID or colchicine {{for the first three}} to six months.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew has {{two main}} {{conjugation}} types, the suffix conjugation, {{also called the}} Perfect, and the prefix conjugation, also called Imperfect. The Perfect verb form expressed {{the idea of the}} verb as a completed action, viewing it from start to finish as a whole, and not focusing on the process by which the verb came to be completed, stating it as a simple fact. This is <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the past tense, however there are some contexts in which a Perfect verb translates into the present and future tenses.|$|E
