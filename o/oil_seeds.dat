40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{nitrogen}} requirements, <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape should be cultivated after rye-grass-clover mixtures (Böhm 2007).

So, the crop rotation must be organized in another way, {{so that there is}} no competition between <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape and wheat. In two-year field trials at the experimental farm of the Institute of Organic Farming (FAL) in Trenthorst the hypothesis was tested, whether <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape with an undersown white clover is a better preceding crop to wheat compared to <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape without underseed. Additionally, the yield was compared to “wheat after ryegrass-clover mixture”. The results showed a higher yield of wheat after <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape with undersown white clover compared to the wheat after <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape without underseed. Only in one year was the yield of wheat after ryegrass-clover mixture about 0. 45 t ha- 1 higher than the yield of wheat after <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape with undersown white clover. Under the given conditions of location, the yield of wheat after “oil seed rape with an undersown white clover” is similar to that after ryegrass-clover mixture.

Twenty early lactating Holstein cows were used in a complete randomized design.

Supplementation with 7. 5 % raw sunflower seed (LS-UT) tended to decrease milk yield with 28. 37 kg day - 1 compared with the control (34. 75 kg day - 1). Milk fat percentage was increased with the HS-UT treatment that obtained 3. 71 % compared with CON that was 3. 39 % and without significant different.

The range of varia-tion in the quality of <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape required a fast and easy analytical method for the determination of the main ingredients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is known for its rapidity and accuracy and may become a useful tool in predicting the quality of organic growing <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape. The aim of the investigations was to evaluate the ability of NIRS to predict the content of oil and fatty acids in full fat <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> rape without any preparation. Spectra from 125 rape samples were scanned in the spectral range from 1000 to 2500 nm and used to develop NIRS equations. Two-third of the samples were used in the calibration set and the remaining samples in the validation set. NIRS equations were calculated by partial least square regression and different pretreat-ments of spectra. Prediction was successful for oil content (r= 0. 97) with an standard error of prediction of 0. 42. The fatty acids were also successfully predicted with re-gression coefficients from 0. 86 to 0. 97 with exception of the erucic acid. But the con-tent of erucic acid is quite low, the prediction of the content was not satisfying.
