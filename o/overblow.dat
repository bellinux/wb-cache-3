5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to <b>overblow</b> at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
25|$|In June 1965, he {{went into}} Van Gelder's studio with ten other musicians (including Shepp, Pharoah Sanders, Freddie Hubbard, Marion Brown, and John Tchicai) to record Ascension, a 40-minute piece that {{included}} solos by the young avant-garde musicians (as well as Coltrane), and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. After recording with the quartet {{over the next few}} months, Coltrane invited Sanders to join the band in September 1965. While Coltrane frequently used over-blowing as an emotional exclamation-point, Sanders would <b>overblow</b> entire solos, resulting in a constant screaming and screeching in the altissimo range of the instrument.|$|E
500|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} the tone holes varies {{the length of}} the pipe, changing the resonant frequencies of the enclosed air column and hence the pitch. A clarinetist moves between the chalumeau and clarion registers through use of the register key; clarinetists call the change from chalumeau register to clarion register [...] "the break". The open register key stops the fundamental frequency from being reinforced, and the reed is forced to vibrate at three times the speed it was originally. This produces a note a twelfth above the original note. Most instruments <b>overblow</b> at two times the speed of the fundamental frequency (the octave), but as the clarinet acts as a closed pipe system, the reed cannot vibrate at twice its original speed because it would be creating a 'puff' of air at the time the previous 'puff' is returning as a rarefaction. This means it cannot be reinforced and so would die away. The chalumeau register plays fundamentals, whereas the clarion register, aided by the register key, plays third harmonics (a perfect twelfth higher than the fundamentals). The first several notes of the altissimo range, aided by the register key and venting with the first left-hand hole, play fifth harmonics (a major seventeenth, a perfect twelfth plus a major sixth, above the fundamentals). The clarinet is therefore said to <b>overblow</b> at the twelfth and, when moving to the altissimo register, seventeenth. By contrast, nearly all other woodwind instruments <b>overblow</b> at the octave or (like the ocarina and tonette) do not <b>overblow</b> at all. A clarinet must have holes and keys for nineteen notes, a chromatic octave and a half from bottom E to B, in its lowest register to play the chromatic scale. This overblowing behavior explains the clarinet's great range and complex fingering system. The fifth and seventh harmonics are also available, sounding a further sixth and fourth (a flat, diminished fifth) higher respectively; these are the notes of the altissimo register. This is also why the inner [...] "waist" [...] measurement is so critical to these harmonic frequencies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Overblowing</b> is a {{technique}} used while playing a wind instrument which, primarily through manipulation of the supplied air (versus, e.g., a fingering change or operation of a slide), causes the sounded pitch to jump to a higher one. Depending on the instrument (and less so on the player), <b>overblowing</b> may involve a change in air pressure, in {{the point at which}} the air is directed, or in the resonance characteristics of the chamber formed by the mouth and throat of the player (a feature of embouchure). In some instruments, <b>overblowing</b> may also involve the direct manipulation of the vibrating reed(s), and/or the pushing of a register key while otherwise leaving fingering unaltered. With the exception of harmonica <b>overblowing,</b> the pitch jump is from one vibratory mode of the reed or air column, e.g., its fundamental, to an overtone. <b>Overblowing</b> can be done deliberately in order to get a higher pitch, or inadvertently, resulting in the production of a note other than that intended.|$|R
50|$|In brass instruments, <b>overblowing</b> (sometimes {{combined}} with tightening of the embouchure) produces a different harmonic.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{modifications}} to factory-built harmonicas {{can increase the}} sensitivity of the instrument and make <b>overblows</b> far easier to achieve. Lowering the reed gap (over the reedplate) and slightly narrowing reed slots (a process called embossing) are probably the most common customization methods used to set up overblow-friendly harmonicas. Because it involves both reeds in the chamber, <b>overblowing</b> is not possible on fully valved harmonicas such as the button chromatic.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1965, Coltrane and 10 {{other musicians}} {{recorded}} Ascension, a 40-minute-long piece without breaks that included adventurous solos by young avante-garde musicians {{as well as}} Coltrane, and was controversial primarily for the collective improvisation sections that separated the solos. [...] Dave Liebman later called it [...] "the torch that lit the free jazz thing.". [...] After recording with the quartet {{over the next few}} months, Coltrane invited Pharoah Sanders to join the band in September 1965.

2500|$|The {{saxophone}} {{was developed}} in 1846 by Adolphe Sax, a Belgian instrument maker, flautist, and clarinetist. Born in Dinant and originally based in Brussels, he moved to Paris in 1842 to establish his musical instrument business. [...] Prior to {{his work on the}} saxophone, he had made several improvements to the bass clarinet by improving its keywork and acoustics and extending its lower range. Sax was also a maker of the then-popular ophicleide, a large conical brass instrument in the bass register with keys similar to a woodwind instrument. His experience with these two instruments allowed him to develop the skills and technologies needed to make the first saxophones. [...] As an outgrowth of his work improving the bass clarinet, [...] Sax began developing an instrument with the projection of a brass instrument and the agility of a woodwind. He wanted it to <b>overblow</b> at the octave, unlike the clarinet, which rises in pitch by a twelfth when overblown. An instrument that overblows at the octave has identical fingering for both registers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Overblowing</b> is an {{important}} modern technique among players of some harmonica types, notably the standard Richter-tuned harmonica or blues harp. Combined with note bending, it yields the full chromatic scale across the instrument's range. Though pioneered on Richter-tuned harps, <b>overblowing,</b> or the related overdrawing, is possible on any harmonica having both a blow reed and a draw reed mounted in the same airway (i.e., behind the same mouthpiece hole), but no windsaver valve on the higher-pitched of the two reeds. While superficially resembling in its pitch-jumping effect the <b>overblowing</b> of other (beating-reed, aerophone, brass) wind instruments, harmonica <b>overblowing</b> is completely unrelated {{from the standpoint of}} the underlying physics. It does not induce the sounding reed to sound a higher overtone - free reed overtones do not even begin to approximate the harmonic series nor are they particularly musical - nor does it induce a higher vibrational mode in air in a pipe or other resonator - harmonicas generally have no such resonator. Rather, it silences the sounding reed while eliciting sound from the formerly silent one - the one that normally responds to air flowing in the opposite direction. A key fact for understanding both <b>overblowing</b> and bending on such an instrument: a free reed mounted over a reedplate slot will normally respond to air flows that pull it initially into the slot, i.e., as a closing reed, but, at only slightly higher air pressure from the opposite side, will also respond as an opening reed; the resulting pitch is generally just less than a semitone higher than the closing-reed pitch.|$|R

60|$|Finding it {{was likely}} to <b>overblow,</b> we took in our sprit-sail, and stood by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns were all fast, and handed the mizen. The ship lay very broad off, so we thought it better {{spooning}} before the sea, than trying or hulling. We reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm was hard a-weather. The ship wore bravely. We belayed the fore down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous. We hauled off upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped {{the man at the}} helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we had sea-room. When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail, and brought the ship to. Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail. Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at south-west. We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie.|$|E

50|$|In woodwind {{and brass}} instruments, the word {{register}} usually distinguishes pitch ranges produced using different normal modes {{of the air}} column, with higher registers produced by <b>overblowing.</b> Often the timbres of different woodwind instrument registers tend to be markedly different.|$|R

5000|$|Overblown notes can {{be played}} as softly as any other note on the instrument. Proper embouchure alone will cause the closing reed to cease {{vibrating}} and induce the opening reed to start. <b>Overblow</b> notes are naturally flat but can be bent up to the correct pitch. An <b>overblow</b> consists of two steps: the closing reed must be choked (silenced), and the opening reed must be sounded. A clean <b>overblow</b> note requires that both of these steps be executed simultaneously. Overblowing technique also {{has been described as}} not much different from doing a blow bend, except on a draw-bend-only reed (holes 1-6), and doing a draw bend embouchure, except on a blow-bend-only reed (holes 7-10).
