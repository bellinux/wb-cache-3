5|$|Although President Jimmy Carter {{tried to}} place another limit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> race with a SALT II {{agreement}} in 1979, his efforts were {{undermined by the}} other events that year, including the Iranian Revolution and the Nicaraguan Revolution, which both ousted pro-US regimes, and his retaliation against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December.|$|E
5|$|Moscow {{had built}} up a {{military}} that consumed as much as 25percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product {{at the expense of}} consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which saw at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species in}} this order have five arms and {{two rows of}} tube feet with suckers. There are {{conspicuous}} marginal plates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> and disc. Some species have paxillae and in some, the main pedicellariae are clamp-like and recessed into the skeletal plates. This group includes the cushion stars, the leather star and the sea daisies.|$|E

5|$|The three-minute ride {{features}} 32 suspended twin seats (64 seats altogether) {{spinning around}} a central tower.

5|$|Before his succession, George {{was granted}} the royal arms differenced by a label of five points Azure, the centre point bearing a fleur-de-lis Or on 27 July 1749. Upon his father's death, {{and along with}} the dukedom of Edinburgh and the {{position}} of heir-apparent, he inherited his difference of a plain label of three points Argent. In an additional difference, the crown of Charlemagne was not usually depicted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of the heir, only on the Sovereign's.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 15th century, {{the cross}} {{with a double}} {{traverse}} is seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of archbishops, and relates to their processional cross and the jurisdiction it symbolizes. Except for cardinals of the Roman Curia, most cardinals head an archdiocese and use an archiepiscopal cross on their arms. Other cardinals use a simple Latin cross, as {{is found in the}} arms of Cardinal Joseph Zen, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, because Hong Kong is not an archdiocese.|$|E
5|$|MI6 sends James Bond, agent 007, {{into the}} field to spy on a {{terrorist}} arms bazaar on the Russian border.

Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros, and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin {{is a large}} oil and tempera on oak panel painting, usually dated between 1435 and 1440, {{attributed}} to the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. Housed in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, it shows Luke the Evangelist, patron saint of artists, sketching the Virgin Mary as she nurses the Child Jesus. The figures are positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards a courtyard, river, town and landscape. The enclosed garden, illusionistic carvings of Adam and Eve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of Mary's throne, and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting's many iconographic symbols.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{this order}} have a small, {{inflexible}} disc and 6–20 long, thin arms, which they use for suspension feeding. They {{have a single}} series of marginal plates, a fused ring of disc plates, a reduced number of aboral plates, crossed pedicellariae, and several series of long spines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms.</b> They live almost exclusively in deep-sea habitats, although a few live in shallow waters in the Antarctic. In some species, the tube feet have rounded tips and lack suckers.|$|E
5|$|No skin {{impressions}} {{have ever}} been found in association with fossils of Deinonychus. Nonetheless, {{the evidence suggests that}} the Dromaeosauridae, including Deinonychus, had feathers. The genus Microraptor is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than Deinonychus, and within the same family. Multiple fossils of Microraptor preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms,</b> legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. Velociraptor is geologically younger than Deinonychus, but even more closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of Velociraptor has been found with quill knobs on the ulna. Quill knobs are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.|$|E

5|$|Skåne was a Danish {{province}} without heraldic arms {{before its}} transfer to Sweden in 1658, and its arms, granted in 1660, {{are based on}} the city of Malmö's Danish era arms. The Malmö arms were granted in 1437 during the Kalmar Union by Eric of Pomerania and contains a Pomeranian griffin. The Skåne coat of arms was created for the funeral of Charles X Gustav of Sweden in 1660, and it is typically represented with a ducal coronet. The coat of arms for the new Skåne County, formed in 1997, was based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>arms</b> of Kristianstad County and Malmöhus County, which in turn were based on the province arms (both former counties were divided from the old Skåne province); the Skåne County arms are the province arms with different colors. When the county arms is shown crowned with a Swedish royal crown, it represents the County Administrative Board, which is the regional presence of royal government authority.

5|$|Canada's {{national}} {{symbols are}} influenced by natural, historical, and indigenous sources. The use of the maple leaf as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's current and previous flags, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arms</b> of Canada. The Arms of Canada is closely modelled after the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom with French and distinctive Canadian elements replacing or added to those derived from the British version. The Great Seal of Canada is a governmental seal used for purposes of state, being set on letters patent, proclamations and commissions, for representatives of the Queen and for the appointment of cabinet ministers, lieutenant governors, senators, and judges. Other prominent symbols include the beaver, Canada goose, and common loon, the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and more recently the totem pole and Inuksuk. Canadian coins feature many of these symbols: the loon on the $1 coin, the Arms of Canada on the 50¢ piece, the beaver on the nickel. The penny, removed from circulation in 2013, featured the maple leaf. The Queen' s image appears on $20 bank notes, and on the obverse of all current Canadian coins.|$|E
