However, that July, U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes {{called for a}} conference in Washington D.C. to be held that November. The stated goal was to curb the rapidly growing and {{extremely}} expensive naval construction programs. It was obvious to the General Board that the expensive new battlecruisers, which some thought were already obsolete, would be very attractive targets for cancellation. Accordingly, studies were done exploring the possibilities of converting {{one or more of}} the battlecruisers to different uses: <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> at a conversion to an aircraft carrier, while another contemplated a conversion to an Atlantic ocean liner.|$|E
25|$|Pregabalin was {{synthesized}} in 1990 as an anticonvulsant. It {{was invented}} by medicinal chemist Richard Bruce Silverman at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Silverman {{is best known for}} identifying the drug pregabalin as a possible treatment for epileptic seizures. During 1988 to 1990, Ryszard Andruszkiewicz, a visiting research fellow, synthesized a series of molecules for Silverman. <b>One</b> <b>looked</b> particularly promising. The molecule was effectively shaped for transportation into the brain, where it activated L-Glutamic acid decarboxylase, an enzyme. Silverman hoped that the enzyme would increase production of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and block convulsions. Eventually, the set of molecules were sent to Parke-Davis Pharmaceuticals for testing. The drug was approved in the European Union in 2004. The US received FDA approval for use in treating epilepsy, diabetic neuropathic pain, and postherpetic neuralgia in December 2004. Pregabalin then appeared on the US market under the brand name Lyrica in fall of 2005.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s and 1930s many skyscrapers were {{designed}} in an Art Deco style. This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an [...] "aesthetic of simple, sculptural mass" [...] {{with the use}} of rich colour and ornamentation on the surfaces of the buildings. The aim was {{to call attention to the}} increasingly complex three-dimensional shape of the skyscraper, in contrast to earlier styles which could be critiqued, as historian Larry Ford suggests, as being merely [...] "short buildings made taller with additional stories". Windows were de-emphasised in favour of creating a strong sense of shape and mass, the surrounding walls treated as textured fabric, dressing the building underneath. Skyscrapers of this period typically lost their ornamental horizontal divisions, being broken up by physical changes in their shape as <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> up the building, the whole forming a striking silhouette.|$|E

Several Norwegian {{scientists}} {{argued against}} an extension, Kreyberg saying, [...] "If it {{is a question}} of handing Dr. Reich over to the Gestapo, then I will fight that, but if one could get rid of him in a decent manner, that would be the best." [...] The writer Sigurd Hoel asked: [...] "When did it become a reason for deportation that <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?" [...] Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich's sociological works were [...] "a distinct and valuable contribution toward science," [...] and from A.S.

500|$|After {{the death}} of Dejan, his province, except for the župe of Žegligovo and Upper Struma, was {{appropriated}} to nobleman Vlatko Paskačić, whose hereditary land was Slavište directly to the south. [...] Vukašin Mrnjavčević, of whom there are no notable mentions until 1365, became more powerful (ultimately the most powerful nobleman in Macedonia) after the deaths of Vojislav Vojinović, Dejan and despot Jovan Oliver (whose status in Macedonia was very high), as Vukašin's rise would have been unlikely during the lifetime of these men. Vukašin's younger brother Jovan Uglješa is also thought to {{have participated in the}} dismemberment of Dejan's province, as he used this chance to take the provinces which bordered on the oblast (province) of Ser (Serres). No <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> to the young sons of Dejan who would later become very important. Dejan's death benefited Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa, not so much in territorial expansion (which is not so sure), but because Dejan's disappearance ended any stronger candidate to counter the Mrnjavčević family.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{enjoyed the}} game's visuals. Entertainment Weekly Adam B. Vary thought the game {{did a good}} job at recreating {{the look and feel of}} the {{original}} manga. Walter called the game's visuals [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "striking", and thought that they were what would get people from places where the manga had not yet become popular interested in the game. Eurogamer Tom Bramwell described the visuals as distinctive, and at times reminiscent of Jet Set Radio. Smith called GioGio's Bizarre Adventure among the most faithful manga-to-video game adaptations he had seen, praising the 3D recreation of the manga's artwork, and said that its use of effects such as speed lines and visual katakana sound effects made it feel familiar. He noted that the environments looked [...] "a little crude" [...] and with blurry textures if <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> at details up close, but that they looked impressive from a distance. Reviewers at Famitsu also enjoyed how the game reproduced the look of the manga in 3D, but noted that the presentation of the story felt insufficient for people who have not read the Vento Aureo manga, and that it seemed mostly targeted towards people who already were fans of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.|$|E

500|$|Ralph Waldo Emerson never {{joined the}} Brook Farm community, despite several invitations. He wrote to Ripley on December 15, 1840, of his [...] "conviction that the Community {{is not good}} for me". He also {{questioned}} the idealism of the community, particularly its optimism that all members would equally share responsibility and workload. As he wrote, [...] "The country members naturally were surprised to observe that one man ploughed all day and <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> out of a window all day... and both received at night the same wages". Twenty years later, Emerson publicly denounced the experiment in his collection of essays titled The Conduct of Life. Charles Lane, {{one of the founders of}} another community called Fruitlands, thought the Brook Farmers lived a lifestyle that did not sacrifice enough. As he said, they were [...] "playing away their youth and day-time in a miserably joyous frivolous manner". Like other communities, Brook Farm was criticized for its potential to break up the nuclear family because of its focus on working as a larger community. After its conversion to Fourierism, the Transcendentalists showed less support for the experiment. Henry David Thoreau questioned the community members' idealism and wrote in his journal, [...] "As for these communities, I think I had rather keep bachelor's hall in hell than go to board in heaven". Even Sophia Ripley later questioned their original optimism, referring to it as [...] "childish, empty, & sad".|$|E

[...] Computer security expert Bruce Schneier {{wrote in his}} 2009 book Schneier on Security that Boston officials were [...] "ridiculed" [...] for their overreaction to the incident. Schneier wrote, [...] "Almost no <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> beyond the finger pointing and jeering to discuss exactly why the Boston authorities overreacted so badly.

Kelly later wrote that he was disappointed in the video, [...] "this <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> like an ad for coffee or sheets... had worked with us on a couple of videos previously ... that had turned out really well.

No <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> after the interest of his people, maintained the influence of the kingdom and managed the state administration better than he did." [...] Before his death he instructed his son and heir Uthman to remain on the defensive with the Marinid kingdom, but to expand into Hafsid territory if possible. Under Yaghmurasen's leadership, and later under Abu Hammu II (1359–89), the kingdom pursued an expansionary policy, pushing towards Fez in the west and into the Chelif valley and Béjaïa in the east.|$|E

2500|$|... and so {{declines to}} delve very far into that topic. Dawkins {{declares}} {{that there was}} no first person, {{to make the point that}} evolutionary biologists use the term species to demark differences in gene composition— over often thousands of generations of separation— rather than from any one generation to the next. To illustrate this he undertakes a thought-experiment involving family photographs. If, hypothetically, there existed a complete set of photographs of all one's direct male ancestors arranged in order of birth date (or hatch date) from youngest to oldest stretching back millions of generations, from one generation to the next one would not perceive much difference between any two adjacent pictures—looking at a picture of one's grandfather or great-grandfather one is looking at a picture of a human—but if <b>one</b> <b>looked</b> at a picture from 185 million generations back one would see an image of some kind of fish-like animal. Dawkins stresses this point by saying the offspring of any sexually reproducing life form belongs in almost all cases to the same species as do its parents, with the exception of unviable hybrids such as mules.|$|E
