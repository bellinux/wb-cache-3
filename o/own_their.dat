5|$|Adolescence and adulthood: When rats forage {{on their}} <b>own,</b> <b>their</b> food choices are {{influenced}} by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites. They smell foods on the fur, whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten. This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats.|$|E

5|$|Although Lenin was {{influenced}} by agrarian-socialist Pëtr Tkachëvi, he and the Social-Democrats clashed with the Socialist–Revolutionary Party (SR), who were inspired by the defunct People's Freedom Party. Advocating a Narodnik agrarian-socialist platform, the SR emphasised the revolutionary role of the peasant, who in 1881 numbered 75 million, {{in contrast to the}} 1 million urban proletariat in Russia. In contrast, the Marxists believed that the peasant class' primary motivation was to <b>own</b> <b>their</b> land, and that they were capitalists; instead, they saw the proletariat as the revolutionary force to advance socialism.|$|E
5|$|Elcor was {{a mining}} location, {{built by the}} mining company to house the workers for its mines. People were allowed to <b>own</b> <b>their</b> homes, but the land on which the houses stood belonged to the mining company. After the Corsica mine closed in 1954, Pickands Mather and Company ordered the {{residents}} to vacate the property {{so that it could}} reclaim the land; by 1956, Elcor was completely abandoned. The desolate property changed hands often through acquisitions, mergers and bankruptcies. In 1993 the Inland Steel Company began stripping the overburden from Elcor's former location for what is now the Minorca mine.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{original}} deployment plans for Zeus had been a defensive system for SAC. The Air Force argued against such a system, in favor of building more ICBMs of their <b>own.</b> <b>Their</b> logic was that every Soviet missile launched in a counterforce strike could destroy a single US missile. If both forces had similar numbers of missiles, such an attack would leave both forces with few remaining missiles to launch a counterstrike. Adding Zeus would {{reduce the number of}} losses on the US side, helping ensure a counterstrike force would survive. However, the same was true if the US built more ICBMs instead. The Air Force was far more interested in building its own missiles than the Army's, {{especially in the case of}} Zeus, which appeared to be easily outwitted.|$|E
