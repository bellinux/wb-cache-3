She also found that the close air above her head was continually freshened by the interchange of currents of lower temperature from below,--as if the whole vast field had a circulation of its own,--and that the adobe beneath her feet was gratefully cool to her tread. There was no dust, as he had said; what had at first half suffocated her seemed to be some stimulating aroma of creation that filled the narrow green aisles, and now imparted a strange vigor and excitement to her as she walked along. Meantime her guide was not conversationally idle. Now, no doubt, she {{had never seen anything like}} this before? It was <b>ordinary</b> <b>wheat,</b> only it was grown on adobe soil--the richest in the valley. These stalks, she could see herself, were ten and twelve feet high. That was the trouble, they all ran too much to stalk, though the grain yield was [...] "suthen' pow'ful." [...] She could tell that to her friends, for he reckoned she was the only young lady that had ever walked under such a growth. Perhaps she was new to Californy? He thought so from the start. Well, this was Californy, and this was not the least of the ways it could [...] "lay over" [...] every other country on God's yearth. Many folks thought it was the gold and the climate, but she could see for herself what it could do with wheat. He wondered if her brother had ever told, her of it? No, the stranger wasn't her brother. Nor cousin, nor company? No; only the hired driver from a San Jose hotel, who was takin' her over to Major Randolph's. Yes, he knew the old major; the ranch was a pretty place, nigh unto three miles further on. Now that he knew the driver was no relation of hers he didn't mind telling her that the buggy was a [...] "rather old consarn," [...] and the driver didn't know his business. Yes, it might be fixed up so as to take her over to the major's; there was one of their own men--a young fellow--who could do anything that COULD be done with wood and iron,--a reg'lar genius!--and HE'D tackle it. It might take an hour, but she'd find it quite cool waiting in the shanty. It was a rough place, for they only camped out there during the season to look after the crop, and lived at their own homes the rest of the time. Was she going to stay long at the major's? He noticed she had not brought her trunk with her. Had she known the major's wife long? Perhaps she thought of settling in the neighborhood? ...|$|E

40|$|The Bachelor's Thesis {{covers the}} {{literary}} review about wheat {{in the context}} of antioxidation activity of its coloured varieties. The theoretical part deals with wheat and its properties, its origin, taxonomy, morphological structure and chemical composition. Furthermore, it studies the methods of getting antioxidation activity data - ABTS, DPPH and ORAC. The aim of the practical part is to compare the antioxidation activity of the chosen wheat samples either with the purple-coloured or blue-coloured grain, with the <b>ordinary</b> redcoloured <b>wheat</b> grain. The outcomes contributed to verification of the antioxidant-active substances in case of the wheat types with the typically red-coloured grain...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{obesity is}} one of the major health problems, a {{so-called}} epidemic of the developed world. Obesity arises through an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, so it is important for products to have a balanced nutritional composition. The aim of this study is to prepare high-protein pasta with high nutritional quality, with emphasis on its amino acid composition, as ordinary durum pasta lacks lysine and threonine. <b>Ordinary</b> durum <b>wheat</b> pasta contains, on average, 77 % carbohydrate, and can have even less than 10 % protein. It is therefore oft en excluded from normal energy-restricted diets, and especially from low-carbohydrate diets. In this study pasta that can satisfy the nutritional requirements of a low-carbohydrate diet and is suitable for daily use was developed and evaluated. Protein-enhanced pasta was produced by adding high amounts of plant protein extract (40 % dry matter) without (plain high-protein pasta) or with 3 % dried spinach powder (high-protein spinach pasta) to durum wheat semolina. According to the sensory analysis data, the addition of 40 % of plant protein extract satisfied sensory and nutritional requirements, allowing further development and evaluation for possible marketing. This analysis shows that these high-protein neutral and spinach pasta contain 36. 4 and 39. 6 g of protein per 100 g of dry mass, 12. 07 and 14. 70 g of total essential amino acids per 100 g of dry mass, and a high content of branched-chain amino acids, i. e. 5. 54 and 6. 65 g per 100 g of dry mass, respectively. This therefore represents a true alternative to durum wheat pasta for low-carbohydrate diets...|$|R

The pan is oiled {{in order to allow}} for easy removal as well as to create a fried effect {{on the outside of the}} crust. In {{addition}} to <b>ordinary</b> <b>wheat</b> flour, the pizza dough may contain corn meal, semolina, or food coloring, giving the crust a distinctly yellowish tone. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.|$|E
5000|$|Gnocchi ( [...] or , , {{singular}} gnocco) {{are various}} thick, small, and soft dough dumplings {{that may be}} made from semolina, <b>ordinary</b> <b>wheat</b> flour, egg, cheese, potato, breadcrumbs, cornmeal, or similar ingredients, with or without flavourings of herbs, vegetables, cocoa, or prunes. The dough for gnocchi is most often rolled out, then {{cut into small pieces}} of {{about the size of a}} cork. [...] They are then pressed with a fork or a cheese grater to make ridges which hold sauce. Alternatively, they are simply cut into little lumps. Gnocchi are usually eaten as a replacement for pasta as a first course, but they can also be served as a contorno (side dish) to some main courses.|$|E
5000|$|Even {{in antiquity}} {{there were a}} wide variety of breads. In ancient times the Greek bread was barley bread: Solon {{declared}} that wheaten bread might only be baked for feast days. By the 5th century BC bread could be purchased in Athens from a baker's shop, and in Rome, Greek bakers appeared in the 2nd century BC, as Hellenized Asia Minor was added to Roman dominion as the province of Asia; the foreign bakers of bread were permitted to form a collegium. In the Deipnosophistae, the author Athenaeus (c.A.D.170 - c. 230) describes some of the bread, cakes, and pastries available in the Classical world. Among the breads mentioned are griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit. The type and quality of flours used to produce bread could also vary, as noted by Diphilus when he declared [...] "bread made of wheat, as compared with that made of barley, is more nourishing, more digestible, and in every way superior." [...] In order of merit, the bread made from refined sieved flour comes first, after that bread from <b>ordinary</b> <b>wheat,</b> and then the unbolted, made of flour that has not been sifted." [...] The essentiality of bread in the diet was reflected in the name {{for the rest of the}} meal: ópson, [...] "condiment", i.e. bread's accompaniment, whatever it might be.|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that elevated amylose content in products from rice, corn, and barley induce lower postprandial glycaemic responses {{and higher levels of}} resistant starch (RS). Consumption of slowly digestible carbohydrates and RS has been associated with health benefits such as decreased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. To evaluate the postprandial glucose and insulin responses in vivo to bread products based on a novel wheat genotype with elevated amylose content (38 %). Bread was baked from a unique wheat genotype with elevated amylose content, using baking conditions known to promote amylose retrogradation. Included test products were bread based on whole grain wheat with elevated amylose content (EAW), EAW with added lactic acid (EAW-la), and <b>ordinary</b> whole grain <b>wheat</b> bread (WGW). All test breads were baked at pumpernickel conditions (20 hours, 120 °C). A conventionally baked white wheat bread (REF) was used as reference. Resistant starch (RS) content was measured in vitro and postprandial glucose and insulin responses were tested in 14 healthy subjects. The results showed a significantly higher RS content (on total starch basis) in breads based on EAW than in WGW (p< 0. 001). Lactic acid further increased RS (p< 0. 001) compared with both WGW and EAW. Breads baked with EAW induced lower postprandial glucose response than REF during the first 120 min (p< 0. 05), but {{there were no significant differences}} in insulin responses. Increased RS content per test portion was correlated to a reduced glycaemic index (GI) (r= −  0. 571, p< 0. 001). This study indicates that wheat with elevated amylose content may be preferable to other wheat genotypes considering RS formation. Further research is needed to test the hypothesis that bread with elevated amylose content can improve postprandial glycaemic response...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to define the {{features}} of chaotic dynamics in changes of winter wheat yield. The yield series for the regions of Ukraine for the period from 1955 – 2008 years served as basic data. In order to bring the series to stationary form the author created a harmonic trend. The research of surplus behaviour made it possible to define their cyclicity (the duration of periods is 4 and 16 – 18 years). It is evidence of mainly determinate character of grain production system. To do our research we selected 16 regions of Central and Eastern Ukraine which had the most apparent cyclicity effect. Close values of cycle’s periods allow considering these regions an unified statistic ensemble. According to ergodic principle such series of 16 time periods each of which is 54 elements long can be considered an analogue of one time period which is 832 elements long. In order to filter high-frequency noises the author used the convolution with Gaussian kernel and Fourier`s discrete conversion. When defining the distance between vectors the pairs of vectors, situated in different columns of yield matrix were considered. The method of "false neighbours" was used in order to define the volume of investments and the evaluation D = 4 ÷ 6 was received. The procedure of Grassberger–Procacci was used to define correlation dimension. As a result the evaluation dc= 4. 30 +– 0. 06 was received. The calculation of Lyapunov`s index was made with the help of Wolf`s method. The evaluation L 1 = 0. 038 was received after computer calculations. The additional index value defines chaotic dynamics and allows evaluating maximum horizon of yield forecast for 25 years. High values of correlation dimension and close to zero value L 1 does not allow to make an unambiguous conclusion of the presence of chaotic dynamics in the system. Therefore the matter of the character of yield dynamics of winter <b>wheat</b> (<b>ordinary</b> or chaotic) needs additional research...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years in Bulgaria there is an {{increasing}} interest in organic production of healthy cereals einkorn and spelt. Typical for them is that they are unpretentious to the soil, resistant to major diseases and pests occurring in cereals. Einkorn and spelt are considered the most ancient types of wheat today and now they are perceived as healthy food. They are distinguished from <b>ordinary</b> <b>wheat</b> in the following parameters: higher percentage of protein; greater amount of fiber, minerals and vitamins /twice higher contents of Vitamin A; vitamins B; calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc and others/; they do not contain cholesterol. They outmach the common wheat in the content of selenium and antioxidants, the amount of gluten is minimized. It does not cause allergic reactions in people suffering from celiac disease /in which the specific protein is not digested, in this case - gluten/. The reason for this property is the content of only 14 chromosomes as opposed to 28 in the common wheat and 42 in the modern types of wheat, which makes it easy to assimilate. Because of the hard shell flakes the grain of einkorn does not absorb harmful substances from soil /eg heavy metals/ which is a problem in modern wheat varieties. This article examines the energy and nutritional qualities of those cereals and the possibility einkorn and spelled to be an alternative in agricultural production - both in crop and animal husbandry...|$|E
