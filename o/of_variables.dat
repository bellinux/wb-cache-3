5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs <b>of</b> <b>variables.</b> It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} produce a Horn instance, no two {{variables}} that appear in the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint on a pair <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> is a 2-satisfiability constraint. By finding a satisfying assignment to the resulting 2-satisfiability instance, Lewis shows how to turn any renamable Horn instance into a Horn instance in polynomial time. By breaking up long clauses into multiple smaller clauses, and applying a linear-time 2-satisfiability algorithm, {{it is possible to}} reduce this to linear time.|$|E
5|$|Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are {{typically}} expressed as Boolean formulas {{of a special}} type, called conjunctive normal form (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of directed graph, the implication graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> as directed edges. Both {{of these kinds of}} inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on backtracking or by using the strongly connected components of the implication graph.|$|E

5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E
5|$|The same {{statements}} {{hold more}} generally for constraint satisfaction problems (or for relational structures, in other words). The only assumption needed is that constraints can involve only a bounded number <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> (all relations are of some bounded arity, 2 {{in the case}} of graphs). The relevant parameter is then the treewidth of the primal constraint graph.|$|E
5|$|One {{can form}} a 2-satisfiability {{instance}} at random, {{for a given}} number n <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> and m of clauses, by choosing each clause uniformly at random from the set of all possible two-variable clauses. When m is small relative to n, such an instance will likely be satisfiable, but larger values of m have smaller probabilities of being satisfiable. More precisely, if m/n is fixed as a constant α ≠ 1, the probability of satisfiability tends to a limit as n goes to infinity: if α<1, the limit is one, while if α>1, the limit is zero. Thus, the problem exhibits a phase transition at α=1.|$|E

The transition between arithmetic and Algebra is {{facilitated by the}} introduction of the concept <b>of</b> <b>variable.</b> Research suggests that students have a definite lack <b>of</b> understanding numerical <b>variables</b> which may account for difficulties with Algebra. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine students’ understanding <b>of</b> numerical <b>variables</b> and the relationship between their level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding and performance in an algebraic context. In order to investigate the relationship between students’ level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding and their performance in an algebraic context, 248 students were randomly selected to take two tests. The two evaluation instruments were the Chelsea Diagnostic Mathematics Test for Algebra, developed by the Social Science Research Council during 1974 to 1979, and the Algebra Performance Test. The purpose of the Chelsea Diagnostic Mathematics Test was to determine students’ level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding. The purpose of the Algebra Performance Test was to evaluate students’ performance on specific algebraic tasks which involve variables in the contexts of expressions, equations, tables, functions and graphs. The percentage of students operating at each level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding was determined and students’ responses on the Algebra Performance Test were classified as low, medium or high. A Chi-Square analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between the students’ level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding and their performance on the Algebra Performance Test. Another Chi-Square analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between seven mathematics class levels and levels <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding. Classification <b>of</b> incorrect responses was made to determine misconceptions. The significant results of this study include that students’ level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding is highly related to their achievement on the Algebra Performance Test. The majority of students who scored low on the Algebra Performance Test were operating at a low level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding and the majority of students who scored high on the Algebra Performance Test were operating at a higher level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding. The majority of students in this study were operating at a level <b>of</b> <b>variable</b> understanding where they could use letters as specific unknowns.

5|$|The set of all {{solutions}} to a 2-satisfiability instance has {{the structure of}} a median graph, in which an edge corresponds to the operation of flipping the values of a set <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> that are all constrained to be equal or unequal to each other. In particular, by following edges in this way one can get from any solution to any other solution. Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of {{solutions to}} a 2-satisfiability instance in this way. The median of any three solutions is formed by setting each variable to the value it holds in the majority of the three solutions. This median always forms another solution to the instance.|$|E
25|$|This {{is because}} one can always {{reduce the number}} <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> by substituting zero for some variables, and one can {{increase}} the number <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> by applying the homomorphisms n; the definition of those homomorphisms assures that n(P(X1,,X'n))=P(X1,,X'n+1) (and similarly for Q) whenever n'd.
