40|$|The {{activated}} sludge process {{is commonly used}} to treat wastewater by aerobic oxidation of organic pollutants into carbon dioxide and water. However, several nonoxidative mechanisms can also contribute to removal of organics. Sorption onto {{activated sludge}} can remove a large fraction of the colloidal and particulate <b>wastewater</b> <b>organics.</b> Intracellular storage of, e. g., polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), triacylglycerides (TAG), or wax esters can convert <b>wastewater</b> <b>organics</b> into precursors for high-value products.

Moreover, the operating cost is relatively low, as the only power required is the electrical power to drive the airlift photoreactor (60  W in the present case). The method of airlift photoreactor degradation has many advantages such as convenience, economy, safety and high efficiency; as a consequence, it has a good prospect in future applications.

40|$|Mass {{balances}} are an instructive {{means for}} investigating {{the fate of}} chemicals during wastewater treatment. In addition to the aqueous-phase removal efficiency (Φ), they can inform on chemical partitioning, transformation, and persistence, {{as well as on}} the chemical loading to streams and soils receiving, respectively, treated effluent and digested sewage sludge (biosolids). Release rates computed on a per-capita basis can serve to extrapolate findings to a larger scale. This review examines over a dozen mass balances conducted for various <b>organic</b> <b>wastewater</b> contaminants, including prescription drugs, estrogens, fragrances, antimicrobials, and surfactants of differing sorption potential (hydrophobicity), here expressed as the 1 -octanol−water partition coefficient (KOW) and the organic carbon normalized sorption coefficient (KOC). Major challenges to mass balances are the collection of representative samples and accurate quantification of chemicals in sludge. A meta-analysis of peer-reviewed data identified sorption potential as the principal determinant governing chemical persistence in biosolids. Occurrence data for <b>organic</b> <b>wastewater</b> compounds detected in digested sludge followed a simple nonlinear model that required only KOW or KOC as the input and yielded a correlation coefficient of 0. 9 in both instances. The model predicted persistence in biosolids for the majority (> 50 %) of the input load of <b>organic</b> <b>wastewater</b> compounds featuring a log 10 KOW value of greater than 5. 2 (log 10 KOC > 4. 4).

However, some industrial discharges contain {{a large amount of}} non-biodegradable organic matter, which cannot be treated properly in a conventional biological WWTP. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics and biodegradability of the <b>wastewater</b> <b>organic</b> matter contained in the industrial discharges and to examine the fate of the industrial discharges in a biological WWTP. In contrast to most previous studies targeting a specific group of organic compounds or traditional water quality indices, such as biological oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), this study was purposed to quantify and characterize the biodegradable and nonbiodegradable fractions of the <b>wastewater</b> <b>organic</b> matter. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) fractionation tests and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the industrial discharge from dyeing or pulp mill factories contained more non-biodegradable soluble organic matter than did the domestic wastewater. Statistical analysis on the WWTPs’ monitoring data indicated that the industrial discharge containing non-biodegradable soluble organic matter was not treated effectively in a biological WWTP, but was escaping from the system. Thus, industrial discharge that contained non-biodegradable soluble organic matter was {{a major factor in the}} decrease in biodegradability of the discharge, affecting the ultimate fate of <b>wastewater</b> <b>organic</b> matter in a biological WWTP.

Previously, the environmental remediation technology (which comprises of adsorption, biological oxidation, chemical oxidation, and incineration) has been used in the treatment of all types of organic and toxic wastewater and also has its effective application in solar energy utilization, environmental treatment, and biomedical and sensing applications. Fujishima and Honda revealed the exceptional knowledge about the photochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of TiO 2 in 1972; research interest has been focused in heterogeneous photocatalysis [3 – 5]. The speeding up of photoreaction in the existence of a catalyst is described as photocatalysis.

Also, in most chemical degradation methods, photocatalytic degradation vis-à-vis photons and a catalyst is often identified as the best in controlling of <b>organic</b> <b>wastewater,</b> solar energy utilization, environmental treatment, and biomedical and sensing applications [3, 5].
