Many discoveries with direct relevance to human health and disease have been elaborated using Arabidopsis, and several processes important to human biology are more easily studied in this versatile model plant. Arabidopsis thaliana, the reference species for plant biology and a key model system for all of biology, has had a greater impact on human health research than may seem evident at first glance.

Diabetes has affected 6 % of the world’s population [1, 2]. Type II diabetes accounts for 90 – 95 % of all diabetic cases [2]. Long-term complica-tions viz; cardiomyopathy, angiopathy, nephropathy etc. are a major cause of morbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus. Hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress frequently co-exist with diabetes mellitus [3]. The increased blood glucose levels in diabetes produce superoxide anions, which generate hydroxyl radicals via Haber Weiss reac-tion, resulting in peroxidation of membrane lipids and protein glycation causing oxidative damage of cell mem-branes. These radicals further damage <b>other</b> <b>importan...</b>|$|E

In this setting, the measurement of nerve conduction ve-locity, as well as the amplitude and shape of evoked potentials from the muscle and nerve, may provide information that is impossible to obtain from the neu-rologic examination.

40|$|Summary. It is {{explained}} how field-theoretic methods and the dynamic renormalisation group (RG) {{can be applied}} to study the universal scaling properties of systems that either undergo a continuous phase transition or display generic scale invariance, both near and far from thermal equilibrium. Part 1 introduces the response functional field theory representation of (nonlinear) Langevin equations. The RG is employed to compute the scaling exponents for several universality classes governing the critical dynamics near second-order phase transitions in equilibrium. The effects of reversible mode-coupling terms, quenching from random initial conditions to the critical point, and violating the detailed balance constraints are briefly discussed. It is shown how the same formalism {{can be applied to}} nonequilibrium systems such as driven diffusive lattice gases. Part 2 describes how the master equation for stochastic particle reaction processes can be mapped onto a field theory action. The RG is then used to analyse simple diffusion-limited annihilation reactions as well as generic continuous transitions from active to inactive, absorbing states, which are characterised by the power laws of (critical) directed percolation.

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a systematic methodology {{for the construction}} of computational models for coupled multi-scale dynamic problems with a major focus given to a case study example related to the design of shape memory alloy actuators controlled by thermoelectric effect. From a mathematical point of view, the problem in hand is a coupled dynamic system of partial differential equations which is not amenable to analytical treatments and requires an efficient computational tool for its solution. The developed methodology is based on a combination of the analysis of such invariant sets that keep the essentials of the system dynamics and on the reduction procedures of the original model on such sets. A presented numerical example demonstrates the efficiency of the developed tool in describing phase transformations in actuators based on materials with shape memory effects. Key words: coupled problems, dynamics of phase transitions, invariant sets, multi-scale analysis. 1 Introduction There is a growing recognition in scientific and engineering communities that many, if not all, real world problems are intrinsically coupled. The coupling may have different sources, e. g. different physical fields coupled together. Electroelasticity, thermoelasticity, viscoelasticity, magnetoelasticity are examples of such problems. Different states of matter should often be also treated together, giving other examples of coupled problems such as fluid-structure interactions, aeroelasticity, various phase transitions. Sometimes such problems are termed as multi-physics problems. This term, however, does not include explicitly many <b>other</b> <b>importan...</b>|$|E
