5|$|In February 1909, Beebe and Blair {{traveled}} to British Guiana, {{in the hope}} that with Roosevelt's support, {{it might be possible to}} establish a permanent field research station there. Another goal of this expedition was to find and capture a hoatzin, a bird whose clawed wings caused it to be considered an important link in the evolution of birds from reptiles. Beebe made extensive documentation of hoatzin behavior through field glasses, but their plans to capture one were foiled when they had to return home early due to Blair breaking her wrist. Despite their failure to obtain their most sought-after prize, the expedition still returned with 280 live birds of 51 species, 33 of which were new to the zoo, although several of these died or escaped during the long trip back to New York. Beebe summarized this expedition in his book <b>Our</b> <b>Search</b> for a Wilderness, which was enthusiastically well reviewed.|$|E

It was produced by the Dramatic Arts Society of Pacific Union College in California. It was based on interviews collected from over 200 individuals. The title derives from White's books, which were traditionally bound with a red cover.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{explore and}} defend {{the idea that we}} have epistemic {{responsibilities}} with respect to <b>our</b> visual <b>searches,</b> responsibilities that are far more fine-grained and interesting than the trivial responsibilities to keep our eyes open and “look hard”. In order to have such responsibilities, we must be able to exert fine-grained and interesting forms of control over <b>our</b> visual <b>searches.</b> I present both an intuitive case and an empirical case for thinking that we do, in fact, have such forms of control over <b>our</b> visual <b>searches.</b> I then show how these forms of control can be used to aim the visual beliefs that result from <b>our</b> <b>searches</b> towards various epistemic goal...|$|R

2500|$|However, {{recently}} the purchasers, eaters, and consumers of opium have become numerous. Deceitful merchants {{buy and sell}} it to gain profit. The customs house at the Ch'ung-wen Gate was originally set up to supervise the collection of imports (it had no responsibility with regard to opium smuggling). If we confine <b>our</b> <b>search</b> for opium to the seaports, we fear the search will not be sufficiently thorough. We should also order the general commandant of the police and police- censors at the five gates to prohibit opium and to search for it at all gates. If they capture any violators, they should immediately punish them and should destroy the opium at once. As to Kwangtung [...] and Fukien , the provinces from which opium comes, we order their viceroys, governors, and superintendents of the maritime customs to conduct a thorough search for opium, and cut off its supply. They should in no ways consider this order a dead letter and allow opium to be smuggled out! ...|$|E

2500|$|In January and February 1908, Clarence Bloomfield Moore [...] {{received}} {{permission from}} the then owner Judge William Andrew Henry of Yazoo City to excavate the sites along the Yazoo River and its tributary the Sunflower River in his steamboat, The Gopher. On his excavation Moore recorded eleven sites and partially excavated eight, including Holly Bluff: “with a large force to dig, including May {{who had been in}} our service before, we go directly to work on such mounds”. Moore commented on the physical appearance of the site: “Strewn over the enclosed area, among the mounds and on them…are chert pebbles; fragments of chert; bits of mussel shell; and small parts of earthenware vessels" [...] Most of the earthenware was undecorated, he recorded, and mostly shell tempered with some stone tempering which is common in the Yazoo-Sunflower region. C. B. Moore’s excavations produced various small artifacts including projectile points, a pebble ax of fossilized wood, a chert hammerstone, and a zoomorphic effigy pipe of shell-tempered pottery. [...] He was disappointed, however, in finding nothing of great importance other than two disturbed burials in a mound on the lake front. [...] Moore’s disappointment was evident in his failing to map the site and his statement, “it having become evident to us that <b>our</b> <b>search</b> was inadequately rewarded”.|$|E
