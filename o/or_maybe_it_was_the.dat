Though she rose to fame singing bawdy cuplés, Meller was known to be prudish. Feyder later recalled how Meller's attitude led to problems while filming: [...] One morning, in the famous stone bullring of Ronda, pearl of Andalusia, we argued over a kiss she thought inappropriate just when we were about to shoot.

5000|$|Reviewing {{the world}} premiere, Richard Nilsen of The Arizona Republic wrote, [...] "The music, lasting a short and {{pleasant}} quarter-hour, takes us on a sonic helicopter ride over Sedona and Montezuma Castle. It {{is not the}} best piece Bates ever wrote, but it was a crowd pleaser." [...] Mark Kanny of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review described the composition as [...] "accessible music full of creativity on many dimensions — from sonority to inventive developments within his thematic material." [...] Andrew Druckenbrod of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette lauded, [...] "Although it includes a recording of Pima Indian song in the last movement, the work is devoid of Mr. Bates' usual electronica but none of his characteristic imagination." [...] He continued: Desert Transport begins with the orchestra alluding to the rotors of the helicopter slowly turning before depicting the arid landscape, with its famed red rocks, seen from above. Bold brass, nuanced percussion and warm strings tell the story through sonic texture instead of melody. But as the copter neared Montezuma's Castle — the famed cliff dwelling — what was meant to be representative became poetic. The field recording of the Native American chant was accompanied by shakes and drums that audibly mirrored the helicopter's spinning rotors. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> other way around: a re-hearing that connected the past to the present, and nature to machine, in a profound way.|$|E
5000|$|The {{director}} {{gave his}} impressions {{of working with}} Johnson:He wasn't that bad. He {{has a lot of}} people with him. He came on to this film with two bodyguards, a cook, a trainer, ah let's see, a helicopter pilot he comes to and from the set in a helicopter, very glamorous let's see, two drivers, a secretary, and, oh yes, his own hair person, his own make-up person, his own wardrobe person. So when he walks to the set he has five people with him.Johnson found Hopper's approach to filmmaking [...] "a little disappointing, I gotta tell you". [...] He later recalled:Mike Figgis had written a script called The Hot Spot, and it was a heist movie. Three days before we started shooting, Dennis Hopper came to all of us, he called a meeting on a Sunday, and he said, “Okay, we’re not making that script. We’re making this one.” And he passed a script around the table that had been written for Robert Mitchum in the ’60s… <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> ’50s… and it was based on a book called Hell Hath No Fury. And that was the movie that we ended up making. This was three days before we started shooting! So he was kind of looking around the table at everybody and saying, “Well, you know, if Don Johnson bails, we don’t have a movie.” Laughs. And I read the script, and I said, “Wow!” I mean, the Figgis script was really slick and cool, and it was a heist movie, but this was real noir, the guy was an amoral drifter, and it was all about how women were going to take him down.Hopper shot the film on location in Texas during what he described as the [...] "hottest, steamiest weather you could imagine". The primary locations were in Taylor, Texas, especially its iconic downtown area, locations around and in Austin as well as in Luling. The swimming scenes were filmed at the famous Hamilton Pool Preserve west of Austin.|$|E

40|$|So how did {{you start}} your day today? Did you take a too quick shower {{followed}} by {{something that looked like}} break-fast and a few quiet minutes reading the newspaper? <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> back of the cereal box you read … or the latest issue of Sports Illustrated … or the juicy pulp novel that you are too embarrassed to tell anyone about? Whatever it was, odds are that you spent some of your leisure time reading something. The unconscious choice to engage in lit-erate behavior is learned. According to Rubin (1986) : Literacy is not a quality that one possesses or doesn’t possess. It is not like red hair and freckles, permanently distinguishing some people. Nor is reading like having a healthy heart muscle that one builds up and maintains through practice. Rather, reading is something that one does. Literacy, like-wise, is a way of coming in contact with the world. Some people engage in literate behavior with greater frequency and intensity than others. Some people use literate behavior to expand their worlds across time and space. Some people read traffic signs and cereal boxes. (p. 81...|$|E
40|$|Probably {{the most}} famous debate on {{economic}} change has been that known as “the standard of living debate, ” {{about the impact of}} the British industrial revolution. ’ This debate began among individuals living in those times, contin-ues today, and will go on, no doubt, tomorrow. The debate’s vehemence has several distinct sources-the politics of the British class struggle, comparisons of British growth with the pattern of communist economic growth in the twen-tieth century, and more general questions of the attitudes toward society and culture that emerged in modern times. Given the broad and emotion-laden sweep of the issues in the British case, it is perhaps surprising that no such prolonged debate has arisen for most of the other nations that developed subsequently. It is not that such debates could not have been generated elsewhere, for periods in which dramatic structural changes in the economy took place, with the expansion of urbanization and industrialization. Surely one might anticipate such concerns for late-nineteenth-century Germany or Japan. Perhaps it has been the earlier dating of the “First Industrial Revolution ” in Britain, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> focus of Marx and Engels on this case in their general discussions of the rise of capitalism, that made the British case so important a historical issue. For whatever reason, the concern with the changing standard of living has produced an extensive literature, with frequent appeals to various quantitative measures to represent economic growth and welfare.
