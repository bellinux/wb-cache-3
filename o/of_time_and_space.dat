5|$|One of Innis's primary {{contributions}} to communications studies was {{to apply the}} dimensions <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> to various media. He divided media into time-binding and space-binding types. Time-binding media are durable. They include clay or stone tablets. Space-binding media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair. The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm uses a smaller amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> than the greedy algorithm by merging pairs of clusters in a different order. In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be guaranteed {{to come up with}} the same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} ecosystem {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns across different scales <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space.</b> Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E
40|$|This study {{draws on}} a feminist {{perspective}} on <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space,</b> or a feminist <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> literacy, {{in order to}} better understand the <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>spaces</b> in distance learning. I seek to respond to some of the key gaps in the literature by considering the multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>spaces</b> in distance learning, and the underpinning power relations, within respondents' stories of being a distance learner. This research makes a substantial contribution to the research on <b>time,</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> distance learning. This is {{not only in terms of}} bringing a feminist <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> literacy to the area of distance learning but, by doing so in conjunction with data collected over <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space,</b> it also adds many new layers to the stories about the multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>spaces</b> in distance learners' lives, and the ways in which gendered and other power relations shape these. Moreover, this study has contributed to the wider body of feminist knowledge in seeking to explore a multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>and</b> <b>spaces</b> in women <b>and</b> men's lives- as opposed to a binary <b>of</b> women's <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> <b>and</b> men's <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> - <b>and</b> in seeking to focus on <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> simultaneously.

25|$|The work of Clarke on the {{existence}} of God set off a British debate that lasted {{to the middle of the}} century.

40|$|In Luther Gulick’s classic essay “Notes on the Theory of Organization,” {{he argued}} that span of control {{structures}} relationships between leaders and subordinates in organizations.

25|$|However it {{cannot be}} stated affirmatively where {{the mind of}} an arahant exists or that it exists at all, because {{describing}} an arahant's mind in terms of existence would limit it to the confines <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space,</b> which Nirvana occurs outside of. It would be equally incorrect {{to say that the}} mind of an arahant does not exist — the Buddha said that the idea of existence or non-existence “does not apply” to the behavior of an arahant's mind. Ajaan Mun argued all of this by describing a unique class of “objectless” or “themeless” consciousness specific to Nirvana, which differs from the consciousness aggregate.|$|E

25|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence to The Wind Will Carry Us. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of this central concept of presence without presence, through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the geographical framework in which the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> {{in the modern world}} of telecommunications.|$|E

With these machines, Doctor Hoffman expands the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space,</b> allowing ever-changing mirages to inhabit the same dimension as the living. Desiderio, though indifferent to the haunting apparitions, finds himself visited nightly by a glass woman, the manifestation of Albertina, Hoffman's daughter and Desiderio's lover-to-be. Unlike Desiderio, many people go crazy in response to the apparitions, and the city, severed from communication with the outside world, becomes a place of rampant insanity and crime, thereby prompting a state of emergency. Under the command of the Minister of Determination, Desiderio embarks on an undercover journey to find and assassinate Doctor Hoffman.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, three {{different}} numerical schemes are described to approximate {{the solution of}} the convection-diffusion equation.

In the second scheme, the discretization <b>of</b> the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> derivatives are done using PDQM and central difference respectively, while in the third scheme only PDQM is used for the discretization <b>of</b> both <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> derivatives. The validation and comparison of the schemes are done through the simulation of two classic examples of convection-diffusion problem having known exact solution. It is found that the numerical schemes are in excellent agreement with the exact solution. We conclude with the realization that the third scheme, i. e. PDQM in <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> produce more accurate results among these three schemes...|$|R

The captain dismissed these concerns and let the takeoff proceed.

The following is a transcript of Flight 90's cockpit voice recorder during the plane's acceleration down the runway.|$|E
25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>space</b> it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, {{but it is not a}} part of the world.|$|E
