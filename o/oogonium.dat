50|$|Eventually, the oogonia {{will either}} {{degenerate}} or further differentiate into primary oocytes through asymmetric division. Asymmetric division {{is a process}} of mitosis in which one <b>oogonium</b> divides unequally to produce one daughter cell that will eventually become an oocyte through the process of oogenesis, and one daughter cell that is an identical <b>oogonium</b> to the parent cell. This occurs during the 15th week to the 7th month of embryonic development. Most oogonia have either degenerated or differentiated into primary oocytes by birth.|$|E
50|$|In phycology and mycology, <b>oogonium</b> {{refers to}} a female gametangium if the union of the male (motile or non-motile) and the female gamete takes place within this structure.|$|E

5000|$|The {{reproductive}} organs of the Charales show {{a high degree}} of specialization. The female organ is a large oval structure with an envelope of spirally arranged, bright green filaments of cells. It is termed an <b>oogonium.</b> The male organ is also large, bright yellow or red in colour, spherical in shape, and is usually termed an antheridium, though some workers regard it as a multiple structure rather than a single organ. The sex organs are developed in pairs from the adaxial nodal cell at the upper nodes of the primary lateral branches, the <b>oogonium</b> being formed above the antheridium. They are sufficiently large to be easily seen with the naked eye, especially the bright orange or red antheridium. Many species are dioecious. In others the monoecious condition is complicated by the development of the antheridium before the formation of the <b>oogonium,</b> thus preventing fertilization by antherozoids of the same alga. In this case the two types of sex organs usually arise from different points on the lateral branches ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Oogonium</b> are {{the stem}} cells for oocytes, and were {{previously}} thought to be depleted during development during {{the production of the}} primary oocytes. However, some of these stem cells have been found in the mouse and primate ovaries.|$|E
50|$|Once {{infection}} season {{comes to}} an end, sexual reproduction occurs to form an oospore. In order to have successful sexual reproduction, weather conditions must be favorable and mating types must match. Two mating types, A1 and A2, exist for Phytophthora colocasiae. Hormonal signaling allows for sporangia of the two mating types {{to come together and}} initiate the development of oogonia and antheridia. An <b>oogonium</b> can be likened to a female reproductive organ while an antheridium carries out the role of a male reproductive organ. The penetration of an <b>oogonium</b> via an antheridium leads to the formation of a sexual spore or an oospore. The oospore will overwinter and germinate to produce infectious sporangia once conditions improve.|$|E
50|$|An {{immature}} ovum is a {{cell that}} {{goes through the}} process of oogenesis to become an ovum. It can be an <b>oogonium,</b> an oocyte, or an ootid. An oocyte, in turn, can be either primary or secondary, depending on how far it has come in its process of meiosis.|$|E
50|$|P. capsici is a heterothallic oomycete. The sexual {{types are}} {{designated}} as A1 and A2. Phytophthora capsici produces both {{a male and}} a female type gametangia called an antheridium (male) and an <b>oogonium</b> (female). The antheridium is amphigynous in the species, meaning that the antheridium may remain in this male form of the gametangia or develop into the female gametangia which is an <b>oogonium.</b> Karyogamy between {{these two types of}} gametangia one being from the A1 sexualtype and the other of the A2 sexual type results in the formation of an overwintering oospore. The oospores may directly germinate into a germ tube or indirectly germinate and give rise to sporangia which then indirectly germinates and gives rise to zoospores. Zoospores are biflagellate motile spores responsible for the polycyclic qualities of this disease.|$|E
5000|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{be either}} homothallic or heterothallic. Homothallic reproduction {{is characterized by}} the fusion of the asexual <b>oogonium</b> and antheridium. This fusion leads to the formation and release of sexual oospores, the primary inoculum for the next season. Heterothallic sexual reproduction is the fusion of sexual cells from two separate organisms, leading to [...] "outcrossing".|$|E
50|$|The antheridia and oogonia are {{protected}} by a layer of sterile cells when mature; the <b>oogonium</b> is oblong in shape and consists of a single egg, while the spherical antheridium is packed with threadlike cells that produce spermatia. As a result, the Charales have the most complex structure of all green algae, if indeed they should be so labelled.|$|E
50|$|Pelvetia canaliculata, {{channelled}} wrack, is a {{very common}} brown alga (Phaeophyceae) found on the rocks of the upper shores of Europe. It is the only species remaining in the monotypic genus Pelvetia. In 1999, {{the other members of}} this genus were reclassified as Silvetia due to differences of <b>oogonium</b> structure and of nucleic acid sequences of the rDNA.|$|E
50|$|Nannandrous Species - In nannandrous species, {{filaments}} bearing antheridia and oogonia show morphological distinction. The male filament, {{which are}} {{much smaller than}} the female filament, is called a dwarf male or nannandrium. Nannandrous species are always dioecious, i.e., antheridia and oogonia are borne on different filaments. The small male filaments are likely to be attached to a female filament, near an <b>oogonium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Phytophthora {{species may}} {{reproduce}} sexually or asexually. In many species, sexual structures {{have never been}} observed, or have only been observed in laboratory matings. In homothallic species, sexual structures occur in single culture. Heterothallic species have mating strains, designated as A1 and A2. When mated, antheridia introduce gametes into oogonia, either by the <b>oogonium</b> passing through the antheridium (amphigyny) or by the antheridium attaching to the proximal (lower) half of the <b>oogonium</b> (paragyny), and the union producing oospores. Like animals, but not like most true fungi, meiosis is gametic, and somatic nuclei are diploid.Asexual (mitotic) spore types are chlamydospores, and sporangia which produce zoospores. Chlamydospores are usually spherical and pigmented, and may have a thickened cell wall to aid in their role as a survival structure. Sporangia may be retained by the subtending hyphae (noncaducous) or be shed readily by wind or water tension (caducous) acting as dispersal structures. Also, sporangia may release zoospores, which have two unlike flagella which they use to swim towards a host plant.|$|E
50|$|Gametogonium (plural gametogonia) are {{stem cells}} for gametes {{located within the}} gonads. They {{originate}} from primordial germ cells, which have migrated to the gonads. Male gametogonia which are located within the testes during development and adulthood are called spermatogonium (plural spermatogonia). Female gametogonia, known as <b>oogonium</b> (plural oogonia), are found within the ovaries of the developing foetus and {{were thought to be}} depleted at or after birth. Spermatogonia and oogonia are classified as sexually differentiated germ cells.|$|E
50|$|As Phytophthora erythroseptica is an oomycete its disease cycle {{follows that}} of any other Phytophthora species. Oospores, sporangia and zoospores can infect any part of the potato plant that is below ground. Oospores {{produced}} in the field can overwinter and when thawed produce an <b>oogonium</b> and antheridium which will then lead to the production of sporangia, oospores and zoospores. This pathogen can be polycyclic, using sporangia as the secondary inoculum. Often this secondary inoculum infects tubers post harvest while in storage.|$|E
50|$|In a {{representative}} species Laminaria, {{there is a}} conspicuous diploid generation and smaller haploid generations. Meiosis takes place within several unilocular sporangium along the algae's blade, each one forming either haploid male or female zoospores. The spores are then released from the sporangia and grow to form male and female gametophytes. The female gametophyte produces an egg in the <b>oogonium,</b> and the male gametophyte releases motile sperm that fertilize the egg. The fertilized zygote then grows into the mature diploid sporophyte.|$|E
50|$|Silvetia is a genus {{of brown}} algae, {{commonly}} known as Rockweed, found in the intertidal zone of rocky seashores of the Pacific Ocean. These were originally classified {{as members of the}} genus Pelvetia. In 1999, Silvetia sp. was created as a separate species from Pelvetia canaliculata due to differences of <b>oogonium</b> structure and of nucleic acid sequences of the rDNA. It was renamed in honor of Paul Silva, Curator of Algae at the Herbarium of the University of California, Berkeley. There are three species and one subspecies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{life cycle}} of Laminaria has [...] {{alternating}} of generations which differs from Fucus. At meiosis {{the male and female}} zoospores are produced separate then germinate into male and female gametophytes. The female egg matures in the <b>oogonium</b> until the male sperm fertilizes it. Life-Cycle: The most apparent form of Laminaria is its sporophyte phase, a structure composed of the holdfast, the stipe, and the blades. While it spends its time predominately in the sporophyte phase, it alternates between the sporophyte and its microscopic gametophyte phase.|$|E
5000|$|Although A. euteiches can {{potentially}} infect hosts {{at any point}} in the growing season, infection usually begins during seedling emergence. The primary source of inoculum is oospores, which can be found either in the soil or in infected plant debris from previously infected host plants. Oospores germinate as a response to chemical signals detected from the roots of new hosts plants. Germination can either be direct or indirect. Either way, infecting begins at the cell in the root tips of the host plant. In direct germination, the oospore produces hyphae which directly penetrate host cells at the plant’s root tips. In indirect germination, the oospore produces sporangia which release zoospores. The zoospores then encyst on the host plant cells, and germinate. After direct or indirect germination, coenocytic hyphae of A. euteiches colonize host tissue through inter- and intra-cellular growth. For sexual reproduction, hyphae develop male and female gametangia called, respectively, antheridia and oogonia. [...] Because Aphanomyces euteiches is homothallic the antheridium and <b>oogonium</b> arise from the same hypha and are self-compatible, meaning separate mating types are not needed for sexual reproduction. [...] The antheridium fertilizes an <b>oogonium,</b> which then develops into a single oospore, which is 20-35 micrometers in diameter.|$|E
50|$|After female (XX) {{germ cells}} collect in the {{undifferentiated}} gonads, the up-regulation of Stra8 {{is required for}} germ cell differentiation into an <b>oogonium</b> and eventually enter meiosis. One major factor {{that contributes to the}} up-regulation of Stra8, is the initiation of the β-Catenin signaling pathway via RSPO1, which is also responsible for ovary differentiation. Since RSPO1 is produced in somatic cells, this protein acts on germ cells in a paracrine mode. Rspo1, however, is not the only factor in Stra8 regulation. Many other factors are under scrutiny and this process is still being evaluated.|$|E
50|$|Pythium irregulare, {{like most}} oomycetes, {{has a life}} cycle with sexual and asexual stages. During the winter, oospores, which are sexual resting spores, survive in the soil. Oospore {{germination}} occurs when the oospore senses chemicals released by seeds or roots. Once germinated, oospores can produce either a germ tube, which directly infects the plant, or a sporangium, which releases zoospores that infect the plant. Sporangium that produce zoospores make up the asexual phase of the life cycle. The zoospores can move through soil when water is present, which is why water is important for disease to occur. Once zoospores reach the root or seed, they encyst, germinate, and infect via a germ tube. Once infection has been established, the pathogen grows hyphae both in and outside the plant and releases enzymes to breakdown plant tissue. The breakdown of tissue provides nutrients for the pathogen, also known as necrotrophy. Once the plant dies, more sporangium can form, release zoospores, and repeat the infection cycle. Alternatively, the hyphae within the dead plant material may also continue to grow and develop “male” and “female” haploid mating structures, known as antheridium and <b>oogonium,</b> respectively. The antheridium then transfers it’s genetic material to the <b>oogonium</b> (fertilization), resulting in the diploid oospore, which overwinters and starts the infection over again in the spring.|$|E
5000|$|D. brightwellii reproduces {{primarily}} asexually, creating clonal lineages. [...] Vegetative {{cells are}} capable of enlargement and may also produce resting spores. However, samples from Puget Sound, WA display high genetic diversity. This is indicative of sexual reproduction (auxospore formation). Clonal isolates have observed to produce both sperm and eggs. Two eggs are produced from each <b>oogonium</b> and 64 sperm are produced from each spermatogonangium. The frequency of sexual reproduction in D. brightwellii is not clear, although conditions including increased nutrients, temperatures ranging from 10 °C-14 °C, and a short photoperiod may be favorable for sexual reproduction.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oogonium</b> and antheridium, {{which are}} formed where two {{neighboring}} hyphae approach, each contain a single nucleus. The cell wall between these organs is dissolved {{at the time}} of fertilization and the male and female nuclei unite, and a fresh wall is laid down between the two organs.Now the wall of the future perithecium beings to form by the development of a number of upright hyphal branches around the <b>oogonium,</b> forming a pseudo-parenchymatous tissue, while the other branches later absorbed grow into the interior of the developing perithecium, while the outer cell walls become flattened and darker in color. Like other species in Sphaerotheca, S. castagnei contains only a single ascus. The cell in which the egg nucleus develops and is fertilized (the carpogonium) elongates, divides and a curved row of 5 or 6 cells is formed. The penultimate cell of this row contains two large nuclei; while the other cells of the row have one nucleus each. The young ascus develops from this penultimate cell in which the two nuclei fuse following a rapid increase {{in the size of the}} ascus; which presses against the inner wall cells of the perithecium and absorbs them. The nucleus of the ascus finally divides three times, producing the nuclei of the eight ascospores; which subsequently are formed by free cell formation. From the half-grown perithecium there arise hyphae which grow out as the appendages. These appendages serve to attach the perithecia to plants.|$|E
5000|$|Like all {{the other}} species in its genus, Albugo occidentalis is an oomycete. The {{survival}} structure is an oospore, {{which is the result}} of the karyogamy of two haploid gametes (the <b>oogonium</b> and antheridium). The oospore can overwinter in the soil, and in the spring it produces zoospores which will encyst on the surface of spinach leaves in the presence of water and germinate. Asexual propagation of Albugo occidentalis occurs via the production of sporangia on sporangiophores. These sporangia disperse and form zoospores, which complete the asexual cycle by re-infecting or infecting a new spinach leaf. The asexual oomycete can overwinter in spinach debris.|$|E
50|$|Most brown algae, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the Fucales, perform sexual reproduction through sporic meiosis. Between generations, the algae go through separate sporophyte (diploid) and gametophyte (haploid) phases. The sporophyte stage is often the more visible of the two, though some species of brown algae have similar diploid and haploid phases. Free floating forms of brown algae often do not undergo sexual reproduction until they attach themselves to substrate. The haploid generation consists of male and female gametophytes. The fertilization of egg cells varies between species of brown algae, and may be isogamous, oogamous, or anisogamous. Fertilization may take place in the water with eggs and motile sperm, or within the <b>oogonium</b> itself.|$|E
5000|$|This is a {{polycyclic}} pathogen with {{a sexual}} and an asexual stage. It thrives in cool moist environments. Over {{winter in the}} soil, oospores survive and wait for spring. In warmer conditions {{when it gets to}} about 47-53 degrees F the oospores will germinate and produce an appressorium or form a short germ tube. The mycelium grows intracellularly and haustoria penetrate through the host cells when the temperature is around 60 degrees F. After about 1-2 weeks when the temperature is between 60-64 degrees F, conidiophores (the asexual stage) will form out of the plant stomata bearing conidia. Sporulation occurs at night. The conidia disseminate in high humidity mornings when it’s about 50-60 degrees. [...] Meanwhile during the sexual stage, the antheridia (the male sex organ) fertilizes the <b>oogonium</b> (the female sex organ) with a fertilization tube and an oospore is developed.|$|E
50|$|Phytophthora sojae overwinters {{in plant}} debris and soil as oospores. Oospores are made after the male gamete, antheridium, and female gamete, <b>oogonium,</b> undergo {{fertilization}} and then sexual recombination (meiosis). They possess thick cell walls with cellulose that {{enables them to}} survive harsh conditions in the soil without germinating for several years. They begin to germinate once the environmental condition is favorable during spring (see environment section for more info) and produce sporangia. They can either germinate directly or indirectly. In direct germination, sporangia directly penetrate the host cells at the plant’s root tips (if it’s within reach). Indirect germination involves sporangia releasing zoospores (if the root is at a farther distance from the sporangia) which encyst on the host plant cells and germinate. Zoospores are biflagellate asexual motile spores. They are dispersed by water flow in the soil and are able to inoculate the roots of plants or seeds. Chemicals such as deadzeins and genistein are released {{at the tip of the}} plant roots which attract the liberated zoospores.|$|E
50|$|Sclerophthora macrospora is an obligate parasite. All oomycetes, {{including}} Sclerophthora macrospora, produce oospores. Oospores are sexual spores {{produced by}} the fusion of an antheridium and <b>oogonium.</b> The oospore germinates and produces sporangium on sporangiophores in damp late spring to autumn. Dissemination of the sporangium, which is pearly white and lemon shaped, is assisted by splashing water. The sporangium, aided by water transport, lands on a leaf surface and releases zoospores which infect the host plants by encysting near the stoma and penetrating the plant tissue with a germ tube. The leaf surface must remain damp or the sporangia will cave in. When wet conditions persist, sporangia can release many zoospores. The pathogen’s zoospores on the infected leaf provide a secondary inoculum allowing for the disease to be polycyclic. Oospores and mycelium can survive on dead leaves. In well drained soils, oospores can persist for a few months. The oospores that survive over winter will then produce more sporangium in late spring. Sclerophthora macrospora also produces mycelium from spores, which absorbs nutrients from the host plant.|$|E

5000|$|Pythium aphanidermatum overwinters in {{the soil}} as oospores, hyphae and/or sporangia. [...] Oospores can produce a germ tube and infect the plant directly, or, if the {{environment}} is favorable (that is an adequate amount of water is present), the oospore may produce sporangia, which in turn produce motile, biflagallete zoospores that swim to the host plant, encyst, and germinate. [...] This infection can occur on seeds, which can rot, or produce a weak seedling. If it infects the roots of a seedling, the mycelium will grow throughout the plant tissue, releasing digestive enzymes which break down plant cell walls allowing the pathogen to absorb the nutrients, effectively killing the plant overtime. P. aphanidermatum is a polycyclic disease A polycyclic plant pathogen has several life cycles during a season, meaning it can reinfect the host plant, or travel to another plant. After infection, several things can happen that spreads the infection: 1)More asexual structures form, including sporangiophores and sporangia, which release more zoospores which can reinfect the host plant, or move to other plants. 2)There can also be sexual reproduction when two different mating hyphal types meet, creating an <b>oogonium</b> (female structure), and an antheridium (male structure). [...] This results in genetic recombination and exists as an oospore-the original overwintering stage of the pathogen.|$|E
