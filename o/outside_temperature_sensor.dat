The proposed <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> {{eliminates the need for}} two-temperature-point calibration in prior <b>temperature</b> <b>sensors.</b> Therefore, <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> calibration efforts in high-volume production can be significantly reduced. The proposed design uses reference clock period information to perform self-calibration, and thus, effects of process variation can be removed. Subse-quently, the accuracy of the proposed <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> can be improved with very small area cost and low power consump-tion. The <b>temperature</b> <b>sensor</b> is implemented with a standard performance 65 -nm complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology. The core area is 0. 01 mm 2, and the power consump-tion of the proposed circuit is 150 μW with a 1 -V supply.
