5|$|St Edern's {{is built}} in the Perpendicular style using local stone, with blocks of cut {{sandstone}} as the external face. The roof is made from slate with stone copings and has a bellcote at the west end, with one bell (dating probably from the 17th century). There is one external buttress to the south-east of the nave to help support {{the weight of the}} building, and there are crosses on the roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> and at the east end of the nave and chancel roofs.|$|E

50|$|However, on <b>the</b> {{left-hand}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south <b>porch</b> {{there is a}} Canonical sundial, dating from the 14th century. The stone with the carved sundial was originally on the south wall and was moved to its present location when <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> was built.|$|R
5|$|The nave of {{the church}} (where the {{congregation}} sat) has no aisle. The chancel (site of the altar) is at {{the east end of}} the nave. There is a porch, which contains an 18th-century memorial, {{on the south side of}} the nave towards the west end, and a vestry to the north. Each section is steeply gabled, with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell. The windows in the nave have two lights (sections of window separated by mullions), save for one to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> which has one light. The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows, the tallest in the middle.|$|E
5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar wooden posts, which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} {{windows on the}} south side of the nave; the one to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> is set in a pointed frame, and the others are in square frames. The middle and easternmost of the five date {{originally}} from the 15th century but have been repositioned; the other three are 19th-century. On the north side, there is a pointed doorway from the early 14th century, with a 19th-century window to the west and two repositioned 15th-century windows with two lights (sections of window separated by mullions) to the east. The west wall has a repositioned 15th-century window. The chancel's east window is also 15th-century, with three lights headed by trefoils (a three-leaf pattern) and decorated with tracery. It has 19th-century glass depicting the Ascension. The south side of the chancel and the north transept have 19th-century windows; the south chancel window has three lights with tracery headed by cinquefoils (a five-leaf pattern), with geometric patterns of glass.|$|E
5|$|The stone {{addition}} exhibits {{two stories}} of deep verandas extending across its eastern front façade. These verandas were once supported by tall columns rising from <b>the</b> addition's ground-level <b>porch,</b> to <b>the</b> roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second-story <b>porch.</b> An exterior stairway once connected <b>the</b> lower <b>porch</b> to <b>the</b> upper <b>porch.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cheppad {{is about}} 44 km north of Kollam on Kollam-Alappuzha National Highway 47. It has an Orthodox Syrian Christian Church {{dedicated}} to St. George built in 1300 AD, {{a place of}} pilgrimage for Orthodox Syrian Christians. The main portico and subsidiary porches are built after <b>the</b> traditional pattern <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> <b>of</b> Hindu temple. <b>The</b> wood carvings in <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> and <b>the</b> mural paintings which depicts <b>the</b> great scenes <b>of</b> epic of Jesus Christ are unique and rare specimens.

5|$|Though {{the temple}} is a Shaiva shrine, it {{contains}} {{the images of}} numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. These images are located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found {{on the wall of}} the temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches around the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch.</b> A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Orissa temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. The porch is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch, and the upper storey has a two-light window. The doorway and window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image of a saint. In the middle storey is a three-light window, in the top storey a two-light window, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet. There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage, and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret. Inside the porch are four corbels (supporting brackets) carved with musicians. On each side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> is a four-light window. At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window, and a five-light window is at the end of the south aisle.|$|E
5|$|Within Dorchester parish {{there are}} 293 {{structures}} that are listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest, including five that are listed Grade I and sixteen that are Grade II*. The Grade I structures are the Church of St George on Fordington High Street, the Church of St Peter on High West Street, Max Gate on Syward Road, the Roman town house on Northernhay, and Shire Hall on High West Street. The Church of St George has a late-11th-century south door {{that has a}} Caen stone tympanum with a realistic carved representation of St George surrounded by soldiers, said to depict the miracle of his appearance at the Battle of Antioch. The south aisle and the north part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> date from the 12th century. The Church of St Peter mostly dates from 1420–21, with a 12th-century south doorway reset into it. There are many notable monuments, including two 14th-century effigies and a 14th-century tomb chest. Thomas Hardy contributed to {{the addition of the}} vestry and chancel in 1856-7. Max Gate was designed by Thomas Hardy in the Queen Anne style, and was his home until his death in 1928. It was built in 1885. The remains of the Roman house north of county hall date from the early 4th century, with later 4th-century enlargements. It has a hypocaust heating system and mosaic pavements. It is the only visible Roman town house in Britain. The current Shire Hall building was designed by Thomas Hardwick and built in Portland stone ashlar in 1797. It replaced a previous structure that had fallen into disrepair. A tablet commemorates the sentencing of the Tolpuddle Martyrs here in 1834. The building housed the Crown Court until 1955; Thomas Hardy was a magistrate here and his experience provided inspiration for his writing. The building has changed little since the 19th century, and in 2014 planning permission was granted to transform it into a heritage centre and tourist attraction, to open in 2017.|$|E

The southern {{entrance is}} a square-headed, battened door with decorative, molded bricks {{in the shape of}} an ovolo surrounding it. The images from the Library of Congress site are worth study, for they show in the late 1950s a compass headed door at this entrance that is evidenced by brick repairs above the doorway.|$|E
50|$|A <b>porch</b> to <b>the</b> south door {{seems to}} have been the first {{addition}} to the church, <b>the</b> outline <b>of</b> which can be easilv traced, and it reached to the present aisle wall.The 14th century builders, who added aisles to the structure did not take down <b>the</b> 13th century <b>porch</b> they found on the south side, but enclosed it in their addition. From it they built out a second porch, which now gives access to the first. <b>The</b> roof line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original <b>porch</b> may be seen over the early door on <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present south door, and is supported by a chamfered arch rib. The outer door to <b>the</b> first <b>porch,</b> now <b>the</b> inner one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>porch,</b> is <b>of</b> two chamfered orders that continue to the ground, with a hood-moulding springing from carved terminals.

500|$|The site faces south, {{with its}} back to Court Hill, {{and the road}} may have passed east-west within [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front door. The great hall, screens passage, porches and chapel blocks have all survived from the early 14th century and the square headed chapel windows contain {{reticulated}} tracery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decorated period. These buildings were probably complete by 1322 although <b>the</b> parapets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porches</b> and chapel may have been remodelled at a later date. The 14th-century building embodied older structures including a small four-storey tower that dates, perhaps, to {{the mid to late}} 13th century, and the building that became the 14th-century kitchen (now the museum) was probably the earlier hall.|$|R

25|$|The {{library is}} a {{beautiful}} example of Ottoman architecture of the 18th century. The exterior of the building is faced with marble. The library has {{the form of a}} Greek cross with a domed central hall and three rectangular bays. The fourth arm of the cross consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch,</b> which can be approached by a flight of stairs on either side. Beneath the central arch of the portico is an elaborate drinking fountain with niches on each side. The building is set on a low basement to protect the precious books of the library against moisture.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a mature}} {{work by the}} {{architect}} who retired in 1898. The nave and chancel are combined structurally into one space with four walls, one roof overall, and no columns or aisles. There is a basic porch leading into the nave on the north side. A combined lean-to {{on the south side}} houses the organ chamber and vestry, which share an arched opening into the chancel. The exterior combines a simple Victorian low church aspect using just the basics of Gothic Revival architecture. Thus, apart from two small crosses on the apexes of the roof and porch, there are only two other decorations: the shaped drip moulding over the west window, and the minimal moulding at the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> archway.|$|E
