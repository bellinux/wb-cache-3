It is open to submissions from across the world. The show's title is taken from the constraint on submissions, which must fit within the box in which Orton's pyrometric cones are shipped, 3" [...] x 3" [...] x 6" [...] (approx. 75 mm x 75 mm x 150 mm.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{pyrometric}} cone is [...] "A pyramid with a triangular base {{and of a}} defined shape and size; the [...] "cone" [...] is shaped from a carefully proportioned and uniformly mixed batch of ceramic materials so that when it is heated under stated conditions, it will bend due to softening, {{the tip of the}} cone becoming level with the base at a definitive temperature. Pyrometric cones are made in series, the temperature interval between the successive cones usually being 20 degrees Celsius. The best known series are Seger <b>Cones</b> (Germany), <b>Orton</b> <b>Cones</b> (USA) and Staffordshire Cones (UK)." ...|$|R
