40|$|It is {{notoriously}} {{difficult to measure}} the causal impact of foreign aid on the econ-omy. The “micro-macro paradox ” (Paul Mosley 1986) renders it impossible to add up the effects of individual aid projects, since foreign aid is fungible. Thus, research-ers are left to conduct cross-country analyses to capture the effect of aid on eco-nomic growth and other outcomes net of the recipient governments ’ domestic budget reshuffling. This large literature has produced mixed results and much disagree-ment, largely due to different interpretations over causal inference (David Roodman 2007). After all, since donors may reward countries for good performance—or bail <b>out</b> <b>basket</b> cases—concerns of endogeneity are justified. Not surprisingly, the litera-ture has employed a number of instrumentation strategies (see Raghuram G. Rajan and Arvind Subramanian 2008). Existing instrumental variable approaches use {{the literature on the}} determi-nants of aid (e. g., Alberto Alesina and David Dollar 2000) to isolate variables that predict foreign aid, broadly, and then use the best candidates to predict aid in a two-stage aid-on-growth regression. But each existing instrument for aid (see Peter Boone 1996; Henrik Hansen and Finn Tarp 2001) can be criticized for one of three broad reasons: it is highly collinear with aid itself (e. g., lagged aid, lagged aid squared); it stands a good chance of not being truly exogenous to the econom...|$|E
