2500|$|The ISUCF'V'MB {{utilizes}} {{a unique}} and traditional marching style during its pregame presentations. The high-step march (used {{for the majority of}} pregame) incorporates a high leg/knee motion combined with a downward toe point. In addition, a similar half-height, double-time version of the high-step, called 'X'ing, is used to enter the field for pregame performances. The swing cadence the band uses to march into the tunnel is also an ISUCF'V'MB signature; members move in a half-time while jumping from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> to cadence in a motion that is similar to hopping. For halftime performances the band uses [...] "glide step", which allows it to maximize its musical and marching output. This is the step the band uses during parades.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Laudrup was {{acclaimed}} for his technique, balance, elegance, vision, ball control, deep {{passes and}} dribbling ability. In regard to his vision, Jorge Valdano, the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid, said, [...] "e has eyes everywhere." [...] His trademark move– looking {{one way and}} passing the other– fooled countless opponents during his career. The Laudrup dribble, a feint {{also known as the}} croqueta, was perhaps the best-known part of his game, and involved him quickly moving the ball from <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> away from the defender. His skills and feints were combined with creativity, which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations. This led to the expression [...] "Made in Laudrup", widely used in Spain about his creative style of play. Numerous teammates of his have said, [...] "Just run, he will always find a way of passing you the ball." ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Restoration of gait in stroke {{survivors}} is a {{major goal}} in rehabilitation. Recently, treadmill training has been introduced as a measure <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> post stroke gait pattern, {{but there is still}} limited data {{on the use of the}} cycle ergometer. The primary aim was to compare selected gait parameters of hemiplegics subjects who received cycle ergometry and those who had traditional physiotherapy. Method: A total of twenty-four (24) subjects were alternately allocated to 2 groups, but only 20 completed the experimental procedure. The two groups received baseline traditional physiotherapy while the experimental group used a cycle ergometer as an addition. Participants pedaled at a predetermined cadence of 50 rpm until the participant indicated that he or she could not pedal any longer, and this training was repeated 3 times per week for 6 weeks. <b>To</b> measure outcomes, <b>the</b> participants were instructed to walk on a 3 -meter walkway with sprinkled powder <b>to</b> show <b>the</b> footprints. The prints were then utilized <b>to</b> measure <b>the</b> selected parameters (step length, stride length and step width). The period of time from one heel contact of <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> following occurrence of the same event with the same foot is taken as gait cycle, while cadence was determined as number of steps per minute. The Wisconsin gait scale was used to measure any changes in the affected limb. Descriptive statistics and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> data. Results: The initial cadence of the experimental group was 42. 17 steps/minute while the final was 64. 00 steps/min. Also, the initial cadence of the control group was 40. 50 steps/min while the final was 52. 25 steps/min. Similarly, the gait cycle improved from 20. 83 seconds to 31. 67 seconds for the experimental group while that of the control group improved from 20. 00 to 25. 75 seconds. This showed that there was significant improvement in cadence (p 3 ̆c 0. 00) and gait cycle (p 3 ̆c 0. 00) when cycle ergometry was combined with conventional therapy compared to those who had only conventional therapy. Also, the Wisconsin Gait Scale score improved significantly for the experimental group (p 3 ̆c 0. 02). Conclusion: This study concluded that selected parameters of the gait of people post-stroke were improved when cycle ergometry was combined with conventional therapy.

50|$|Adaptor {{molecules}} {{are responsible}} for self-assembly and recruitment. Two examples of adaptor proteins are AP180 and epsin. AP180 is used in synaptic vesicle formation. It recruits clathrin to membranes and also promotes its polymerization. Epsin also recruits clathrin to membranes and promotes its polymerization, and can help deform the membrane, and thus clathrin-coated vesicles can bud. In a cell, a triskelion floating in <b>the</b> cytoplasm binds <b>to</b> an adaptor protein, linking <b>one</b> of its <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> membrane at a time. The skelion will bind to other ones attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> membrane <b>to</b> form a polyhedral lattice, skelion, which pulls the membrane into a bud.
