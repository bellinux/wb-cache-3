The first part generally focuses on civil procedure, definition of its subject {{and its relation to}} substantive law. There is also described its development since era of ancient Rome till presence. The second chapter focuses on the most important type {{of civil procedure}}, which is civil trial proceedings, that is divided into contentious and non- contentious proceedings. At first there is described <b>contentious</b> <b>procedure</b> aiming on its basic principles, goal, rights and obligations of participants and its procedure. The part devoted to non-contentious procedure contains common and different characteristics with <b>contentious</b> <b>procedure,</b> basic principles, specification of participants, general procedure and description of chosen types of non-contentious procedure. Based on its continuity the third chapter is dedicated to enforcement procedure. The chapter is subdivided to parts focused on writ of execution, general procedure and possible ways of its end.

40|$|The "right of defense" has an {{important}} place in the <b>contentious</b> <b>procedure</b> as organised in Book VII of the Code of Canon Law of 1983. It also has its "raison d'être" {{in the process of}} declaration of nullity of marriage {{due to the fact that}} it is assimilated to the contentious process and deals with the private interests of the parties; nevertheless the rules guaranteeing the right to defense must, in this case, be adjusted so as to deal with the declaratory character and the common good of the nullity process.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this master's degree thesis is to provide {{information}} about position of a judge during evidence proceeding in <b>contentious</b> <b>procedure</b> with special focus on production of evidence. In the text I often use particular decisions of the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic and the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic to demonstrate how theoretical legal institutes are applied in practice. I have decided to choose this topic because I am very interested in judge's profession and its practical aspects especially within evidence proceeding. More reasons for my research are stated in the very first introductory part of my theses. The whole theses is composed of three parts and each of them dealing with different sides of evidence proceeding or position of a judge within the meaning of his rights, duties, activity and also responsibility. Part One generally characterizes evidence proceeding and it makes the foundation for following part that is focused on partial phase of evidence proceeding (i. e. production of evidence). This part is divided into four chapters. The first chapter describes <b>contentious</b> and non-contentious <b>procedure</b> and also gives an explanation of main distinctions between these concepts. The second chapter concerns with basic principles of justice and civil procedure. The [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The essay {{focuses on}} the new pre-litigation advice of ANAC (i. e. italian public {{procurement}} Authority), from the genesis since the recent evolutions. The analysis of this non-judicial remedy offered the chance {{to reflect on the}} more general issue of the differences between administrative procedure and judicial review. Starting from the contributions of traditional scholars about administrative appeal and <b>contentious</b> <b>procedure,</b> the essay identifies formal features that structurally characterize a "process" and, according to the prospective chosen, these elements have been combined with a functional analysis. After this survey, the new binding pre-litigation advice of ANAC is identified with the category of“administrative decision”and this conclusion brings specific results in terms of rules applicables. However the essay emphasizes that the notion of “process” has different meanings in each field of law and needs to be verified (for instance, in the light of EU law or ECHR) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the European Commission's Directorate General for Competition, under its new Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, is now facing acute {{problems}} in its investigation and prosecution of cartels, which stem from the successful cartel busting era of Commissioner Kroes. The core argument is that the Commission's procedures emerged {{at a time when}} the aim was to consult extensively on the development of competition law, and not to prosecute and fine delinquent business entities. These antiquated procedures, which have not been substantially reformed since they came into force in March 1963, involve extensive documentary responses in which the Commission acts as investigator, prosecutor and judge and only allow the Commission to hand down half a dozen decisions condemning cartels per year. This paper argues for a comprehensive modernisation of the Commission's anti-cartel regime, stripping away the limitations on the application of the leniency programme; streamlining the <b>contentious</b> <b>procedure</b> to encourage greater throughput of cases and reforming the sanctions regime to allow individual sanctions to ensure personal accountability for price-fixing by corporate executives...|$|R
40|$|The {{occupational}} physician {{may play a}} crucial role in the risk assessment of workers in a given occupational environment. In fact, according to the current italian legislation, the document on risk assessment must be produced by the employer, with the cooperation of the responsible for prevention and safety and, in the due contexts, with the contribution of the {{occupational physician}}. Therefore, a cooperation between the different figures involved in the process is a pre-requisite for the elaboration of an adequate planning of preventive measures. From the point of view of the occupational physician, it seems necessary a preliminary in-depth knowledge of the plant and of the various steps of the productive process. In particular it is mandatory to have precise data on the number of workers, the mean age, work seniority, and the percentage of disabled workers. As a corollary, it is important to know the frequency of occupational related disorders, the number of accident at work, and the possible presence of <b>contentious</b> <b>procedures</b> with security organisms. Several important open questions remain, however: in particular to establish a causal relationship of any disorder with occupational situtations and to discriminate between distressing situations inside and outside the work environment...|$|R
40|$|Whenever the {{legitimacy}} of a new or ethically contentious medical intervention is considered, a range of influences will determine whether the treatment becomes accepted as lawful medical treatment. The development and introduction of abortion, organ donation, gender reassignment, and non-therapeutic cosmetic surgery have, for example, all raised ethical, legal, and clinical issues. This book examines the various factors that legitimatise a medical procedure. Bringing together a range of internationally and nationally recognised academics from law, philosophy, medicine, health, economics, and sociology, the book explores {{the notion of a}} treatment, practice, or procedure being proper medical treatment, and considers the range of diverse factors which might influence the acceptance of a particular procedure as appropriate in the medical context. Contributors address such issues as clinical judgement and professional autonomy, the role of public interest, and the influence of resource allocation in decision-making. In doing so, the book explores how the law, the medical profession, and the public interact in determining whether a new or ethically <b>contentious</b> <b>procedure</b> should be regarded as legitimate. This book will be of interest and use to researchers and students of bioethics, medical law, criminal law, and the sociology of medicine...|$|R

40|$|The Minor in the Civil Procedure JUDr. Jana Sladká Hyklová Abstract The thesis {{deals with}} {{the topic of the}} minor in civil procedure. This topic has not been yet {{properly}} compiled in Czech legal literature although the issues of participation of minors within civil proceedings are still actual and their importance is increasing. The basic legal source covering the chosen topic is Act No. 99 / 1963 Coll., Civil Procedure Code, which had to be amended more than 120 times. Procedural law in family law matters, which form substantial part of the content of this thesis topic, is firmly connected with substantive law. Substantive legislation is nowadays represented by Civil Code and Family Law, which are supposed to be replaced on 1 January 2014 with new code of civil law, Civil Code (Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll.). This is the reason why the thesis pays attention to the existing legislation as well as to novelties brought by the new code. Where needed, an analysis of new legislation in terms of proper procedural protection of the rights of minors is provided. New legislation of civil law brings the question of preparation of appropriate procedural code. On spring 2012 the draft of law of non <b>contentious</b> <b>procedure</b> which includes main principles and outline of this brand new procedural regulation was published. Where [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The {{movie is}} told through various {{points of view}} in a semi-documentary. Generosa (Poppy Montgomery) is a {{struggling}} artist who sells real estate, and one day, when client Ted (David Sutcliffe) fails to show up, she goes over to confront him. They soon fall in love, get married and are happy for several years during which time they adopt twin orphans: Alexa Ammon (Aislinn Paul) and Greg Ammon (Munro Chambers). Whether {{a result of being}} a mother or from an organic or drug-induced biochemical imbalance, Generosa becomes increasingly paranoid accusing Ted of, among other indiscretions, adultery. Her erratic behavior tears the marriage apart, thereby unleashing a very <b>contentious</b> divorce <b>procedure</b> with Generosa demanding custody of the twins, ownership of their house in the Hamptons and, if possible, all of Ted's wealth. She even resorts to lying to the children about Ted in an attempt to turn them against him.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{the duties of the}} parties to a {{litigation}} (<b>contentious</b> civil <b>procedure).</b> There are two such duties in a litigation: the duty to prove and the duty to assert. The aim of the thesis is to analyze these procedural institutes, to explain both their historical context and their relation to other related institutes such as the burden of proof or the burden of proof assertion. Concurrently, duties of the court itself regarding this matter are dealt with as well as imperfections of current legislation. In the last chapter, proposals de lege ferenda are made. This thesis is divided into six basic sections. The first one focuses on the historical perspectives, the second one {{deals with the}}oretical fundamentals and basic concepts, the third one addresses the duties of the court itself related to this subject matter, the fourth one focuses on the judicature of both the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of the Czech republic, the fifth one describes and compares related current legislation of Slovakia and, as mentioned, the last chapter contains several proposals de lege ferenda...|$|R
40|$|The medical {{procedure}} of 'feticide' {{has been used}} in clinical practice since the early 1990 s in the UK. The procedure constitutes a sensitive aspect of late termination of pregnancy (TOP), an issue that is in itself <b>contentious.</b> The <b>procedure</b> has attracted attention from academic and policy commentators, but recently the medical profession has expressed some uncertainty with respect to the legal position of live birth following TOP, and professional discretion in providing feticide. To understand the meaning of these comments better, we argue that it is helpful to acknowledge the rhetoric that shapes the academic discourse on feticide. In this paper, we review how feticide has been conceptualised within academic discourse, demonstrating that the concept has multiple meanings, some of which could be considered politically charged. We then consider some examples of the comments made about the legal uncertainties of feticide, highlighting assumptions made about the problematic nature of professional discretion. Ultimately, we suggest that {{a better understanding of the}} context of feticide is needed to ensure that future research in this area of health care engages adequately with issues of professional discretion.

40|$|This study {{consisting}} of four chapters is {{an examination of}} the judicial penal procedure for dismissal of a diocesan priest from the clerical state for the commission of certain grave delicts. It mainly focuses on two areas: first, the identification of certain delicts that merit dismissal from the clerical state; second the application of right penal measures to deal with such delicts. While in light of the constant social teaching of the Church, the Code affirms the inviolable dignity and rights of the faithful, it does not fail to assert its right to impose appropriate penalties on members who violate the law (c. 1311). The exercise of personal rights is contingent upon the promotion of common good (c. 223). Therefore, threats to justice, gravity of scandal and contumacy of an offender necessitate the imposition of appropriate penalties (c. 1341). The right of a competent ecclesiastical authority to impose penalty presupposes proper understanding of delicts and penalties prescribed in the Code. By and large, penal laws operate in the juridical not moral sphere; that is to say, while all delicts are sinful, not all sins are considered delicts before law (I Jn. 5, 17). Delicts and penalties operate solely in the external forum. In order to impose appropriate penalties, the ecclesiastical superior must evaluate various factors that affect imputability and other factors related to delict (cc. 1322 - 1327). It is not uncommon for clerical delicts to be punished with severe penalties because they are a breach of trust and against the integrity of the sacrament of Orders. Clerical delicts against human dignity, celebration of the sacraments and morals are considered more serious; {{and some of them are}} reserved to the Apostolic See. In judging the clerical delicts meriting the serious expiatory penalty of dismissal from the clerical state, the Code prefers judicial procedure which guarantees better the right of defence (c. 1620, 7 °) and counterchecks possible arbitrariness. A judicial penal procedure follows the norms of the <b>ordinary</b> <b>contentious</b> process (cc. 1501 - 1670) and the canons on penal process provided in the Code (cc. 1717 - 1731). The norms which supplement the Code are to be observed for reserved delicts. The faithful observance of substantive and procedural norms will safeguard the superior from slipping away from justice and the protection of rights. The lawfully imposed penalty of dismissal from the clerical state on a guilty cleric results in certain prohibitions and deprivations such as the deprivation of exercise of sacred ministry, office, power, function, faculty, privilege, etc. All rights and obligations pertaining to the clerical state become extinct (cc. 273 - 283) except the obligation of celibacy (c. 291). Because the expiatory penalty of dismissal from the clerical state has severe consequences for the offending cleric, Christian charity in the application of the prescripts of the Code calls for justice and equity recommended by the Code for cases involving dismissal from the clerical state...|$|R
40|$|Two {{issues have}} been {{particularly}} prominent in the contemporary scholarly discussion about civil liberties in Canada: the ever-present debate about the legitimacy of judicial review, with its current 2 ̆ 2 dialogue theory 2 ̆ 2 inflection, and the wisdom and constitutionality of national security measures introduced or made more prominent {{in light of the}} current concern with terrorism. In this article, the author draws together these concerns around civil liberties and judicature in an examination of the detention review powers of the Federal Court within the <b>contentious</b> security certificate <b>procedure</b> in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the author concludes that the Federal Court has the power to review the automatic detention of foreign nationals pursuant to security certificates. Most commentators and our courts have misassessed the powers of the Federal Court and this misdiagnosis is attributable, in part, to a myopic view of judicature that has failed to recognize certain profound shifts in the structure of Canadian judicature...|$|R
