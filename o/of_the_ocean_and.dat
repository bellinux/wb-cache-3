5|$|Europa Orbiter — Its {{objective}} {{would be}} to characterize the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>and</b> its relation to the deeper interior. Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, magnetometer, Langmuir probe, and a mapping camera. The Europa Orbiter received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surface.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} stated that sperm whales, {{as well as}} other large cetaceans, help {{fertilise}} the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans' surface when they defecate, an effect known as the whale pump. This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants on the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>and</b> contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon.|$|E

5|$|As autumn approaches, Teran takes {{advantage}} of Sea Mither's exhaustion to break free, and conflict between the two starts again.

No details are given as to where she spends the winter, but during the storms caused by Teran the fishermen were consoled that Sea Mither would return refreshed and powerful in the spring, to again oust Teran from his malevolent grip over the seas.|$|E

5|$|It was {{the grandest}} sight I ever experienced, {{to look out}} of the {{lighthouse}} on a very stormy day, and see oneself hanging, as it were, over the ocean, surrounded on three sides by a fearful chasm in which the air was so thickly crowded with birds as to produce {{the appearance of a}} heavy snowstorm, whilst the cries of these myriads, mingled with the roar <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>and</b> the howling of the tremendous gusts of wind coming up from below as if forced through a blast pipe, made it almost impossible to hear a person speak.|$|E

She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid {{says he does not}} know, she uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies the subject as Nadia.|$|E

25|$|Some oxygen was {{stimulated by}} solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation to form ozone, which {{collected in a}} layer near {{the upper part of}} the atmosphere.
