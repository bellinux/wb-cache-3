5|$|A {{landscaped}} {{park with}} lakes and statues was laid <b>out</b> <b>around</b> the house, and {{the drive to}} the house was along a semicircular avenue of trees. Sir Edward died in 1766.

This proved impossible so in 1768 he had the entire house demolished.|$|E
5|$|Little {{evidence}} exists of settlements within the Rhondda during the Norman period. Unlike the communal dwellings of the Iron Age {{the remains of}} the Medieval buildings discovered in the area follow the pattern similar to modern farmsteads; with separate holdings spaced <b>out</b> <b>around</b> the hillsides. The evidence of Medieval Welsh farmers comes from {{the remains of the}}ir buildings, with the foundations of platform houses having been discovered spaced out throughout both valleys. When the site of several platform houses at Gelligaer Common were excavated in the 1930s potsherds dating from the 13th-14th century were discovered.|$|E

5|$|Marasmius sasicola is {{a species}} of Marasmiaceae fungus known from Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. First {{collected}} in 2000, it was described in 2002 by Haruki Takahashi. The species produces small mushrooms with white caps and very short, very thin black stems. Unlike in other, similar species, the stems enter the plant matter on which the mushroom grows. The six to eight white gills are spread <b>out</b> <b>around</b> the cap, {{and all of them}} reach the stem. The flesh has no taste or odour. Found in June, the species grows on dead Sasa leaves, from which it takes its specific epithet.|$|E
5|$|Most ground-living cacti {{have only}} fine roots, which spread <b>out</b> <b>around</b> {{the base of}} the plant for varying distances, close to the surface. Some cacti have taproots; in genera such as Copiapoa, these are {{considerably}} larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti. Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only adventitious roots, produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium.|$|E

5|$|The castle, {{situated}} on a headland overlooking Loch Ness, {{is one of}} the largest in Scotland in area. It was approached from the west and defended by a ditch and drawbridge. The buildings of the castle were laid <b>out</b> <b>around</b> two main enclosures on the shore. The northern enclosure or Nether Bailey includes most of the more intact structures, including the gatehouse, and the five-story Grant Tower at the north end of the castle. The southern enclosure or Upper Bailey, sited on higher ground, comprises the scant remains of earlier buildings.|$|E
5|$|The major {{structures}} of Q'umarkaj were laid <b>out</b> <b>around</b> a plaza.

The main ballcourt was placed between the palaces of two of the principal noble houses. Palaces, or nimja, were spread throughout the city. There was also a platform that was used for gladiatorial sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|The monkey lemurs are {{considered}} to be most closely related to the living indriids and the recently extinct sloth lemurs, although recent finds had caused some dispute over a possible closer relation to living lemurids. Genetic tests, however, have reaffirmed the previously presumed relationship. Hadropithecus lived in open habitat in the Central Plateau, South, and Southwest regions of Madagascar. It is known only from subfossil or recent remains and {{is considered to be a}} modern form of Malagasy lemur. It died <b>out</b> <b>around</b> 444â€“772 CE, shortly after the arrival of humans on the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{street is}} named after The Vine, an 18th-century public house, which in turn may have been named after a {{vineyard}} that existed at this location in Roman times. It was documented on ratebooks as Little Swallow Street in 1675. It was laid <b>out</b> <b>around</b> 1686 and originally ran further, along {{what is now the}} Man in the Moon Passage.

In the mid 19th century the Dean of Lincoln was invited to stay at the property by Fredrick, 4th Earl Spencer. He complained the following morning that during the night a figure dressed as a groom (believed to be the ghost of the deceased servant of the 3rd Earl) had entered his room holding candles and checking that they were snuffed <b>out</b> <b>around</b> the bed.
