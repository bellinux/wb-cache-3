5|$|Cochet played <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> matches at the Swiss covered courts {{championships in}} St. Moritz, {{returning}} {{to the scene of}} his very first tennis triumph after a 36-year hiatus. At the age of 56 with his partner Bernard Destremau he managed to pass {{the first round of the}} doubles contest with a 6–2, 6–1 win over locals D. Wegs and H. Flury. Cochet retired from tennis later that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Baba gave <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> public functions, {{a series}} of {{meetings}} he called The East-West Gathering. At these meetings, in which his western followers were invited to meet his Indian disciples, Baba gave darshan to many thousands of people despite the physical strain this caused him.|$|E
5|$|The drip {{painting}} {{works of the}} modern artist Jackson Pollock are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 Number 14 has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> works, Blue Poles, took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.|$|E
50|$|He then {{retired to}} the country. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> {{legacies}} is the Perth Bridge over the River Tay, which he helped fund.|$|R

50|$|Weller's War {{includes}} articles {{which were}} published (wholly or in part) by Chicago Daily News, Boston Globe(August 31 and September 1, 1945) and London Daily Telegraph(September 1, 1945). Weller's reporting on Nagasaki remains <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> legacies.|$|R
5|$|Beyond these controversies, Jones {{significantly}} {{influenced the}} Air Force's development {{during and after}} the war. He was honoured for his work running the Empire Air Training Scheme in 1940–42 and has received credit as CAS for building up the RAAF's strength to 70squadrons by 1945. After the war he played a personal part in improving education within the service, including the establishment of RAAF College, along similar lines to Royal Military College, Duntroon, and the Royal Australian Naval College, as well as the RAAF Staff College. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> directions as CAS was the formation of RAAF Museum at Point Cook, where it is still based.|$|E
5|$|In 1870 Brassey {{was told}} that he had cancer but he {{continued}} to visit his working sites. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> visits was to the Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway, only a few miles from his first railway contract at Penkridge. In the late summer of 1870 he took to his bed at his home in St Leonards-on-Sea. There he was visited by members of his work force, not only his engineers and agents, but also his navvies, many of whom had walked for days to come and pay their respects.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Skelton {{made several}} {{specials}} for HBO including Freddie the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner (1981) and the Funny Faces series of specials. He gave a Royal Command Performance for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in 1984, which was later {{shown in the}} U.S. on HBO. A portion of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> interviews, conducted by Steven F. Zambo, was broadcast {{as part of the}} 2005 PBS special The Pioneers of Primetime.|$|E
5000|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> {{words to}} <b>his</b> family was [...] "Kawawa naman si Cory" [...] (Oh how pitiful Cory is!), as he died broken hearted {{to see this}} {{daughter}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> harassed and harangued by the Marcos government for being the woman Ninoy Aquino chose as his wife.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{promotion}} to brigadier general in July 1973, {{for three years}} he was the academic and administrative head of the Command and General Staff College. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> contributions at the College was to consolidate all Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) constructive simulations and create a family of technologically based realistic battle simulations from platoon through corps level.|$|R
50|$|Benjamin B. Martin (1883 - 1932) was an artist. He {{made his}} living in Seattle, Washington, where {{he worked as a}}n {{illustrator}} for the Seattle Times, and later in New York, where he worked as a commercial artist. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> legacies was <b>his</b> work {{as a member of the}} Seattle Cartoonists' Club, in the club's book The Cartoon; A Reference Book of Seattle's Successful Men.|$|R
5|$|In <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> acts as governor, he {{appointed}} Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The lame duck appointment was occasioned {{by the sudden}} resignation of Otis Lord, a Republican who may have resigned in order to deny the appointment opportunity to the incoming Democratic Governor, Benjamin Butler. The appointment was made on December 8, 1882, {{the last day of}} Long's term when the Governor's Council (which had to approve the appointment) was scheduled to meet.|$|E
5|$|Stephen survived his doctor, {{who died}} in Moldavia in late 1503. Another Moldavian {{delegation}} was sent to Venice {{to ask for a}} replacement, but also to propose a new alliance against the Ottomans. This was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> acts of international diplomacy. When Stephen was dying, various boyars, who opposed Bogdan, rebelled, but they were suppressed. On his deathbed, he had urged Bogdan to continue to pay the tribute to the Sultan. He died on 2 July 1504 and was buried in the Monastery of Putna.|$|E
5|$|Tătărescu {{resigned}} {{his office}} on 6 November 1947, {{and was replaced by}} the Communist Ana Pauker. For the following two months, he was sidelined in his own party by PCR pressures, and removed from its leadership in January 1948 (being replaced with Petre N. Bejan — the party was subsequently known as National Liberal Party-Petre N. Bejan). <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> actions as cabinet member had been to sign the document officially rejecting the Marshall Plan.|$|E
50|$|Fang Bao died in 1749. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> {{contributions}} to the imperial system apart from his literary writings was {{the establishment of the}} guwen style as the essay style of the imperial examination system which thereafter put emphasis on Song dynasty neo-Confucian theory. This influence drastically changed the imperial examination system which imposed standards and made the guwen essays the foundational part of scholarly writing across the Qing Empire.|$|R
50|$|He {{began his}} {{performing}} arts {{career as a}} musician (he was a violinist, an avocation he would pursue during his entire career as an actor). Oakland began his acting career in the late 1940s. He enjoyed a series of Broadway hits, including Light Up the Sky, The Shrike and Inherit the Wind, and theater was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> passions. He was a concert violinist until the 1940s.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the West Washington Street Bridge was {{influenced}} by the work of Edwin Thacher. Thacher was an engineer who built military bridges during the Civil War. To solve many of the complex mathematical calculations required in designing bridges, Thacher invented and patented a cylindrical slide rule. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> legacies is <b>his</b> design <b>of</b> the reinforcing system for concrete bridges that was used in the West Washington Street Bridge.|$|R
5|$|Goldfaden had an on-again off-again {{relationship}} with Zionism. Some of his earliest poetry was Zionist avant la lettre and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> plays {{was written in}} Hebrew; several of his plays were implicitly or explicitly Zionist (Shulamith set in Jerusalem, Mashiach Tzeiten?! ending with its protagonists abandoning New York for Palestine); {{he served as a}} delegate from Paris to the World Zionist Congress in 1900. Still, {{he spent most of his}} life (and set slightly more than half of his plays) in the Pale of Settlement and in the adjoining Jewish areas in Romania, and when he left it was never to go to Palestine, but to cities such as New York, London or Paris. This might be understandable when the number of his potential Jewish spectators in Palestine in his time was very small.|$|E
5|$|Harvard University offered Holst a lectureship for {{the first}} six months of 1932. Arriving via New York he was pleased to be reunited with his brother, Emil, whose acting career under the name of Ernest Cossart had taken him to Broadway; but Holst was dismayed by the continual attentions of press interviewers and photographers. He enjoyed his time at Harvard, but was taken ill while there: a {{duodenal}} ulcer prostrated him for some weeks. He returned to England, joined briefly by his brother for a holiday together in the Cotswolds. His health declined, and he withdrew further from musical activities. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> efforts was to guide the young players of the St Paul's Girls' School orchestra through one of his final compositions, the Brook Green Suite, in March 1934.|$|E
5|$|He also prosecuted {{a number}} of {{contempt}} of court cases, including suits against Dow Jones Publishing Company (Asia), Inc. for material published in The Wall Street Journal Asia; against US-based lawyer Gopalan Nair for comments on his blog; and against three Singapore Democratic Party supporters, John Tan Liang Joo, Isrizal bin Mohamed Isa and Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi bin Sariman, who wore T-shirts bearing {{the image of a}} kangaroo dressed in a judge's gown outside the Supreme Court Building. On 15 March 2010, in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> cases before his term of office ended, he defended the constitutionality of capital punishment in Singapore before the Court of Appeal in an appeal by a man sentenced to death for drug trafficking.|$|E
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> {{legacies}} to {{racing is}} the creation <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the showcase end of season races. Bull was adamant {{for a long time}} that the British flat racing programme lacked a mile race for two-year-olds, and at his behest, the Timeform Gold Cup was established in 1961 to fill this gap. The race, now known as the Racing Post Trophy, is now a Group 1 race, and in recent years has been won by future Derby winners including High Chaparral, Authorized and Camelot.|$|R
50|$|These last {{articles}} presaged Waters' {{later work}} in emergency preparedness with the Florida State Courts system following {{the terrorist attacks}} of September 11, 2001, the anthrax attacks of 2001, and the disastrous Florida hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> contributions was the founding of the Florida Court Public Information Officers, Inc., a federally recognized nonprofit organized for educational purposes. FCPIO serves as a network of Florida's court PIOs with members in all 26 subdivisions of the state courts system, with regular meetings around Florida.|$|R

5|$|Its royal {{occupant}} {{may very}} well have made York House the pinnacle of Brettingham's career. Built during the 1760s, it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> grand houses. His last country-house commission was at Packington Hall, Warwickshire. In 1761, he published his plans of Holkham Hall, calling himself the architect, which led critics, including Horace Walpole, to decry him as a purloiner of Kent's designs. Brettingham died in 1769 at his house outside St. Augustine's Gate, Norwich, and was buried in the aisle of the parish church. Throughout his long career, Brettingham did much to popularise the Palladian movement. His clients included a Royal Duke and at least twenty-one assorted peers and peeresses. He is not a household name today largely because his provincial work was heavily influenced by Kent and Burlington, and unlike his contemporary Giacomo Leoni he did not develop, or was not given the opportunity to develop, a strong personal stamp to his work on country houses. Ultimately, he and many of his contemporary architects were eclipsed by the designs of Robert Adam. Adam remodelled Brettingham's York House in 1780 and, in addition to Kedleston Hall, went on to replace James Paine as architect at Nostell Priory, Alnwick Castle, and Syon House. In spite of this, Adam and Paine remained great friends; Brettingham's relationships with his fellow architects are unrecorded.|$|E

500|$|Francis Darwin {{described}} it as characteristic that his father delighted in the observations that preceded the publication of Fertilisation of Orchids, not the applause which followed it. He quoted <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>last</b> letters about orchids, written in 1880: ...|$|R
5000|$|Nathamuni {{collected}} the poems of Nammalvar, {{in the form}} of Divya Prabandham, likely in the 9th century CE, or the 10th century. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>lasting</b> contributions was to apply the Vedic theory of music on all the Alvar songs using Sanskrit prosody, calling the resulting choreography as divine music, and teaching his nephews the art of resonant bhakti singing of the Alvar songs. This precedence set the guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student-tradition) in Sri Vaishnavism. This style <b>of</b> education from <b>one</b> generation to the next, is a tradition called Araiyars, states Guy Beck, which preserved [...] "the art of singing and dancing the verses of the Divya Prabandham" [...] set in the sacred melodies and rhythms described in the Vedic texts.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though none}} survives in its {{original}} form, Soseki's Zen gardens {{have proven to be}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most <b>lasting</b> contributions to the country's culture and image. To Soseki designing new gardens and altering existing ones {{was an integral part of}} the practice of Zen.|$|R
25|$|In <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>last</b> major {{railroad}} positions, Stone briefly {{became a}} director of two railroads, the Massillon and Cleveland Railroad and the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway, in early 1883.|$|E

50|$|As {{early as}} 694 he co-ruled with Wittiza, his son by Cixilo, even though Wittiza was a minor. In <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> very <b>last</b> acts he had Wittiza anointed in 700. Ergica {{died in his}} bed, with his {{succession}} secured, sometime between 701 and 703.|$|R
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> longest <b>lasting</b> {{legacies}} was <b>his</b> {{bringing a}} group of Spanish performers, known as the Spanish Students, to the United States. These performers inspired imitators and {{gave rise to the}} widespread playing of the mandolin in the United States, where it was previously unknown.|$|R
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most <b>lasting</b> {{legacies}} {{may turn}} out to be <b>his</b> creation <b>of</b> a new annual tournament called the Laver Cup which pits Europe against the rest of the world.
