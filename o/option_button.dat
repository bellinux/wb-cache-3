40|$|Background : Automated, high-speed, {{high-resolution}} whole slide imaging (WSI) robots {{are becoming}} increasingly robust and capable. This technology has started {{to have a significant}} impact on pathology practice in various aspects including resident education. To be sufficient and adequate, training in pathology requires gaining broad exposure to various diagnostic patterns through teaching sets, which are traditionally composed of glass slides. Methods: A teaching set of over 295 glass slides has been used for resident training at the Division of Genitourinary Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Whole slide images were prepared from these slides using an Aperio ScanScope CS scanner. These images and case-related information were uploaded on a web-based digital teaching model. Results: The web site is available at: [URL] Once logged in, users can view the list of cases, or search cases with or without diagnoses shown. Each case can be accessed through an <b>option</b> <b>button,</b> where the clinical history, gross findings are initially shown. Whole slide images can be accessed through the links on the page, which allows users to make diagnoses on their own. More information including final diagnosis will display when the diagnosis-button is clicked. Conclusion: The web-based digital study set provides additional educational benefits to using glass slides. Residents or other users can remotely access whole slide images and related information at their convenience. Searching and sorting functions and self-testing mode allow a more targeted study. It would also prepare residents with competence to work with whole slide images. Further, the model can be expanded to include pre-rotation and post-rotation exams, and/or a virtual rotation system, which may potentially make standardization of pathology resident training possible in the future...|$|E

40|$|During 50 -min sessions, 6 male human {{subjects}} could press either Button A or Button B available as nonreversible <b>options.</b> <b>Button</b> A presses were nonaggressive responses and earned points {{according to a}} fixed-ratio 100 schedule. Prior to the experiment subjects were instructed that every 10 (fixed-ratio 10) Button B presses (aggressive responses) subtracted a point from a fictitious 2 nd subject. A random-time schedule of point loss was used to engender aggressive responding. The instructions attributed these point losses to the Button B presses of the subject's fictitious partner. Aggressive responding either escaped or avoided point loss by initiating an interval free of point loss. The duration of the interval was varied systematically across sessions. Avoidance contingencies maintained {{a high rate of}} aggressive responding over 30 sessions in the absence of point loss. Escape contingencies also maintained aggressive responding across sessions, with rates of aggressive responding corresponding to rates of point loss...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a learning system using {{an approach to}} induce hierarchical cognition for reconceptualization in Basic Electric Circuits. The concept-building model, which ascribes interactive multimedia to cognitive processes, is built upon the knowledge framework as a basis to design learners’ interaction at the interface. Cognitive processes are systematically activated over increasing levels of cognition and matched with learner activities of increasing complexity. The four-phase learning approach, namely, @cognitive conflict, (ii) testing presented new knowledge, (iii) discriminating new and old knowledge, and, (iv) declaring and articulating new concepts, {{is included in the}} cognition hierarchy of the concept-building model. Sensory activities of reading and observing an interface which are predominantly text, graphics and animations, of electrical phenomena stimulates conceptual recall as preparation for subsequent metacognitive activities involving increasing physical interactions at the interface. High learnercontrolled activities include encompass reading text guide, dragging and dropping graphical objects to specified coordinates, observing effects of construction, and entering input of voltage measurements. Interactive discussions of question and answer <b>options</b> <b>buttons</b> with explanatory feedback prompts help learners to mentally discriminate and clarify their new knowledge. As a final measure for cognitive consolidation, learners write opinions to contend true or false assertions of the different aspects of electrical concept...|$|R

40|$|Author: Al-Saleh, Khalid Industrial Engineering Department College of Engineering King Saud University Saudi Arabia Email Id: kalsaleh@ksu. edu. saThe need {{to analyse}} {{a large number}} of manual {{industrial}} tasks in manual assembly lines using Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Quick Exposure Check (QEC) initiated the need to develop a software for each technique to facilitate and speed up the process for obtaining the scores for each task. RULA and QEC are widely used to assess work-related musculoskeletal risks. RULA was available since 1993 while QEC was available since 1998. Both techniques require actual observation of the task in question and come with guidelines to enable the process of obtaining the scores for various work-related musculoskeletal disorders risks. However, this process is done manually consuming the time of the observer and having a possibility of committing mistakes. For each technique, a computer program in quick basic was written and tested. Then the program was transformed to a more practical and user friendly software using visual basic. Both softwares are very small in size (96 KB for RULA and 40 KB for QEC) and have an exe extension which makes them executable applications without the need for any additional software or program. In each software, the user or observer is required to input the relevant values which are previously gathered from actual task observations by simply selecting the relevant <b>option</b> <b>buttons.</b> Then the results are shown by the software promptly. Just recently, QEC was updated with a new version (QEC 2003). This version is nearly the same as the previous one except for some minor changes with wording in some assessment questions and the addition of one item within worker's evaluation (about driving), but the overall format and score calculation remain the same. The QEC software was updated accordingly...|$|R

There are only two parameters for this screen: zip code and latitude/longitude. You will only need to enter data for one or the other. Zip Code. This is the 5 -digit zip code for the physical location of your facility. IWAIR uses this zip code to assign the most appropriate meteorological station to your site; therefore, you should not use the zip code from a mailing address, such as a post office box or a company headquarters. The zip code database includes zip codes established through 1999.

40|$|What, exactly, is an "interface " and {{why does}} the {{electronic}} library need {{more than one of}} them? The etymology of the term {{can be traced back to}} the Greek prosopon, meaning a face that is facing another face in a living, mutual relationship. In ancient Greece, an interface was a third state of being, an ontological reality achieved through communication. Similarly, some modern scholars, for example, Marshall McLuhan (1962), Walter Ong (1982), and Michael Heim (1987), define "interface " as a technological environment that slowly transforms perception and cognition and eventually induces a new state of being, a new consciousness of self and world. Computer users learn to experience and participate in the world in a digital way through encounters at the interface. The software and hardware they use shape their digital experience and their expectations about the interface. For example, Macintosh users expect to use a mouse to select menu <b>options,</b> click <b>buttons,</b> and navigate with a scroll bar; they don't expect to type command...|$|R
