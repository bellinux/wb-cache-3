5|$|The {{road was}} {{originally}} {{built in the}} mid-18th century {{as part of the}} New Road, a bypass of Central London for coach traffic. It was named Pentonville Road after the new town of Pentonville, that encouraged manufacturing {{to move out of the}} city and into suburbia. Numerous factories and commercial premises became established <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> the 19th and 20th centuries, particularly after the arrival of London railways in the 1840s.|$|E

With their win, they moved up to No.2 and No.3 in the AP and Coaches' Polls.

5|$|Mells' war {{dead were}} first commemorated by a stone tablet {{on a wall}} in St Andrew's Church, {{designed}} by the Kensington School of Art and listing the names of 14 villagers. The idea for a larger, public memorial originated with the Horner family, who called a public meeting to discuss the possibilities. The participants first considered whether the memorial should be something with a utilitarian function or something purely monumental. Suggestions for utilitarian memorials included benches, a fountain, a garden, and a children's playground, but they felt that the memorial should be something {{to be looked at}} and admired. After discussing various potential locations, including St Andrew's churchyard, they decided that the memorial should be <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> a prominent position where it would be obvious to passers-by.|$|E

After the sacking of Henrique Calisto as head coach, Fowler was made player/coach.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the home}} {{teams in the}} playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation. From 1970 to 1974, the {{division}}al playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage, with the wild-card teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs. Starting in 1970, the divisional playoff games consisted of the AFC Central champions and the NFC West champions playing their games on the road. Then in 1971 it rotated to the AFC East champions and the NFC East champions playing their games <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>In</b> the 1972 divisional playoff games, the AFC West champions and the NFC Central champions were the visiting teams. And 1973 it would start all over with the AFC Central and NFC West again, and so on.|$|E

5|$|The current road {{further south}} was {{designed}} as a toll road by Thomas Telford to improve communications east of Glossop, which was expanding as an industrial town. It was originally called the Sheffield to Glossop Turnpike and run by a turnpike trust, the Sheffield and Glossop Trust. An act of parliament to build the road was passed in 1818, and construction was financed by the Duke of Norfolk and the Duke of Devonshire. The road opened in 1821, having cost £18,625 to build. Upon opening, it was the highest turnpike road in England. The road was immediately popular and increased toll collections of traffic heading to Glossop. Tolls were abolished <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> June 1870.|$|E

5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>In</b> the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E

5|$|Historically part of Gateshead Fell in County Durham, Sheriff Hill was {{the site}} of a battle between William the Conqueror and Malcolm III of Scotland in 1068. A road was built through Gateshead Fell in the early 13th century, {{attracting}} some settlers. A procession of bishops, sheriffs and noblemen known as the Sheriff's March took place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>in</b> 1282 and continued biannually until the 1830s. By then, Gateshead Fell had been enclosed and a village had grown around the road, largely populated by an influx of tinkers, coalminers working at Sheriff Hill Colliery and workers at the local pottery, mill and sandstone quarry. By the turn of the 20th century these industries were in steep decline. The local authority built a large council estate at Sheriff Hill to alleviate dangerous overcrowding in Gateshead, effectively turning the area into a residential suburb. It ceased to be an independent village on 1 April 1974 when it was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead {{under the terms of the}} Local Government Act 1972.|$|E
