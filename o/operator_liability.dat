The statute, however, did not define ownership liability. As a result, various courts devised three approaches to determine ownership of possessory interests in property.

40|$|The {{system of}} third party {{liability}} for nuclear damage {{established in the}} 1960 s has been the model for many national legal systems in countries with nuclear power programmes. However, this approach has been criticised. It is argued that, with compensation limited to certain types of damage and with limits set well below the possible consequences of an accident, not all damage arising from an accident might be compensated. Moreover, relatively low levels of <b>operator</b> <b>liability</b> mean that risks associated with nuclear power are borne {{by the general public}} and that the generation of nuclear electricity is effectively subsidised. Debate about nuclear liability and compensation arrangements increased markedly after the 1986 Chernobyl accident, which brought into stark relief numerous deficiencies in the existing regimes. The subsequent revision of the international nuclear liability and compensation conventions has sought to address this criticism by establishing higher liability amounts and broadening the range of compensable nuclear damage, whilst leaving much of the original 1960 s liability and compensation structure unchanged. ...|$|E

The necessity of regulating the legal obligations resulting from such incidents, in a convention level, in order to obviate the application of the various domestic laws on the matter which do not contain standard liability provisions, among other things, was long felt. Such need stems from the economic policy obtaining in international air law to define, regulate and limit an aircraft <b>operator's</b> <b>liability</b> from catastrophic losses that usually results from a single aviation accident, and extend reasonable protection to the rights of end-users, including innocent third parties, who may have suffered injury or sustained damage as a result of aircraft operations...|$|R

40|$|The Asset Conversation, Lender Liability, and Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 1996 {{amended the}} Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) to clarify under what {{circumstances}} secured creditors would and would not lose the protection of a statutory exemption from CERCLA § 107 (a) owner or <b>operator</b> <b>liability.</b> This safe harbor exempts from liability a person who holds indicia of ownership in a facility provided that the indicia is held primarily to protect a security interest, and that the person does {{not participate in the}} management of the facility.

40|$|Multimodal {{transportation}} means transporting goods from a pickup point, where the operator receives the goods, {{all the way}} to the delivery location, using at least two different means of transportation, covered under the same multimodal transport contract and by only one document, regardless of the number or type of transportation vehicles used. The key factor to the optimal operation of multimodal transportation is the multimodal transport operator. It is up to this individual to compensate for various unpredictable circumstances, the complexity of the business processes, nature’s whims and carelessness. He must also organize and execute multimodal transport in all stages. Due to the above mentioned dangers and the fact that the area of liability insurance for multimodal transport operators is still being neglected, this article raises some valid points in favour of a proposal that would cover all of the {{transportation means}} as well as all the accompanying activities with a single insurance policy. The model includes 17 elements of liability insurance for a multimodal transport operator and all values which quantify the insurance elements in 2009 as well as the projected values for 2015, when progress is expected in the areas pertaining to the implementation of economical processes concerning transit development, as well as values for 2025, representing a period of innovation, reconstruction, optimization and modernization. With this supposed model for liability insurance of a multimodal transport operator, the foundation is laid for a liability insurance which would be used by a multimodal transport operator.

This study, phase I {{of a continuing}} study, identifies key areas for food safety improvement. This study is designed as an exploratory evaluation of independently owned and operated delicatessen operations, using Escherichia coli and Sta phylococcus aureus as indicators to assess food handling and the public’s risk for pathogenic contamination from commonly served ready-to-eat/take-away foods. The analysis consisted of a comprehensive strategy of laboratory testing of samples for pathogenic contamination, informal field observation of food handling procedures, and {{the examination of the}} most recent health inspection reports for each of the 18 operations visited. The deli turkey, cream cheese and let tuce were tested using bacteria indicator plates. The results showed widespread levels of contamination. Of the 54 samples tested for Escherichia coli, 26 showed positive results which are ~ 45 % for E. coli contamination. Of the 54 samples tested for Staphy-lococcus aureus, 31 showed positive results which are ~ 57 % for S. aureus contamination. One issue discovered while conducting the study was the lack of consistent uniform international standards of contamination tolerance levels. The informal field observations and health report analyses revealed widespread temperature violations and numerous instances of poor food handling. The study offers independent practitioners a strategy designed to improve their health inspections scores, food handling, and mitigation of <b>operator</b> <b>liability.</b> Independe nt operators traditionally do not enjoy the resources of centralized supervision and expert on-staff t raining; yet in aggregate they account for significant volume in  both dollars and the quantity of product served.

40|$|The draft nuclear {{liability}} bill indemnifies the supplier {{of a nuclear}} plant and caps the liability of the operator {{in the event of}} an accident. The indemnity for suppliers is meant to please multinational plant vendors who wish to be free of liability even for accidents that result from a design flaw. The cap on <b>operator</b> <b>liability</b> is far lower than the potential damage that a nuclear accident could cause. This clause is designed to facilitate the entry of domestic big business into the nuclear market by ensuring that domestic operators will not be held responsible in the eventuality of damage following an accident. Hence the bill transfers risks for a nuclear mishap onto the people at large. Furthermore, it offers almost no financial disincentive for unsafe behaviour on part of the operators and suppliers of nuclear plants. The withdrawal of the civil {{nuclear liability}} bill from active consideration in Parliament provides us with a short period to reflect on some of the larger questions that are often neglected in the arguments over the minutiae of the bill. Not that the latter are unimportant, but neglecting the larger questions is also unwise. To the extent that we discuss the bill itself, we focus on its two major features rather than the details. The primary reason for the government to withdraw the bill was the strong opposition in Parliament and outside by various political parties and other formations. At the same time, there is also ample pressure, both foreign and domestic, to have some legislation passed so that various new players can enter the I ndian nuclear energy market. Since the Manmohan Singh govern ment is committed to a large expansion of nuclear power, it is expected that the bill will soon be revised and submitted for approval. What might the contours of such a revised bill be? To understand this, we first broadly describe the expected landscape of new nuclear commerce in India. In this landscape, a supplier or vendor – a company like Westinghouse or General Electric (GE) or Areva – will “supply ” a nuclear plant to an Indian operator. This operator will operate the plant to generate electri city and sell it to the grid. Under the current Atomic Energy Act...|$|E
40|$|This paper gives a {{particular}} attention to the handling of the multimodal transport <b>operator’s</b> <b>liability</b> in view of the new legislation in Kosovo, in terms of comparison with international legislation. From the research carried out in this area of transport, it has been found that, over the last decades, the international transport of goods has become more sophisticated and effective, and has increased rapidly because of the increased use of containers. Containers have advanced the flexibility to focus more on an integrated movement of goods instead of the movement specifically associated with a certain mode of transport. Unfortunately, this technical flexibility has been accompanied by a severe rigidity in the legal field in Kosovo as well.

40|$|Resumé v anglickém jazyce The {{topic of}} this thesis is "Liability for damage {{of the ski}} area operator. " Legislation of the ski area <b>operator's</b> <b>liability</b> for damage is {{primarily}} embodied in the Civil Code. When interpreting and applying the legal rules in Civil Code, is necessary based not only on this codification, but also use other legal regulations, even non-legal nature. In drawing conclusions about a private law liability for damage of the ski area operator is necessary to distinguish between two main activities with which {{the operation of the}} ski area is linked, and those are a) operation of the cableways, ski lifts and other transport facilities providing the transportation of skiers or snowboarders to the top and b) management of the downhill slopes allowing ride down the slopes of the skiers or snowboarders from the final station of the cableway or ski lift down the valley. This distinction is necessary not only from a purely practical point of view but also from a legal perspective. Operation of the cableways, ski lifts or other transport facilities providing the transportation for skiers or snowboarders is the provision of transport services within the meaning of the Railway Act. Any damage cause by the special nature of this operation is damage according to § 427 paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{power plant}} (NPP) {{operators}} have several basic long-term liabilities. Such liabilities include storage, treatment {{and disposal of}} radioactive waste generated at the operators’ NPP, storage and management of nuclear fuel irradiated in the reactor of the operator’s NPP (“spent fuel”), disposal of the spent fuel (SF) or residues resulting from spent fuel reprocessing. Last but not least, the operator is liable for decommissioning its nuclear facilities. If the operator considers extending the life time of its NPP or if {{the construction of a}} new NPP is being evaluated by an investor, an integral part of the economic evaluation must be a comprehensive assessment of future incremental costs related to the above-mentioned long-term liabilities. An economic evaluation performed by standard methods (usually NPV, alternatively real options) leads to a decision either to proceed with the project or to shelve it. If the investor decides to go ahead with the project there can be an immediate impact on nuclear liabilities. The impact is not the same for all <b>operator</b> <b>liabilities.</b> Depending on the valid legislation and the nature of the liability, in some cases the extent of the liability must be immediately recalculated when a decision is made to proceed with the project, and the annual accrual of accumulated reserves / funds must be adjusted. In other cases, the change in liability is linked to the generation of additional radioactive waste or spent fuel. In the Czech Republic, responsibility for each of the nuclear liabilities is defined, as is the form in which the financial means are to be accumulated. This paper deals with the impact of NPP life time extension (alternatively NPP power up-rate or construction of a new NPP) on individual nuclear liabilities in the conditions of the Czech Republic. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years the nuclear {{industry}} has used concerns about climate change to argue for a nuclear revival. Although industry representatives may have convinced some political leaders that this is a good idea, there is little evidence of private capital investing in nuclear plants in competitive electricity markets. The reason is simple: nuclear power is uneconomical. In an excellent recent analysis, "The Nuclear Illusion," Amory B. Lovins and Imran Sheikh put the cost of electricity from a new nuclear power plant at 14 -cents per kilowatt hour and that from a wind farm at 7 -cents per kilowatt hour. This comparison includes the costs of fuel, capital, operations and maintenance, and transmission and distribution. It does not include the additional costs for nuclear of disposing of waste, insuring plants against an accident, and decommissioning the plants when they wear out. Given this huge gap, the so-called nuclear revival can succeed only by unloading these costs onto taxpayers. If all the costs of generating nuclear electricity are included in the price to consumers, nuclear power is dead in the water. To {{get a sense of the}} costs of nuclear waste disposal, we need not look beyond the United States, which leads the world with 101, 000 megawatts of nuclear-generating capacity (compared with 63, 000 megawatts in second-ranked France). The United States proposes to store the radioactive waste from its 104 nuclear power reactors in the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, roughly 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. The cost of this repository, originally estimated at $ 58 billion in 2001, climbed to $ 96 billion by 2008. This comes to a staggering $ 923 million per reactor [...] almost $ 1 billion each [...] assuming no further repository cost increases. In addition to being over budget, the repository is 19 years behind schedule. Originally slated to start accepting waste in 1998, it is now set to do so in 2017, assuming it clears all remaining hurdles. This leaves nuclear waste in storage in 121 temporary facilities in 39 states [...] sites that are vulnerable both to leakage and to terrorist attacks. One of the risks of nuclear power is a catastrophic accident like the one at Chernobyl in Russia. The Price-Anderson Act, first enacted by Congress in 1957, shelters U. S. utilities with nuclear power plants from the cost of such an accident. Under the act, utilities are required to maintain private accident insurance of $ 300 million per reactor [...] the maximum the insurance industry will provide. In the event of a catastrophic accident, every nuclear utility would be required to contribute up to $ 95. 8 million for each licensed reactor to a pool to help cover the accident's cost. The collective cap on nuclear <b>operator</b> <b>liability</b> is $ 10. 2 billion. This compares with an estimate by Sandia National Laboratory that a worst-case accident could cost $ 700 billion, a sum equal to the recent U. S. financial bailout. So anything above $ 10. 2 billion would be covered by taxpayers. Another huge cost of nuclear power involves decommissioning the plants when they wear out. A 2004 International Atomic Energy Agency report estimates the decommissioning cost per reactor at $ 250 [...] 500 million, excluding the cost of removing and disposing of the spent nuclear fuel. But recent estimates for some reactors, such as the U. K. Magnox reactors that have high decommissioning waste volumes, decommissioning costs can reach $ 1. 8 billion per reactor. In addition to the costs just cited, the industry must cope with rising construction and fuel expenses. Two years ago, building a 1, 500 -megawatt nuclear plant was estimated to cost $ 2 - 4 billion. As of late 2008, that figure had climbed past $ 7 billion, reflecting primarily the scarcity of essential engineering and construction skills in a fading industry. Nuclear fuel costs have risen even more rapidly. At the beginning of this decade uranium cost roughly $ 10 per pound. Today it costs more than $ 60 per pound. The higher uranium price reflects the need to move to ever deeper mines, which increases the energy needed to extract the ore, and the shift to lower-grade ore. In the United States in the late 1950 s, for example, uranium ore contained roughly 0. 28 percent uranium oxide. By the 1990 s, it had dropped to 0. 09 percent. This means, of course, that the cost of mining larger quantities of ore, and that of getting it from deeper mines, ensures even higher future costs of nuclear fuel. Few nuclear power plants are being built in countries with competitive electricity markets. The reason is simple. Nuclear cannot compete with other electricity sources. This explains why nuclear plant construction is now concentrated in countries like Russia and China where nuclear development is state-controlled. The high cost of nuclear power also explains why so few plants are being built compared with a generation ago. In an illuminating article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, nuclear consultant Mycle Schneider projects an imminent decline in world nuclear generating capacity. He notes there are currently 439 operating reactors worldwide. To date, 119 reactors have been closed, at an average age of 22 years. If we generously assume a much longer average lifespan of 40 years, then 93 reactors will close between 2008 and 2015. Another 192 will close between 2016 and 2025. And the remaining 154 will close after 2025. But only 36 nuclear reactors are currently under construction worldwide [...] 31 of them in Eastern Europe and Asia. Although there is much talk of building new nuclear plants in the United States, there are none under construction. What these numbers indicate, Schneider points out, is that plant closings will soon exceed plant openings [...] and by a widening margin in the years ahead. The trend is clear. From 2000 to 2005, an average of 4, 000 megawatts of nuclear generating capacity was added each year. Since 2005, this has dropped to only 1, 000 megawatts of additional capacity per year. Even if all reactors scheduled to come online by 2015 make it, the projected closing of 93 nuclear reactors by then will drop nuclear power generation roughly 10 percent below the current level. Unless governments start routinely granting operating permits for reactors more than 40 years old, a half-century of growth in world nuclear generating capacity is about to be replaced by a long-term decline. Despite all the industry hype about a nuclear future, private investors are openly skeptical. In fact, while little private capital is going into nuclear power, investors are pouring tens of billions of dollars into wind farms each year. And while the world's nuclear generating capacity is estimated to expand by only 1, 000 megawatts this year, wind generating capacity will likely grow by 30, 000 megawatts. In addition, solar cell installations and the construction of solar thermal and geothermal power plants are all growing by leaps and bounds. The reason for this extraordinary gap between the construction of nuclear power plants and wind farms is simple: wind is much more attractive economically. Wind yields more energy, more jobs, and more carbon reduction per dollar invested than nuclear. Though nuclear power plants are still being built in some countries and governments are talking them up in others, the reality is that we are entering the age of wind, solar, and geothermal energy...|$|E

Restrictive eligibility criteria can protect manufacturer and <b>operator</b> from <b>liability</b> for injury, since no guest could sustain injury without exposure to the ride.

This paper describes and compares two approaches to more specifically determining participation eligibility for guests with disabilities and health conditions: the medical approach and the human factors engineering approach. Although many conditions are manifest in a range of severities, the medical approach will either impose the most restrictive eligibility on all guests with the same disability type, or require park personnel to make diagnostic determinations outside their expertise, and requires compilation of data about every disability and condition. The human factors engineering approach identifies functions to be performed by the guest to fulfill the ride experience. Clear description of functions and risks will enable guests to determine whether they are able to safely ride, in consultation with their own advisors. The approach to determining eligibility affects not only whether a particular guest can ride, but also operational practices that affect guests’ relationship with the park...|$|R

(2) The overwhelming majority of problematic ads discriminate on the basis of familial status. There are very few that discriminate based on race, ethnicity, or religion. (3) The few roommate ads that do mention race, ethnicity, or religion are more likely to discriminate in favor of minority groups. Thus, they appear more as expressions of individual diversity of backgrounds and beliefs than exclusionary tools of a majoritarian power structure. This information can and should inform changes to the legislative and enforcement regime for dealing with discriminatory housing advertisements. For example, we should recognize that the roommate relationship is different from traditional rental housing, and accord roommate-seekers protection from the law – protection which is currently given to small landlords (who arguably do not need it) but not co-lessees. Fair housing advocates also must address the unique problems presented by familial status as a protected category, both in terms of public awareness and acceptance of the law...|$|R
40|$|Operation of {{a nuclear}} {{installation}} is connected {{with the creation of}} long-term liabilities for spent fuel management and disposal, and also decommissioning of the installation (power plant, storages). This means that the operator will have to expend considerable amount of financial resources over a long period after the closure of installation. These financial resources will have to be created during operation of the installation. Related costs to be expended in future must be fully included in the price of electricity, in order to ensure fair competition among different operators. Financial resources for future coverage of liabilities must be continuously invested in order to compensate for inflation and to gain some real interest. Any failure by the operator to comply with its liabilities poses an economic and potentially an environmental hazard for operator’s country. Due attention must therefore be paid to assessing connected costs, defining liabilities and ensuring appropriate regulatory oversight. Appropriate measures must be well defined and firmly anchored in the legislation of countries operating nuclear installations. This paper reviews the basic principles that should ensure <b>operator’s</b> compliance their <b>liabilities,</b> and maps the current situation in the Czech Republic. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In fixed-odds numbers games, {{the prizes}} and {{the odds of}} winning are known {{at the time of}} {{placement}} of the wager. Both players and operators are subject to the vagaries of luck in such games. Most game <b>operators</b> limit their <b>liability</b> exposure by imposing a sales limit on the bets received for each bet type, at the risk of losing the rejected bets to the underground operators. This raises a question—how should the game operator set the appropriate sales limit? We argue that the choice of the sales limit is intimately related to the ways players select numbers to bet on in the games. There are ample empirical evidences suggesting that players do not choose all numbers with equal probability, but have a tendency to bet on (small) numbers that are closely related to events around them (e. g., birth dates, addresses, etc.). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to quantify this phenomenon and examine its relation to the classical Benford’s law. We use this connection to develop a choice model, and propose a method to set the appropriate sales limit in these games...|$|R
40|$|In {{the second}} part of the 20 th century it became clear to {{insurers}} that any nuclear accident has catastrophic potential. The characteristics of the nuclear risks made the coverage unattractive to individual insurers. The insurance industry was challenged to create structural and legal mechanisms, in order to be able to deal with the new hazard. The most important mechanism is the insurance pool which has contributed to the insurance industry remaining an essential part of the development of the nuclear industry and the nuclear third party liability regime. Today, the insurance market, through the insurance pools, is involved in the parallel creation of legislation and insurance policies in the two most important types of nuclear insurance: - Insurance of physical damage or first party liability that will provide coverage for all the operator’s assets on the nuclear facility. This damage consists of various types of actual damage and future damage or loss of income which results from the actual damage - Nuclear third party liability policy or liability insurance covers all aspects of off-site nuclear damage suffered by people, businesses and other property not directly related to the nuclear site. This paper aims to present the significance of the nuclear insurance pools in nuclear law and the provision of financial security in case of third party liability for the nuclear operator. Keywords: nuclear <b>operator,</b> third party <b>liability,</b> nuclear damage, insurance pool, financial security...|$|R
40|$|In 2008, as {{a result}} of a joint Indo-US {{agreement}} on civil nuclear cooperation, India gained access to the Nuclear Suppliersâ Group, allowing it to access civilian nuclear technology and fuel from other countries despite not being party to the Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Following this, in 2011 India announced ambitious plans to expand its installed nuclear power generation capacity to 63 Gigawatts (GW) (out of over 800 GW) by 2032 through civil nuclear trade. However, several years on, much of this envisaged trade and investment has yet to come to fruition. Nuclear power remains on the agenda; Indiaâs new government (elected in May 2014) urged the Department of Atomic Energy to triple nuclear power generation capacity from the current 5. 7 GW (out of a total installed capacity of over 200 GW) to 17 GW by 2024. In the longer term, Indiaâs Atomic Energy Commission expects a far more ambitious 500 GW of nuclear power capacity to be in place by 2060. However, the quantum of domestic and foreign investments required to achieve these targets has remained elusive. This has largely been put down to the passage into law of the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010 (âthe Actâ). The Act, which sets up a specialized compensation mechanism for victims of nuclear incidents, contains provisions arguably inconsistent with Indiaâs international obligations. Additionally, it has been held to be excessively onerous on the suppliers of nuclear equipment and materials. Two specific provisions are particularly contentious: Section 17 (b) which holds suppliers liable for recourse when a nuclear incident results from either a patent or a latent defect in the equipment or material supplied, or {{as a result}} of the supply of substandard services; and Section 46 which arguably allows suppliers to remain liable under regular provisions of tort law and other general legislation despite having fulfilled their liabilities under this Act. This article explores these two issues and argues for a legislative re-alignment that ensures nuclear safety while incentivizing participation in the nuclear industry. Though several other issues are relevant for operationalizing the Act, specifically the establishment of the India Nuclear Insurance Pool, recently announced by the Government of India for insuring <b>operator</b> and supplier <b>liability,</b> they are incidental to the core legal concerns that currently impair the growth of nuclear energy in India, and are consequently not dealt with in this article. </p...|$|R
