For decoration, Balabushka often inlaid small mother-of-pearl dots and notched diamonds. Series of window-shaped maple pieces commonly adorned Balabushka butt sleeves, with each window usually featuring one burl for its aesthetic effect. Some other features common {{to many other}} cuemakers' lines from the same era are notably absent or mostly absent from Balabushka's, including ivory inlays and the signing of his cues. A long-standing controversy exists over what finish Balabushka used. One side argues that he used an <b>oil</b> <b>finish</b> on all his cues, while the other insists that his later cues were coated with a spray lacquer.|$|E

50|$|This {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} called wet look, since wetting wood with water often displays the chatoyancy, albeit only until the wood dries. Certain finishes cause the chatoyancy (also referred to as wood iridescence, moire, vibrancy, shimmer or glow) to become more pronounced. <b>Oil</b> <b>finishes,</b> epoxy, and shellac can strongly bring out the wet look effect.|$|R
50|$|Oil - Oiled floors {{have existed}} for several {{thousand}} {{years and is}} the most common floor <b>finish</b> used globally. <b>Oil</b> <b>finished</b> floors are made from naturally derived drying oils, and are {{not to be confused with}} petroleum based oils.

5000|$|While {{tung oil}} has become popular as an {{environmentally}} friendly wood finish, {{it should be}} noted that many products labelled as [...] "tung oil finishes" [...] are deceptively labelled: polymerized oils, wiping varnishes, and oil/varnish blends have all been known to be sold as tung <b>oil</b> <b>finishes</b> (sometimes containing no tung oil at all), and all the above contain solvents and/or chemical driers. Product packaging will usually clearly state if it is pure tung oil. For example, Danish Oil has been thought to have tung oil in it.|$|R
5000|$|When {{used as a}} wood finish, {{linseed oil}} dries slowly and shrinks little upon hardening. Linseed oil does not cover the surface as varnish does, but soaks into the (visible and microscopic) pores, leaving a shiny but not glossy surface that shows off {{the grain of the}} wood. A linseed <b>oil</b> <b>finish</b> is easily repaired, but it {{provides}} no significant barrier against scratching. Only wax finishes are less protective. Liquid water penetrates a linseed <b>oil</b> <b>finish</b> in mere minutes, and water vapour bypasses it almost completely. [...] Garden furniture treated with linseed oil may develop mildew. Oiled wood may be yellowish and is likely to darken with age. Because it fills the pores, linseed oil partially protects wood from denting by compression.|$|E
50|$|It {{can be used}} {{to finish}} and protect wood, much like a mineral <b>oil</b> <b>finish.</b> It is used to {{condition}} and protect smooth leather products like bicycle saddles, boots, motorcycle clothing, and used to put a shine on patent leather shoes (when applied in a thin coat and then gently buffed off).|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinder}} had a side-loading gate which pulled {{straight to}} the rear. The sight picture was a ball and v type and is easy to align. It could be difficult to stay on target double-action due to the stiffness of the action. There was certainly no danger of accidentally pulling the trigger double-action. Cleaning and disassembly were easy as the cylinder pin doubled as a screwdriver and all-purpose tool. Internal parts were finely machined and finished. The trigger, hammer, {{and several of the}} internal springs were straw-finished, a type of case-hardening hot <b>oil</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|E

50|$|Formaldehyde resins are {{commonly}} used to bind together the fibres in MDF, and testing has consistently revealed that MDF products emit free formaldehyde and other volatile organic compounds that pose health risks at concentrations considered unsafe, for at least several months after manufacture. Urea-formaldehyde is always being slowly released from the edges and surface of MDF. When painting, {{it is a good}} idea to coat all sides of the finished piece in order to seal in the free formaldehyde. Wax and <b>oil</b> <b>finishes</b> may be used as finishes but they are less effective at sealing in the free formaldehyde.|$|R

50|$|Linseed oil, {{also known}} as {{flaxseed}} oil or flax oil, is a colourless to yellowish oil obtained from the dried, ripened seeds of the flax plant (Linum usitatissimum). The oil is obtained by pressing, sometimes followed by solvent extraction. Linseed oil is a drying oil, meaning it can polymerize into a solid form. Due to its polymer-forming properties, linseed oil {{can be used on}} its own or blended with combinations of other oils, resins or solvents as an impregnator, drying <b>oil</b> <b>finish</b> or varnish in wood finishing, as a pigment binder in oil paints, as a plasticizer and hardener in putty, and in the manufacture of linoleum. Linseed oil use has declined {{over the past several decades}} with increased availability of synthetic alkyd resins—which function similarly but resist yellowing.|$|E

50|$|Linseed oil is {{extracted}} from {{the seeds of the}} flax plant, already extensively grown for the production of linen. The raw oil may be used, but it cures poorly and leaves a sticky surface. Normally boiled linseed oil is used. This has been prepared beforehand by boiling with lead, in the form of lead oxide, or with manganese salts. Modern boiled oils use a lead-free metallic drier added cold, such as cobalt resinate. Old linseed <b>oil</b> <b>finishes</b> yellow with age, owing to oxidation with the air. Linseed oil was also widely used for the production of oilcloth, a waterproof covering and rainwear material, formed by coating linen or cotton fabrics with the boiled oil.|$|R
