50|$|Since the {{inception}} of computers, a key concept differentiating computers from <b>other</b> <b>calculating</b> <b>machines</b> has been their ability to store information. Over the years, various hardware devices {{have been designed to}} store ever larger quantities of data. With the development of the Internet the quantity of information available appears to continue to grow at an ever increasing rate often characterised as an Information Explosion. As information stored on traditional media such as hand-written documents, printed books, photographic images and the likes is being replaced by digital files so our social and cultural legacy to future generations will depend more and more on the permanence of digital information.|$|E
5000|$|Though {{they used}} {{machine-readable}} media, Babbage's engines, player pianos, jacquard looms and many <b>other</b> early <b>calculating</b> <b>machines</b> were themselves analog computers, with physical, mechanical parts. The first truly digital media {{came into existence}} {{with the rise of}} digital computers. [...] Digital computers use binary code and Boolean logic to store and process information, allowing one machine in one configuration to perform many different tasks. The first modern, programmable, digital computers, the Manchester Mark 1 and the EDSAC, were independently invented between 1948 and 1949. Though different in many ways from modern computers, these machines had digital software controlling their logical operations. They were encoded in binary, a system of ones and zeroes that are combined to make hundreds of characters. The 1s and 0s of binary are the [...] "digits" [...] of digital media.|$|R
