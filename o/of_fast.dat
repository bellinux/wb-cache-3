5|$|Ampelosaurus {{seems to}} {{have grown in a}} way similar to more basal sauropods. After a certain point in its development, the {{microscopic}} material of the bone became very different from more basal Sauropoda. Ampelosaurus grew more slowly once the bone microstructure became unique among sauropods. Although Diplodocoidea and basal Macronaria also show an increase in bone growth and a decrease in growth rate around the presumed onset of sexual maturity, it is much more gradual than Ampelosaurus. The process of growing, which in other sauropods started around sexual maturity, was clearly delayed in Ampelosaurus. The period of growth after sexual maturity seems to be shortened in Ampelosaurus and is dominated by slow bone building instead <b>of</b> <b>fast</b> growth. Growth marks are generally rare in sauropods or appearing only late in ontogeny, if at all. The lack of growth marks is suggestive <b>of</b> <b>fast</b> and continuous growth in sauropods, which supports the hypothesis that they achieved large body size through because <b>of</b> <b>fast</b> growth. Ampelosaurus does not show growth marks on any bone sample. This is unusual to be found with the apparently reduced growth rate and high level of bone growth seen in it, as those features are often associated with the occurrence of growth marks.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the practise <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> as one <b>of</b> traditional cleansing methods, nowadays settled {{in the concept of}} natural or alternative medicine. The first part explains the very concept <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> and its principle. Furthermore, it is stated what motivations lead to its taking. This method of purification has deep roots in history, from which it is possible to understand the importance and tradition in different directions of its use. Although the work is not oriented to fasting for religious reasons, this aspect is also outlined because of its strong connection with the general theme <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> Thereafter, the text focuses primary on the very <b>fast.</b> The principle <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> physiology, creating its effects and parallel being a base for understanding the whole method, is explained. Afterwards there is stated possible and recommended duration on the fasting period. The text explains different stages <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> which one passes through with specific feelings within the respective stage. Finally, the thesis describes principles and recommendations <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> method, which are important aspects of cleansing. Further the thesis focuses on the negative side effect <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> and its criticism due to contraindications and opposite opinions of the conventional western medicine. As the last point of this work is indicated the possibility <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> as a way of changing the lifestyle of the individual...|$|R

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{responses of}} adult and young freshwater Kinosternon scorpioides turtles raised in captivity were evaluated. Two experiments were performed: a) blood metabolite changes caused by food deprivation, and b) liver and muscle glycogen and total lipid differences after fasting and refeeding. Blood glucose concentration of young animals was susceptible to food deprivation. In both groups this metabolite decreased after 30 days <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> Feeding for 15 days did not recover blood glucose. Total seric proteins were {{not affected by}} food deprivation. Fasting decreased blood urea nitrogen and the highest difference was found around 30 days. Uric acid increased in young animals after 60 days <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> Triacylglicerol decreased after 15 days <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> and refeeding for 15 days recovered the pre-fasting levels. Free fatty acid plasma tended to increase around 15 days <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> Liver glycogen decreased at day 15 <b>of</b> <b>fasting,</b> being stable thereafter while muscle glycogen decreased at a slower rate. Total liver lipid stabilized after 30 days and then decreased 70 % after 60 days <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> Muscle lipids remained stable throughout fasting. It could be concluded that <b>fasting</b> <b>of</b> Kinosternon scorpioides led to metabolic adaptations {{similar to the one}} reported from reptiles and fish...|$|R

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVE To {{identify}} the length <b>of</b> perioperative <b>fasting</b> among patients submitted to gastrointestinal cancer surgeries. METHOD Retrospective cohort study, developed by consulting {{the medical records}} of 128 patients submitted to gastrointestinal cancer surgeries. RESULTS The mean of total length <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> was 107. 6 hours. The total length <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> {{was significantly associated with}} the number of symptoms presented before (p= 0. 000) and after the surgery (p= 0. 007), the length of hospital stay (p= 0. 000), blood transfusion (p= 0. 013), nasogastric tube (p= 0. 001) and nasojejunal tube (p= 0, 003), postoperative admission at ICU (p= 0. 002), postoperative death (p= 0. 000) and length <b>of</b> preoperative <b>fasting</b> (p= 0. 000). CONCLUSION The length <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> is associated with complications that affect the quality of the patients’ postoperative recovery and nurses’ work.

40|$|International audienceThe {{transition}} from the fed to the fasted resting state is characterized by, amongst others, changes in lipid metabolism and peripheral insulin resistance. Acylcarnitines have been suggested {{to play a role}} in insulin resistance besides other long-chain fatty acid metabolites. Plasma levels of long-chain acylcarnitines increase during fasting, but this is unknown for muscle long-chain acylcarnitines. We studied whether muscle long-chain acylcarnitines increase during fasting and their relation with glucose/fat oxidation and insulin sensitivity in lean healthy humans. After 14 and 62 hours <b>of</b> <b>fasting,</b> glucose fluxes, substrate oxidation, plasma and muscle acylcarnitines were measured before and during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Hyperinsulinemia decreased long-chain muscle acylcarnitines after 14 hours <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> but not after 62 hours <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> In both the basal state and during the clamp glucose oxidation was lower and fatty acid oxidation was higher after 62 hours vs. 14 hours <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> Absolute changes in glucose and fat oxidation in the basal vs. hyperinsulinemic state were not different. Muscle long-chain acylcarnitines did not correlate with glucose oxidation, fatty acid oxidation or insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake. After 62 hours <b>of</b> <b>fasting,</b> the suppression <b>of</b> muscle long-chain acylcarnitines by insulin was attenuated compared to 14 hours <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> Muscle long-chain acylcarnitines do not unconditionally reflect fatty acid oxidation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: These data were extended with information on fasting studies performed on our patients with MCAD deficiency known in the Beatrix Children's Hospital, UMC Groningen, The Netherlands. The data reflect considerable inter-individual variation and overlap between safe and unsafe duration <b>of</b> <b>fasting.</b> RESULTS: In six out <b>of</b> 35 <b>fasting</b> tests, symptoms were reported before hypoglycaemia was observed. Until 1 year of age, the median safe and unsafe duration <b>of</b> <b>fasting</b> was 12 hours (n= 7, range 8 - 19 hours) and 18 hours (n= 5, range 15 - 20 hours), respectively.
