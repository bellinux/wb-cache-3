5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The chemical structure <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E

40|$|The rubber {{industry}} {{plays an important}} role in the Malaysian economic. The exportation <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber</b> may be influenced by several factors such as the price <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber,</b> rubber-planted area and the consumption <b>of</b> synthetic <b>rubber.</b> Year by year, the price <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber</b> is increasing. The cost of producing the natural rubber is quite high due to the high pay of labor. It is feared that the increase in the price <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber</b> in Malaysia may lead to the lower demand from other countries towards the natural rubber in Malaysia. There is uncertainty of future exportation <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber</b> due to the unstable price <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber</b> as well as the existence and consumption <b>of</b> synthetic <b>rubber</b> This study is conducted by using the secondary data.

5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} 23,000 tyres per day at {{a factory}} in Nokia, Finland, and 200,000 tyres a year under the Bridgestone brand name. The original factory was built in 1904, the current one in 1945; it has expanded several times since then. Nokian Tyres has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant. The plant uses radio frequency devices to monitor the inventory of materials used to manufacture tyres, such as the 100-metre long strips <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> tread. Shortages <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> tread can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency. Despite trade journals discussing this technique, Nokian declines to confirm its production methods.|$|E

5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber. Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plantations and the gathering <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government {{to reduce the size}} of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber within the confines of its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its oil palm concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E

5|$|Abir {{collected}} 70 tons {{of dried}} rubber in 1895, rising to 410 tons in 1898 {{by which time}} it had eleven operational posts. At {{the same time the}} price <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> also increased from 6.30–6.50 fr per kilogram in 1894 to 8.04–10.00 fr per kilogram in 1898. Abir's costs in 1897 amounted to 0.25 fr per kilogram to purchase the rubber from the collectors (in lieu of tax), 0.4 fr for transportation, 0.25 in export duty paid to the Congo Free State and 0.45 for storage for a total cost of 1.35 fr per kilogram. In the same year Abir could sell on the rubber in Europe for up to 10 fr per kilogram. Abir's profits rose with the increasing quantity and price <b>of</b> <b>rubber,</b> for the first two years (1892–94) the company recorded a total profit of 131,340 fr, this had increased almost twentyfold by 1898 when they recorded a 2,482,697 fr profit just for one year. As a result, the dividend paid in 1898 was 1,100 fr per 500 fr share. These profits were made in spite of increasing costs due the doubling of export duty in 1892 and the construction of the Leopoldville-Matadi railway in 1894 which increased the cost of moving rubber to the coast to 0.63 fr per kilo, more than the entire trip to Antwerp had taken in 1892.|$|E
