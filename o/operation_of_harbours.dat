40|$|Being one of {{the most}} {{representative}} spatial processes of the last 30 years, which frequently occur in strategic parts of the cities and justify special financing investments, the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> renewal <b>of</b> <b>harbour</b> areas {{can be seen as a}} laboratory of contemporary urban design. In the context of the activity developed by the IFHP Working Party on Multifunctional and Intensive Land Use, these operations are also an high potential field of research, justifying its closer analysis, as it has been done in the last two years with the technical visits to Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Oslo, and now to Barcelona. Focusing on the multifunctional use of spaces, this paper analyses several <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> renewal <b>of</b> <b>harbour</b> areas, trying to identify the urban design solutions adopted in those operations regarding the physical distribution of the proposed urban functions. The case-study comparative analysis is the applied method, based on which are identified: (1) the different urban functions present on these operations, and; (2) the concept under which these different functions are disposed in the area and combined between themselves. The hypothesis is that it can be established a general classification on the forms how different functions are combined in these operations. The paper previously distinguishes two types of functions, regarding the relative its importance in the area: the dominant urban functions and the located urban functions. The dominant urban functions are those functions that generally dominate an urban area, although it can contain located urban functions within its perimeter on specific locations, e. g., residential areas, offices and shopping areas, industrial areas, public equipment areas and special use areas. The located urban functions are those specific functions that aren’t dominating functions and exist within the perimeter of a dominant urban function, e. g., schools, museums, public services, local shopping’s and others. The papers defines which are the frequent groups of dominant urban functions and of located urban functions in the analysed <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> renewal <b>of</b> <b>harbour</b> areas...|$|R

In 1993, local commercial associations made first plans for a major container terminal with initially four, later six, berths for large container vessels.|$|R

50|$|The harbour, {{located in}} the suburb of Vuosaari in East Helsinki, handles goods traffic for the Greater Helsinki region, while {{passenger}} services remain in Helsinki city centre. Vuosaari Harbour has assumed the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> two container <b>harbours,</b> West Harbour in the city centre and Sörnäinen Harbour, and will eventually also replace the oil harbour in Laajasalo. In addition, the railway depot in Pasila currently used by goods transport will be moved northwards. These processes release land for commercial and residential redevelopment.|$|R
40|$|Sediments {{that are}} dredged during routine <b>operations</b> for {{maintenance}} <b>of</b> <b>harbour</b> areas are generally contaminated, even {{in consideration of}} given standards or regulations that do not allow their free disposal in the aquatic system. Therefore, sediments coming from dredging operations have to be properly characterised since their final destination depends {{on the level of}} contamination. Due to the quantity of dredged sediments and the number of contaminants to determine, analyses carried out for characterisation are expensive and time-consuming. In this research work, a new approach for a prompt evaluation of sediments' contamination based on hyperspectral analysis is proposed. Results of laboratory tests carried out on marine sediments, before and after chemical-physical treatments, show a correlation among the value of reflectance, obtained by hyperspectral analysis, and the level of contamination and size distribution of sediments. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

40|$|Gathering {{baseline}} data on ecology {{is essential for}} sustainable development in order to predict and minimize any future negative effects on living organisms. Dredging <b>of</b> <b>harbour</b> causes loss <b>of</b> benthic habitat and Secutor ruconius, (Pug nose pony fish) being a schooling Demerol omnivore is a very likely candidate to reflect any effects <b>of</b> <b>harbour</b> building activities. In this study, therefore, the size and length weight relationship of the beach seine pony fish Secutor ruconius was examined in the Ampara district, {{in the month of}} October, 2010, at a site near the Oluvil harbour, prior to commencement <b>of</b> <b>operations</b> and at a relatively undisturbed control site in Maruthamunai, 20 km north <b>of</b> the <b>harbour</b> site. At each site, according to a stratified random sampling method, two boats were sampled in the morning, {{at about the same time}} of the day, to examine intra and inter site variations in estimates. From each boat 100 - 200 individuals of Secutor ruconius were collected for length and weight comparisons. Total length of Secutor ruconius was measured to the nearest 0. 1 cm using a foot ruler and weight was measured on an electronic balance to the nearest 0. 1 gm. The mean lengths and weights of Secutor ruconius in samples from undisturbed Maruthamunai site did not differ between boats but those of the disturbed Palamunai boat samples were different between themselves. However, the mean length and weight estimates of Secutor ruconius from the disturbed Palamunai site were always higher than those from the undisturbed Maruthamunai site (P<O. OI). Length weight regressions for Secutor ruconius from all study sites showed a positive correlation and an overall significant relationship (P<O. OI). In comparison of regression slopes there was no strong evidence against null hypothesis as P value was always < 0. 01. The regressions of both populations had the same slope but differed in the range of size they occupied. Regression slopes were less than 3 (body length increases faster than weight), ranging from 2. 48 to 2. 81. These values tally with the findings of other researchers. Apart from their food value, examining pony fish populations for impacts <b>of</b> <b>harbour</b> construction is useful because they play an important role in the food chains of commercially exploited fish species (tuna, mackerel, trevally). However, further monitoring may be worthwhile after the commencement <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>harbour.</b> This study is only a preliminary exploratory investigation but it provides important base line ecological data which was hitherto non existent...|$|R
25|$|Economic {{output in}} the Gaza Strip {{declined}} by about one-third between 1992 and 1996. This downturn {{was attributed to}} Israeli closure policies and, to a lesser extent, corruption and mismanagement by Yasser Arafat. Economic development has been hindered by Israel refusing to allow the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> a sea <b>harbour.</b> A Gaza Seaport was planned {{to be built in}} Gaza with help from France and The Netherlands, but the project was bombed by Israel in 2001. Israel said that the reason for bombing was that Israeli settlements were being shot at from the construction site at the harbour. As a result, international transports (both trade and aid) had to go through Israel, which was hindered by the imposition of generalized border closures. These also disrupted previously established labor and commodity market relationships between Israel and the Strip. A serious negative social effect of this downturn was the emergence of high unemployment.|$|R
