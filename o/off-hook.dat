25|$|Strowger-based, {{step-by-step}} {{offices in}} the Bell System required continuous maintenance, such as cleaning. Indicator lights on equipment bays in step offices alerted staff to conditions such as blown fuses (usually white lamps) or a permanent signal (stuck <b>off-hook</b> condition, usually green indicators). Step offices were more susceptible to single-point failures than newer technologies.|$|E
25|$|A {{telephone}} exchange automatically senses an <b>off-hook</b> {{condition of the}} telephone when the user removes the handset from the switchhook or cradle. The exchange provides dial tone {{at that time to}} indicate to the user that the exchange is ready to receive dialed digits. The pulses or DTMF tones generated by the telephone are processed and a connection is established to the destination telephone within the same exchange or to another distant exchange.|$|E

40|$|Existing {{methods for}} nonholonomic motion {{planning}} {{can be applied}} to exactly nilpotentizable or flat systems. However, some nonholonomic systems do not fall into this class. For these, it is expected that the availability of globally defined nilpotent approximations will be important for the synthesis of efficient steering and stabilization strategies. In this paper, we consider as a case study the vehicle consisting of a car pulling two <b>off-hooked</b> trailers, and we show how to compute a nilpotent approximation that is valid in the neighborhood of both regular and singular points. Simulation results to test the accuracy of the proposed procedure are given. Copyright c fl 1998 IFAC Keywords: Nonholonomic systems, singularities, nilpotent approximation 1. INTRODUCTION Nonholonomic motion planning and control are challenging problems of particular relevance in mobile robotics (Laumond et al., 1998). Substantial progresses have been recently achieved: for example, we know how to [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Amateur {{radio and}} some {{cellular}} or PCS wireless systems use direction finding or triangulation of transmitter signals radiated by the mobile. This {{is sometimes called}} radio direction finding or RDF. The simplest forms of these systems calculate the bearing from two fixed sites to the mobile. This creates a triangle with endpoints at the two fixed points and the mobile. Trigonometry tells you roughly where the mobile transmitter is located. In wireless telephone systems, the phones transmit continually when <b>off-hook,</b> making continual tracking and the collection of many location samples possible. This is one type of location system required by Federal Communications Commission Rules for wireless Enhanced 911.|$|E
500|$|Nominal {{impedance}} {{first started}} to be specified {{in the early days}} of telecommunications. [...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. [...] It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. [...] It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. [...] Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections (and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect) and power transfer is maximised. [...] To this end, all cables and equipment {{started to be}} specified to a standard nominal impedance. [...] The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 Ω, originally used for telephony. [...] It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more to do with the way telephones were interfaced into the local exchange than any characteristic of the local telephone cable. [...] Telephones (old style analogue telephones) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. [...] Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line (dialling, handset <b>off-hook</b> etc.). [...] The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground. [...] A telephone exchange relay coil is around 300 Ω so the two of them together are terminating the line in 600 Ω.|$|E
2500|$|When a subscriber's {{phone is}} <b>off-hook,</b> it {{presents}} an electrical resistance {{across the line}} which causes current to flow through the telephone and wires to the central office. [...] In a manually operated switchboard, this current flowed through a relay coil, and actuated a buzzer or a lamp on the operator's switchboard, signaling the operator to perform service.|$|E
2500|$|With manual service, the {{customer}} lifts the receiver <b>off-hook</b> and asks the operator {{to connect the}} call to a requested number. Provided that the number {{is in the same}} central office, and located on the operator's switchboard, the operator connects the call by plugging the ringing cord into the jack on the switchboard corresponding to the called customer's line. If the called party's line is on a different switchboard in the same office, or in a different central office, the operator plugs into the trunk for the destination switchboard or office and asks the operator answering (known as the [...] "B" [...] operator) to connect the call.|$|E
2500|$|As in the divided-multiple {{telephone}} switchboard arrangements {{with which it}} served until it replaced them, the panel system consisted of an originating section and a terminating section, connected by a line circuit. A subscriber's line had two appearances in a local office, one on the originating side, {{and one on the}} terminating side. The line circuit consisted of a line relay on the originating side to indicate that a customer had gone <b>off-hook,</b> and a cutoff relay to keep the line relay from interfering with an established connection. [...] The cutoff relay was controlled by a sleeve lead that, as with the multiple switchboard, could be activated by either the incoming section or the outgoing. [...] The final selector performed a sleeve test to detect a busy line when a subscriber was called.|$|E
50|$|The <b>off-hook</b> tone (also {{receiver}} <b>off-hook</b> tone, <b>off-hook</b> warning, or howler tone) is a telephony signal used {{to alert}} a user that the telephone {{has been left}} <b>off-hook</b> without use for an extended period, effectively disabling the telephone line. See permanent signal.|$|E
50|$|Many {{ringdown}} circuits work in both directions. In {{some cases}} a circuit {{is designed to}} work in one direction only. That is, going <b>off-hook</b> at one end (end A) rings the other (end B). Going <b>off-hook</b> at end B has no effect at end A.|$|E
5000|$|Wink Start - {{when the}} {{originator}} goes off hook, {{the other end}} transmits a short (140-290ms) <b>off-hook</b> signal and returns to on-hook. The originator detects the wink and then sends the dialed digits. The other end goes permanently <b>off-hook</b> (seized) when the call is answered.|$|E
5000|$|Non-dialled {{connection}} (an <b>off-hook</b> extension automatically dials an extension).|$|E
50|$|Calling switch goes <b>off-hook.</b> It sends ABCD bits = 1111.|$|E
50|$|On an {{ordinary}} two-wire telephone line, <b>off-hook</b> status is {{communicated to the}} telephone exchange by a resistance short across the pair. When an <b>off-hook</b> condition persists without dialing, for example because the handset has fallen off or the cable has been flooded, it is treated as a permanent loop or permanent signal.|$|E
5000|$|Connect <b>off-hook</b> lines {{through to}} the local {{exchange}} — the concentration function.|$|E
5000|$|On a trunk, on-hook and <b>off-hook</b> signals {{must pass}} in both directions. In a one-way trunk, the {{originating}} or A board sends a short for <b>off-hook,</b> {{and an open}} for on-hook, while the terminating or B board sends normal polarity or reverse polarity. This [...] "reverse battery" [...] signaling was carried over to later automatic exchanges.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{enterprises}} with a private branch exchange (PBX) switch, the ringdown can be operated by the PBX key. The switch is programmed to ring a specific extension (the called phone) when a defined extension (the calling phone) goes <b>off-hook.</b> The PBX does not offer dial tone to the calling extension: it only detects on-hook or <b>off-hook</b> status.|$|E
50|$|The act {{of going}} <b>off-hook</b> is also {{referred}} to as seizing the line or channel.|$|E
50|$|The {{message is}} then {{followed}} by a fast busy signal instead of the <b>off-hook</b> tone.|$|E
50|$|The called switch goes <b>off-hook</b> {{when the}} call is answered. It sends ABCD bits = 1111.|$|E
50|$|The {{media gateway}} uses MGCP to report events, such as <b>off-hook</b> or dialed digits, to the Call Agent.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>off-hook</b> tone if {{the phone}} has {{been picked up}} but no number dialed for an {{extended}} period of time.|$|E
50|$|A hotline is a {{point-to-point}} {{communications link}} {{in which a}} call is automatically directed to the preselected destination without any additional action by the user when the end instrument goes <b>off-hook.</b> An example would be a phone that automatically connects to emergency services on picking up the receiver. Therefore, dedicated hotline phones do not need a rotary dial or keypad. A hotline can also be called an automatic signaling, ringdown, or <b>off-hook</b> service.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{automatic}} ringdown circuits have one-to-many configurations. When {{one phone}} goes <b>off-hook,</b> {{a group of}} phones is made to ring simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>off-hook</b> {{condition}} is a tip condition or describes a circuit {{that is in}} use, e.g., when a phone call is in progress.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{busy signal}} sometimes occurs (sometimes with an intercept message played over the busy) {{at the end}} of a call to indicate the other party has hung up (see Disconnect tone), but mostly the <b>Off-hook</b> tone is used. In some phone companies in the United Kingdom, the busy signal is played after the dial tone to indicate the caller has used up their allocated time to dial a number and must hang up, before the <b>off-hook</b> tone is played.|$|E
5000|$|In {{telephone}} switching systems, wink pulsing is recurring pulsing {{in which the}} off-condition is relatively short compared to the on-condition. In Wink start trunks, the exchange at the originating end sends an <b>off-hook</b> to alert to a call. The terminating end indicates readiness to receive the dialed telephone number by sending an <b>off-hook</b> of approximately half a second duration, or [...] "wink". Upon receiving this go ahead signal, the originating end uses multi-frequency or other address signalling to send the phone number.|$|E
50|$|An FXS {{interface}} utilizes an FXO {{protocol to}} detect when the terminating device (telephone) goes on-hook or <b>off-hook,</b> and can {{send and receive}} voice signals.|$|E
50|$|These exchanges used a relay {{to detect}} a drop in line voltage (usually to less than -10V <b>off-hook,</b> {{compared}} to -48V when on-hook) to begin billing for a call; a separate relay controlled ringing on the line. The black box placed a resistor in series with the line, so that the <b>off-hook</b> voltage was closer to -36V: just enough to stop the ringing, {{but not enough to}} trigger billing. A bypass capacitor was often added to prevent the device from attenuating AC signals such as transmitted voice.|$|E
5000|$|PSTN {{protocol}} - Translation of the analogue signals for POTS into {{a digital}} form for transfer from AN to LE. (i.e. <b>off-hook,</b> digit dialling, on hook etc.).|$|E
50|$|A {{dial tone}} is a {{telephony}} signal sent by a telephone exchange or {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) to a terminating device, such as a telephone, when an <b>off-hook</b> condition is detected. It indicates that the exchange is working and is ready to initiate a telephone call. The tone stops when the first dialed digit is recognized. If no digits are forthcoming, the permanent signal procedure is invoked, often eliciting a special information tone and an intercept message, followed by the <b>off-hook</b> tone, requiring the caller to hang up and redial.|$|E
5000|$|One of two {{possible}} signaling states, such as tone or no tone, or ground connection versus battery connection. Note: if on-hook pertains to one state, <b>off-hook</b> {{pertains to the}} other.|$|E
5000|$|SSDC5 is {{commonly}} used in the United Kingdom and unlike Type V the on- and <b>off-hook</b> state, are backwards to allow for fail-safe operation. If line breaks interface defaults to busy.|$|E
