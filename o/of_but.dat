The post property, now {{being used as a}} roadhouse, soon became known as McCarty's. Another prospector named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's Roadhouse to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.|$|E

Letters were to be passed through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part <b>of,</b> <b>but</b> only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions that were to {{be passed on to}} André, written in both code and invisible ink, using Stansbury as the courier.|$|E

5|$|As New Orleans {{continues}} {{to recover from}} Hurricane Katrina, various projects have been proposed but increasing material and labor costs have eliminated some. The tallest tower approved for construction in the city was Trump International Hotel & Tower; upon completion it would have become the tallest building in New Orleans at a height <b>of</b> , <b>but</b> construction was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2011. Phase 3 of Canal Place is another skyscraper proposed for construction in the city. In addition, while not new constructions, many of the older buildings in the central business district are undergoing renovations to condominium, apartment and hotel towers; these projects include the National American Bank Building.|$|E

5|$|Goebel {{challenged}} the vote returns in several counties. While the challenges were being adjudicated, Goebel {{was shot by}} an unknown assassin; Goebel was ultimately declared {{the winner of the}} election, but died of his wounds two days after being sworn into office. Among those charged in Goebel's murder was Governor Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Powers employed Brown as his legal counsel during his first trial, which ended in a conviction in July 1900. Brown died January 11, 1904, in Henderson and was buried at the Fernwood Cemetery in that city. He was the namesake <b>of,</b> <b>but</b> not related to, 20th century Kentucky Congressman John Y.

5|$|People of {{all ages}} played board games pitting two players against each other, {{including}} latrunculi ("Raiders"), a game of strategy in which opponents coordinated the movements and capture of multiple game pieces, and XII scripta ("Twelve Marks"), involving dice and arranging pieces on a grid of letters or words. A game referred to as alea (dice) or tabula (the board), to which the emperor Claudius was notoriously addicted, may have been similar to backgammon, using a dice-cup (pyrgus).

Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude toward them of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly.

5|$|Below Spalding, {{there were}} no {{restrictions}} on headroom, which allowed small coasters to reach the town. The bridge at Fosdyke was a swing bridge, {{to comply with the}} provisions of the Fosdyke Bridge Act of 1870. The demise of such traffic allowed it {{to be replaced by a}} fixed bridge with headroom <b>of</b> , <b>but</b> the powers of the original act had to be rescinded, and the Port of Fosdyke Act was obtained in 1987 to allow this to happen. The redundant wharfs at Fosdyke have been developed to provide moorings for yachts and other pleasure craft. The lock at Fulney has three sets of gates, two pointing towards the sea, and a third between them which points upriver. The lock can thus only be used when the level below it is higher than the level above it, and as the tide falls, the intermediate gate closes to prevent its use.|$|E
5|$|Earthsea {{itself is}} an {{archipelago}} {{or group of}} islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware <b>of,</b> <b>but</b> which is disrupted by somebody {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned Kargish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.|$|E

NY9A was cut back to the Lincoln Tunnel as a result. The extension of I-478 into Manhattan was eliminated following the collapse of part of the Elevated Highway in 1973, an event which led to the demolition of the highway south of 59th Street. Demolition was completed in 1989.
