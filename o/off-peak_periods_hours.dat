25|$|Peak and {{off-peak}} {{is used by}} TransLink {{to encourage}} passengers to travel during non-busy hours. TransLink does this by offering discounts to passengers for traveling during off-peak hours. Peak is from 06:00 to 08:30 and 15:30 to 19:00 weekdays, except public holidays, while off-peak is from 08:30 to 15:30 and after 19:00 weekdays until 06:00 the following day and all day weekends and gazetted public holidays. To qualify for off-peak, the journey or segment must be commenced before the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> ends.

40|$|This paper studies how {{the price}} affects {{the demand for}} public {{transport}} in the peak- and <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> in the public transport in Stockholm. Further, the study investigates how differences in price elasticities of demand in the peak- and <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> can enable an increase in revenues {{as well as the}} total number of passengers while dampening the peak-load problem through price discrimination. The data is set up to examine the effect of the price on the number of passengers travelling by subway from January 1999 to December 2008. A number of control variables are used to isolate the effect of a price change in our econometric model. Thereafter, the elasticities of demand for each period are calculated in order to find Ramsey prices that can be used when a monopoly firm maximizes profit and minimizes the welfare loss. The study concludes that the price elasticities of demand differ between the peak- and the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> and that SL should charge a higher price in the peak-period and a lower price in the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> to both increase their revenue, the total number of passengers, and reduce their problems associated with the peak-load demand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} a price signal with two settings: off-peak tariff and on-peak tariff. Some loads {{are connected to}} specific electricity meters which allow the consumption of power only in <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> Historically, <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods</b> were located during the night and on-peak periods during the day. Changing the assignment of <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods</b> is an easy method for distribution system operators to access to the flexibility of small consumers. This solution can be implemented quickly as the infrastructure needed already exists in some countries. We propose a mixed-integer linear model to assign optimally the off-peak hours so as to minimize a societal cost. This cost gathers together the cost of electricity, the financial losses due to energy curtailments of photovoltaic installations and the loads’ wellbeing. Our model considers automatic tripping of inverters and constraints of the electrical distribution networks. Simulation {{results show that the}} new disposition of off-peak hours could reduce significantly the photovoltaic energy curtailed in the summer.

2500|$|Melbourne uses [...] "clock-face" [...] {{timetables}} in <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> {{but generally}} not in peak periods, due to operating {{near to the}} capacity of the infrastructure and having to accommodate single-line sections, flat junctions, and regional diesel-hauled trains. Even in <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> however, frequencies vary according to time of day and day of week, and by line. In some places, services on two lines combine to provide more frequent services on common sections of tracks. Saturday and Sunday services are identical during the day, but differ during the evening on some lines. Sunday morning services however start later than on Saturdays, and run less frequently until around 10am.|$|R
5000|$|Laker {{claimed that}} Skytrain helped to grow {{passenger}} numbers for all airlines in the London—New York market, citing statistics comparing passenger {{numbers for the}} July—September peak season in 1977 {{with those of the}} corresponding period in 1976 as evidence. These had shown that in the days before Skytrain, total traffic between London and New York for the aforesaid period in 1977 was down 2% on the same period in 1976. He contrasted these figures with those comparing the October—December 1977 <b>off-peak</b> <b>period</b> with the corresponding 1976 <b>off-peak</b> <b>period.</b> The latter set of figures had shown a 30% increase, boosted by [...] "Skytrain", which launched on 26 September 1977.|$|R
30|$|Load {{shifting}} {{technologies are}} those which facilitate moving or shifting existing loads to <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> Technologies involved often use process control to modify industrial operations or use electric energy storage or {{thermal energy storage}} for space heating, cooling or domestic water heating.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, the {{marginal}} utility of customer j in period t {{during the peak}} periods is MU_jt^H. If the demand amount is reduced to D_jt^a as the marginal utility decreases, the market will also fall to a new equilibrium E^'. The unmet partial load during the peak periods will shift to the <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods</b> because their relative marginal utility increases during the <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods</b> MU_jt^L. Therefore, the demand will increase to D_jt^o + ∑_τ tγ_jτ t· DRL_jτ^max· D_jτ^o, where DRL_jt^max is the maximum DR level of customer j in period t and γ_jτ t is the load-shifting rate of customer j from time t to time τ. This reflects that customers’ initiative leads to behaviors that are driven by their marginal utility.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{difference}} between peak and off-peak occupancy rates in public transport, the average emission per traveller kilometre is lower in the peak than during the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period.</b> However, in this paper {{it is argued that}} it is much more fruitful to analyse environmental effects in marginal than in average terms. The issue appears to depend on capacity management policies of public transport suppliers that are facing increases in demand both during the peak and <b>off-peak</b> <b>period.</b> A detailed analysis of capacity management of the Netherlands Railways reveals that the off-peak capacity supply is mainly dictated by the demand levels during the peak period. Topics that receive attention in the analysis are the effects of frequency increases and size of vehicle increases on environmental effects. Also environmental economies of vehicle size are taken into account in the analysis. The main conclusion is that the marginal environmental burden during the peak is much higher than is usually thought, whereas it is almost zero at the <b>off-peak</b> <b>period.</b> Thus, one arrives at a pattern that is entirely reversed compared with the average environmental burden: peak passengers are more polluting than off-peak passengers. The conclusion is that policies based on average environmental performances would lead to misleading conclusions. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} have proposed numerous advanced load scheduling algorithms for smart homes {{with the goal}} of reducing the grid’s peak power usage. In parallel, utilities have introduced variable rate pricing plans to incentivize residential consumers to shift more of their power usage to low-price, <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> also {{with the goal of}} reducing the grid’s peak power usage. In this pa-per, we argue that variable rate pricing plans do not incentivize consumers to adopt advanced load scheduling algorithms. While beneficial to the grid, these algorithms do not significantly lower a consumer’s electric bill. To address the problem, we propose flat-power pricing, which directly incentivizes consumers to flat-ten their own demand profile, rather than shift as much of their power usage as possible to low-cost, <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods.</b> Since most loads have only limited scheduling freedom, load scheduling algo-rithms often cannot shift much, if any, power usage to low-cost, <b>off-peak</b> <b>periods,</b> which are often many hours in the future. In con-trast, flat-power pricing encourages consumers to shift power usage even over short time intervals to flatten demand. We evaluate the benefits of advanced load scheduling algorithms using flat-power pricing, showing that consumers save up to 40 % on their electric bill, compared with 11 % using an existing time-of-use rate plan...|$|R
