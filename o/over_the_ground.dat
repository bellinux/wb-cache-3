5|$|The {{diminishing}} {{number of}} troops available to Vang Pao demanded their replacement by growing numbers of Thai volunteers (Project Unity), who increasingly took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> war in the north. By the end of 1971, the entire 55-man battalion of Thais were in action, whose total numbers were 6,000–8,000 men. During the following year, those numbers had ballooned to 17,800. The total force eventually deployed was three artillery and 27 infantry battalions.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the known}} Ankylosaurus {{specimens}} were not scientifically described at length, though several paleontologists planned to do so, until Carpenter redescribed the genus in 2004. Carpenter noted that Ankylosaurus has become the archetypal member of its group, and the best known ankylosaur in popular culture, perhaps due to a life-sized reconstruction of the animal being featured at the 1964 World's Fair in New York City. Many traditional popular depictions show Ankylosaurus in a squatting posture and with a huge tail club being dragged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Modern reconstructions show the animal with a more upright limb posture and with the tail held off the ground. Likewise, large spines projecting sideways from the body (similar to those of nodosaurs) are present in many traditional depictions, but are not known from Ankylosaurus itself.|$|E

5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. The course for the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road staged {{its first}} Scottish League match when Hibs joined {{the league in}} 1893. Hibs were only renting Easter Road, which Edinburgh city {{planners}} had designated for future development. This meant the club were unwilling to develop the ground and looked for alternatives. Hibs considered relocating to Aberdeen in 1902, a year before Aberdeen FC was formed by a merger of three local clubs. In 1909, work began on a potential new ground in the Piershill area of Ednburgh, but the North British Railway company won a court order allowing them to build a railway line <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> No line was ever built, but Hibs' interest in moving to the site was thwarted. The long-term future of Easter Road was only secured in 1922, when the club agreed a 25-year lease on the ground. Two years later, three banks of terraces were raised, while a main stand seating 4,480 people {{was built on the}} west side of the ground. The redeveloped stadium had a capacity of 45,000. The pitch was also moved 40 yards to the east, providing space for the main stand. The slope was reduced to approximately 6 feet as part of this work.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a small swallow that has grey-brown underparts {{becoming}} white on the throat and lower abdomen, dark grey-brown upperparts and a slightly forked tail. The underparts are heavily streaked with black. It nests in small colonies anywhere with suitably sheltered sites for constructing a nest, such as ledges, buildings, tunnels, caves or amongst rocks. The nest is a shallow cup of twigs and other plant material, and the normal clutch is two or three brown-spotted white eggs. The incubation and fledging times are unknown. The Mascarene martin has a heavy flight with slow wingbeats interspersed with glides, and frequently perches on wires. It feeds on insects in flight, often hunting low <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> or vegetation. In eastern Africa, open habitats such as deforested areas are frequently used for hunting. A number of internal and external parasites have been detected in this species.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} be able to host Test cricket, the ground {{underwent}} a redevelopment starting in 2008, which saw the stands built to increase capacity and other construction work undertaken to make the hosting of international cricket at the ground more viable. A four-star Hilton Hotel with an integrated media centre overlooking the ground was opened in 2015. The end names are the Pavilion End to the south and the Hotel End to the north. Following Hampshire Cricket Ltd finding itself in financial trouble in 2011, the lease <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> was sold to Eastleigh Borough Council for £6.5 million with Rod Bransgrove injecting a similar sum in 2012.|$|E

However the NSW Labor Government, under Premier Neville Wran, amended the Sydney Sports Ground and Cricket Ground Act to remove the Trust's power to decide who played at the SCG and the NSWCA's traditional right <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> A new Trust was established with 12 members appointed by the Government and two elected by SCG members. The new Trust had no WSC opponents, and although legal action by the NSWCA stopped WSC games being played at the SCG in 1977, they were played there in 1978.|$|E

At 12:52pm, the Su-27 aircraft – flown by two experienced pilots – entered a rolling maneuver with a downward trajectory at low altitude; having rolled upright once more the aircraft was still descending rapidly and the left wing dropped shortly before the aircraft hit the ground, {{at which point the}} crew initiated ejection. The aircraft flattened out initially, skidding <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> towards stationary aircraft, striking a glancing blow against the nose of an Il-76 transport aircraft before beginning to explode and cartwheel into the crowd of spectators.

25|$|The first {{football}} team {{to play at}} St James' Park was Newcastle Rangers in 1880 They moved to a ground at Byker in 1882, then returned briefly to St James' Park in 1884 before folding that year. Newcastle West End took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in 1886. West End were wound up in 1892 and effectively merged into their rivals Newcastle East End, {{who took over the}} lease of St James' Park and became Newcastle United later that year. Local residents opposition to football being played at St James' dated back to the first games in the Football League following the building of the first small stand at the Gallowgate End. A redeveloped Gallowgate and further stands followed in 1899, bringing the first official capacity to 30,000 (standing).|$|E
25|$|Though {{aware of}} the {{weakness}} of his defense lines, Moreaux {{did not want to}} retreat, possibly because he was masking Jourdan's transfer of troops to the north. Kaiserslautern was held by the division of Jean-Jacques Ambert with eight battalions, a cavalry regiment and two squadrons of chasseurs à cheval. Many of the soldiers were raw recruits and some were not even armed. One of the few veteran battalions was commanded by Nicolas Oudinot. Anxious about the position, Moreaux sent Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr, an adjutant general whose advice he trusted, to look <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> Saint-Cyr advised Ambert to retreat but that general had orders to hold his ground though he had only 5,000 troops.
