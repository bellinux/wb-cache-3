5|$|These {{benefits}} meant that, {{as early}} as 1901, Fisher was pressing the advantages of <b>oil</b> <b>fuel.</b> There were technical problems with oil-firing, connected with the different distribution {{of the weight of}} <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> compared to coal, and the problems of pumping viscous oil. The main problem with using oil for the battle fleet was that, {{with the exception of the}} United States, every major navy would have to import its oil. As a result, some navies adopted 'dual-firing' boilers which could use coal sprayed with oil; British ships so equipped, which included dreadnoughts, could even use oil alone at up to 60% power.|$|E
5|$|Repairs and {{alterations}} of {{the power}} plant continued until 1904, when the continuing boiler failures compelled the Navy to dispense with <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> and convert Rostislav to coal in 1904 and 1905. Each round of repairs and alterations added more weight to the already overweight ship, and by 1907 the ship's belt armor was completely below the waterline.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, it was {{proposed}} to list Loring on the Environmental Protection Agency's National Priorities List. This {{was due to}} the presence of waste <b>oil,</b> <b>fuel,</b> solvents, and pesticides in the soil. Additionally, the burning of waste also created problems, in addition to the use of landfills in old gravel pits on site. The fire training area also needed clean up, as materials were burned until 1974 on that site. Loring was officially added to the list in February 1990.|$|E

5|$|In service, the Pennsylvania-class saw {{limited use}} in the First World War, as a {{shortage}} of <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> in the United Kingdom meant that only the coal-burning ships of Battleship Division Nine were sent. Both were sent across the Atlantic to France after the war for the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and were then transferred to the Pacific Fleet before being significantly modernized from 1929 to 1931. For {{the remainder of the}} inter-war period, the ships were used in exercises and fleet problems. Both Pennsylvania and Arizona were present during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which brought the United States into the Second World War. Arizona was sunk by a massive magazine explosion and was turned into a memorial after the war, while Pennsylvania, in dry dock at the time, received only minor damage. After a refit from October 1942 to February 1943, Pennsylvania went on to serve as a shore bombardment ship for most of the remainder of the war. Pennsylvania was present at the Battle of Surigao Strait, the last battle ever between battleships, but did not engage. Pennsylvania was severely damaged by a torpedo on 12 August 1945, two days before the cessation of hostilities. With minimal repairs, it was used in Operation Crossroads, part of the nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll, before being expended as a target ship in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{scrapping}} of obsolete ships after World War I {{had caused}} {{a downturn in}} demand for scrap iron {{by the time the}} Navy decided to sell off Warrior on 2 April 1925. There was no commercial interest in scrapping the old ship, and she remained at Portsmouth for another four years. She was modified into a mooring jetty beginning on 22 October 1927. This entailed the removal of all of her equipment and masts other than her boilers and generators, and the installation of two diesel-driven emergency pumps. The space under the poop was converted into accommodation for a shipkeeper and his family. The hulk was towed to her new home, Pembroke Dock in Wales, on 13 March 1929 where she served as a floating oil jetty. For the next fifty years, the ship lay just offshore from an oil depot at Llanion Cove. The Navy covered the ship's upper deck with a thick layer of concrete during one of her maintenance dockings before World War II. In the war, she served as a base ship for coastal minesweepers and, on 27 August 1942, was renamed as <b>Oil</b> <b>Fuel</b> Hulk C77 to release her name for use by a light aircraft carrier, , then under construction. She refuelled 5,000 ships during her service at Llanion Cove.|$|E

25|$|Conversion to <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> {{would not}} work for Pomona, because on the Corvallis run, {{they would have to}} fill the tanks with {{sufficient}} fuel to make the round trip, and this would sink the boat down in the water, making it more difficult to reach points on the upper river, particularly during low water.|$|E
25|$|By the 1930s most British {{shipping}} companies specified <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> for new steamships {{because it was}} more economical. Booth, however, still specified coal because it was cheaper, and as the company's ships carried little cargo on outward voyages to South America and it considered it could afford larger coal bunkers. Anselms bunkers had capacity for 980 long tons of coal.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} about growing crops for fuel use rather than {{food and the}} environmental impacts of large-scale agriculture and land clearing required to expand the production of vegetable oil for fuel use.

25|$|As with 100% {{biodiesel}} (B100), {{to ensure}} the fuel injectors atomize the vegetable oil in the correct pattern for efficient combustion, vegetable <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> must be heated to reduce its viscosity to that of diesel, either by electric coils or heat exchangers. This is easier in warm or temperate climates. MAN B Diesel, Wärtsilä, and Deutz AG, {{as well as a}} number of smaller companies, such as Elsbett, offer engines that are compatible with straight vegetable oil, without the need for after-market modifications.|$|E

In that year, she was converted from coal to <b>oil</b> <b>fuel.</b> She was sold to her managers in 1950 and renamed Nancy Moller in 1951.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, Flyer had an {{extensive}} overhaul and conversion to <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> {{to allow her}} to compete with the newer steel steamers that the Puget Sound Navigation Company had purchased in the Great Lakes and brought round South America.

In 1907, so many people wanted to travel to Tacoma on the Flyer that they were regularly turned away at the dock.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the three new ships, the two destroyers and the light cruiser , caused the first {{installation}} of <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> tanks in Halifax and Victoria harbours. While sailing from the United Kingdom to Canada, {{it was found that}} while Patrician performed to expectations, the lack of service in the other two ships while awaiting transfer had caused their performances to decline. The three ships arrived at Halifax in late 1920. On 21 January 1921, the three ships departed for a cruise carrying secret documents from the Admiralty to British consulates throughout Central and North America. While on the cruise, the squadron was ordered to Puntarenas, Costa Rica, where their presence was used to strengthen the Canadian government position in negotiations over oil concessions.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, Houlder Line {{reported}} that during 1946 {{they had taken}} Empire Balfour on bareboat charter {{for a period of}} three years.

She was converted from coal to <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> and improvements made in the crew's accommodation at a cost of £45,000. She served with Houlder Brothers for another nine years. In 1958, Barton Grange was sold to the Western Steamship Co Ltd, Hong Kong and renamed Sunlight. She was operated under the management of Wang Kee & Co Ltd, Hong Kong. After serving with Western for four years, Sunlight was sold to the Pan-Norse Steamship Co SA, Panama. She was operated under the management of Wallem & Co Ltd, Hong Kong. She served for five years with Pan-Norse. Sunlight arrived on 30 March 1967 at Hong Kong for scrapping.|$|E
25|$|Ailsa Craig had two quite {{separate}} {{rail transport}} systems, one dated from 1886 and supplied coal, <b>oil</b> <b>fuel</b> and provisions to the lighthouse and gas works via the North Port {{and later the}} New Jetty and the other transported road stone from the quarries at Kennedy's Nags via the stone crusher to the Quarry Pier. The Northern Lighthouse Board's tramway had a section worked via a powered cable way that hauled wagons up from the North Port and later from the New jetty. This well-built tram line is largely intact and has a gauge of 3 feet with junction/points at the gas works and a further set of points {{that led to a}} siding that ran down parallel to the gable end of the gas works to presumably collect the coal ash for disposal. The main line runs on down to the lighthouse and its ancillary buildings, taking a right-angled bend to run parallel to {{the southern end of the}} lighthouse buildings block. This section of the line was worked by hand and at least two wagons remain at the site together with a set of spare wheels at the gas works.|$|E
