40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{assessment}} about the structure {{and use of the}} conceptual model of occlusion in operational weather forecasting. In the beginning a survey has been made about the conceptual model of occlusion as introduced to operational forecasters in the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). In the same context an overview has been performed about the use of the conceptual model in modern operational weather forecasting, especially in connection with the widespread use of numerical forecasts. In order to evaluate the features of the occlusions in operational weather forecasting, all the occlusion processes occurring during year 2003 over Europe and Northern Atlantic area have been investigated using the conceptual model of occlusion and the methods suggested in the FMI. The investigation has yielded a classification of the <b>occluded</b> <b>cyclones</b> {{on the basis of the}} extent the conceptual model has fitted the description of the observed thermal structure. The seasonal and geographical distribution of the classes has been inspected. Some relevant cases belonging to different classes have been collected and analyzed in detail: in this deeper investigation tools and techniques, which are not routinely used in operational weather forecasting, have been adopted. Both the statistical investigation of the <b>occluded</b> <b>cyclones</b> during year 2003 and the case studies have revealed that the traditional classification of the types of the occlusion on the basis of the thermal structure doesn’t take into account the bigger variety of occlusion structures which can be observed. Moreover the conceptual model of occlusion has turned out to be often inadequate in describing well developed cyclones. A deep and constructive revision of the conceptual model of occlusion is therefore suggested in light of the result obtained in this work. The revision should take into account both the progresses which are being made in building a theoretical footing for the occlusion process and the recent tools and meteorological quantities which are nowadays available...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of a narrow, heavy, occasionally convective snowband that fell within a modest surface cyclone on 19 January 1995 is examined using gridded model output from a successful numerical simulation performed using the University of Wisconsin—Nonhydrostatic Modeling System. It is found that the snowband was produced by a thermally direct vertical circulation forced by significant lower-tropospheric warm frontogenesis {{in the presence of}} across-front effective static stability differences as measured in terms of the equivalent potential vorticity (PVe). The sometimes convective nature of the snowband resulted from the development of freely convective motions forced by frontal lifting of the environmental stratification. Model trajectories demonstrate that a stream of warm, moist air ascended through the trowal portion of the warm-occluded structure that developed during the cyclone life cycle. The lifting of air in the trowal was, in this case, forced by lower-tropospheric frontogenesis occurring in the warm-frontal portion of the warm occlusion. This trowal airstream accounts for the {{production of}} the so-called wrap-around precipitation often associated with <b>occluded</b> <b>cyclones</b> and, in this case, accounted for the northern third of the heavy snowband. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} latent heat release on the {{development}} of the occluded thermal structure in a major winter storm is examined through comparison of full physics (FP) and no-latent-heat-release (NLHR) simulations of the event performed using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM 5). Though both simulations possess a well-developed occluded thermal ridge near the surface, the 3 D structure of their respective occluded quadrants is quite different. In particular, the FP simulation depicts the canonical, troposphere-deep warm occluded thermal structure, whereas the NLHR simulation produces only a shallow, poorly developed one. Consistent with these differences in tropospheric thermal structure, the FP cyclone displays a robust treble clef potential vorticity (PV) distribution in the upper troposphere in its postmature phase, while a considerably less robust version characterizes the NLHR simulation. The PV minimum of the treble clef overlies a poleward sloping column of warm, weakly stratified air that extends through the depth of the troposphere and is a signature of the trowal, the essential structural feature of warm <b>occluded</b> <b>cyclones.</b> Consequently, examination of the role played by latent heat release in production of the occluded thermal structure in this case is made through consideration of its influence on the evolution of the upper-tropospheric PV morphology.

40|$|During March 1962, {{the cloud}} changes {{associated}} with the predevelopment and development-periods of two secondary cyclones in the North Pacific Ocean were viewed {{on at least two}} successive days by the 8 - 12 p “window” channel of the TIROS IV meteorological satellite. Both secondary cyclones developed {{at the base of the}} occlusion. For the two cases, when the secondary circulations were first noticeable on the surface chart, the equivalent blackbody temperatures (TaB) as measured by the radiometer averaged 15 ’K colder than the day before in the northeast quadrant relative to the base of the occulusion. The average TBB was taken over an area of approximately 300, 000 mi 2. For two other cases, an average warming of 4 ’K occured from day to day over the same area relative to th 2 base of the occlusion when no significant secondary development occurred and when the primary <b>occluded</b> <b>cyclone</b> was slowly weakening.

40|$|On 7 June 1998, a {{mesoscale}} convective system (MCS), {{associated with}} a mesoscale cyclone, was initiated {{on the south side}} of a mei-yu front near Hong Kong and developed over the Taiwan Strait. In this study, numerical simulations for this event are performed using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–NCAR Me-soscale Model (MM 5). The model captures the evolution of the MCS, including the shapes of clouds and the rainfall rate. In the mature phase of the simulated MCS, the MCS is composed of several meso-b- and meso-g-scale convective clusters possessing commalike shapes similar to that of a midlatitude <b>occluded</b> <b>cyclone.</b> The cluster at the head of the ‘‘comma’ ’ consists of convective clouds that are decaying, while the tail of the comma is made up of a leading active convective line.

40|$|Separate vector {{expressions}} for {{the rate}} of change of direction of the potential temperature gradient vector resulting from the geostrophic vorticity and geostrophic deformation, referred to as QVR and QDR, respectively, are derived. The evolution of the thermal structure and forcing for quasigeostrophic vertical motion in an <b>occluded</b> <b>cyclone</b> are investigated by examining the distributions of QVR and QDR and their respective convergences. The dynamics of two common structural transformations observed in the evolution of occluded cyclones are revealed by consideration of these separate forcings. First, the tendency for the sea level pressure minimum to deepen northward and/or westward into the cold air west of the triple point is shown to be controlled by the convergence of QVR, which is mathematically equivalent to thermal wind advection of geostrophic vorticity, a well-accepted mechanism for forcing of synoptic-scale vertical motion. Second, the lengthening of the occluded thermal ridge and surface occluded front are forced by the nonfrontogenetic geostrophic deformation, which rotates the cold frontal zone cyclonically while it rotates the warm frontal zone anticyclonically. The net result is a squeezing together of the two frontal zones along the thermal ridge and a lengthening of the occluded thermal ridge. The associated convergence of QDR along the axis of the the thermal ridge also forces vertical motion on a frontal scale. This vertical motion accounts for the clouds and precipitation often observed to extend from the triple point westward to the sea level pressure minimum in the northwest quadrant of occluding cyclones. 1...|$|E
5000|$|Meteorological {{conditions}} {{during the}} evening hours of June 18, 2001 rapidly began to deteriorate across the Upper Midwest. At 7 PM CDT (0000 UTC) an <b>occluding</b> <b>cyclone</b> was present over Northeast Minnesota, while a secondary front was located to its south. A zonally oriented warm front extended from the southern low, while a north-south cold front was located near the low pressure. Cape values in Iowa were between the 3000 to 4500 J/kg range, and conditions were starting to deteriorate there as well. By early evening a line of thunderstorms began to develop along the cold front across Eastern Nebraska and Iowa, and extended up into Minnesota.

40|$|The Arizona Monsoon Boundary {{is defined}} as the {{boundary}} separating two distinctly different air masses over Mexico, the southwestern United States, and the adjacent Pacific during the summer. The structure and dynamics of this boundary are examined by cross-sectional analysis using three different data sources: (1) a time-height cross section, constructed using radiosonde observations, at the time the boundary initially passed through Tucson in 1984; (2) a composite cross section through the boundary, constructed from the Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center analysis; and (3) a cross section through the boundary using high-resolution fields of temperature, moisture, and geopotential height obtained from the VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS). All three cross sections showed similar structure. In some respects, the Arizona monsoon boundary resembles a mid-latitude front with a distinct and relatively sharp air mass change across the boundary, forced almost entirely by confluence. A direct ageostrophic circulation is produced by this forcing, giving weak ascent on the warm, moist side of the boundary. The gradients and flow associated with the composite boundary are weaker, by a factor of four, than those associated with strong mid-latitude fronts. However, the VAS cross section suggests that, at times, the strength of the boundary approaches that of middle-latitude fronts. The wind shear suggested by the composite boundary ought to be unstable to baroclinic or barotropic processes. Disturbances developing along the boundary have been observed. One example of such a disturbance is examined using GOES imagery, lightning strike data, cloud track winds, and VAS data. Satellite images show the disturbance resembling a mid-latitude <b>occluded</b> <b>cyclone,</b> with an apparent low pressure center over northern Baja California and front-like cloud features extending eastward and southward from the low. Lightning strike data show convective activity occurring along the front-like features. Wind data indicate the presence of a cyclonic circulation south of San Diego along the Baja California coast. Cross sections using VAS data suggest that barotropic and baroclinic energy sources are present and suggest the front-like nature of the cloud feature extending southward from the low pressure center. Additionally, a second disturbance that eventually interacted with the monsoon boundary is briefly examined using satellite imagery...|$|E

40|$|The {{two main}} {{principles}} underlying {{the use of}} isentropic maps of potential vorticity to represent dynamical processes in the atmosphere are reviewed, including the extension of those principles to take the lower boundary condition into account. {{the first is the}} familiar Lagrangian conservation principle, for potential vorticity (PV) and potential temperature, which holds approximately when advective processes dominate frictional and diabatic ones. the second is the principle of 'invertibility' of the PV distribution, which holds whether or not diabatic and frictional processes are important. the invertibility principle states that if the total mass under each isentropic surface is specified, then a knowledge of the global distribution of PV on each isentropic surface and of potential temperature at the lower boundary (which within certain limitations can be considered {{to be part of the}} PV distribution) is sufficient to deduce, diagnostically, all the other dynamical fields, such as winds, temperatures, geopotential heights, static stabilities, and vertical velocities, under a suitable balance condition. the statement that vertical velocities can be deduced is related to the well-known omega equation principle, and depends on having sufficient information about diabatic and frictional processes. Quasi-geostrophic, semigeostrophic, and 'nonlinear normal mode initialization' realizations of the balance condition are discussed. an important constraint on the mass-weighted integral of PV over a material volume and on its possible diabatic and frictional change is noted. Some basic examples are given, both from operational weather analyses and from idealized theoretical models, to illustrate the insights that can be gained from this approach and to indicate its relation to classical synoptic and air-mass concepts. Included are discussions of (a) the structure, origin and persistence of cutoff cyclones and blocking anticyclones, (b) the physical mechanisms of Rossby wave propagation, baroclinic instability, and barotropic instability, and (c) the spatially and temporally nonuniform way in which such waves and instabilities may become strongly nonlinear, as in an <b>occluding</b> <b>cyclone</b> or in the formation of an upper air shear line. Connections with principles derived from synoptic experience are indicated, such as the 'PVA rule' concerning positive vorticity advection on upper air charts, and the role of disturbances of upper air origin, in combination with low-level warm advection, in triggering latent heat release to produce explosive cyclonic development. In all cases it is found that time sequences of isentropic potential vorticity and surface potential temperature charts—which succinctly summarize the combined effects of vorticity advection, thermal advection, and vertical motion without requiring explicit knowledge of the vertical motion field—lead to a very clear and complete picture of the dynamics. This picture is remarkably simple in many cases of real meteorological interest. It involves, in principle, no sacrifices in quantitative accuracy beyond what is inherent in the concept of balance, as used for instance in the initialization of numerical weather forecasts...|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} severe {{thunderstorms}} that impacted the Oslo area have been investigated. The thunderstorms {{occurred during the}} summer of 2014, an extraordinary summer with record high temperatures, number of lightning strikes and amount of short-term precipitation. The thunderstorm on 26 June produced precipitation amounts of 44. 5 mm in one hour and 72. 8 mm in 24 hours, both records. It was short-lived in both time and space. The other thunderstorm on 4 August was part of a large organized convective system that traveled from southern Sweden to northern Norway, lasting 15 hours in total. Even though both thunderstorms were intense, the dynamical processes leading to their formation and evolution were starkly different. The necessary ingredients for deep convection are sufficient moisture, conditional instability and a so-called triggering mechanism. An in-depth synoptic scale analysis utilizing maps of the large scale flow, Lagrangian backward trajectories and stability indices is conducted for both cases to better understand how these necessary ingredients were met and their respective roles in the observed deep convection. The June case was characterized by large-scale persistent northerly flow associated with an <b>occluding</b> <b>cyclone</b> east of Norway and high pressure to the west. The flow pattern resulted in significant cold air advection and a suppressed tropopause (upper level cold anomaly). Meager amounts of moisture were found in this case, albeit with a local maximum in the thunderstorm region. Additionally, no synoptic scale triggering mechanism was present. The trajectory and stability index analyses indicate the primary cause of the thunderstorm was a steep vertical temperature lapse rate resulting from local surface heating and the large-scale upper-level cold anomaly. The surface heating {{on the day of the}} event was sufficient to create positively buoyant air parcels, thereby triggering the deep convection. The August case provides a remarkable contrast. The large scale flow characterized by low pressure to the west and high pressure to the east of Norway resulted in significant warm, moist advection and an elevated tropopause. The trajectory analysis points to two moisture regions: the Atlantic ocean and over the Baltic. The combination of anomalously high surface temperatures and moisture content led to large values of conditional instability as evidenced in the stability index analysis. Associated with a low pressure center over Great Britain, a frontal boundary draped over western Norway on the day of the event providing a triggering mechanism. The large scale (in time and space) nature of the organized convective system can be tied to the presence of significant vertical wind shear associated with low-level baroclinicity (i. e. the front). This study of two distinctly different cases of intense deep convection illustrates the utility of combining an understanding of the large scale flow pattern over the days prior to a convective event and the local scale conditions with respect to the necessary conditions for deep convection. Lagrangian analyses and stability indices were found to be valuable tools for the assessment of both events, tools that are available in a forecast framework...|$|R
50|$|In meteorology, a cyclone is a {{large scale}} air mass that rotates around a strong center of low {{atmospheric}} pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones also lie within the synoptic scale.Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within the smaller mesoscale. Upper level cyclones can exist without {{the presence of a}} surface low, and can pinch off {{from the base of the}} Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclones have also been seen on extraterrestrial planets, such as Mars and Neptune.Cyclogenesis describes the process of cyclone formation and intensification. Extratropical cyclones begin as waves in large regions of enhanced mid-latitude temperature contrasts called baroclinic zones. These zones contract and form weather fronts as the cyclonic circulation closes and intensifies. Later in their life cycle, extratropical <b>cyclones</b> <b>occlude</b> as cold air masses undercut the warmer air and become cold core systems. A cyclone's track is guided over the course of its 2 to 6 day life cycle by the steering flow of the subtropical jet stream.|$|R
5|$|Extratropical {{cyclones}} form along linear {{bands of}} temperature/dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear, {{and are thus}} classified as baroclinic cyclones. Initially, cyclogenesis, or low pressure formation, occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak. The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants, where divergence ensues. The divergence causes air to rush out {{from the top of}} the air column. As mass in the column is reduced, atmospheric pressure at surface level (the weight of the air column) is reduced. The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone (a low pressure system). The lowered pressure acts to draw in air, creating convergence in the low-level wind field. Low-level convergence and upper-level divergence imply upward motion within the column, making cyclones tend to be cloudy. As the cyclone strengthens, the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone. Meanwhile, its associated warm front progresses more slowly, as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser, and therefore more difficult to dislodge. Later, the <b>cyclones</b> <b>occlude</b> as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front, forcing a tongue, or trowal, of warm air aloft. Eventually, the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken.|$|R
40|$|Output from a {{numerical}} simulation by the University of Wisconsin Nonhydrostatic Modeling System {{is used to}} investigate {{the evolution of the}} surface frontal structure of an intense winter cyclone that occurred off the east coast of North America. Using the model data as input to the piecewise potential vorticity (PV) inversion method developed by Davis and Emanuel, the total surface frontogenesis is partitioned into contributions from discrete PV anomalies. These contributions are calculated using the nondivergent balanced winds associated with PV anomalies in the upper, interior, and surface layers as well as the balanced irrotational winds in what is termed piecewise frontogenesis. The cyclone of interest developed into a nearly stationary, well-occluded storm characterized by a cutoff PV anomaly at the tropopause and near-surface frontogenesis concentrated in the warm frontal zone. During the open wave stage of the cyclone life cycle, this frontogenesis was produced largely by the balanced flow, particularly that portion of it associated with the upper-level PV anomaly. Throughout the remainder of the cyclone life cycle, the upper-level contribution to the frontogenesis retained a distribution {{similar to that of the}} total frontogenesis. After the <b>cyclone</b> <b>occluded,</b> however, the frontogenesis forced by the unbalanced portion of the flow became increasingly significant despite the persistent smallness of the unbalanced winds. In fact, a substantial portion of the lower-tropospheric frontogenesis observed in the occluded quadrant, including that along a developing bent-back front, was eventually associated with the unbalanced flow. These results suggest a potentially significant role is played by unbalanced motions in the development and maintenance of lower-tropospheric frontal structure in midlatitude cyclones. 1...|$|R
