50|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> {{is a type}} {{of heated}} bath used in a laboratory. These baths are {{commonly}} used to heat reaction mixtures. An <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> is essentially a container of oil that is heated by a hot plate. Generally, silicone oil is used in modern <b>oil</b> <b>baths,</b> although mineral <b>oil,</b> cottonseed oil and even phosphoric acid have been used in the past.|$|R
50|$|Another {{use of an}} <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> is {{to filter}} {{particulates}} out of air, by leading the air stream through an (unheated) <b>oil</b> <b>bath.</b> This type of air filter was used in car engines, but {{has been replaced by}} modern paper air filters. In some cases <b>oil</b> <b>baths</b> are used to heat bearings so they (the bearings) expand before installing them on shafts of aircraft engines.|$|R

25|$|A basic {{melting point}} {{apparatus}} {{for the analysis}} of crystalline solids consists of an <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> with a transparent window (most basic design: a Thiele tube) and a simple magnifier. The several grains of a solid are placed in a thin glass tube and partially immersed in the <b>oil</b> <b>bath.</b> The <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> is heated (and stirred) and with the aid of the magnifier (and external light source) melting of the individual crystals at a certain temperature can be observed. In large/small devices, the sample is placed in a heating block, and optical detection is automated.|$|R
50|$|Introduction - Multiple disk {{clutches}} {{are used}} to deliver extremely high torque in a relatively small space. These clutches can be used dry or wet (<b>oil</b> <b>bath).</b> Running the clutches in an <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> also greatly increases the heat dissipation capability, which makes them ideally suited for multiple speed gear boxes and machine tool applications.|$|R

30|$|Polyethylene {{glycol monomethyl ether}} 5000 (PEG) (Aldrich) {{with narrow}} {{molecular}} weight distribution (PDI =  1.06) was employed to grow single crystals. The self-seeding technique was applied for growing single crystals. Solution crystallization was carried out with a dilute concentration of 0.008  wt% in amyl acetate as solvent, and melt crystallization was conducted without solvent and on appropriate silicon wafers. The sample was heated to above the dissolution temperature (T d =  42 °C) in solution system and melting temperature in bulk system (T m =  65 °C) in a temperature-controllable <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> for 15  min. Then it was transferred to a 0 °C bath lasting 5  h for fast crystallization and, subsequently, immersed into a given self-seeding temperature <b>oil</b> <b>bath,</b> and kept for 20  min. The sample was then quickly switched into a desired isothermal <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> adjusted at crystallization temperature, and maintained for 2  days. Self-seeding method was also used to grow the single-co-crystals. Solution single crystallization {{was carried out in}} amyl acetate (Merck, > 98 %). Desired amount of solutes (50 / 50 wt/wt of homo and copolymer) and amyl acetate were added into the cell tube to reach the dilute concentration of 0.018  wt%. Then the sealed cell tube was heated to above the dissolution temperature (T d =  65  °C) in a temperature-controllable <b>oil</b> <b>bath,</b> and kept for about 12  min. Then cell tube was switched to another <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> at present − 10  °C lasting 5  h for crystallization. The cell tube was then immersed into a given self-seeding temperature (T s) <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> (T s =  41  °C), and kept for 15  min. The cell tube was then quickly transferred into an isothermal <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> preset at a given crystallization temperature (T c), and maintained for 2 – 3  days.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century (about 1900 to 1930), water bath air {{cleaners}} {{were used in}} some applications (cars, trucks, tractors, and portable and stationary engines). They worked on roughly the same principles as <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> air cleaners. For example, the original Fordson tractor had a water bath air cleaner. By the 1940s, <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> designs had displaced water bath designs because of better filtering performance.|$|R

The first {{objective of this}} work is to conduct the synthesis of these molecules by heating in a classical <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> or by microwave irradiation with a phase transfer catalyst.

30|$|Figure  2 a {{shows the}} {{temperature}} profiles for a 5  mL sample of ethanol boiled at 160 °C {{in a single}} mode closed vessel microwave irradiation and open vessel <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> heating conditions. The temperature profiles show that microwave heating method allows for rapid increase of solvent temperature and quick cooling as well, whereas in conventional heating (<b>oil</b> <b>bath)</b> rate of heating and cooling are very slow. Figure  2 b shows thermal behavior of microwave versus <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> heating. Temperature gradients shown in Figure  2 b suggest that microwave irradiation rises {{the temperature of the}} whole volume evenly and simultaneously whereas in <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> heating the reaction mixture in contact with the vessel wall is heated first. Inverted thermal gradient differences can be observed between the two heating methods [33 – 35]. The advantages of this enabling technology have more recently also been exploited in the context of multistep total synthesis and medicinal chemistry/ drug discovery and have additionally penetrated fields such as polymer synthesis, 6 material sciences, nanotechnology, and biochemical processes [36].|$|R

Some chemicals, improper use of cosmetics, poor hygiene, old age and some diseases causes disorder in the mentioned structures and leads to TEWL increase. The {{aim of this study}} was to obtain the optimal formulation composition of an <b>oiling</b> <b>bath</b> cosmetic based on rapeseed phospholipids and vegetable oil with high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In this work, the composition of <b>oiling</b> <b>bath</b> form was calculated and the degree of oil dispersion after mixing the bath preparation with water was selected as the objective function in the optimizing procedure.

40|$|Stretchability {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} functional properties of Mozzarella cheese, but no objective and widely accepted technique exists for evaluation; most of the cheese stretchability tests are influenced by the ambient conditions. This paper demonstrates a technique, which is novel and relatively simple, to evaluate the stretchability of Mozzarella cheese objectively. In an <b>oil</b> <b>bath,</b> melted cheese is stretched by a hook probe, controlled by an Instron tensile tester (Instron Corp., Norwood, MA); cheese strands are lifted from the melted cheese reservoir to a stretch length of 300 mm, when the load and extension data are recorded by the Instron tensile tester. This test overcomes other tests' drawbacks, such as subjective stretching speeds and variations in ambient temperature and humidity. Through the test comparison on standard Mozzarella, the modified stretching test in an <b>oil</b> <b>bath</b> has greater repeatability than the original test without <b>oil</b> <b>bath.</b> From the load and extension curve, the yield load is measured to evaluate the stretchability. In the meantime, the inversion point extension of necking is also measured based on polymer study, producing more repeatable results than the yield load. The modified 3 -prong hook test was applied to Mozzarella cheese samples with different processing conditions, including the screw conditions (screw time, speed, and temperature), draining pH, calcium content, and fat content, and significant differences were found between these samples and the control sample...|$|R
