5|$|Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! is {{credited}} {{as being a}} defining moment in Hindi cinema's box office history, and the beginning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> in the Indian film distribution system. When it was released, cinema was in decline in India due to improved cable television, home video, and film piracy. The film was originally released in {{only a small number}} of theatres that agreed to upgrade their facilities. Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television. Also, the film's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre. This film, in addition to the following year's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40% in just two years.|$|E
5|$|The US-based United Fruit Company (UFC) {{was one of}} {{many foreign}} {{companies}} that acquired large tracts of both state land and indigenous land. Manuel Estrada Cabrera, who was president of Guatemala from 1898 to 1920, permitted limited unionization in rural Guatemala, but also made further concessions to the UFC. In 1922, the Communist Party of Guatemala was created, and became a significant influence among urban laborers; however, it had little reach among the rural and Indian populations. In 1929, the Great Depression led to the collapse of the economy and a rise in unemployment, leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Fearing the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution,</b> the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico y Castañeda, who had built a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.|$|E
5|$|The wartime {{debate about}} post-war {{perspectives}} was accelerated by {{the resolution of}} the February 1944 European Conference of the Fourth International. The conference appointed a new European Secretariat and elected Michel Raptis, a Greek resident in France also known as Michel Pablo, the organisational secretary of its European Bureau. Raptis and other bureau members re-established contact between the Trotskyist parties. The European conference extended the lessons <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> then unfolding in Italy, and concluded that a revolutionary wave would cross Europe as the war ended. The SWP had a similar perspective. The British Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) disagreed and held that capitalism was not about to plunge into massive crisis but rather that an upturn in the economy was already underway. A group of leaders of the French Internationalist Communist Party (PCI) around Yvan Craipeau argued a similar position until they were expelled from the PCI in 1948.|$|E

5|$|With two Landing Ship Docks, Boxer was {{dispatched}} to Hispaniola on 29 August 1964 on a humanitarian mission to aid Haiti and the Dominican Republic whose infrastructure had {{been damaged by}} Hurricane Cleo. The ships provided medical aid and helped to evacuate civilians displaced by the storm. On 27 April 1965 Boxer returned to the Dominican Republic with Helicopter Squadron 264 and a complement of Marines. They evacuated about 1,000 US nationals from {{the country in the}} wake <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> in the country. It was a part of Operation Powerpack which would eventually see the US occupation of that country. Later in 1965, she was used as a transport vessel for the Vietnam War. The carrier transported 200 helicopters of the US Army's 1st Cavalry Division to South Vietnam. She made a second trip to Vietnam in early 1966 when she transported Marine Corps aircraft to South Vietnam. However, she did not participate in combat operations during that war.|$|E
5|$|The Combine's first {{appearance}} is in Half-Life 2. Through {{the early stages}} of the game, Combine Civil Protection units pursue Gordon Freeman through City 17 after he accidentally reveals his presence to Wallace Breen. Due to Freeman's actions in Half-Life, Breen sees Freeman as a major threat. As Freeman escapes the city, Civil Protection units raid the resistance base of Black Mesa East and capture resistance leader Eli Vance, who is transferred to holding facilities at Nova Prospekt. Freeman and Vance's daughter Alyx break into the facility to rescue him, but Eli Vance is teleported to the Combine Citadel by double agent Judith Mossman. However, the strike against Nova Prospekt is seen as the start <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> by the citizens of Earth, who take up arms against the Combine. In response, Combine Overwatch are deployed to City 17, and heavy street fighting takes place. Freeman manages to infiltrate the Citadel but is captured and taken to Breen. Mossman allows Freeman to break free of his captivity, and Breen flees to the Citadel's trans-dimensional teleporter, intent on escape. However, Freeman destroys the teleporter's reactor before Breen can escape, causing a large explosion that destroys the top of the Citadel.|$|E
25|$|The name Gordred was {{probably}} taken from Chatterton's 'Godred Crovan' (1768). Margaret Ruth Lowery suggests that Blake took more from Chatterton than simply {{the name of}} Gordred, arguing {{that there are many}} parallels in theme and imagery between Chatterton's story of a Norse tyrant invading the Isle of Man, and Blake's <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> against a Norse tyrant.|$|E

25|$|Leading up to 1924, two rival surrealist {{groups had}} formed. Each group {{claimed to be}} successors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> {{launched}} by Guillaume Apollinaire. One group, led by Yvan Goll, consisted of Pierre Albert-Birot, Paul Dermée, Céline Arnauld, Francis Picabia, Tristan Tzara, Giuseppe Ungaretti, Pierre Reverdy, Marcel Arland, Joseph Delteil, Jean Painlevé and Robert Delaunay, among others.|$|E
25|$|The Hartal {{took the}} country to a {{complete}} standstill. Afraid <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> in the making, the government cabinet sought refuge on the HMS Newfoundland, a Royal Navy warship offshore.

25|$|In February 1891, a Radical {{ministry}} was formed. Queen Natalija and the ex-Metropolitan Mihailo {{returned to}} Belgrade, and Austrian influence began {{to give way}} to Russian. Fear <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> and of King Milan's return led to a compromise, by which, in May 1891, the queen was expelled, and Milan was allowed a million francs from the civil list, on condition of not returning to Serbia during his son's minority.|$|E

25|$|At this {{juncture}} Gustav III {{was approached by}} Jacob Magnus Sprengtporten, a Finnish nobleman, who had incurred the enmity of the Caps, with the prospect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution.</b> He undertook to seize the fortress of Sveaborg in Finland by a coup de main. Once Finland was secured, he intended to embark for Sweden, join up with the king and his friends near Stockholm, and force the estates to accept a new constitution dictated by the king.|$|E
25|$|There was anxiety {{at first}} that the viewing public would not accept a new soap set {{in the south of}} England, though {{research}} commissioned by lead figures in the BBC revealed that southerners would accept a northern soap, northerners would accept a southern soap and those from the Midlands, as Julia Smith herself pointed out, did not mind where it was set {{as long as it was}} somewhere else. This was the beginning of a close and continuing association between EastEnders and audience research, which, though commonplace today, was something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> in practice.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, after President Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine fled as {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution,</b> Putin {{requested}} and received authorization from the Russian Parliament to deploy Russian troops to Ukraine. Following a Crimean referendum in which separation was favored by {{a large majority of}} voters, the Russian leadership announced the accession of Crimea into the Russian Federation, though this and the referendum that preceded it were not accepted internationally. On March 27 the United Nations General Assembly voted in favor of a non-binding resolution opposing the Russian annexation of Crimea by a vote of 100 member states in favour, 11 against and 58 abstentions.|$|E

25|$|The royal couple lived {{surrounded}} by soldiers, always in dread <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution.</b> Their security was {{guaranteed by the}} Austrian troops stationed in Naples, but their expenses were a heavy burden on the state coffers and {{the main reason for}} the high public debt. On Medici’s advise, Francis and Maria Isabella, taking with them their one-year-old son the Count of Aquila, went to Milan in May 1825 in order to obtain a reduction in the occupation troops. After an agreement between Medici and the Austrian ambassador Count Karl Ludwig von Ficquelmont, the King and Queen returned to Naples on 18 July. The Austrian troops were reduced to 12,000 beginning {{at the end of that}} year and departed in February 1827.|$|E
25|$|Triggered by brutal police {{repression}} of student-led protests causing {{the death of}} over a hundred students and civilians in March and June 1988, widespread protests and demonstrations broke out on 8 August throughout the country. The military responded by firing into the crowds, alleging Communist infiltration. Violence, chaos and anarchy reigned. Civil administration had ceased to exist, and by September of that year, the country {{was on the verge}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution.</b> The armed forces, under the nominal command of General Saw Maung, staged a coup on 8 August to restore order. During the 8888 Uprising, as it became known, the military killed thousands. The military swept aside the Constitution of 1974 in favour of martial law under the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) with Saw Maung as chairman and prime minister.|$|E
25|$|Blake {{had many}} {{expectations}} for the American revolution, which is described in a prophetic way within the poem. However, he was disappointed when the fallen state of existence returned and that slavery was not immediately ended. He was also disappointed when {{there was not a}} sensual liberation. After Napoleon declared himself emperor in 1804, Blake believed that the Americans would start treating George Washington as their god king in the manner that the French treated Bonaparte and the English George III. He continued to believe in an apocalyptic state that would soon appear, but he no longer believed that Orc man, the leader <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution,</b> would be the agent of the apocalypse. Instead, he believed that God could only exist in men, and he distrusted all hero worship.|$|E

25|$|With the schism in {{internal}} party politics came a new {{threat to the}} mines that brought South Africa its wealth. A small-scale miners' dispute flared into a full-blown strike, and rioting broke out in Johannesburg after Smuts intervened heavy-handedly. After police shot dead twenty-one strikers, Smuts and Botha headed unaccompanied to Johannesburg to resolve the situation personally. Facing down threats to their own lives, they negotiated a cease-fire. But the cease-fire did not hold, and in 1914, a railway strike turned into a general strike. Threats <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> caused Smuts to declare martial law. Smuts acted ruthlessly, deporting union leaders without trial and using Parliament to absolve him {{and the government of}} any blame retroactively. This was too much for the Old Boers, who set up their own National Party to fight the all-powerful Botha-Smuts partnership.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 20th century brought the start <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution</b> in physics. The long-held theories of Newton were shown not to be correct in all circumstances. Beginning in 1900, Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr and others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental results, by introducing discrete energy levels. Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales, but even more disturbingly, the theory of general relativity, proposed by Einstein in 1915, showed that the fixed background of spacetime, on which both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity depended, could not exist. In 1925, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger formulated quantum mechanics, which explained the preceding quantum theories. The observation by Edwin Hubble in 1929 that {{the speed at which}} galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance, led to the understanding that the universe is expanding, and the formulation of the Big Bang theory by Georges Lemaître.|$|E
25|$|Jatin {{was acquitted}} in February 1911 and released. Immediately, he {{suspended}} armed revolution. This lull proved Jatin's full command of violence as an antidote, {{contrary to the}} Chauri Chaura fiasco after him. During the German Crown Prince's visit to Calcutta, Jatin met him and received a promise about arms supply. Having lost his government job– and home interned -, he managed to leave Calcutta, to start a contract business constructing the Jessore–Jhenaidah railway line. This provided him with a valid pretext and an ample scope to move about on horse-back or on bicycle to consolidate not only the district units in Bengal, but also to revitalise those in other provinces. Jatin with his family {{set out on a}} pilgrimage, and at Haridwar visited his Guru, Bholananda Giri. Jatin went on to Brindavan where he met Swami Niralamba (who had been Jatindra Nath Banerjee, the renowned revolutionary, before leading a sanyasi's life); he had continued preaching in North India Sri Aurobindo's doctrine <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>revolution.</b>|$|E
