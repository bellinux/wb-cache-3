Recrystallization of cellulose was found to hinder the further hydrolysis particularly with the high DP. The effect of recrystallization can be reduced by the decrease of DP of RCs.

This process, patented by the founders of the Viscose Development Company, is the most widely used method for manufacturing regenerated cellulose products.

METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and Embase for randomised clinical trials assessing use <b>of</b> oxidised <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose,</b> hyaluronate carboxymethylcellulose, icodextrin, or polyethylene glycol in abdominal surgery. Two researchers independently identified reports and extracted data. We compared use of a barrier with no barrier for nine predefined outcomes, graded for clinical relevance. The primary outcome was reoperation for adhesive small bowel obstruction. We assessed systematic error, random error, and design error with the error matrix approach. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD 42012003321. FINDINGS: Our search returned 1840 results, from which 28 trials (5191 patients) were included in our meta-analysis. The risks of systematic and random errors were low. No trials reported data for the effect <b>of</b> oxidised <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> or polyethylene glycol on reoperations for adhesive small bowel obstruction.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study we {{evaluated}} spontan-eous and stimulated adherence of human monocytes to regenerated cellulose and polyacrylonitrile (AN 69) membranes. Spontaneous adherence at 60 min was significantly higher for regenerated cellulose (28 ± 2 %, P< 0. 001) than for AN 69 (11 ± 2) membranes. Stimuli such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, TNFa, interleukin- 1 and- 6 as well as platelet-activating factor, but not IL- 4, significantly enhanced adherence at 60 min to AN 69 (28 to 30 %). In contrast, adherence was not further inducible in the presence <b>of</b> <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose.</b> Both spontaneous and cytokine/bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated adherence were signi-ficantly reduced by SDZ- 63072, a specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist.

Several. analytical techniques were used to establish the changes that were induced into the treated <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose.</b> films. Techniques such as UV spectrophotometry, FTIR spectrop 40 tometry, contact angle measurement, SEM analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and gas chromatography were used. A number of molecular biology approaches such as the polymerase chain reaction (peR) procedure and restriction enzyme digestion were undertaken to an~lyse the community profile ofthe enriched culture. Evidence is given to show that the nitrocellulose coating underwent denitrification when treated with Shewqnella 118 143 culture in the presence of azo dye. However, poly(vinylidene chloride) coating incubated with Shewanella 118 143 culture did not undergo any significant chemical changes either in theÃ‚Â· presence or in the absence of azo dye. The enrichment study, based on the biodegradation <b>of</b> various <b>regenerated</b> <b>cellulose</b> films, indicated that the biodegradation rate of cellulosic films was greater under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. The enrichment provides a number of cÃ‚Â·ultures that are capable of utilising cellophane films as a carbon source, under anaerobic conditions. Activities of both bacteria and methanogenic archaea were observed in all of the enriched cultures. Profiling bacterial community ofthe enriched cultures gave general information concerning the way these enriched cultures are related. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
