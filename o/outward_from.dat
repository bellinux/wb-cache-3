5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity {{due to its}} Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|Saturn is {{probably}} {{best known for the}} system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend from 6,630km to 120,700km <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> Saturn's equator, average approximately 20meters in thickness and are composed of 93% water ice with traces of tholin impurities and 7% amorphous carbon. The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible.|$|E

5|$|Winds within {{high-pressure}} areas flow <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> {{the higher}} pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers. Gravity {{adds to the}} forces causing this general movement, because the higher pressure compresses the column of air {{near the center of}} the area into greater density – and so greater weight compared to lower pressure, lower density, and lower weight of the air outside the center.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the spiral arm structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Haifa al 'Atiqa was {{repopulated}} with many Arab Christians in an overall neighborhood {{in which many}} Middle Eastern Jews were established inhabitants, as Haifa expanded <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> its new location. The ultimate origin of the name Haifa remains unclear. One theory holds it derives from {{the name of the}} high priest Caiaphas. Some Christians believe it was named for Saint Peter, whose Aramaic name was Keiphah. Another theory holds it could be derived from the Hebrew verb root חפה (hafa), meaning to cover or shield, i.e. Mount Carmel covers Haifa; others point to a possible origin in the Hebrew word חוֹף (hof), meaning shore, or חוֹף יָפֶה (hof yafe), meaning beautiful shore.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run over the top of the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion of the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E

40|$|The {{privileges}} of integration {{with the global}} economy have led developing countries {{to embark on a}} path of liberalisation and globalisation. This resulted in rapid growth of inward and outward foreign direct investment from developing countries. In the last two decades there is an increasing trend of <b>outward</b> FDI <b>from</b> developing countries to both developed and developing countries. This dissertation focuses on exploring the literature on <b>outward</b> FDI <b>from</b> developing countries, and internationalisation process of developing country multinationals which are considered to be carriers to investment across international borders. The study has examined the two main strands of literature on <b>outward</b> FDI <b>from</b> developing countries – determinants of outward FDI and internationalisation process. Findings of the systematic review show that there is a dearth of studies in this area of research. Except a number of studies on China and countries of East and South East Asia, there is very limited evidence on <b>outward</b> FDI <b>from</b> developing countries. There is a set of studies on Africa that examine South-South investment flows. Studies on other major developing countries are either non-existent or lack in comprehensiveness. Some studies resulted in contradictory findings about the determinants of outward FDI. This raises the question of sensitivity of variables across geographical locations and time periods, which has not been researched before. Studies on outward FDI also do not make a clear distinction between South-South and South-North FDI flows. Other aspects like sovereign wealth funds and commodity price boom have been ignored in the literature. It is important to investigate <b>outward</b> FDI flows <b>from</b> the major developing economies because of its sheer scope to contribute to academic literature, its policy implications, and also because of its potential to bring development {{to some of the most}} impoverished parts of the world...|$|R
5|$|While at peak intensity, Ernest {{was a small}} cyclone with gales {{extending}} 130km (80mi) <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> the well-defined eye. After maintaining peak winds {{for about}} 12hours, the cyclone began weakening while turning to the southeast. On January23, Ernest made landfall on the southwest coast of Madagascar at Itampolo, with winds estimated at 130km/h (80mph). The cyclone accelerated to the southeast across the island and quickly weakened into a tropical storm. Late on January23, the JTWC issued its last advisory after Ernest began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Early the next day, MF declared Ernest extratropical, and continued tracking it until the storm dissipated on January25 in the southern Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from the stem tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> the stem) results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48–72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} the stem adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E
5|$|Hiʻiaka orbits Haumea nearly circularly every 49days. Namaka orbits Haumea in 18 {{days in a}} {{moderately}} elliptical, non-Keplerian orbit, and as of 2008 was inclined 13° with respect to Hiʻiaka, which perturbs its orbit. Because the impact that created the moons of Haumea {{is thought to have}} occurred in the early history of the Solar System, over the following billions of years it should have been tidally damped into a more circular orbit. Namaka's orbit has likely been disturbed by orbital resonances with the more-massive Hiʻiaka due to converging orbits as they moved <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> Haumea due to tidal dissipation. They may have been caught in and then escaped from orbital resonance several times; they currently are in or at least close to an 8:3 resonance. This resonance strongly perturbs Namaka's orbit, which has a current precession of its argument of periapsis by about −6.5° per year, a precession period of 55 years.|$|E

5|$|Spathularia flavida may be {{distinguished}} from the velvet-foot fairy fan (Spathulariopsis velutipes) by differences in the stem: S.velutipes is fuzzy and brown rather than smooth and yellowish. The fuzziness {{is a result of}} a thin layer of intertwined hyphae that cover the stem, which project short hyphae <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> the surface. The closely related species S.neesi has an ochre color, spores that measure 60–80 by 1.5–2µm, and paraphyses that are branched on the upper parts. Neolecta irregularis is roughly similar in appearance to S.flavida, but lacks a sharply differentiated, spoon-shaped head, has a stem lighter in color than the head, and microscopically, has much smaller oval to elliptical spores that measure 5.5–8.5 by 3–4µm. Another yellowish earth-tongue fungus, Microglossum rufum, has a well-defined oval to spoon-shaped head, and sausage- to spindle-shaped spores that are 18–38 by 4–6µm.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of tightness of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E
5|$|Tbr1 is {{expressed}} mainly in early-born postmitotic neurons {{of the developing}} cerebral cortex—in particular, the preplate and layer VI neurons. The preplate forms the architectural network of neurons that help developing neurons migrate. Successive migrations of neurons divide the preplate such that its inner cells form the cortical plate while its outer cells form the marginal zone. The cortical plate and the marginal zone eventually develop into six cortical layers, known as the neocortex, present in the mature cerebral cortex. These layers are numbered I-VI with layer VI being the deepest and forming first, while the remaining layers grow <b>outward</b> <b>from</b> it (from V to I). Layers II-VI develop from the cortical plate and layer I forms from the marginal zone. The subplate, intermediate zone, subventricular zone, and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing cortical layers. High expression of Tbr1 {{is seen in the}} marginal zone, cortical plate, and subplate of the developing cortex whereas little expression is seen in the subventricular zone. No Tbr1 expression has been observed in the ventricular zone.|$|E
