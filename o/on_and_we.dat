[...] When {{an interview}} for his cover story shared with, Idol runner-up, Adam Lambert, Allen explained, [...] "It's a song that has a really good message-that we only have so much time, let's make the most of it.

500|$|The council {{decided to}} name the new {{underpass}} Tittle Cott, a move that was met with dismay by local residents. The Castleford Area Voice for the Elderly, an over-50s group, organised a campaign to have the name Tickle Cock restored. The group's chairman, Margaret Shillito, {{was quoted in the}} press as saying [...] "the old plaque was wrong, it had the wrong name <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were offended by it". Brian Lewis was quoted as saying [...] "I feel we should never alter names and Tickle Cock has a very clear message behind it". A public meeting was held at which a [...] "large majority" [...] voted in favour of reverting to the original name, a decision that persuaded the council to replace the bridge's plaque with one bearing the legend Tickle Cock.|$|E

[...] Drummer Phil Collins, having a temporary break from Genesis after his first marriage had failed, was at a loose end and asked to replace Moon, but Townshend had already asked Jones, who had previously played with the Small Faces and the Faces. Jones officially joined the band in November 1978. John [...] "Rabbit" [...] Bundrick joined the live band as an unofficial keyboardist. On 2 May 1979, the Who returned to the stage with a concert at the Rainbow Theatre, followed by the Cannes Film Festival in France and dates at Madison Square Garden in New York.|$|E

500|$|Assistant manager Harry Redknapp {{was also}} now taking {{a bigger role}} in the {{transfer}} of players, with the club's approval. With rumours of his old club AFC Bournemouth being prepared to offer him a position, the West Ham board and their managing director, Peter Storrie, made a controversial move. The board were anxious not to lose Redknapp's services and offered Bonds a place away from the day-to-day affairs of the club—on the West Ham board. This would have allowed them to appoint Redknapp as manager. Bonds refused the post offered and {{walked away from the}} club. His accusations of deceit and manipulation by the board and by Redknapp have continued to cause ill-feeling. Peter Storrie claimed they that they had handled the situation correctly, saying, [...] "If Harry had gone to Bournemouth, there was a good chance Bill would have resigned anyway, so we were in a no-win situation. We're sad that Bill is going, and it's a big blow but it's time to move <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> have appointed a great manager." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene where}} the cast {{is trying to}} get back to the {{elevator}} after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film. As Jackson explained, [...] "At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn't have safety harnesses <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> were flailing around on this deck." [...] Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J's character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J's character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, the 48-year old Davis {{embarked}} on a three-week tour of Japan; between January 22 and February 8, he played 14 concerts in large-hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews. Japanese critic Keizo Takada said Davis was leading his [...] "magnificent and energetic" [...] band just as Duke Ellington had his orchestra: [...] "Miles must be the genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent." [...] Throughout the tour, he had been sick with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse, while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket. Unable to work his trumpet's volume and effects pedals because of {{the pain in his}} legs, he would go down on his knees to press them with his hand during performances. To relieve his pain and perform, he used codeine and morphine, smoked, and drank large quantities of Heineken beer. On several occasions, Davis was able to play two concerts in one day, as he did on February 1 at the Festival Hall in Osaka. [...] "The Japanese people were very beautiful", Henderson recalled from the concerts. [...] "They came in with their suit and ties <b>on</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers with a million amplifiers." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{likelihood}} of Panesar playing against Australia in the 2006–07 Ashes series led to media commentary by some Australian players, who {{indicated that they}} would take an aggressive approach towards him. Australian captain Ricky Ponting said, [...] "We'll try to make some sort of impact on him early <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> won't let him get on top. The way our left-handers, especially Justin Langer and Matty Hayden, play spin is to be fairly aggressive." [...] However, he was also praised by Ponting. Ponting told the Sunday Age, [...] "He (Panesar) didn't look like he was scared to throw the ball up a little bit and actually try to get you out. He's got good, subtle changes of pace and, watching the other night (against Pakistan), a really good arm ball as well.".|$|E
2500|$|In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins {{describes}} {{an approach to}} life-extension that involves [...] "fooling genes" [...] into thinking the body is young. Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to Peter Medawar. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, {{we should be able}} to prevent these genes from switching <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> should be able to do so by [...] "identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body".|$|E

Grierson respected Flaherty immensely for {{his contributions}} to documentary form and his attempts to use the camera to bring alive the lives of everyday people and everyday events. [...] Less commendable in Grierson's view was Flaherty's focus on exotic and faraway cultures. ("In the profounder kind of way", wrote Grierson of Flaherty, [...] "we live and prosper each of us by denouncing the other"). In Grierson's view, the focus of film {{should be on the}} everyday drama of ordinary people. As Grierson wrote in his diaries: [...] "Beware {{the ends of the earth}} and the exotic: the drama is on your doorstep wherever the slums; are, wherever there is malnutrition, wherever there is exploitation and cruelty."

In this sense the ready-to-hand is primordial compared to that of the present-at-hand. The term primordial here does not imply something Primitive, but rather refers to Heidegger's idea that Being can only be understood through what is everyday and [...] "close" [...] to us. Our everyday understanding of the world is necessarily essentially a part of any kind of scientific or theoretical studies of entities — the present-at-hand — might be.

So Mary Frances and Julia and I all went back to medical school." [...] Irwin loosely based the character of Marguerite on his mother ("unabashed and delightfully inappropriate") and his maternal grandmother ("a genteel, bun-haired lady of means"). [...] As Irwin explains, [...] "I was raised by Southern women so I imitate a lot of them. Marguerite {{is the voice of}} my grandmother, who was born in 1894, and the attitude of my mother.

2500|$|At the time, Vallance was {{primarily}} {{known as a}} songwriter, having written most frequently (and successfully) with Bryan Adams. [...] He also had some previous production experience, having produced one album apiece by Adams, Doug and the Slugs and CANO in the early 1980s. The band's lead vocalist Alan Frew recalled: [...] "It worked out great because we were {{all at the same}} stage of development. He didn't change the sound of the band at all. He let us experiment but wasn't afraid to get heavy-handed when he had to." [...] Vallance composed [...] "Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)" [...] with the band, while Adams provided backing vocals. Frew - [...] "On the very first day that we met Jim Vallance, he picked us up at the airport and to break the ice asked us what we were listening to. One was Tears For Fears.

Billboard magazine later confirmed the news, quoting Andy Summers' 2006 statement as to how the band could have continued post-Synchronicity: [...] "The more rational approach would have been, 'OK, Sting, go make a solo record, and let's get back together in two or three years.' I'm certain we could have done that. Of course we could have. We were definitely not in a creative dry space. We could have easily carried <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> <b>we</b> could probably still be there. That wasn't to be our fate. It went in another way. I regret we never paid it off with a last tour."

[...] before launching into [...] "Roxanne". After the dissolution of the Police, Sting adamantly refused to reunite with Copeland or Summers for any prolonged period, often commenting [...] "If I ever reform the Police I should be certified insane." [...] However, by 2007, he had a change of heart. When asked what prompted the reunion, Sting said [...] "I'd just done the lute album—Songs from the Labyrinth. I was thinking: 'Well what do I do? What's going to surprise people?' I just had this instinct, this desire to call the guys up and say: 'Let's give this a go.'" [...] Sting added he saw the reunion as [...] "a kind of healing.
