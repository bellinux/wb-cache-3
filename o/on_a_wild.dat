5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the season, Wensloff {{remained}} a major part of the starting rotation. His losses included a 10 defeat in which he only allowed one unearned run <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> throw against the St. Louis Browns. During the season, Wensloff added a knuckleball to his selection of pitches, which he threw regularly during the season. As the end of the season approached, Wensloff was being promoted as a rookie of the year candidate, due to being second on the team in strikeouts, as well as his 13 wins. Wensloff finished the season with a 13–11 record and a 2.54 ERA in 29 games, 27 of them starts. He did not pitch in the 1943 World Series, though he was on the roster.|$|E
5|$|The score {{remained}} the same through the fourth inning. Fogg was relieved by Taylor Buchholz {{in the top of}} the fifth and, following a double by Tulowitzki, Peavy allowed the game-tying run to score on a Holliday single. Seth Smith, pinch hitting for the pitcher in the bottom of the sixth, hit a triple and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Matsui to give the Rockies a 6–5 lead. The Rockies' Garrett Atkins appeared to homer in the bottom of the seventh, extending the Rockies lead, but umpires ruled that the ball hit padding on the outfield wall, which was still in play, and awarded Atkins a double. Jamey Carroll pinch ran for Atkins, but no runs scored in the inning. The Rockies brought in closer Brian Fuentes {{in the top of the}} 8th, but the Padres re-tied the game when Geoff Blum singled to lead off the inning, advanced to second base <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch, and scored on a double by Brian Giles. This was Fuentes' seventh blown save of the season.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins in}} Indocine, a fictional Southeast Asian country. The player {{controls}} a Super Apache helicopter {{as part of}} the STRIKE covert operations force, led by General Earle (John Marzilli) and assisted by technician Hack (Antwon Tanner) and propagandist Andrea Gray (Susan Turner-Cray). The antagonist is Colonel LeMonde (Bo Hopkins), a spy-turned-warlord who has stolen a nuclear weapon. Allied to STRIKE in Indocine is guerrilla leader Naja Hana (Moon Bloodgood), whose forces join the player in attacking LeMonde's forces. Meanwhile, LeMonde bluffs STRIKE by arming a fake nuclear bomb in an old temple compound, which results in Naja attempting to locate the warhead and LeMonde. At the same time, the player is sent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> goose chase attacking a decoy convoy thought to have the nuclear bomb being transported away from Indocine. In actuality, LeMonde escapes capture long before STRIKE could catch up to him and he managed to smuggle the real nuclear bomb away from Indocine off-screen. This prompts the player to extract Naja from the now booby-trapped compound before the whole compound blew up sky high. Nonetheless, his forces are eventually defeated in Indocine and STRIKE conducts their operations in the South China Sea, where LeMonde is discovered dealing with Napoleon Hwong (Philip Tan), head of a fictional Triad-like criminal organization known as the Octad. The player recruits mercenary Harding Cash (Jamie Donovan) in battling the pirate warlord in an attempt to recover the missing nuclear weapon. After defeating Hwong's forces, the player and Harding manage to capture and interrogate Hwong for information concerning the whereabouts of the nuke long enough before Hwong commits suicide. The player eventually heads to Pyongyang, North Korea, where the stolen nuke is located.|$|E
25|$|The Giants sent Ryan Vogelsong to the mound, {{while the}} Royals sent Jason Vargas. The Giants {{scored in the}} bottom of the first inning when Gregor Blanco walked, {{advanced}} to second <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch, stole third base, and scored on a fielder's choice off the bat of Hunter Pence.|$|E
25|$|The Brew Crew drew first {{blood in}} the second with an RBI double by Charlie Moore. They {{followed}} that in the third when Paul Molitor singled, stole second, went to third <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch by Cardinals starter John Stuper, and scored on a Robin Yount groundout. Ted Simmons stretched the lead to 3–0 with his second solo homer in two games.|$|E

60|$|While {{still at}} meat, the drum, {{which had been}} {{sounding}} at intervals, suddenly took <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wilder</b> energy, followed immediately by a high, shrill, yelping call, which was instantly augmented by a half-dozen others, all as savage and startling as the sudden burst of howling from a pack of wolves. This clamor fell away into a deep, throbbing chant, only to rise again to the yelping, whimpering cries with which it began.|$|R

The Professor tells Leela that he has designated her as his sole heir due to her lack of impulsiveness. Leela then kills Farnsworth on an impulse, kicking him into a pit housing his pet man-eating anteaters.|$|E
25|$|St. Louis {{began the}} scoring {{in the fourth}} inning on a bases-loaded two-run double by center fielder Jim Edmonds off of Nate Robertson. Two more runs would score {{in the bottom of}} the seventh on an error by Detroit pitcher Joel Zumaya, who overthrew third baseman Brandon Inge on what should have been a routine force out. St. Louis would add another run in the eighth <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch.|$|E
25|$|In December, Dokic {{participated in}} the Australian Open Wild Card playoff tournament. In her round robin, Dokic won all three of her matches and {{a spot in the}} semi final round where she {{defeated}} Alicia Molik. However, Dokic lost to Olivia Rogowska in the final 6–1, 6–7, 3–6. Despite missing out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> card spot, the organisers awarded her a wild card for the Australian Open main draw. Dokic finished 2010 ranked world No. 138.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{trailing}} 4–1 at a {{point in}} the game, Markakis scored the tying run <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch {{in the bottom of the}} ninth inning, Chris Withrow kept the Braves in the game with his relief performance and Freeman hit a walk-off home run to center-right to beat the Giants 5–4 in the 11th inning. The Braves concluded their home-stand with a 6–0 loss to the Giants after squandering an early scoring opportunity by Chase d'Arnaud and Freeman in the first inning.|$|E
25|$|The African wolf isn't {{common in}} Neolithic rock art, {{though it does}} {{occasionally}} appear; a definite portrayal is shown on the Kef Messiouer cave in Algeria's Tébessa Province, where it is shown feeding <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> boar carcass alongside a lion pride. It {{plays a role in}} Berber mythology, particularly that of the Ait Seghrouchen of Morocco, where it plays a similar role in folktales as the red fox does in Medieval European fables, though it is often the victim of the more cunning hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|Roy Halladay {{relieved}} Rogers in {{the bottom}} of the third. It was in this inning when the National League exemplified what it does best: playing small. Alfonso Soriano hit a single with one out and stole second base on Gold Glove catcher Iván Rodríguez. He tried to score on a single by Carlos Beltrán, but was thrown out at home plate by Vernon Wells. Beltran would advance to second on the throw, then steal third and score <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch by Halladay, giving the NL a 2–1 lead.|$|E

25|$|After abandoning {{university}} in Vienna, Weiss drifted aimlessly around 1920s Germany, working briefly for the expressionist film director Fritz Lang (F. W. Murnau, according to The Road to Mecca). By his own account, after selling a jointly written film script, he splurged the windfall <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> party at an expensive Berlin restaurant, {{in the spirit}} of the times. While working as a telephone operator for an American news agency in Berlin, Weiss obtained a coveted interview with Russian author Maxim Gorky's wife, his first published piece of journalism, after simply ringing up her hotel room.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1980s, {{question}} marks formed a constant motif, usually on the shirt collars or, {{in the case}} of the Seventh Doctor, on his sleeveless jumper and the handle to his umbrella. The idea was grounded in branding considerations, as was the movement starting in Tom Baker's final season toward an unchanging costume for each Doctor, rather than the variants on a theme employed over the first seventeen years of the programme. When the Eighth Doctor regenerated, he clad himself in a 19th-century frock coat and shirt based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wild</b> Bill Hickok costume, reminiscent of the out-of-time quality of earlier Doctors and emphasising the Eighth Doctor's more Romantic persona.|$|E
25|$|Baseball {{returned}} to La Trobe University for the Victoria Aces' home championship series, after having {{just the one}} game there during the regular season. Unlike the semi-final series, scoring started immediately in the championship series, with South Australia scoring {{in the top of}} the first inning: Jeremy Cresswell singled and then advanced to third when Stefan Welch reached on a throwing error by catcher Grant Karlsen. Michael Collins and Ryan Murphy each walked in consecutive plate appearances, advancing Cresswell to score the first run. Before the inning could be closed out, Welch scored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch to extend South Australia's lead to two.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1957 season, Demeter {{was rated}} {{as one of}} the top 8 rookie {{prospects}} in February in a poll conducted by 12 major league organizations. On January 12, he signed his contract to play with the Dodgers for the year. In an exhibition rematch of last year's World Series, the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees 1-0 in 11 innings after Demeter hit a double and later in the inning scored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> throw by Gil McDougald as he ran to third. Overall, Don failed to impress during spring training and was cut by the Dodgers on March 31 and subsequently optioned to the AAA St. Paul Saints of the American Association.|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} {{the sixth}} inning, the Cubs {{extended}} their lead to 8-4 when Zobrist, now playing left field, walked and Russell doubled – the ball rolling to the left-field wall right past a sliding Jayson Werth, who lost it in the stadium's lights – to drive Zobrist in. In the bottom of the sixth, the Nationals began to battle back. After getting the first two outs, Chicago reliever Pedro Strop walked Jayson Werth. Mike Montgomery relieved Strop and promptly gave up a double to Bryce Harper that advanced Werth to third. Next, he walked Ryan Zimmerman <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch that allowed Werth to score – cutting Chicago′s lead to 8-5 – and advanced Harper to third. Daniel Murphy followed with a double that scored Harper and advanced Zimmerman to third. After the Cubs intentionally walked third baseman Anthony Rendon, Montgomery finally got Wieters to end the inning by flying out with the Cubs leading 8-6.|$|E
25|$|The Giants {{threatened}} {{again in}} the top of the fourth when Pence doubled, went to third <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>wild</b> pitch, and Brandon Belt walked. Michael Morse then singled to score the fourth run of the game, which knocked Shields out of the game. Danny Duffy was brought in. After allowing a sacrifice bunt to Juan Pérez (who pinch hit for Travis Ishikawa), Duffy allowed two straight walks to Crawford and Blanco, bringing the fifth run in for the Giants. He retired the next two batters to end the inning. The score remained 5–0 until the top of the seventh, when Blanco drew another walk. Joe Panik hit a ball to right fielder Aoki, which he misplayed, allowing Blanco to score and Panik to reach third. Tim Collins was brought in and allowed a single to Sandoval after Posey lined out, which was the seventh and final run for San Francisco.|$|E
