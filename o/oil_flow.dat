25|$|Interconnection of {{multiple}} generator sources into an electrical grid required development of circuit breakers with increasing voltage ratings and increased ability to safely interrupt the increasing short-circuit currents produced by networks. Simple air-break manual switches produced hazardous arcs when interrupting high voltages; these {{gave way to}} oil-enclosed contacts, and various forms using directed flow of pressurized air, or of pressurized oil, to cool and interrupt the arc. By 1935, the specially constructed circuit breakers used at the Boulder Dam project use eight series breaks and pressurized <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> to interrupt faults of up to 2,500 MVA, in three cycles of the AC power frequency.|$|E

25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called hydrodynamic transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E
500|$|Additional tasks {{remained}} {{still to}} be completed, but the pipeline could be put into operation without them. The [...] E. L. Patton Yukon River Bridge was not completed until October 1979; until then, traffic utilized a series of ferries across the river.

500|$|The {{first section}} of pipe was laid in 1975 after {{more than five years}} of legal and {{political}} arguments. Allegations of faulty welds drew intense scrutiny from local and national observers. A culture grew around the unique working conditions involved in constructing the pipeline, and each union that worked on the project had a different function and stereotype. Thirty-two Alyeska Pipeline Service Company employees and contract workers were killed during the project. The main construction effort lasted until 1977; the first barrel of oil was delivered on July 28 of that year. Several more pump stations, added as <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> increased, were completed through 1980.|$|E

50|$|Initially sceptical about {{peak oil}} predictions, he was persuaded by Colin Campbell of the {{unreliability}} of oil reserves {{data and the}} risks this posed to energy supply projections. His insight was to recognise that future production <b>flows,</b> rather than <b>oil</b> reserves, were the key determinant of global oil supply. Consequently, he developed Peak Flow Analysis based on the future <b>oil</b> <b>flows</b> identified in his own Global Oil Megaprojects Database. Using this methodology he concluded that major supply/demand imbalances would occur by 2007 with actual peak <b>oil</b> <b>flows</b> occurring no later than 2011.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{maintenance}} headaches and catastrophic failures were the engines. Although the Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone radial engines later became a trustworthy workhorse in large piston-engined aircraft, early models were beset with dangerous reliability problems.

Interim measures included cuffs placed on propeller blades to divert a greater flow of cooling air into the intakes which had baffles installed to direct a stream of air onto the exhaust valves. <b>Oil</b> <b>flow</b> to the valves was also increased, asbestos baffles installed around rubber push rod fittings to prevent oil loss, thorough pre-flight inspections made to detect unseated valves, and frequent replacement of the uppermost five cylinders (every 25 hours of engine time) and the entire engines (every 75 hours).|$|E

50|$|The {{oil pump}} in the {{crankshaft}} bearing housing creates oil pressure and pumps the {{oil from the}} oil sump through the engine. In the main <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> a sieve filter cleans the oil, the secondary <b>oil</b> <b>flow</b> has a centrifugal oil filter.

For oil cooling the engine has an involute heat exchanger or a shell and tube heat exchanger. Shell and tube heat exchangers are found mostly in engines for the IFA W50.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{research}} group including {{two of the}} present authors previously discovered a sur-prising phenomenon in <b>oil</b> <b>flows</b> through constricted channels; at a certain flowrate {{when there is no}} cavitation occurring, an infinitesimal cavity suddenly emerges on the wall where the flow separates. The newborn cavity grows and splits releasing many minute bubbles to downstream, as the flowrate increases. To see if this phenomenonoccurs inwater too,water flows through rect-angular and cylindrical constrictions have beenmeticulously observed with very high resolution in terms of both time and space. As a result it has been confirmed that the same phenomenon does occur in separating water flows as well, although the developing process of a newborn cav-ity in water flows is different from that in <b>oil</b> <b>flows</b> probably depending on a large difference in Reynolds numbers between both flows. When the flowrate is substantially increased from that for the cavity inception, a large attached cavity is formed on the wall just downstream of the separation point, as it occurred in corresponding <b>oil</b> <b>flows.</b> The pressure inside the cavity has proved to be almost equal to the saturation vapour pressure of water...|$|R
