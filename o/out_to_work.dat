He credited his wife, who was an intensive care nurse at the height of The Troubles, for advice on medical details and for pointing out how padres often did more good than doctors for disturbed patients, which inspired The Genocidal Healer.|$|E

25|$|Colonists' {{hopes of}} peace rose {{over the summer}} of 1830-31 as Aboriginal attacks fell to a low level and the Colonial Times {{newspaper}} speculated that their enemy had either been wiped out or frightened into inaction. But the north remained a dangerous place: on 29 January a Dairy Plains woman was murdered—three months after her husband {{had died in a}} similar attack—and in March a mother carrying her infant was fatally speared while working in her garden on the East Tamar. Though the number of attacks in 1831 was {{less than a third of}} those the previous year—a total of 70, compared with 250 in 1830—settlers remained so fearful that many men refused to go <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

It is not an isolated incident and there are similar complaints from dhakis in the Tarakeswar and Dhaniakhali regions.|$|E

The trio traveled to Chicago to investigate the house music scene there, particularly the legendary Chicago DJs Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles. House was a natural progression from disco music, so that the trio began to formulate the synthesis of this dance music with the mechanical sounds of groups like Kraftwerk, {{in a way that}} reflected post-industrialist Detroit. An obsession with the future and its machines is reflected in much of their music, because, according to Atkins, Detroit is the most advanced in the transition away from industrialism.|$|E
25|$|New York grew in {{importance}} as a trading port while under British {{rule in the}} early 1700s.

Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, and the banks and shipping tied to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.|$|E

5000|$|Therefore, to {{calculate}} VORP one must multiply the league's average runs per {{out by the}} player's total outs; this provides the number of runs an average player would have produced given that certain number of <b>outs</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with.

Simply subtract the replacement's runs created from the player's actual runs created, and the result is VORP.|$|R
