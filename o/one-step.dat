25|$|Both the <b>one-step</b> and two-step {{processes}} {{above are}} commercially available. Currently, {{there is more}} widespread application of the two-step process, since it is relatively simple and start-up costs are relatively low. There is also a <b>one-step</b> liquid-phase process in development.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{substituted}} alkyl halides are bulky, {{limiting the}} room for the E2 <b>one-step</b> mechanism; therefore, the two-step E1 mechanism is favored.|$|E

25|$|Another {{major change}} was {{the change to}} <b>one-step</b> procedures, reconstructiong opening and closing phases at the same time. Especially Jan Friden, from Gothenburg, with major {{experience}} in this area championed this thought, partially driven by the transport problems in Sweden during winter, it saved the patients an operation and minimized hospital stay.|$|E
25|$|SCAR-less editing uses {{plasmids}} for genome modification created using circular polymerase extension cloning. Briefly, in a <b>one-step</b> reaction, {{this process}} can assemble and clone multiple inserts into any vector and requires no restriction enzyme digestion, ligation, or homologous recombination. Therefore, this method {{contributes to the}} cost-effectiveness and throughput of the no-SCAR system.|$|E
25|$|In <b>one-step</b> machines, {{the entire}} process from raw {{material}} to finished container is conducted within one machine, making it especially suitable for molding non-standard shapes (custom molding), including jars, flat oval, flask shapes, etc. Its greatest merit is the reduction in space, product handling and energy, and far higher visual quality than {{can be achieved by}} the two-step system.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two basic}} molding methods for PET bottles, <b>one-step</b> and two-step. In two-step molding, two {{separate}} machines are used. The first machine injection molds the preform, which resembles a test tube, with the bottle-cap threads already molded into place. The body of the tube is significantly thicker, as it will be inflated into its final shape in the second step using stretch blow molding.|$|E
25|$|The <b>one-step</b> {{and other}} dances {{had been done}} to the tempo of Memphis Blues.... When St Louis Blues was written the tango was in vogue. I tricked the dancers by {{arranging}} a tango introduction, breaking abruptly into a low-down blues. My eyes swept the floor anxiously, then suddenly I saw lightning strike. The dancers seemed electrified. Something within them came suddenly to life. An instinct that wanted so much to live, to fling its arms to spread joy, took them by the heels.|$|E
25|$|The {{breast cancer}} {{movement}} {{has resulted in}} widespread acceptance of second opinions, the development of less invasive surgical procedures, the spread of support groups, and other advances in patient care. The movement successfully separated diagnostic biopsy from mastectomy surgery; before about 1980, it was common to perform the biopsy and, if a quick review of tissues indicated a probable need, a mastectomy in the same surgery. The <b>one-step</b> surgery prevented women from seeking different opinions about their treatment, and sent them into the surgery without knowing whether their breasts would be removed that day. In response to women's concerns over lymphedema after routine removal of lymph nodes during mastectomy, the more limited approach of sentinel node biopsy was developed. Advocacy efforts also led to the formal recommendation against the routine use of the Halsted radical mastectomy in favor of simple mastectomies and lumpectomies.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the probing {{process was}} {{performed}} in two steps because of the relative ease of producing primary and secondary antibodies in separate processes. This gives researchers and corporations huge advantages in terms of flexibility, and adds an amplification step to the detection process. Given the advent of high-throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection, however, there has been interest in developing <b>one-step</b> probing systems {{that would allow the}} process to occur faster and with fewer consumables. This requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label, probes which are often available for known protein tags. The primary probe is incubated with the membrane {{in a manner similar to}} that for the primary antibody in a two-step process, and then is ready for direct detection after a series of wash steps.|$|E
500|$|Sparring {{takes three}} forms: three-step {{sparring}}, <b>one-step</b> sparring, and free sparring. Three-step sparring and <b>one-step</b> sparring {{are similar to}} equivalent exercises in ITF and WTF schools, but free sparring is different, having {{more in common with}} traditional karate sparring. Rhee Taekwon-Do free sparring is unscored, unarmoured, and usually 'non-contact' in principle. Members typically achieve non-contact sparring by two methods, whether separately or in combination: ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 1920s, [...] Sir Christopher Ingold {{proposed}} {{a model to}} explain a peculiar type of chemical reaction: the E2 mechanism. E2 stands for bimolecular elimination. [...] The reaction involves a <b>one-step</b> mechanism in which carbon-hydrogen and carbon-halogen bonds break to form a double bond (C=C Pi bond).|$|E
2500|$|The {{second step}} may be {{bypassed}} since a homotopy equivalence is in particular a quasi-isomorphism. [...] But then the simple roof definition of morphisms {{must be replaced}} by a more complicated one using finite strings of morphisms (technically, it is no longer a calculus of fractions). So the <b>one-step</b> construction is more efficient in a way, but more complicated.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{detection}} process the membrane is [...] "probed" [...] for the protein of interest with a modified antibody which {{is linked to}} a reporter enzyme; when exposed to an appropriate substrate, this enzyme drives a colorimetric reaction and produces a color.

2500|$|An {{elimination}} {{reaction is}} a type of organic reaction in which two substituents are removed from a molecule in either a one or two-step mechanism. The <b>one-step</b> mechanism is known as the E2 reaction, and the two-step mechanism is known as the E1 reaction. [...] The numbers do not {{have to do with the}} number of steps in the mechanism, but rather the kinetics of the reaction, bimolecular and unimolecular respectively. In rare cases, for molecules possessing [...] particularly poor leaving groups, a third type of reaction, E1CB, [...] exists.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, {{while working as a}} soda jerk at the Poodle Dog Café, Ellington wrote his first composition, [...] "Soda Fountain Rag" [...] (also known as the [...] "Poodle Dog Rag"). He created the piece by ear, as he had not yet learned to read and write music. [...] "I would play the 'Soda Fountain Rag' as a <b>one-step,</b> two-step, waltz, tango, and fox trot", Ellington recalled. [...] "Listeners never knew it was the same piece. I was {{established}} as having my own repertoire." [...] In his autobiography, Music is my Mistress (1973), Ellington wrote that he missed more lessons than he attended, feeling at the time that playing the piano was not his talent.|$|E
2500|$|In a QDSC, a {{mesoporous}} {{layer of}} titanium dioxide nanoparticles forms {{the backbone of}} the cell, much like in a DSSC. This [...] layer can then be made photoactive by coating with semiconductor quantum dots using chemical bath deposition, electrophoretic deposition or successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction. The electrical circuit is then completed {{through the use of a}} liquid or solid redox couple. The efficiency of QDSCs has increased to over 5% shown for both liquid-junction and solid state cells. In an effort to decrease production costs, the Prashant Kamat research group demonstrated a solar paint made with [...] and CdSe that can be applied using a <b>one-step</b> method to any conductive surface with efficiencies over 1%. However, the absorption of quantum dots (QDs) in QDSCs is weak at room temperature. The plasmonic nanoparticles can be utilized to address the weak absorption of QDs (e.g., nanostars). Adding an external infrared pumping sources to excite intraband and interband transition of QDs is another solution.|$|E
2500|$|Willstätter {{noted that}} the {{compound}} did not exhibit the expected aromaticity. [...] Between 1939 and 1943, chemists throughout the US unsuccessfully attempted to synthesize COT. [...] They rationalized their lack of success with the conclusion that Willstätter had not actually synthesized the compound but instead its isomer, styrene. Willstätter responded to these reviews in his autobiography, where he {{noted that the}} American chemists were 'untroubled' by the reduction of his cyclooctatetraene to cyclooctane (a reaction impossible for styrene). [...] During World War 2, Walter Reppe at BASF Ludwigshafen developed a simple, <b>one-step</b> synthesis of cyclooctatetraene from acetylene, providing material identical to that prepared by Willstätter. Any remaining doubts on the accuracy of Willstätter's original synthesis were resolved when Arthur C. Cope and co-workers at MIT reported, in 1947, a complete repetition of the Willstätter synthesis, step by step, using the originally reported techniques. They obtained the same cyclooctatetraene, and they subsequently reported modern spectral characterization of many of the intermediate products, again confirming the accuracy of Willstätter's original work.|$|E
2500|$|Jazz came to Paris in 1917, {{with the}} American {{soldiers}} arriving {{to fight in}} the First World War. The soldiers were accompanied by military bands, including the 369th regiment band, composed of fifty black musicians directed by a celebrated Broadway band leader, James Reese Europe, and several other regimental bands led by famous American musicians. They gave concerts at the kiosks in the parks of Paris, performing the foxtrot, the two-step, the <b>one-step,</b> and the Memphis Blues and [...] "The Army Blues" [...] of W.C. Handy. [...] In August 1918, the orchestra of J.R. Europe was invited to perform at a music hall on the Champs-Élysées. [...] The one-night performance was extended for eight weeks. [...] The Casino de Paris presented the first French jazz review, with Gaby Deslys and Harry Pilcer and a ragtime orchestra. A black American jazz orchestra, the Jazz Kings, led by drummer Louis Mitchell, came to the Casino de Paris in 1919 to present a jazz review called Pa-ri-ki-ri, [...] followed in 1920 by the jazz review Laisse-les-Tomber, with the young singer Mistinguett. [...] The author jean Cocteau, enchanted by the new sound, described jazz as [...] "an improvised catastrophe" [...] and [...] "a sonic cataclysm".|$|E
2500|$|The Swedish ballet {{performing}} at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées closed in 1925, and its manager, André Davin, {{decided to create}} a musical show in the American style. He dispatched an American producer, Caroline Dudley, to New York, to recruit a company. [...] She went to Harlem and returned in September 1925 with a troupe of twenty-five black musicians, singers and dancers, including the pianist Claude Hopkins, the clarinetist Sidney Bechet and the twenty-five year old singer Josephine Baker. [...] The new show was called La Revue Nègre. [...] The director, Jacques Charles, recruited from the Moulin Rouge, persuaded Baker to perform a Charleston called [...] 'Danse sauvage,' half-nude, wearing only ostrich feathers. [...] The audience at opening night on October 25, 1925 included Jean Cocteau, composers Darius Milhaud and Maurice Ravel, and fashion designer Paul Poiret. [...] The show was an immense success. [...] After a successful tour of Europe, Baker returned to France three months later to star at the Folies Bergère.

6000|$|Her {{eyes were}} moist, {{her voice was}} jagged with excitement. He was {{convinced}} that he had won her.

60|$|Music {{had begun}} again, {{but it was}} not the soft music such as a lover demands if he is to give of his best. It was a brassy, clashy {{rendering}} of a ribald <b>one-step,</b> enough to choke the eloquence of the most ardent. Couples were dipping and swaying and bumping into one another {{as far as the eye}} could reach; while just behind him two waiters had halted in order to thrash out one of those voluble arguments in which waiters love to indulge. To continue the scene at the proper emotional level was impossible, and Bruce Carmyle began his career as an engaged man by dropping into Smalltalk.|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} such groups, {{with the same}} summer watering-places and the same winter beering-places. Some of them drink hard liquor and play cards. But Miss Mitchin's group were very mild in manner, though desperately violent in theory. The young women wore platter-sized tortoise-shell {{spectacles}} and smocks that were home-dyed to a pleasing shrimp pink. The young men also wore tortoise-shell spectacles, but not smocks--not usually, at least. One of them had an Albanian costume and a beard that was a cross between the beard of an early Christian martyr on a diet and that of a hobo who merely needed a shave. Elderly ladies loved to have him <b>one-step</b> with them and squeeze their elbows.|$|E
60|$|Two {{or three}} days went by. Now when they passed Miss Thompson on the road she did not greet them with ironic cordiality or smile; she passed with her nose in the air, a sulky look on her painted face, frowning, as though {{she did not see}} them. The trader told Macphail that she had tried to get lodging elsewhere, but had failed. In the evening she played through the various reels of her gramophone, but the pretence of mirth was obvious now. The ragtime had a cracked, heart-broken rhythm {{as though it were a}} <b>one-step</b> of despair. When she began to play on Sunday Davidson sent Horn to beg her to stop at once since it was the Lord's day. The reel was taken off and the house was silent except for the steady pattering of the rain on the iron roof.|$|E
60|$|The chief maitre d'hotel {{advanced}} {{to meet them}} with a gesture of invitation, and led them to a table arranged for five. The restaurant was crowded, and the coloured band, from the space against the wall on their left, was playing a lively <b>one-step.</b> Ferrani was buttonholed by an important client as they crossed the threshold, and they lingered for a moment, waiting for his guidance. Whilst they stood there, a curious thing happened. The leader of the orchestra seemed to draw his fingers recklessly across the strings of his instrument and to produce a discord which was almost appalling. A half-pained, half-amused exclamation rippled down the room. For a moment the music ceased. The conductor, {{who was responsible for}} the disturbance, was sitting motionless, his hand hanging down by his side. His features remained imperturbable, but the gleam of his white teeth, and a livid little streak under his eyes gave to his usually good-humoured face an utterly altered, almost a malignant expression. Ferrani stepped across and spoke to him for a moment angrily. The man took up his instrument, waved his hand, and the music re-commenced in a subdued note. Pamela turned to the chief maitre d'hotel, who had now re-joined them.|$|E
60|$|Such was Miss Pillenger. She was {{the last}} of a long line of {{unprotected}} English girlhood which had been compelled by straitened circumstances to listen for hire to the appallingly dreary nonsense which Mr Meggs had to impart on the subject of British Butterflies. Girls had come, and girls had gone, blondes, ex-blondes, brunettes, ex-brunettes, near-blondes, near-brunettes; they had come buoyant, full of hope and life, tempted by the lavish salary which Mr Meggs had found himself after a while compelled to pay; and they had dropped off, one after another, like exhausted bivalves, unable to endure the crushing boredom of life in the village which had given Mr Meggs to the world. For Mr Meggs's home-town was no City of Pleasure. Remove the Vicar's magic-lantern and the try-your-weight machine opposite the post office, and you practically eliminated the temptations to tread the primrose path. The only young men in the place were silent, gaping youths, at whom lunacy commissioners looked sharply and suspiciously when they met. The tango was unknown, and the <b>one-step.</b> The only form of dance extant--and that only at the rarest intervals--was a sort of polka not unlike the movements of a slightly inebriated boxing kangaroo. Mr Meggs's secretaries and typists gave the town one startled, horrified glance, and stampeded for London like frightened ponies.|$|E
60|$|Swann {{did as he}} was bidden, and as a loud, violent {{discordance}} blared out of {{the machine}} he threw away his cigarette, and turned to Helen. She seemed to leap at him. She had a pantherish grace. Swann drew her closely to him, with his arm all the way round her, while her arm encircled his neck. They began a fast swaying walk, in which Swann appeared to be forcing the girl over backwards. They swayed, and turned, and glided; they made strange abrupt movements in accordance with the jerky tune; they halted {{at the end of a}} walk to make little steps forward and back; then they began to bounce and sway together in a motion that Lane instantly recognized as a toddle. Lane remembered the <b>one-step,</b> the fox-trot and other new dances of an earlier day, when the craze for new dancing had become general, but this sort of gyration was vastly something else. It disgusted Lane. He felt the blood surge to his face. He watched Helen Wrapp in the arms of Swann, and he realized, whatever had been the state of his heart on his return home, he did not love her now. Even if the war had not disrupted his mind in an unaccountable way, even if he had loved Helen Wrapp right up to that moment, such singular abandonment to a distorted strange music, to the close and unmistakably sensual embrace of a man--that spectacle would have killed his love.|$|E
50|$|The {{next level}} of kumite is {{freestyle}} <b>one-step</b> sparring (jiyu ippon kumite). This type of kumite, and its successor—free sparring, have been documented extensively by Nakayama and are expanded upon by the JKA instructor trainee program, for those clubs under the JKA. Freestyle <b>one-step</b> sparring is similar to <b>one-step</b> sparring but requires the karateka to be in motion. Practicing <b>one-step</b> sparring improves free sparring (jiyu kumite) skills, and also {{provides an opportunity for}} practicing major counter-attacks (as opposed to minor counter-attacks). Tsutomu Ohshima states that freestyle <b>one-step</b> sparring is the most realistic practice in Shotokan Karate, and that it is more realistic than free sparring.|$|E
