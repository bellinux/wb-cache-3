Hot Lake (Oroville, WA) is an athalassohaline {{epsomite}} lake that can have precipitating concentrations of MgSO 4 salts, mainly epsomite. Little biotic study {{has been done on}} epsomite lakes and it was unclear whether microbes isolated from epsomite lakes and their margins would fall within recognized halotolerant genera, common soil genera or novel phyla. Our initial study cultivated and characterized epsotolerant bacteria from the lake and its margins. Approximately 100 aerobic heterotrophic microbial isolates were obtained by repetitive streak-plating in high-salt media including either 10 % NaCl or 2 M MgSO 4. The collected isolates were all bacteria, nearly evenly divided between Gram-positive and Gram-negative clades, the most abundant genera being Halomonas, Idiomarina, Marinobacter, Marinococcus, Nesterenkonia, Nocardiopsis and Planococcus. Bacillus, Corynebacterium, Exiguobacterium, Kocuria and Staphylococcus also were cultured. This initial study included culture-independent community analysis of direct DNA extracts of lake margin soil using PCR-based clone libraries and 16 S rRNA gene phylogeny. Clones assigned to Gram-positive bacterial clades (70 % of total clones) were dominated by sequences related to uncultured actinobacteria. There were abundant Deltaproteobacteria clones related to bacterial sulphur metabolisms and clones of Legionella and Coxiella. These epsomite lake microbial communities seem to be divided between bacteria primarily associated with hyperhaline environments rich in NaCl and salinotolerant relatives of common soil organisms. Archaea appear to be in low abundance and none were isolated, despite near-saturated salinities.

The aerosol particles (6170) were analyzed as individual particles and classified according to their chemical composition, size, number concentration per cubic centimeter and morphology. Most of the aerosol particles could be classified into four groups. The first contains gypsum from the sea and from industrial sources brought in by land breezes. A second group is characterized by continental aluminosilicate and quartz. A third group consists of sea salt mixed with sulphate particles. The fourth group is characterized by an abundance of sulphate particles, {{some of which are}} ammonium sulphate brought by the land breezes. The particles were identified as marine and mineral aerosols which originated in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean sea, while local aerosols brought by land breeze characterized by phosphate, fly ash and soil particles originated in the Haifa industrial zone. In addition, the aerosols were analyzed for sulphates and nitrates. Aerosols of sea and land breezes differed as follows: Sulphate and nitrate concentrations in the aerosols were 5 - 10 times higher during land breeze than during sea breeze, and the total content of suspended particles was, respectively, 6 - 12 times higher. Particle size spectra during land breeze were broader than during sea breeze and their concentrations were about 20 times greater. Analyses of individual particles by electron microscopy revealed that during the sea breeze the aerosols contained calcium sulphate, sodium sulphate and sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid, of pH 2. 5, is due to the long-range transport as previously reported (Ganor et al. 1993) while the <b>other</b> <b>sulphates</b> are from the sea.

40|$|A new oxy-hydroxy iron(III) {{sulphate}} {{from the}} small magnetite-pyrite ore body at Fornovolasco (Apuan Alps, Tuscany, Italy) was identified. The origin of this mineral {{is related to the}} action of strongly acid solutions derived from the alteration of pyrite in the old tunnels of Fornovolasco mines. It is strictly associated with <b>other</b> <b>sulphates,</b> like alum-(K), copiapite, halotrichite, melanterite, römerite, and voltaite. The new mineral occurs as bladed crystals, elongated on 010, up to 50 microns long and less than 5 microns across. XRPD showed that this mineral is the natural analogous of the synthetic compound Fe 4 (SO 4) (OH) 10. This new sulphate is monoclinic, with cell parameters a 16. 085 (2), b 3. 054 (1), c 10. 929 (2) Å, beta 93. 78 (1) °, space group C 2 /m. Electron microprobe analyses give Fe 2 O 3 63. 33, SO 3 14. 07, H 2 O 17. 18, sum 94. 58. The sum of the wt of oxides is low even after the addition of the calculated water content. This may be a consequence of the very small crystal size, which have a thickness of less than 5 microns. Owing to the very small size, intensity data were collected at the XRD beamline of the Elettra synchrotron facility (Basovizza, Trieste, Italy). The crystal structure was solved and refined to R 0. 078 for all 259 reflections with Fo > 4 sigma(Fo). Figure 1 shows the crystal structure of this oxy-hydroxy iron(III) sulphate. The crystal structure is composed by ribbons of edge-sharing Fe-octahedra running along 010, linked together by corner-sharing to form wavy layers. As {{it is not possible to}} locate two SO 4 groups at distance of only 3 Å, it is probable that a regular alternation of SO 4 groups and H 2 O molecules takes place along the b direction. Such ordered sequence should double the b parameter, with the occurrence of additional superstructure reflections. Actually, only continuous streaks were detected in the diffraction patterns.

(Central Poland), are considered a large complex of mid-Cambrian strata (Alexandrowicz 1972). In a 2 -km long exposure of the Pieprzowe Mts succession, along the Vistula River bank near the town of Sandomierz, shales, quartz-mica shales, quartzites, sandstones, mudstones and conglomerates are outcropping. All shaly facies are enriched in pyrite. The occurrence of secondary minerals in the weathering zone of the mid-Cambrian shale formation in the Pieprzowe Mts. is known for an extended period of time. Differences in color eff lorescence observed on the weathered surface were considered as alum incrustations; hence, the term “alum shale” has been used with reference to these rocks. The phase composition of fine-crystal aggregates was determined by Kuhl (1931). Based on observations under polarizing microscope, he interpreted them as a composition of mirabilite, epsomite and alunogen, thus contradicting his earlier hypothesis about pickeringite occurrence. Pickeringite is a sulphate mineral owing its origin to oxidation of pyrite in low pH conditions (Kruszewski 2013) and is a member of the halotrichite group with theoretical formula MgAl 2 (SO 4) 4 ∙∙ 22 H 2 O. However, chemically pure pickeringite is rare as most of its occurrences form transitional phases between pickeringite and halotrichite (Parafiniuk 1991). This mineral is usually observed in aggregates with other sulphates; the most common association consists of alunogen and epsomite. Crystallization and preservation of pickeringite depend on air humidity, which results from its high solubility in water (Balcerzak et al. 1992, Parafiniuk 1991). The aim of this study is to describe conditions of pickeringite crystallization in the weathering zone of the Pieprzowe Mts. shale formation. SEM-EDS analysis made it possible to detect three types of sulphide minerals occurring within aggregates. The most common is pickeringite forming elongated crystals with smooth surfaces, which demonstrate absence of dissolution processes. Fibers of pickeringite are associated with a mineral of tabular shape named alunogen – Al(SO 4) 3. Epsomite was detected in subordinate quantities. XRD analysis confirmed the polymineral character of efflorescenes. The main ref lex for pickeringite (ca. 4. 80 Å) is fragmented into two peaks: (1) 4. 8061 Å and (2) 4. 7958 Å. These values are reduced as compared to ICDD data, which could result from admixtures of <b>other</b> <b>sulphates,</b> alunogene and epsomite. Another options is that this reduction means that pickeringite is forming transitional phase into halotrichite, which has its maximum reflex at 4. 81 Å. This could be confirmed by chemical composition (Fe impurities). The Pieprzowe Mts. shale formation presents specific conditions favouring evaporation of pickeringite. The elements required for pickeringite crystallization originate from the host rocks. The source of Al 3 +could be kaolinite, which is common as a product of alteration processes as well as an authigenic compound. Processing of micas transformation causes environmental enrichment in Mg 2 +. The published sources indicate that the presence of pyrite is a key-factor for pickeringite crystallization. However, this mineral is also typical for shales present in the Carpathian rock units, where as a product of pyrite oxidation jarosite and gypsum are common. This suggests that some other initiator is required for the formation of pickeringite. It has been suggested that surface evaporation of groundwater causes the precipitation of sulphates (Cody & Briggs 1973 vide Parnell & Roderic 1982). The Pieprzowe Mts. shale formation contains dense network of veins so it is possible that waters from deeper layers are able to migrate into the subsurface. Some documented occurrences of pickerigite are related to arid regions. Certainly, an important role is played by humidity – southern exposure and poor plant cover of the Pieprzowe Mts. could be the reason why pickeringite may not only crystalize but also exist there. Most of the pickeringite occurrences in Poland are associated with rocks of old units (mid-Cambrian in age in the Pieprzowe Mts., Proterozoic in Wieściszowice and in Krobica quarry). Older rocks are poor in carbonates so it could mean that pH is a more important factor conditioning pickeringite crystallization than pyrite occurrence. Pickeringite was found also on burning coal-mining dumps in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (Kruszewski 2013), what confirm that pH determines crystalization of this mineral. Correlation between pickeringite and <b>other</b> <b>sulphates</b> is also interesting. Alunogen associated with pickeringite crystalize when the delivery of Mg 2 +is reduced. Paragenesis consisting of alunogene, epsomite and pickeringite could be a result of different solubility of these phases or changing of Mg 2 +and Al 3 +ions during evaporation processes. The following sequence of crystallization is proposed: alunogene-pickeringite-epsomite. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej. KEYWORDS: quartz-mica shale, quartzite, sandstone...|$|E
40|$|Gypsum {{rocks are}} widely {{exploited}} {{in the world}} as industrial minerals. The purity of the gypsum rocks (percentage in gypsum mineral –CaSO 4 • 2 H 2 O- in the whole rock) is a critical factor to evaluate the potential exploitability of a gypsum deposit. It is considered than purities higher than 80 % in gypsum are required to be economically profitable. Gypsum deposits have been studied with geoelectrical methods; a direct relationship between the electrical resistivity values of the gypsum rocks and its lithological composition has been established, with the presence of lutites being the main controlling factor in the geoelectrical response of the deposit. This phenomenon has been quantified by means of a combination of theoretical calculations, laboratory measurements and field data acquisition. A geoelectrical classification of gypsum rocks defining three types of gypsum rocks has been elaborated. Anhydrite (CaSO 4) is frequently found in gypsum quarries and in no-outcropping sulphates. Because of its highest hardness than gypsum it supposes a problem for the extraction of gypsum; the fronts of the quarries in which anhydrite is found are stopped at the moment when it appears. The electrical properties of calcium sulphates have been studied by means of geoelectrical methods. The conductivity of crystals has been tested in laboratory. A direct relationship between the electrical conductivity values of the calcium sulphate rocks and its lithological composition has been established being the lutitic matrix the main controlling factor when it is percolant (connected at long range). When the rock is matrix dominant, the electrical resistivity trend is bond to the Hashin-Shtrikman lower bound for multiphase systems. On the other hand, when the rock is calcium sulphate dominant the trend shows the one of the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound. A geoelectrical classification for calcium sulphate rocks has been elaborated. With this classification it is possible to differentiate between calcium sulphate rocks with different composition according to their electrical resistivity value. Glauberite (Na 2 Ca(SO 4) 2) is nowadays exploited as industrial mineral. Glauberite rocks usually have high lutite content in their composition, together with other evaporictic minerals as gypsum, anhydrite or halite among others. There is no reference to the conductivity of glauberite rocks in the bibliography, but due to their impurity it is expected to observe values as the observed for <b>other</b> <b>sulphates</b> in the matrix domain (less than 55 % in purity). Two areas of the Ebro river basin (the Zaragoza and La Rioja sectors) have been studied by means of electrical resistivity tomography profiles, in which glauberite has been found in boreholes. As example of application for the study of sulphate deposits, an electrical resistivity tomography survey has been carried out in the Pira Gypsum member (SE of Catalan margin of the Tertiary Ebro Basin, Spain). Additionally, a continuous coring drill was performed in order to support the study. Electrical imaging has been successfully applied to identify the gypsum deposits interlayered in lutite units. Another resistivity survey has been carried out in an active gypsum quarry in the Gelsa Gypsum unit (Zaragoza, N Spain). During the extraction of the rock, the most important parameters to know are the purity changes in the deposit. Sudden changes in the purity make the processing of the raw material less profitable. The performed profiles have shown different gypsum layers from which the purest layers have been identified. Electrical resistivity tomography lines are useful in prospection of gypsum deposits. However, electrical imaging prospection should be supported by an accurate petrological study of the deposits, in order to properly interpret the resistivity profiles.

40|$|AbstractThe {{synthetic}} peptide, SFLLRNPNDKYEPF, {{has been}} recently {{described as a}} peptide mimicking the new amino-terminus created by cleavage of the thrombin receptor, therefore acting as an agonist of the thrombin receptor. This peptide was a potent mitogen for rabbit arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) and exhibited the same activity as that of native α-thrombin. Both compounds stimulated the proliferation of growth-arrested SMCs with half-maximum mitogenic responses at 1 nM. NAPAP, a synthetic inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of thrombin, specifically inhibited thrombin-induced SMC growth (IC 50 = 0. 35 ± 0. 04 μM) but was without effect on the mitogenic effect of the agonist peptide. These results therefore demonstrate that the mitogenic effect of α-thrombin for SMCs is intimately linked to its esterolytic activity. Heparin, which inhibited fetal calf serum-induced SMC growth, was without effect on thrombin-induced SMC growth but strongly reduced the mitogenic effect of the agonist peptide (IC 50 = 32 ± 5 μ/ml).

40|$|Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) {{arises from}} {{sequestration}} of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized erythrocytes (PE) in the placenta, leading to chronic symptoms in the expectant mother and serious consequences for fetal development. Placental sequestration {{has been linked}} to binding of chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) by the var 2 CSA variant of PfEMP 1 expressed on the PE surface, and a substantial body of evidence shows that the immune response to var 2 CSA gives an effective protection against PAM. We have expressed the var 2 CSA-DBL 5 epsilon domain, derived from a placental isolate from Senegal, as soluble product in Escherichia coil and have shown using different criteria that the recombinant protein is obtained with the native conformation. Using surface plasmon resonance techniques, we have examined binding of DBL 5 epsilon to placental chondroitin sulphate proteoglyan and CSA; however, the recombinant protein also binds to <b>other</b> <b>sulphated</b> oligosaccharides, with higher affinity in some cases, indicating that the single domain lacks the specificity for CSA shown by the complete extra-cellular region of var 2 CSA and placental parasites. Recombinant DBL 5 epsilon was specifically recognized by sera from malaria-exposed Senegalese women in a parity-dependent manner but by sera not from children or males from the same endemic region. Conversely, DBL 5 epsilon induced antibodies in mice that recognized placental isolates from Benin but not isolates from children. The presence of universal epitopes thus supports DBL 5 epsilon as an interesting component of var 2 CSA to be considered for vaccine development...|$|R
40|$|Accumulation of airway {{smooth muscle}} (ASM) and its {{infiltration}} by mast cells are key pathological features of airway remodelling in asthma. Heparin, {{a major component}} of mast cell granules, inhibits ASM proliferation by an unknown mechanism. Here, unfractionated heparins and related glycosaminoglycans having structurally heterogeneous polysaccharide side chains that varied in molecular weight, sulphation and anionic charge were used to identify features of the heparin molecule that were required for its antiproliferative activity in cultured human ASM cells. Proliferation induced by 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) was abrogated by two unfractionated commercial heparin preparations (Sigma and Multiparin) and this effect was reproduced with each of three low-molecular weight heparin preparations (3, 5 and 6 [*]kDa, respectively), demonstrating that antiproliferative activity resided in at least a 3 [*]kDa heparin fraction. N-desulphated 20 % re-acetylated (N-de) heparin (anticoagulant) and O-desulphated heparin (O-de) (non-anticoagulant) fractions also inhibited FBS-dependent proliferation (rank potency: Sigma heparin>O-de>N-de) suggesting that the antiproliferative action of heparin involved N-sulphation but was independent of its anticoagulant activity. <b>Other</b> <b>sulphated</b> molecules with variable anionic charge (dextran sulphate, fucoidan, chondroitin sulphates A or B, heparan sulphate) inhibited proliferation to varying degrees, as did the non-sulphated molecules hyaluronic acid and poly-L-glutamic acid. However, nonsulphated dextran had no effect. In summary, attenuation of FBS-dependent proliferation of human ASM by heparin involves but does not depend upon sulphation, although loss of N-sulphation reduces antiproliferative activity. This antiproliferative effect is independent of anionic charge and the anticoagulant actions of heparin...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{effluents}} rich in sulphate, {{acid and}} metals are produced when sulphuric acid {{is used as}} a raw material, and when pyrites is oxidised due to exposure to the atmosphere, e. g. in the mining industry. Biological sulphate removal can be used to treat industrial effluents to achieve, in addition to sulphate, metal removal and neutralisation. Sulphate can be removed as elemental sulphur via sulphide as an intermediate product when an energy source is provided. The biological sulphate removal process has developed over the past 15 years to the stage where it can compete successfully with <b>other</b> <b>sulphate</b> removal technologies for full-scale treatment of mine and other industrial effluents. The aim of this investigation was to demonstrate the performance of the integrated process consisting out of hydrogen generation, sulphate reduction with hydrogen as energy source, H 2 S-stripping and stabilization stages. The following conclusions were made from this investigation: • The biological sulphate removal process can be used for removal of sulphate to less than 200 mg/l using ethanol as the carbon and energy source. • H 2 S can be stripped to below 20 mg/l (as S) with CO 2 by using a venturi as a stripping device. The efficiency of H 2 S-stripping is influenced by H 2 S feed rate, CO 2 -concentration, CO 2 /H 2 S load ratio and absorption efficiency of H 2 S in iron(III). • Hydrogen is the most cost-effective energy source. The cost of hydrogen amounts to R 1. 53 /m 3 per g/l of sulphate removed (R 1. 53 /kg SO 4 removed) ...|$|R

40|$|The tannes {{region of}} the Sine Saloum basin in Senegal {{exhibits}} a variety of soils related to pyrite oxidation, topographic position, and hydrology. Tanne is the local name for salt-affected coastal flats. Strong salinization and progressive formation of acid sulphate soils has taken place since 197 1 caused by the severe drought. Soils on low terraces, subject to tidal flooding, have oxidized, leading to jarosite formation. Soils on the higher terraces show not only complete oxidation of pyrite to jarosite but, also, hydrolysis of jarosite to goethite and dehydration of goethite to hematite. These processes seem to be extremely rapid compared {{to the situation in}} <b>other</b> acid <b>sulphate</b> soil regions, for instance in Southeast Asia. Possibly, in the supersaline conditions, hydrolysis of jarosite to goethite might be stimulated by neu-tralization of acid, and hygroscopic free salts might accelerate the dehydration of goethite to hematite during the dry season...|$|R
40|$|The fumarolic {{mineralogy}} of the Icelandic active volcanoes, the Tyrrhenian volcanic belt (Italy) and the Aegean active arc (Greece) is investigated, {{and literature}} data surveyed {{in order to}} define {{the characteristics of the}} European fumarolic systems. They show broad diversity of mineral associations, with Vesuvius and Vulcano being also among the world localities richest in mineral species. Volcanic systems, which show recession over a longer period, show fumarolic development from the high-temperature alkaline halide/sulphate, calcic sulphate or sulphidic parageneses, synchronous with or immediately following the eruptions, through medium-temperature ammonium minerals, metal chlorides, or fluoride associations to the late low-temperature paragenesis dominated by sulphur, gypsum, alunogen, and <b>other</b> hydrous <b>sulphates.</b> The situation can be different in the systems that are not recessing but show fluctuations in activity, illustrated by the example of Vulcano where the high-temperature association appears intermittently.

40|$|Previously {{degradation}} studies carried out, over {{a number}} of different mortars by the research team, have shown that observed degradation does not exclusively depend on the solution equilibrium pH, nor the aggressive anions relative solubility. In our tests no reason was found that could allow us to explain, why same solubility anions with a lower pH are less aggressive than others. The aim {{of this paper is to}} study cement pastes behavior in aggressive environments. As observed in previous research, this cement pastes behaviors are not easily explained only taking into account only usual parameters, pH, solubility etc. Consequently the paper is about studying if solution physicochemical characteristics are more important in certain environments than specific pH values. The paper tries to obtain a degradation model, which starting from solution physicochemical parameters allows us to interpret the different behaviors shown by different composition cements. To that end, the rates of degradation of the solid phases were computed for each considered environment. Three cement have been studied: CEM I 42. 5 R/SR, CEM II/A-V 42. 5 R and CEM IV/B-(P-V) 32. 5 N. The pastes have been exposed to five environments: sodium acetate/acetic acid 0. 35 M, sodium sulfate solution 0. 17 M, a solution representing natural water, saturated calcium hydroxide solution and laboratory environment. The attack mechanism was meant to be unidirectional, in order to achieve so; all sides of cylinders were sealed except from the attacked surface. The cylinders were taking out of the exposition environments after 2, 4, 7, 14, 30, 58 and 90 days. Both aggressive solution variations in solid phases and in different depths have been characterized. To each age and depth the calcium, magnesium and iron contents have been analyzed. Hydrated phases evolution studied, using thermal analysis, and crystalline compound changes, using X ray diffraction have been also analyzed. Sodium sulphate and water solutions stabilize an outer pH near to 8 in short time, however the stability of the most pH dependent phases is not the same. Although having similar pH and existing the possibility of forming a plaster layer near to the calcium leaching surface, this stability is greater than <b>other</b> <b>sulphate</b> solutions. Stability variations of solids formed by inverse diffusion, determine the rate of degradation...|$|R
40|$|Almost {{all modern}} engine {{lubricants}} use the additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) to provide antiwear and extreme pressure protection. However existing and proposed emissions regulations include constraints in {{the concentration of}} ZDDP or <b>other</b> <b>sulphated</b> ash-, phosphorus- and sulphur- (SAPS) containing additives in engine oils, as well as limits to the permissible phosphorus loss from the oil in running engines. The deleterious effects of SAPS on exhaust aftertreatment systems from ZDDP decomposition has lead to {{a great interest in}} identifying alternative low and zero SAPS antiwear additives that can partially of fully replace ZDDP in the next generation of engine oils to extend the life of exhaust after-treatment systems. The aim of the work described in this thesis is to explore under the same test conditions, the film-forming, friction and wear-reducing properties of a very wide range of low and zero SAPS antiwear additives as possible replacements for ZDDP in engine oils, and, where additive types are effective, to investigate their mechanism of action. Some of the alternative low and zero SAPS antiwear additives investigated show wear-reducing performance comparable to the ZDDP used as a benchmark in this research. The most promising alternatives to be used as supplements/replacements for ZDDP are suggested and discussed. One characteristic of ZDDP is that it can form quite thick films on surfaces during rubbing. It is found that many different types of additive can also form thick films, though not generally as thick as ZDDP. However it has been found that there is no significant correlation between the ability of an additive to form a thick boundary film and its ability to control wear. Thick boundary film formation does, however, correlate positively with an increase in friction in contacts operating at intermediate entrainment speeds, so thick film formation should not be taken as a necessary or desirable feature of antiwear additives. It is also found that antiwear additives can give a very wide range of boundary friction coefficient values, depending on the molecular structure of the additive. There thus appears to be scope for optimising the structure of antiwear additives to provide reduced boundary friction. Imperial Users Onl...|$|R
40|$|The {{thrombin}} mutant, des-ETW-thrombin, lacking Glu(146), Thr(147), and Trp(148) {{within a}} unique insertion loop {{located at the}} extreme end of the primary specificity pocket, has been shown previously to exhibit reduced catalytic activity with respect to macromolecular and synthetic thrombin substrates and reduced or enhanced susceptibility to inhibition. Investigation of the hydrolysis of peptidyl p-nitroanilide substrates by des-ETW-thrombin showed increased activity {{in the presence of}} heparin and <b>other</b> <b>sulphated</b> glycosaminoglycans. No effect was observed upon the activity of wild-type thrombin. Heparin was found to decrease the K(m) for cleavage of four thrombin-specific substrates by des-ETW-thrombin by 3 - 4 -fold. Similarly, pentosan polysulphate (PPS) decreased the K(m) with these substrates by 8 - 10 -fold. Heparin also increased the rate of inhibition of des-ETW-thrombin by antithrombin III and D-phenylalanyl-prolyl-arginylchloromethane (PPACK). The inhibition of des-ETW-thrombin by a number of thrombin-specific peptide boronic acids also showed significant reduction in the final K(i) in the presence of heparin, due to reduction in the off-rate. A peptide analogue of a sequence of hirudin which binds thrombin tightly to exosite I (fibrinogen recognition site) potentiated the activity of des-ETW-thrombin against peptide p-nitroanilide substrates {{in a manner similar to}} heparin. The K(i) for the inhibition of des-ETW-thrombin by p-aminobenzamidine was decreased by these ligands from 9. 7 mM to 7. 5 mM, 5. 1 mM, and 2. 5 mM in the presence of heparin, hirudin peptide and PPS respectively, suggesting the increased catalytic activity is due to enhanced access to the primary specificity pocket. The positive influence of these ligands on des-ETW-thrombin was reversed in the presence of ATP or ADP; the latter has previously been shown to inhibit thrombin activity by blocking initial interaction with fibrinogen at exosite 1. Because the effect of heparin and PPS is similar to that of hirudin peptide, it is proposed that the most likely mechanism is that binding at the heparin-binding site (thrombin exosite 2) facilitates interaction at exosite 1 causing a conformational change which partially corrects the defective ground-state binding of the mutant thrombin. Although no effect was observed upon the activity of wild-type thrombin, our findings do provide further evidence of an allosteric property of thrombin which may control the geometry of, and access to, the primary specificity pocket...|$|R
40|$|Rice {{fields are}} {{major sources of}} CH 4 and N 2 O. A num-ber of {{practices}} have been suggested to minimize the emission of either of these gases, but simultaneous mitigation of these gases are not widely discussed. Mitigating CH 4 emission may increas N 2 O emissions and vice versa. Reducing their emission and making the cumulative radiative forcing a minimum is a pri-ority. The strategies should be effective, applicable on a large scale, technically feasible, economic, less time-consuming, environment friendly and should be easily acceptable. On {{the basis of the}} available literature on CH 4 and N 2 O mitigation, the following measures are suggested by the author to mitigate the emissions of these two gases simultaneously from irrigated rice fields: (1) Aplication of mid-season drainage which does not coincide with high ammonium in soil, (2) application of urea and based-NH 4 + fertilizers in splits with nitrification inhibitors to increase N use efficiency, (3) replacement of ammonium <b>sulphate</b> with <b>other</b> <b>sulphate</b> sources to minimize CH 4 and N 2 O emissions, (4) replacement of N broadcasting by foliar-N spray application, (5) sub- rface application of urea supergranules, (6) incorporation or deep placement of prilled urea instead of surface applica-tion, (7) application of well-composted organic matter in place of fresh organic matter and green manure, (8) use of single superphosphate (SSP) basally, which in addition to supplying phosphorus, could mitigate CH 4 production by supplying sulphur to soil and (9) culti-vati n of rice varieties with low gas transport capaci-ties and low exudate formation. These practices can be taken up without much difficulty in irrigated rice fields and can reduce CH 4 and N 2 O emission simul-taneously. METHANE (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) are two impor-tant greenhouse gases and lead to chemical changes in the atmosphere 1 – 4. Although, atmospheric loading of N 2 O is lower than CH 4 globally 4, the former is a 310 times more potent greenhouse gas than CO 2 on a 100 -year time-scale while CH 4 is only 21 times more poten...|$|R

30|$|Carbon black, if pure, {{should be}} {{deprived}} of elements detectable by EDXRF analysis; on the contrary, it is very absorbent of infrared radiation so that the infrared image obtained by IR reflectography can make its presence visible. Reflectography is widely used on painting for under-drawing examination. For this reason, there is a deep knowledge of the response of black painting media. We performed long wave infrared reflectography (with sensitivity ranging 1000 – 2500  nm) because, in this range of wavelength, carbon black pigments are strong absorber while iron-gallic ink are transparent [10]. There are some other materials, such as hematite (iron oxide) which have instead an intermediate behaviour at these wavelengths. The iron-gallic dyes, {{on the basis of}} the ancient recipes, were produced by mixing vegetal extracts (tannins obtained by gall-nuts) with inorganic salts (mainly vitriols, nominally iron <b>sulphates</b> with <b>other</b> metal <b>sulphates</b> such manganese, copper, zinc, lead and others). For this reason, this kind of pigments is very well characterized by EDXRF analysis, but it is transparent to IR radiation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigates the}} {{mechanical}} influence of pericellular matrix on the deformation of isolated articular chondrocytes compressed within 3 % agarose specimens. After 1 day in culture, {{the cells were}} associated with minimal amounts of sulphated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and hydroxyproline and exhibited substantial deformation from a spherical to an oblate ellipsoid morphology when subjected to 20 % gross compressive strain. However, over the 6 day culture period, there was a reduction in cell deformation associated {{with an increase in}} matrix content. Treatment with testicular hyaluronidase at days 3 and 6 reduced sulphated GAG content to levels observed in untreated specimens at day 1. At day 3, the resulting cell deformation during 20 % compression was equivalent to that in specimens compressed at day 1. However, at day 6 cell deformation was only partially restored, suggesting the presence of additional structural matrix components, <b>other</b> than <b>sulphated</b> GAG, which were not present at day 3. Dual scanning confocal microscopy indicated that the elaborated matrix formed a pericellular shell which did not deform during compression and was therefore stiffer than the 3 % agarose substrate. Therefore, the elaboration of a mechanically functional pericellular matrix within 6 days, effectively limits the potential involvement of cell deformation in mechanotransduction within cell seeded systems such as those employed for cartilage repair...|$|R
