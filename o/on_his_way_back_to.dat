5|$|At {{this point}} Kantakouzenos {{received}} grave news from Constantinople. In late August Apokaukos attempted a coup {{and tried to}} kidnap John V. Having failed, he fled to his fortified house at Epibatai, where he was blockaded by troops. Kantakouzenos returned to Constantinople in early September, where he stayed {{for a few weeks}} consulting with the Empress. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Thrace to prepare for a campaign into the Morea, he went to Epibatai, where he pardoned Apokaukos and restored him to his former offices.|$|E

The young az-Zafir became caliph in 1149, and Ibn as-Sallar became vizier, with Usama as one of his advisors. As-Sallar sent Usama to negotiate an alliance against the crusaders with Zengi's son Nur ad-Din, but the negotiations failed. Usama took part in battles with the crusaders outside of Ascalon <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Egypt, and after he left, his brother 'Ali was killed at Gaza.|$|E
5|$|The {{sighting}} by Jane Tanner, {{one of the}} Tapas Seven, of a man {{carrying a}} child that night became {{an important part of}} the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.|$|E
5|$|A {{recovered}} Herkus Monte raided Culmerland {{with a large}} {{force and}} took many prisoners in 1263. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm (Chełmno) in 1263 and in 1265.|$|E

5|$|Although Ibn Haukal {{reports the}} sack of Samandar by Sviatoslav, the Rus' leader {{did not bother}} to occupy the Khazar heartlands north of the Caucasus Mountains permanently. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kiev, Sviatoslav chose to strike against the Ossetians and force them into subservience. Therefore, Khazar {{successor}} statelets continued their precarious existence in the region. The destruction of Khazar imperial power paved the way for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} he had {{achieved}} in Romania in 1940 {{with the help of}} his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the Volksdeutsche communities of Romania, Hungary and Yugoslavia, which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little could be done to further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time Yugoslavia had been overrun by the Axis, and Romania and Hungary had joined the pact. Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav Volksdeutsche into his renamed SS-Division-Reich, even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through Romania and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.|$|E
5|$|Hasekura {{stayed for}} 5 months in Mexico <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Japan. The San Juan Bautista {{was waiting in}} Acapulco since 1616, after a second trip across the Pacific from Japan to Mexico. Captained by Yokozawa Shōgen, she was laden with fine pepper and lacquerware from Kyoto, which were sold on the Mexican market. Following a request by the Spanish king, {{in order to avoid}} too much silver leaving to Japan, the Viceroy asked for the {{proceeds}} to be spent on Mexican goods, except for an amount of 12,000 pesos and 8,000 pesos in silver which Hasekura and Yokozawa could bring back with them respectively.|$|E

5|$|In June 1863, Hines led an {{invasion}} into Indiana with 25 Confederates {{posing as a}} Union unit in pursuit of deserters. Their goal was {{to see if the}} local Copperheads would support the invasion of John Hunt Morgan planned for July 1863. Traveling through Kentucky for eight days to obtain supplies for their mission, they crossed the Ohio River to enter Indiana, near the village of Derby, on June 18, 1863. Hines visited the local Copperhead leader, Dr. William A. Bowles, in French Lick, and learned {{that there would be no}} formal support for Morgan's Raid. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Kentucky, Hines and his men were discovered in Valeene, Indiana, leading to a small skirmish near Leavenworth, Indiana, on Little Blue Island. Hines had to abandon his men as he swam across the Ohio River under gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Innocent consecrated Stephen Langton as {{archbishop}} against John's wishes, {{triggering a}} long {{dispute between the}} papacy and the King. The pope imposed various sanctions on England and John; at one point de Gray {{was one of only}} two bishops still legitimately holding office in England. In 1209 he became governor of Ireland for John, and spent until 1213 attempting to impose royal government on the Anglo-Norman barons and the native Irish in that country. Recalled to England to help defend against a threatened invasion by the French, de Gray then travelled to Rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement of John and Innocent's dispute over the bishop's abortive elevation to Canterbury. After securing his pardon de Gray was appointed Bishop of Durham, but he died <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> England.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Salih and the Tayy fended off Fatimid {{troops in}} Palestine. <b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Aleppo, Salih {{captured}} {{a string of}} towns and fortresses, namely Ba'albak west of Damascus, Hims and Rafaniyya in central Syria, Sidon on the Mediterranean coast and Hisn Ibn Akkar in the hinterland of Tripoli. These strategically valuable towns gave Salih's emirate an outlet to the sea and control of part of the caravan route between Aleppo and Damascus. The fall of Sidon particularly alarmed the Fatimids, who largely prioritized control of Syria's port cities over the inland towns and who feared that other ports would recognize Bedouin rule.|$|E

5|$|There are {{indications}} that Robert may have been briefly betrothed to a daughter of King Cnut, but no marriage took place. It is unclear if William would have been supplanted in the ducal succession if Robert had had a legitimate son. Earlier dukes had been illegitimate, and William's association with his father on ducal charters appears to indicate that William was considered Robert's most likely heir. In 1034 Duke Robert decided to go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Although some of his supporters tried to dissuade him from undertaking the journey, Robert convened a council in January 1035 and had the assembled Norman magnates swear fealty to William as his heir before leaving for Jerusalem. He died in early July at Nicea, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Normandy.|$|E
5|$|For many scholars, {{the scene}} at 6.34 seems to {{anticipate}} and parallel the confrontation between Theodosius and Ambrose in 390; Erasmus used the two situations as parallel exempla in a letter written to Francis I in 1523. That later event has been taken as evidence against Philip's Christianity. Even in the later 4th century, {{in a society that}} had already been significantly Christianized, the argument goes, Theodosius' humiliation had shocked the sensibilities of the aristocratic elite. It is therefore inconceivable that 3rd century aristocrats, members of a society that had experienced only partial Christianization, would accept such self-abasement from their emperors. Shahîd contests this parallel, and argues that Philip's scene was far less humiliating than Theodosius': it did not take place against the same background (Theodosius had massacred seven thousand Thessalonicans some months before), no one was excommunicated (Theodosius was excommunicated for eight months), and it did not involve the same dramatic and humiliating dialogue between emperor and bishop. Philip made a quick repentance at a small church <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rome from the Persian front, a stark contrast to the grandeur of Theodosius' confrontation with Ambrose.|$|E
5|$|<b>On</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> home to join Sastry for a concert, Suryam helps a few {{victims of}} an {{accidental}} fire in Ramapuram. His absence leaves Sastry livid and {{he refuses to}} listen to any excuses. Sastry comes across Suryam and Lalitha as a couple, which widens the gap between them. While Gayathri is apprehensive, Udayam remains unaffected. On the way to another concert, Sastry refuses to help an injured lineman named Narayana. A disturbed Suryam emphasises that society's welfare {{is more important than}} worshipping music, which makes Sastry declare Charukesa his successor as a musician. Suryam confronts Sastry about this and leaves the house for good after an argument. Suryam meets Varalayya and stays in his client's house. Suryam later meets Narayana's widow and learns that the government has denied him compensation as he was drunk during working hours. He also meets the family of another drunkard named Kishtappa, one of the survivors of the fire. Their situation leaves Suryam disturbed, and he vows to abolish liquor in Ramapuram. Suryam and Lalitha begin their attempts to make the working class men abandon liquor consumption. Although initially successful, the plan backfires later.|$|E

5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
5|$|Pellew too was <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Brest in Indefatigable, {{accompanied}} by Amazon {{under the command}} of Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds. While the rest of the Channel Fleet had been pursuing the French without success, Pellew had had his ships refitted and resupplied at Falmouth so that both frigates were at full complement, well armed and prepared for action. At 13:00 on 13January, the British ships were approaching the island of Ushant in a heavy fog when they spied another ship through the gloom ahead. This ship, clearly much larger than either of the British vessels, was the Droits de l'Homme. At the same time, lookouts on the French ship spotted the British, and Lacrosse was faced with the dilemma of whether or not to engage the enemy. He knew that his ship was far larger than either of his opponents, but had earlier spotted sails to westwards he believed to be British and thus considered himself outnumbered and possibly surrounded. British records show that no other British vessels were in the vicinity at the time and it is likely that Lacrosse had seen the French ships Révolution and Fraternité returning to Brest from Bantry Bay. In addition, Lacrosse was concerned by the increasing gale and rocky lee shoreline, which posed a considerable threat to his over-laden vessel, which was already damaged from its winter voyage and carried a demi-brigade of the French Army and Humbert, neither of which could be placed at risk in an inconsequential naval action.|$|E
5|$|Valckenier {{had asked}} to be {{replaced}} late in 1740, and in February 1741 had received a reply instructing him to appoint van Imhoff as his successor; an alternative account indicates that the Lords XVII informed {{him that he was}} to be replaced by van Imhoff as punishment for exporting too much sugar and too little coffee in 1739 and thus causing large financial losses. By the time Valckenier received the reply, van Imhoff was already <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Netherlands. Valckenier left the Indies on 6 November 1741, after appointing a temporary successor, Johannes Thedens. Taking command of a fleet, Valckenier headed for the Netherlands. On 25 January 1742 he arrived in Cape Town but was detained, and investigated by governor Hendrik Swellengrebel by order of the Lords XVII. In August 1742 Valckenier was sent back to Batavia, where he was imprisoned in Fort Batavia and, three months later, tried on several charges, including his involvement in the massacre. In March 1744 he was convicted and condemned to death, and all his belongings were confiscated. In December 1744 the trial was reopened when Valckenier gave a lengthy statement to defend himself. Valckenier asked for more evidence from the Netherlands, but died in his prison cell on 20 June 1751, before the investigation was completed. The death penalty was rescinded posthumously in 1755. Vermeulen characterises the investigation as unfair and fuelled by popular outrage in the Netherlands, and arguably this was officially recognised because in 1760 Valckenier's son, Adriaan Isaäk Valckenier, received reparations totalling 725,000 gulden.|$|E
