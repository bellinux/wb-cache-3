5|$|The player, as Donald, ventures {{through a}} variety of side-scrolling levels. Generally, each level is divided into an <b>overland</b> part and a dungeon, such as the Maharajah's palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides. Although the player may choose any order to play the <b>overland</b> sections, various {{obstacles}} prevent the player from entering the dungeons outside of a specific order. In addition to this, some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections. Once Donald has completed the <b>overland</b> section of an area, he may leave by calling his nephews' biplane, and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return.|$|E

50|$|In January 1841, as a {{business}} venture, Chisholm supplied 5,000 sheep for <b>overlanding</b> from Goulburn to Adelaide, following the Murrumbidgee and Murray rivers. The <b>overlanding</b> party, under the joint command of Henry Inman and Henry Field, were attacked by Aboriginals at the Rufus River on 16 April 1841. All the livestock and equipment was lost, the overlanders narrowly escaping with their lives.|$|R

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed in the northern Bay of Bengal on June 6 and developed into a depression the next day as it drifted to the north, moving over south of the Ganges Delta. The depression reversed its course <b>overland,</b> reemerging into the Bay of Bengal on June 8. Once over water, the depression intensified into a cyclonic storm {{on the morning of}} June 9. The cyclone's motion shifted to the northwest and it made a second landfall near Balasore in northern Orissa that night. The cyclone quickly weakened to a deep depression <b>overland</b> and tracked to the west over central India, where it degenerated into a broad area of {{low pressure}} on June 11.|$|E
5|$|Around 10:00pm {{local time}} on 4January, {{the centre of}} Tropical Cyclone Helen made {{landfall}} near Channel Point. As it moved ashore, the storm developed an eye; however, this feature began breaking apart once <b>overland</b> and the eyewall merged into the system's feeder bands. Roughly 12hours after landfall, Helen weakened to a tropical low before moving over the Gulf of Carpentaria late on 5January. Due {{to an increase in}} forward motion, the system was unable to regenerate sufficient convection to be reclassified a tropical cyclone before making a second landfall along the Cape York Peninsula. Once <b>overland</b> again, the remnants of Helen abruptly slowed and were last noted on 7January in the same region.|$|E
50|$|In 1873, 5,000 sheep were <b>overlanded</b> from Adelaide by Alfred Giles for {{distribution}} to Telegraph Stations along the line. During 1877 and 1878 Alfred Giles and Arthur Giles <b>overlanded</b> stock for W. J. Browne to the Katherine River. On the 1878 journey Frank Withall, a young Englishman, was {{included on the}} suggestion of Browne to gather some colonial experience. Alfred Giles later started Springvale, Delamere and the Newcastle Waters runs.|$|R
50|$|In 1893, Lindsay <b>overlanded</b> camels to Coolgardie after news of gold discoveries there, {{and sold}} them at a profit.|$|R
50|$|Alfred Giles {{made use}} of the {{reservoir}} when <b>overlanding</b> 4,000 cattle and 8,000 sheep to establish Springvale Station near Katherine in 1879.|$|R
5|$|As the American {{troops were}} {{attempting}} to destroy Shōji's force, Vandegrift ordered Carlson's raiders to march <b>overland</b> from Aola Bay toward Koli Point to cut off any of Shōji's forces that escaped the encirclement attempt. On 5 November, two transport ships headed for Espiritu Santo to pick up three companies from Carlson's battalion while Carlson prepared his two companies already on Guadalcanal to march <b>overland</b> towards Koli Point. Carlson arranged for rear echelon personnel at Aola to resupply his patrol with rations every four days at a prearranged point on the coast. A patrol with native carriers would meet the boat and manpack the supplies inland to Carlson's patrol base.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative <b>overland</b> road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported <b>overland</b> by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese when referring to Southeast Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{hurricane}} weakened to {{a tropical storm}} again on October 14 as it moved <b>overland,</b> and began to curve north-northwest, restrengthening to a major hurricane by October 17 while it was west-southwest of Cuba. The hurricane made landfall over Cuba {{on the evening of}} October 17. The hurricane passed over southern Florida near Pigeon Key and Downtown Miami on October 18. The hurricane continued traveling north-northwest; however, it was forced to re-curve south-southwest, {{as a result of a}} high-pressure area. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm <b>overland,</b> eventually becoming a tropical depression. The system meandered into the Gulf of Mexico, making a final landfall in Central America on October 23.|$|E

50|$|The Glossolalia debate (Tungetaledebatten) was a {{literary}} debate on modernist poetry in Norway in the 1950s. The debate started with Arnulf <b>Øverland's</b> nationwide touring with the speech Tungetale fra Parnasset (Glossolalia from the Parnassus) in 1953, characterizing modernist literature as babble and nonsense. His talk {{was published in}} Arbeiderbladet in 1954, and resulted in a fierce debate. Among the defenders of modernist poetry were Odd Solumsmoen, Olav Dalgard and Paal Brekke, while poet and literary critic André Bjerke joined <b>Øverland's</b> criticism.|$|R
5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy <b>overland</b> route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over which side to take. This argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different <b>overland</b> routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E

50|$|For {{the next}} eight years Baxter was to {{accompany}} Eyre through nearly every one of his pastoralist, livestock <b>overlanding,</b> and exploration endeavours, most usually as his faithful overseer and best friend, but sometimes as a partner. For example, Baxter brought 60 head of his own cattle in the herd that he and Eyre <b>overlanded</b> to Adelaide, arriving July 1838. In 1840 Baxter and Eyre were equal minority shareholders in the special survey that led to settlement of the Clare Valley, holding adjacent sections of land.|$|R
2500|$|A droving {{record was}} set by William Philips in 1906 who <b>overlanded</b> 1,260 {{bullocks}} from Wave Hill some [...] to Burrendilla, near Charleville in just 32 weeks.|$|R
5|$|Such vast cargoes {{would be}} carried by boat {{as far as}} possible, by sea and/or river, and only the {{shortest}} possible distance <b>overland.</b> That is because transport on water was far more economical than on land (as it remains today, although the differential is smaller).|$|E
5|$|The Landing at Nadzab was an {{airborne}} {{landing on}} 5 September 1943 during the New Guinea campaign of World War II {{in conjunction with}} the landing at Lae. The Nadzab action began with a parachute drop at Lae Nadzab Airport, combined with an <b>overland</b> force.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} <b>overland</b> {{transportation}} corridors {{in the future}} state of Michigan were the Indian trails. None of these followed {{the path of the}} modern I-69 however.|$|E
50|$|Another famous drove is by William Philips in 1906 who <b>overlanded</b> 1,260 {{bullocks}} from Wave Hill Station some 2100 mi to Burrendilla, near Charleville in just 32 weeks.|$|R
50|$|In 1920 it {{was owned}} by Ben Copley who was running cattle. Copley also owned Karbar Station near Yalgoo and had <b>overlanded</b> herds for the 600 mi journey.|$|R
50|$|Cattle {{were first}} <b>overlanded</b> across the range in 1903. Leaving from Fitzroy Crossing {{and used to}} stock Mount Barnett Station, the trip took over six weeks to complete.|$|R
5|$|The {{first major}} <b>overland</b> {{transportation}} corridors {{in the future}} state of Michigan were the Indian trails. Only one of these followed part of the path of US31; the Mackinac Trail roughly paralleled the route of US31 from Petoskey northward.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Goliad {{meant that}} Cos lost his means of {{communicating}} with Copano Bay, the closest port to Béxar. The Mexican troops garrisoned at Béxar would now need to get supplies and reinforcements <b>overland.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{force of}} commandos landed to destroy {{machinery}} and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank, set ablaze, or immobilised {{virtually all the}} small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England; the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape <b>overland.</b> Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they were surrounded and captured by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire.|$|E
50|$|European pastoralists first {{occupied}} {{the region in}} the 1840s. Among the first pioneers was Fred Handcock, who <b>overlanded</b> livestock from New South Wales, and lost his life there in 1847.|$|R
2500|$|... 20,000 head {{of cattle}} were removed from Wave Hill and <b>overlanded</b> to Killarney Station, near Narrabri in New South Wales, in 1904. The {{remarkable}} feat of droving took 18 months to complete.|$|R
50|$|Hamilton {{came from}} an old Herefordshire family and as a youth was educated at Harrow School before serving as {{midshipman}} in the Royal Navy. Farming was his major interest when he emigrated to Australia, firstly to Sydney, before <b>overlanding</b> sheep to Port Phillip, Victoria. He then participated in <b>overlanding</b> a herd of cattle to South Australia in October 1839, along with close friend E.B. Scott. For {{the next few years}} he combined mixed farming along with his artistic talents, both visual arts and authorship, all of which had considerable merit, but none of which were a resounding success.|$|R
