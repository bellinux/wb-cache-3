25|$|The {{original}} series, titled Magnus, Robot Fighter, 4000 AD, premiered in 1963. It {{was written}} and drawn by Russ Manning, {{and as a}} nod to its influences, included Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics as a quote {{in the beginning of}} the first issue. For the duration of the title's original run, Magnus battled rogue robots, aliens, space pirates and other threats. He fell in love with Leeja Clane, the daughter of one of North Am's senators. Leeja developed limited telepathic abilities after training by M'Ree and other humans who had acquired them as a result <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> being linked together while imprisoned in suspended animation by H8.|$|E
25|$|Every {{single year}} Feyenoord fans {{look forward to}} the club's first {{training}} of the new season. They show up with thousands together and temporary stands are placed around the training pitch. Players signed during the summer will be seen by the fans in public {{for the first time and}} the players take some time to sign autographs after the training. Around the training pitch there are several other activities held before the first and in between the first and second training of the day. No other club in the Netherlands attracts as much supporters towards the first training and the new players are positively surprised every year. Despite finishing 9th in the Eredivisie in the 2006–07 season for instance the first training of the 2007–08 season broke all records when 20,000 fans showed up to support the team and to erase the previous season out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} telepathy is not {{dissimilar}} to two clinical concepts: delusions of thought insertion/removal. This similarity might explain how an individual {{might come to}} the conclusion that they were experiencing telepathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of psychosis, particularly of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or substance-induced psychosis. Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>minds</b> or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic medication. Psychiatrists and clinical psychologists believe and empirical findings support the idea that people with schizotypy and [...] schizotypal personality disorder are particularly likely to believe in telepathy.|$|E

50|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{have two}} essential components: audibility and alienation.
