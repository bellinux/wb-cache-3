5|$|An edition called OGRE: Deluxe Edition was {{released}} in 1987. The rulebook cover artwork was the Denis Loubet illustration that was also used for the Ogre computer game (see Spinoffs below). The board was sturdier than the previous edition's paper map, and the counters were provided with stand-up plastic bases. G.M. magazine's 1989 review of OGRE: Deluxe Edition highlighted the game's ease of introduction and short playing time, but pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> gamers either like the game or loathe it.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, the {{historian}} Boris Rybakov, while analysing miniatures of ancient Russian chronicles, pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of them, from {{the thirteenth century}} onward, display churches with onion domes rather than helmet domes. Nikolay Voronin, the foremost authority on pre-Mongol Russian architecture, seconded his opinion that onion domes existed in Russia {{as early as the}} thirteenth century, although they presumably could not be widespread. These findings demonstrated that Russian onion domes could not be imported from the Orient, where onion domes did not replace spherical domes until the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} remains, as Jona Lendering points <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> {{of the things}} we know about Aspasia are based on mere hypothesis. Thucydides does not mention her; our only sources are the untrustworthy {{representations}} and speculations recorded by men in literature and philosophy, who did not care at all about Aspasia as a historical character. Therefore, in the figure of Aspasia, we get a range of contradictory portrayals; she is either a good wife like Theano or some combination of courtesan and prostitute like Thargelia. This is the reason modern scholars express their scepticism about the historicity of Aspasia's life.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid {{was born}} in Northumbria in about 633. James Fraser argues that Wilfrid's family were aristocrats from Deira, {{pointing}} <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of Wilfrid's early contacts were from that area. A conflict with his stepmother {{when he was about}} 14 years old drove Wilfrid to leave home, probably without his father's consent. Wilfrid's background is never explicitly described as noble, but the king's retainers were frequent guests at his father's house, and on leaving home Wilfrid equipped his party with horses and clothes fit for a royal court.|$|E

5|$|With {{the score}} tied 10–10, Buccaneer linebacker Cal Peterson {{suffered}} a career-ending injury untouched when his knee gave out while running in an interception {{for what would}} have been a touchdown. Lee Roy Selmon also suffered a season-ending knee injury. After taking a 13–10 lead on a Dave Green field goal, the injury-riddled Buccaneers were doomed by an 18½ minute span in which the Broncos scored 38 points. Coach McKay accused Broncos coach John Ralston of running up the score and stormed off of the field, refusing to shake hands with him after the game. He later referred to Ralston as a “horse’s ass” and said, “I don’t like any part of him. His day is coming”. Ralston responded by pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the Broncos points came on fumble recoveries and interceptions. McKay later revealed his thoughts on the team’s likely high draft position, saying “This team needs a catalyst. Ricky Bell can run through a wall”.|$|E
5|$|As the {{situation}} for the Swedish army in Pomerania deteriorated {{during the winter of}} 1675–76, the fleet, with Kronan as flagship, was ordered to sea again {{in a desperate attempt to}} relieve the hard-pressed Swedish land forces. The weather was unusually cold and large parts of the Baltic were iced in. The fleet, now under the command of the seasoned sea officer Claes Uggla, was blocked by ice when it reached Dalarö on 23 January. The Privy Councilor Erik Lindschöld had been assigned by the King to assist with the expedition, and he came up with the idea of cutting the fleet out of the ice to reach the open sea. Hundreds of local peasants were ordered out to open a narrow channel through the ice with saws and picks to the anchorage at Älvsnabben, more than 20km (12mi) away. On reaching the naval station on 14 February, three weeks later, it turned <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the sea outside the inner skerries was frozen as well. A storm hit the tightly packed ships and the ensuing movement of the ice crushed the hull of the supply vessel Leoparden, sinking it. A Danish force had managed to reach the open waters farther off and observed the immobilized Swedish ships from a distance. When temperatures fell even further, the project was declared hopeless and Lindschöld gave up the attempt.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} against the batmen was largely circumstantial: both {{had been seen}} to possess unusually large amounts of gold soon after the column's return, and both had since bought farming rights, paying cash. Daniel said he had won the money in his possession playing cards, while Wilson claimed to have brought his {{with him when he}} came to Rhodesia. Witnesses confirmed that there had been heavy gambling at Inyati camp, in which Daniel and Wilson had actively taken part, both possessing noticeable reserves in gold sovereigns. Sehuloholu claimed in his statement that both of the men he had met in the rear guard had fluently and perfectly spoken to him in Sindebele, but neither of the accused men knew the language, and {{the only member of the}} column who did at a fluent level was a medical orderly who had never been near the rear guard. The prosecutor proposed that Sehuloholu could be exaggerating the standard of Sindebele spoken by the men he had met, pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> of the phrases quoted were actually relatively basic, and did not imply a profound understanding of the language.|$|E

25|$|The APSAC Task Force {{stated that}} proponents of {{attachment}} therapy correctly point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> critics have never actually observed {{any of the}} treatments they criticize or visited any of the centers where the controversial therapies are practiced.

Holding is described as gentle or nurturing and it is maintained that intense, cathartic approaches are necessary to help children with attachment disorders. Their evidence for this is primarily clinical experience and testimonials.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan in Waters of Life {{connects the}} laws of {{impurity}} to the narrative {{in the beginning of}} Genesis.

One who comes into contact with one of the forms of death must then immerse in water which is described in Genesis as flowing out of the Garden of Eden (the source of life) in order to cleanse oneself of this contact with death (and by extension of sin).|$|E

25|$|The flag design {{shortlist}} was {{met with}} negative response from {{some members of the}} public, professional designers and vexillologists. The selection was lambasted as unappealing, clichéd, dull and too logo-like. There were complaints that the four designs were far too similar to each other, as only one does not feature a large silver fern dividing the field, and two are identical except for a colour choice. The two Lockwood proposals were likened to the design of a beach towel, at least until Lockwood pointed <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> national flags were made into beach towels. Some commentators also felt that the Flag Consideration Panel was never qualified to make an adequate design selection, since none of its members had any credentials or experience in the fields of graphic design, art or vexillology. The panel stated that it consulted vexillologists and designers to ensure that the flags chosen were workable and had no impediments. According to journalist Grant McLachlan, the panel consulted a Nike shoe designer and not any vexillologists.|$|E
500|$|In The C++ Programming Language, Bjarne Stroustrup, on {{the other}} hand, argues that the [...] "apparently raconian {{restriction}} against per-object information in allocators is not particularly serious", pointing <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>most</b> allocators do not need state, and have better performance without it. He mentions three use cases for custom allocators, namely, memory pool allocators, shared memory allocators, and garbage collected memory allocators. He presents an allocator implementation that uses an internal memory pool for fast allocation and deallocation of small chunks of memory, but notes that such an optimization may already be performed by the allocator provided by the implementation.|$|E
