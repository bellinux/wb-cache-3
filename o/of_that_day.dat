While all revolutionaries who attended the meeting were placed under arrest, Ion Heliade Rădulescu and Christian Tell sought refuge at the British consulate in Bucharest, where they were received by Robert Gilmour Colquhoun in exchange for a sum of Austrian florins.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning a}} clear victory, and as pursuit became too {{hazardous}} near Wake, American forces retired. Spruance once again withdrew {{to the east}} to refuel his destroyers and rendezvous with the carrier Saratoga, which was ferrying much-needed replacement aircraft. Fletcher transferred his flag to Saratoga {{on the afternoon of}} 8 June and resumed command of the carrier force. For the remainder <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> and then 9 June, Fletcher continued to launch search missions from the three carriers to ensure the Japanese were no longer advancing on Midway. Late on 10 June a decision was made to leave the area and the American carriers eventually returned to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|He {{scored two}} more {{victories}} on 23 and 28 April, his {{first in the}} North African Campaign. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille was leaning forward the rounds missed him by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter. Just a month later, records show that James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A turning dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.|$|E

5|$|State Highway 34 {{was first}} {{designated}} on June 15, 1931. At that time, the highway {{began at the}} free bridge over the Red River north of Quanah, Texas, and followed what is today SH-6 {{to the point that}} is now SH-34's southern terminus. There, it turned north, following its current alignment. Its 1931 alignment did not differ significantly from that of the present day (although it followed US-66 through Elk City prior to the establishment of I-40) until it got to Woodward. Rather than continue north out of town, the SH-34 <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> instead turned west, then north, passing through Fort Supply and crossing into Harper County just north of that town. It then began a concurrency with US-60 in Buffalo, turning east and connecting with its final segment, bringing it to the Kansas state line. Thus, SH-34 started life as a border-to-border highway.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army Group was not {{directly}} attacked {{during the first}} few days of the invasion, but events to the east and west of its deployment area resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Drava and Danube then the Sava. On 10 April, the crumbling defences of the 4th Army on the left flank of the 1st Army Group had been penetrated by the German 8th Panzer Division, which then turned east and drove into the left flank of the 1st Army Group on the following day. By the end <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> the Germans had effectively routed the 2nd Army Group. Remnants continued to fight along the line of the Sava until early on 14 April, but mass surrenders began that day with tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers being taken into captivity by the Germans during their drive on Sarajevo in the centre of the country. The Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E

5|$|The {{center of}} Henriette made {{landfall}} {{just east of}} Cabo San Lucas {{on the afternoon of}} September 4 with winds of 80mph (130km/h). It was over land for only about six hours before emerging into the Gulf of California. The brief interaction with land caused a slight weakening, but Henriette remained a Category1hurricane for most <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> The next day it made final landfall near Guaymas in the state of Sonora. Henriette weakened quickly over land and dissipated over the mountains of northwestern Mexico early on September 6. The remnants of Tropical Storm Henriette continued to track across west Texas and southeastern New Mexico as it was being absorbed by a cold front moving through New Mexico. The flow of moisture from originating from these remnants, moderate instability, and marginal shear contributed to flash flooding and severe thunderstorms.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} {{form of the}} myth was recounted in the Metamorphoses of Ovid, and the story {{was the subject of}} the most famous work (now lost) of the poet Helvius Cinna. Several alternate versions appeared in the Bibliotheca, the Fabulae of Hyginus, and the Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis, with major variations depicting Myrrha's father as the Assyrian king Theias or depicting Aphrodite as having engineered the tragic liaison. Critical interpretation of the myth has considered Myrrha's refusal of conventional sexual relations to have provoked her incest, with the ensuing transformation to tree as a silencing punishment. It has been suggested that the taboo of incest marks the difference between culture and nature and that Ovid's version of Myrrha showed this. A translation of Ovid's Myrrha, done by English poet John Dryden in 1700, has been interpreted as a critique of the society <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> linking Myrrha to Mary II and Cinyras to James II.|$|E
