25|$|Internal brilliance—the {{percentage}} of incident light reflected {{back to the}} viewer from the rear (pavilion) facets—relies on careful consideration of a cut's interfacial angles {{as they relate to}} diamond's RI.

Two observations can be made: if the pavilion is too shallow, light meets the pavilion facets within the critical angle, and is refracted (i.e., lost) through the pavilion bottom into the air.

40|$|The {{scattering}} of sound by turbulence in a jet shear layer is considered. Spectral broadening or `haystacking' {{is the process}} whereby the turbulent, time-varying inhomogeneities in the flow scatter tonal sound fields, which decreases {{the level of the}} incident tone, but increases the broadband level around the frequency of the tone. The scattering process is modelled analytically, using high-frequency asymptotic methods and a weak-scattering assumption. Analytical models for the far-field spectral density of the scattered field are derived for two cases: (1) any polar angle including inside the cone of silence; (2) polar <b>angles</b> <b>outside</b> the cone of silence. At polar <b>angles</b> <b>outside</b> the cone of silence, the predictions from the two models are very similar, but using the second model it is considerably simpler to evaluate the far-fileld spectral density. Simulation results are compared to experimental data, albeit only at a polar angle of 90 ±. The model correctly predicts the behaviour of the scattered field as a function of jet velocity and tone frequency. Also simulations at other polar angles and a parametric study are presented. These simulations indicate how the `haystacking' is predicted to vary {{as a function of the}} polar angle, and also as a function of the characteristic length, time and convection velocity scales of the turbulence contained in the jet shear layer...|$|R
