5|$|A {{video of}} Franken at the Minnesota State Fair on September 2, 2009, {{engaging}} in a discussion {{with a group of}} Tea Party protesters on health care reform, began circulating on the Internet and soon went viral.

5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} now {{considered to have}} been quadrupedal, some discussion has <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E

5|$|In 1846, the Andover workhouse scandal, where {{conditions}} in the Andover Union Workhouse {{were found to be}} inhumane and dangerous, prompted a government review and the abolition of the Poor Law Commission which was replaced with a Poor Law Board which meant that a Committee of Parliament was to administer the Poor Law, with a cabinet minister as head.

5|$|The typhoon brought {{heavy rain}} and wind to {{areas of the}} Mariana Islands, the Philippines, Taiwan, and {{the east coast of}} China. It was {{responsible}} for 458 deaths and $2.5billion (2006USD) in damage. Saomai affected many of the same areas affected by Tropical Storm Bilis a month earlier, and the China Meteorological Administration reported that Saomai was the strongest typhoon that ever <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> China's offshore region as well as the most powerful typhoon ever to make landfall over Mainland China.|$|E
5|$|Under Napoleon, a new {{emphasis}} towards the destruction, not just outmanoeuvring, of enemy armies emerged. Invasions of enemy territory <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> broader fronts which made wars costlier and more decisive. The political effect of war increased; defeat for a European power meant {{more than the}} loss of isolated enclaves. Near-Carthaginian peaces intertwined whole national efforts, intensifying the Revolutionary phenomenon of total war.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> the course of billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|With unity as an {{essential}} teaching of the religion, Bahá'ís follow an administration they believe is divinely ordained, and therefore see attempts to create schisms and divisions as efforts that are contrary to the teachings of Bahá'u'lláh. Schisms have <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> the succession of authority, but any Bahá'í divisions have had relatively little success and have failed to attract a sizeable following. The followers of such divisions are regarded as Covenant-breakers and shunned, essentially excommunicated.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the central}} island <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> a drawbridge, through a pair of {{gatehouse}}s on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, probably {{for the use of the}} castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, remnant moisture from Rick enhanced a strong cold front over the Great Plains of the United States. Severe thunderstorms <b>occurred</b> <b>over</b> parts of the southern states, with at least three tornadoes touching down in Louisiana. Further north, the complex brought heavy rainfall to the northeast and parts of southern Canada. In Louisiana, the storm system spawned seven tornadoes, two of which were ranked as EF-1. One of these tornadoes damaged more than 10structures, destroyed a grain silo, flipped a tractor trailer and left numerous residents without power. In all, the tornadoes left nearly $1million in losses and injured one person.|$|E
