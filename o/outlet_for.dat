5|$|When the {{existence}} of the tapes was first publicly reported in July 1973, Williams was planning to ask Apple for at least £100,000. Williams said he later met with George Harrison and Starr to offer the tapes for £5000, but they declined, citing financial difficulties at the time. Williams and Taylor teamed up with Paul Murphy, head of Buk Records, to find an <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> the tapes.|$|E

5|$|A cube-shaped {{concrete}} {{building was}} constructed {{on the top}} of the hill, next to the dome. This was intended to be used as the bomb-proof <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> a ventilation and air conditioning shaft. It was an essential component of a facility where dangerous and explosive gases were expected to be used in large quantities on a daily basis. It was never finished, and the Allies found when they captured the site that the ventilation shaft had not been fully excavated. The building survived the bombing intact and is still prominently visible today.|$|E
5|$|Creekside, a {{regeneration}} area beside Deptford Creek, {{is used for}} educational and artistic purposes, such as the Laban Dance Centre, which was designed by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, and opened in February 2003; and the Art in Perpetuity Trust (APT) gallery and studio space.

5|$|For {{commercial}} use, varieties with {{a minimum}} stem length of 30cm are sought, making them ideal for cut flowers. Florists require blooms that only open when they reach the retail <b>outlet.</b> <b>For</b> garden plants the objectives are to continually expand the colour palette and to produce hardy forms, {{and there is a}} particular demand for miniature varieties. The cultivars so produced tend to be larger and more robust than the wild types. The main species used in breeding are N. bulbocodium, N. cyclamineus, N. jonquilla, N. poeticus, N. pseudonarcissus, N. serotinus and N. tazetta.|$|E

5|$|From 1800 to 1847, Banagher {{enjoyed a}} period of {{prosperity}} unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long {{been one of the}} chief agricultural activities of the district and the opening of the Grand Canal {{at the end of the}} 18th century gave easy access to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> the grain raised in a wide area round the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, it {{was decided}} to develop the Port of Ploče, as the site {{at the mouth of the}} Neretva on the Adriatic coast {{represented}} the natural <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was then part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Preparations included the construction of a railway between Metković and Ploče, as an extension of the railway from Sarajevo. The railway was completed in 1942, three years after construction of the port commenced in 1939. The works were delayed by the onset of World War II, but they were intensified in 1945 after modernization of the SarajevoPloče narrow gauge railway.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ball began a {{short-lived}} engagement to Dot Allbourne (or Ellbourne), {{though he was}} still interested in other girls such as Thelma Starr.

He paid to undertake pilot training in his own time at the Ruffy-Baumann School, which charged £75 to £100 for instruction (£5,580 to £7,440 in 2010 prices).|$|E

5|$|Like their {{previous}} tours, The Joshua Tree Tour was a minimalistic, austere production, and U2 used this <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> addressing {{political and social}} concerns. One such issue was Arizona Governor Evan Mecham's canceling the state's observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Throughout the tour, the group continued to explore American roots music: they collaborated with folk artist Bob Dylan, blues musician B. B. King, and Harlem's New Voices of Freedom gospel choir; U2 also visited Graceland and Sun Studios in Memphis, where they recorded new material. These new songs and the band's experiences on tour were documented for the 1988 Rattle and Hum album and Phil Joanou-directed motion picture.|$|E
5|$|Queen's University has a {{joint venture}} with McGill University, {{operating}} an academic publishing house known as the McGill-Queen's University Press. It publishes original peer-reviewed and books in all areas of the social sciences and humanities.

The press has over 2,800 books in print. The publishing house was known as the McGill University Press in 1963 prior to it amalgamating with Queen's in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The K Foundation {{was an art}} {{foundation}} set up by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty (The KLF) in 1993, {{following their}} 'retirement' from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> the duo's post-retirement KLF income. Between 1993 and 1995, they spent this money {{in a number of}} ways, including on a series of Situationist-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world, focusing in particular on the Turner Prize. Most notoriously, when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through, they burned a million pounds in cash.|$|E

5|$|But geology also {{provided}} an alternate route, albeit across foreign territory. The valleys of the Red and Minnesota Rivers {{lay in the}} beds of Glacial Lake Agassiz and its prehistoric outlet Glacial River Warren; the lands exposed when these bodies of water receded were flat plains between low uplands covered by prairie grasslands. At the Traverse Gap, only a mile (1.6 km) of land separated the Bois des Sioux River, a source stream of the Red (which flowed north to Hudson Bay) and the Little Minnesota River, a source stream of the Minnesota River (tributary to the Mississippi, which flowed south to the Gulf of Mexico). The valley floors and uplands of the watercourses along this gently graded route provided a natural thoroughfare to the south. The eyes of the colonists therefore turned to the new United States, both {{as a source of}} supplies and an (illegal) <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> their furs.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{an admirer}} of the elegance and wit {{in the work of}} satirical French writers and artists of the eighteenth century, and often {{employed}} grotesques in his descriptions to ridicule the ostentation of colonial aristocracy. Examples include Ti Noel's comparison of wax heads at a barber's shop to white men's heads being served at a banquet, or the portrayal of the decadence of Mademoiselle Floridor, a fourth-rate actress who performs for slaves as an <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> her desire to act. Carpentier further satirizes the pomp of those in power through a series of details of protocol and ceremony whose cumulative effects ridicule the object of description, {{as is the case with}} Henri Christophe's chambers.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{a teacher at the}} ICY, White closely collaborated with Octavius Catto, an {{important}} civil rights activist and long-time friend of White's who shared a similar social group and views on education. Both men, former cricket players at the ICY, believed baseball was another <b>outlet</b> <b>for</b> African Americans to promote social reform and prove their right for full citizenship. In the spring of 1866, White and Catto established the Philadelphia Pythians, a baseball club composed mainly of men from the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization. Catto, a hard-hitting shortstop and second baseman, was the de facto captain on the field, while White became the team's secretary, responsible for scheduling games, arranging festivities, and recording statistics. Soon, Pythian games became a popular fixture of the black community.|$|E
