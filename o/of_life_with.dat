In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>With</b> adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>with</b> better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E

5|$|It {{is likely}} that a multicomponent, {{adaptive}} immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response. Many species, however, utilize mechanisms {{that appear to be}} precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity. Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>with</b> bacteria using a unique defense mechanism, called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens, called bacteriophages. Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity, through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past, which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference. Prokaryotes also possess other defense mechanisms. Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes, but studies of their roles in defense are few.|$|E

However, there is remarkably little systematic data available regarding the applicability and inter-rater {{reliability of the}} available tools. What little data is available is often gathered by research teams with significant experience in rating the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> people <b>with</b> dementia.

5|$|S. Sivasekaram's 1980 Tamil poem Ahalikai {{examines}} the stone motif in Ahalya's tale: she marries {{a husband who}} is no more interested in her than a stone and briefly encounters joy with Indra, only to end up cursed to become a lifeless stone. The poet asks if it was better for Ahalya to remain physically a stone and retain her dignity rather than return to a stony marriage. Uyir Maga ("Life-woman") by the Tamil poet Na. Pichamurthy (1900–76) presents Ahalya as an allegorical representation <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>with</b> Gautama as the mind and Indra pleasure. The Marxist critic Kovai Gnani, in his poem Kallihai, represents Ahalya as the oppressed class and Rama as an ideal future without exploitation. Gautama and Indra represent feudalism and capitalism. The character of Ahalya played by Kamala Kotnis in the 1949 movie Sati Ahalya ("chaste Ahalya") was described as still relevant by contemporary film critics due to its portrayal of the predicament of a stained woman.|$|E

The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.|$|E
40|$|Objective: In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in the study and evaluation of the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for people <b>with</b> schizophrenia. The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a comprehensive literature review on the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for people <b>with</b> schizophrenia who are living in the community. Method: An integrative literature review was undertaken to review literature in the field of medical/mental health in relevant databases. Results: A total of 21 studies were reviewed and categorised according to three themes identified from the literature: the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and socio-demographic characteristics of people with schizophrenia; the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> people <b>with</b> schizophrenia internationally; and the quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> people <b>with</b> schizophrenia in cross-cultural studies. Conclusion: Quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> for people <b>with</b> schizophrenia depends on many factors, including cultural and econontic factors, homogeneity of the society, traditional role of the family, social support, and availability of the mental health services. Recommendations for further studies, particularly in the Arab world, are made...|$|R

5|$|The Welsh Mountain sheep is a {{hardy breed}} that can scrape {{a living from}} the mountainous {{habitats}} where they spend the whole year. Being adept at exploiting their environment, they have local knowledge of their mountains and are {{left to their own}} devices, being gathered once or twice a year. Originally often horned, and various shades of brown or black, they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance. More recently, scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of the world. They form part of the ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in Wales, the Llanwenog, the Lleyn sheep, the Kerry Hill, the badger-faced, the Welsh mule and the Beulah speckle-faced. In rural areas, sheep are still an important part <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>with</b> local livestock shows and sheep dog trials taking place annually.|$|E
5|$|Gerber set out {{to expand}} the Society's {{membership}} beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support {{of people in the}} medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for forbidden fruit was the real spice <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>With</b> this argument, they rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such resistance from our own people. Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort. The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.|$|E
5|$|In frogs, the {{hind legs}} {{are larger than}} the fore legs, {{especially}} so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>with</b> webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and {{more or less the}} same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish. Some salamanders in the genus Aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails. In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.|$|E

5|$|The {{deepening}} {{economic crisis}} caused a marked deterioration in {{quality of life}} of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> <b>with</b> ration cards (kartki) necessary to buy basic consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit policies to the de facto bankrupt Polish government, access to goods the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the available scarce resources of Western currency had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and increased to US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by continuing to maintain a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing black market {{and the development of a}} shortage economy. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by phenomena such as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration in the areas of biological environment and physical and mental health, which included steadily increasing mortality rates. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.|$|E
