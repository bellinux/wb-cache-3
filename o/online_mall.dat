40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this work is to test several {{incentive}} strategies for attaining new customers via electronic referrals, or e-referrals. The paper aims to examine: the roles of both {{the magnitude of the}} incentive offered to the sender and the magnitude of the incentive offered to the receiver; and the effect of equity versus inequity of financial incentives for the two parties. Design/methodology/approach: The study consisted of a large-scale field experiment conducted with 45, 000 members of an <b>online</b> <b>mall.</b> The participants were divided into eight conditions in an incomplete two-factor 4 x 4 between-subjects design, where not every combination of incentive magnitudes was utilized and the magnitude of the incentive offered the receiver and sender varied in size such that sometimes rewards were equal, sometimes receivers of the e-referral had larger rewards, and sometimes senders of the e-referral s received more. Dependent measures included the number of e-referrals sent, the number of those e-referrals that lead to a new customer registering, and the number of new registrants that converted to buyers from completing a purchase. Findings: The results demonstrate that both the magnitude of financial incentives, and the relative magnitude of the incentives for the senders and receivers both influence e-referral rates. Specifically, it was found that offering higher incentives to senders and receivers led to an increase in referral invitations sent, new member sign-ups and new buyers. It was also found that the disparity between incentives offered to senders and receivers affected e-referral rates and that inequity should favor the sender to enhance results. Originality/value: This paper offers marketers valuable insights as to how different combinations of financial incentives to receivers and senders can affect e-referral rates. The findings suggest that potential referrers respond not only to referral incentives but also to the disparity between their incentives and the receivers 2 ̆ 7 incentives...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by the premise that online consumers can make a purchase {{at any time of}} day if they have even a tiny time slot along with Internet access. Given the increased shopping time flexibility, we first examine the patterns of online purchase timing at an <b>online</b> shopping <b>mall</b> handling diverse products (e. g., Amazon. com). The results show (1) the breakdown of purchase timing regularity and (2) the change of weekly spike purchase occurrence. Second, we build online inter-purchase time and price promotion utilization models and estimate them with the data collected from one of the premier <b>online</b> shopping <b>malls</b> in Korea. We find that <b>online</b> shopping <b>malls</b> need to start marketing activities immediately after a transaction because as inter-purchase time increase the likelihood of another transaction substantially drops. We also find three effects of a price promotion: (1) a price promotion can directly induce consumers to purchase any items sooner than necessary, (2) consumers who take advantage of a price promotion at the current transaction are likely to accelerate next purchase time (indirect effects of price promotion), and (3) online consumers experiencing a pric...|$|R
