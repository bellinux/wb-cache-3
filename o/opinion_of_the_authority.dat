40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the changes in decision-making of ten-year old children under the influence of peer interaction. We tried to determine whether there were differences in the decision-making process when children made their decisions in a group, as opposed to the situation when they decided individually. In the first phase of the study (which included individual decision-making), 139 fourth-graders were tested. Based on their responses we formed 10 triads in the experimental group. The control group consisted of 31 children with the response structure equivalent to the initial response structure in the experimental group. In the second phase, children in the control group once again decided individually, while children in the experimental group made a group decision. We found that subjects in the control group retained their previous decisions, while children in the experimental group changed their initial decisions under the influence of peers, so that their decisions became less risky. This finding may be ascribed to the context in which the research was conducted (school), but also to the content of the task used. Qualitative analysis of social interaction enabled us to understand the dynamics of group decision-making. We found several mechanisms that explain how children change their initial decision in the triad (reference to the <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>authority,</b> conversational passivity, majority rule, etc.), and how they retain their decision (conversational activity and argumentation) ...|$|E
40|$|Early in 1996 it was {{reported}} that groundwater contamination in the form of volatile organic chemicals had been found in several private wells in an area immediately adjacent to the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) in Upton, New York. Information released by BNL and their consulting hydrologists indicates {{that there should be no}} threat to the Authority's downgradient well fields located in Mastic as a result of said contamination. This is due to the remediation efforts undertaken by BNL at the site of its facilities to contain groundwater within such site and the distance between the sources of contaminants and their location relative to the Authority's well fields. The Authority has not encountered any such contamination in the Mastic well fields. The Authority will utilize all the data that is available from the study of this contamination in the siting of future wells, which should prevent any negative impact on those future water sources. As a result of the events described above, BNL, through the Federal Department of Energy, approached the Authority to supply residents in the areas surrounding the BNL complex and contracted with the Authority to pay for the cost of the extension of water mains into such areas and the connections of homes to the System. In early 1997, it {{was reported}} that radionuclides in the form of tritium were discovered on the grounds of BNL. Consequently, the Authority has been closely monitoring all public wells in the vicinity of BNL through independent and frequent testing. Testing for radionuclides is being performed by two independent certified laboratories to ensure the accuracy of the results. To date, all well testing has shown no contamination from BNL. While minute traces of some radionuclides were detected in some samples, they were found at levels thought to be indistinguishable from naturally-occurring background levels, and thus, not the result of events at BNL. The Authority has also established emergency procedures to ensure that no contamination may enter the public water supply. As a result of the discovery of tritium, BNL, through the Federal Department of Energy, again approached the Authority to supply residents in an area surrounding the BNL complex and contracted with the Authority to pay for the cost of further extending water mains into such area and the connections of homes to the System. Taken together with the other extensions, the Authority extended approximately 163, 150 feet of water main into the areas surrounding the BNL complex and will have increased its customer base by approximately 1, 400 connections. It is the <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Authority</b> that these groundwater contaminations will not have an adverse financial impact of its operations or its financial condition...|$|E
