500|$|The {{ceremony}} was identified by some commentators as precipitating a new {{mood in the}} United Kingdom: it [...] "had barely finished before {{it had become a}} byword for a new approach, not only to British culture but to Britishness itself. Politicians would soon be referring to it, using it as shorthand for a new kind of patriotism that does not lament a vanished Britain but loves the country that has changed. Boyle's {{ceremony was}} hailed from (almost) all sides...for providing a nation that had grown used to mocking its myriad flaws with a new, unfamiliarly positive view of itself ... It was, perhaps, this lack of cynicism that people responded to ... So used to British irony and detachment, it felt refreshing to witness an unembarrassed, positive case for this country. Boyle himself says this {{was the most important thing}} he took away from the Olympic experience: [...] "How important it is to believe in something. You might make a fool <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> people will go, 'How can you believe in that, you stupid idiot?' But if you believe in something, you carry people with you." ...|$|E
500|$|Most reviewers {{criticized the}} quality of its cameras, {{particularly}} due to their resolution in comparison to contemporaneous mobile phones. They considered them sufficient for the DSi's screens, however. Harris and Lowe believed that the camera's only use was to take [...] "silly pictures <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> others". They complained about the difficulty of taking photographs in low-light environments, and said that low-light images were tinged green or blue. Opinions on the DSi's photograph-editing tools were varied: Bit-techs Martin and Reid considered them to be a gimmick, but Bakalar and Cliff Edwards of BusinessWeek thought otherwise. Edwards said that the camera's use in gameplay was a new opportunity for developers; Martin did not think that the concept would be widely adopted, as he believed it to be [...] "a gimmick that would alienate [...] DS Lite owners". Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell speculated that the DSi follows Game & Watch and Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi's philosophy of using dated technology developers are familiar with to introduce new game design concepts that are inexpensive enough for mass production at a profit. He argued its features are designed to [...] "briefly entertain" [...] early adopters while encouraging [...] "developers to consider it as an alternative [...] " [...] to build an attractive game library for the long term.|$|E

2500|$|Springer {{was hired}} as a {{political}} reporter and commentator on Cincinnati's NBC affiliate, WLWT, which had, at the time, the lowest-rated news program. Later, having been named primary news anchor and Managing Editor, he needed a broadcast catchphrase in the model of other great newsmen. With the help of some others at WLWT, he created his signature line: [...] "Take care <b>of</b> <b>yourself,</b> <b>and</b> each other." [...] Within two years he was Cincinnati's number-one news anchor, along with partner Norma Rashid. For five years, he was the most popular one in the city, garnering ten local Emmy Awards for his nightly commentaries, which were frequently satirized by Cincinnati radio personality Gary Burbank. Those commentaries would eventually become his [...] "Final Thought" [...] on Springer. Springer would remain commentator at WLWT until January 1993. He resided in Loveland, Ohio, during this time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1778, Hicks {{helped to}} build the Friends meeting house in Jericho, which remains a place of Quaker worship. Hicks preached {{actively}} in Quaker meeting, and by 1778 he was acknowledged as a recorded minister. Hicks {{was regarded as a}} gifted speaker with a strong voice and dramatic flair. He drew large crowds when he was said to be attending meetings, sometimes in the thousands. In November 1829, the young Walt Whitman heard Hicks preach at Morrison's Hotel in Brooklyn, and later said, [...] "Always Elias Hicks gives the service of pointing to the fountain of all naked theology, all religion, all worship, all the truth to which you are possibly eligible—namely in yourself and your inherent relations. Others talk of Bibles, saints, churches, exhortations, vicarious atonements—the canons outside <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> apart from man—Elias Hicks points to the religion inside of man's very own nature. This he incessantly labors to kindle, nourish, educate, bring forward and strengthen." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, it {{does not}} appear that Crowley waited for Reuss's {{response}} to assume his duties. In a diary entry for November 27, 1921, Crowley wrote: [...] "I have proclaimed myself O.H.O. Frater Superior of the Order of Oriental Templars." [...] Reuss died on October 28, 1923. In a letter to Heinrich Tränker dated February 14, 1925, Crowley stated the following: [...] "Reuss was very uncertain in temper, and in many ways unreliable. In his last years he seems to have completely lost his grip, even accusing The Book of the Law of communistic tendencies, than which no statement could be more absurd. Yet it seems that he must have been to some extent correctly led, on account of his having made the appointments <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones), and designating me in his last letter as his successor." [...] In a letter to Charles Stansfeld Jones dated Sun in Capricorn, Anno XX (Dec. 1924 - Jan. 1925), Crowley said, [...] "in the O.H.O.'s last letter to me he invited me to become his successor as O.H.O. and Frater Superior." [...] Reuss's letter designating Crowley his successor as O.H.O. has not been found, but no credible documentation has surfaced which would indicate that Reuss ever designated any alternative successor.|$|E

2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to acknowledge that there is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet <b>of</b> <b>yourself</b> <b>and</b> everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
