5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hot {{water that}} is {{comfortable}} for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria. Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 C). However, warm, soapy water {{is more effective than}} cold, soapy water at removing the natural oils <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> which hold soils and bacteria. Contrary to popular belief however, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on hands.|$|E
25|$|Preventative {{measures}} one {{can take}} to help {{prevent the spread of}} the disease include washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing food.

2500|$|In 1978, McCotter {{was criticized}} in the Des Moines Sunday Register for a {{statement}} he made during a sermon about child rearing. The sermon {{was based upon}} the Bible verse Proverbs 20:30 ("Blows that wound cleanse away evil; strokes make clean the innermost parts.") In it, McCotter said, [...] "When you discipline, this verse indicates, as others do, {{that you want to}} do it so it wounds. Now, when you say ‘wounds,’ it doesn’t mean that you have a bloody mess <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> necessarily. It doesn’t mean that you have a child ‘wounding’ like he has a broken leg.... And he may, and often will be, black and blue. My children have been many times. And it cleans evil from them." ...|$|E
