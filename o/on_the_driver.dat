5|$|Eladio escapes as he {{is being}} deported, killing a truck driver in the process. A {{clinical}} exam <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> shows his death {{was caused by a}} rapid growth of Trichophyton — the Athlete's foot fungus. Scully brings samples of the fatal fungi to a mycologist who discovers that their abnormally rapid growth was caused by an unidentifiable enzyme. This revelation leads Scully to suspect Eladio of being an unwitting carrier of the enzyme, necessitating his immediate capture. Eladio, seeking to return to Mexico, meets with his cousin Gabrielle to ask for money. He works with a construction foreman for the day to make the money. Soledad comes after him, seeking to kill him, but finds the foreman dead. Eladio escapes in the foreman's truck and heads to the grocery store where Gabrielle works, spreading the fungal growth. The agents later confront Soledad at the supermarket, discovering another dead victim of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{damage was}} {{reported}} in coastal areas of Grand Bahama Island, with widespread destruction of roofs and vehicles, along with downed poles and trees. Power and telephone services were disrupted throughout the island. A total of 400structures sustained damage, of which about 200commercial buildings were severely damaged and recommended by engineers not to be repaired. Among the destroyed buildings were a police station on the western end and several buildings in Freeport. More than 500automobiles were flooded, including five police cars. The storm surge also raised 54corpses in five graveyards on the island. Several resorts were closed {{for an extended period}} of time, all on the western portion of the island. One hotel, the Xanadu Beach and Marine Resort, reported about $3.5million in damage (2005USD), including numerous destroyed windows designed to withstand hurricane-force winds. Further to the east, numerous houses and commercial buildings lost their roofs in the city of Freeport. One serious traffic accident occurred when the winds overturned a bus, inflicting injuries <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> Several other traffic accidents were reported in the area, although none were severe. During the passage of the hurricane, five cases of looting were reported, of which one person was caught in the process. Storm surge from the hurricane killed one child, the only casualty directly related to Wilma in the archipelago.|$|E

30|$|In {{the fatigue}} driving {{detection}} methods, there are mainly based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> physiological signal detection, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> operation behavior and vehicle state detection, and based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver’s</b> facial expression detection. Most {{of these tests}} rely on image processing technology to get driver’s fatigue characteristic data. Therefore, this paper analyzes and studies the key technology of anti-fatigue driving based on image recognition and improves the common key technology. Finally, the eye fatigue data of drivers during driving are collected through experiments. The improved key technologies are applied to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} technology.|$|R

25|$|The 2010, 2012, and 2013 models lacked an {{interior}} trunk release mechanism. The trunk was only accessible using the key fob (Remote Keyless Entry) or a touch sensor between the trunk lid and the license plate. The 2011 year model added a remote release button {{at the left}} of the steering wheel on the instrument panel. The 2014 model refresh returned the trunk release button to LaCrosse but placed it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> door.|$|E
25|$|In response, Bone {{decided to}} speed up the relay and {{authorized}} additional drivers for Seppala's leg of the relay, so they could travel without rest. Seppala was still scheduled to cover the most dangerous leg, the shortcut across Norton Sound, but the telephone and telegraph systems bypassed the small villages he was passing through, {{and there was no way}} to tell him to wait at Shaktoolik. The plan relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> from the north catching Seppala on the trail. Summers arranged for drivers along the last leg, including Seppala's colleague Gunnar Kaasen.|$|E

Also, the optional Intelligent Parking Assist system supports steering operations when parallel parking and backing into a parking space. Ultrasonic sensors installed on the front of the vehicle detect other parked vehicles and, based on the results, estimate the physical dimensions of a vacant parking space and set the target parking position.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 2008, the Japanese-spec Legacy can {{be fitted}} with a new {{collision}} avoidance feature, called EyeSight. It consists of twin CCD cameras, {{one on each side}} of the rear view mirror, that use human-like stereoscopic vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver.</b> The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a lane departure warning system, a driver alert warning for various safety situations, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. SI-Cruise has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.|$|E
25|$|Two demonstrator/prototype INNOVIA ART 100 {{cars were}} built {{and used for}} testing at the UTDC urban transit {{facility}} Millhaven, Ontario. Unlike the production cars, the demo cars lacked doors {{at either end of}} the vehicle. Test Vehicle 1 had windows in the centre and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> cab, while Test Vehicle 2 is a trailer car only had a centre window and no driver's cab. The paint scheme on the lead car was orange and white, while the trailer was grey and orange. The interior of the vehicle was unfinished (no seats, incomplete floor/ceiling and plywood panelling covering wiring). Only Test Vehicle 2 remained at the facility and in 2011 it was donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa.|$|E

25|$|On October 17, Labonte {{announced}} the GEICO 500 {{is to be}} his 890th and final start. To commemorate the occasion, Go Fas Racing designed a car split into three designs: the Kellogg's design from his 1996 title run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> side, the Piedmont Airlines design from his 1984 championship year on the passenger side, and the Duck Industries design from his early career in the center. However, NASCAR did not allow the scheme, due to a rule stating cars must have the same colors on both the driver side and passenger {{side of the car}} for safety reasons; the team would switch to the former design, while being allowed to retain the center. Labonte qualified ninth, but because of the unapproved paint scheme, was forced to start {{at the tail end of}} the field. He would finish in thirty-third place, one lap down in his final race.|$|E
25|$|The load that {{a driver}} {{presents}} to an amplifier {{consists of a}} complex electrical impedance—a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), {{and the effects of}} air loading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{purchased}} his own Evel Knievel gloves {{at his own}} yard sale. He {{decides to}} use the family car to jump over a row of cars, but is unsuccessful and results in his drivers license being revoked by Joe. Lois arranges for Meg to become Peter's personal driver, and he makes numerous attempts to annoy Meg, including setting her hat on fire when traveling with his friends. When another car rear ends her and she is insulted by the driver, Meg takes out her repressed rage with Peter <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> by beating him up; Peter is impressed, and the two bond in the car. In the end, Joe stops by Peter's house to reinstate his license. Meg worries that Peter will begin treating her badly again, but Peter says that while he will only do so {{in front of the}} family to keep up appearances, and that they will now be [...] "secret best friends." ...|$|E
