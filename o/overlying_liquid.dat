50|$|Growth of {{the inner}} core is thought to play an {{important}} role in the generation of Earth's magnetic field by dynamo action in the liquid outer core. This occurs mostly because it cannot dissolve the same amount of light elements as the outer core and therefore freezing at the inner core boundary produces a residual liquid that contains more light elements than the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid.</b> This causes it to become buoyant and helps drive convection of the outer core. The existence {{of the inner}} core also changes the dynamic motions of liquid in the outer core as it grows and may help fix the magnetic field since it is expected to be a great deal more resistant to flow than the outer core liquid (which is expected to be turbulent).|$|E

3000|$|Since the {{discovery}} of Mercury’s magnetic field, it has mostly been argued that a hydromagnetic dynamo driven by chemical convection in an outer liquid core provides the best explanation, although alternative dynamo mechanisms have been suggested as well (see below). It is generally accepted that Mercury has an iron-rich core. The high density of the planet suggests that this core must be comparatively large, about 0.8 planetary radii. Recent MESSENGER gravity data (Smith et al. 2012) and the amplitude of libration measurements with Earth-based radar (Margot et al. 2007, 2012) {{have been used to}} calculate improved values of the planet’s moment of inertia factor, C, and the ratio of the moment of inertia of the solid part of the planet <b>overlying</b> the <b>liquid</b> core to that of the whole planet, C [...]...|$|R

Included are the contributions form all normal modes that occur, and the branch-line integral representing the refraction arrival. The value of the refraction arrival is given in terms of the complex error function. The effect of different velocity and density contrasts are considered, and the effect of source depth and the distance to the receiver are investigated. The results giving the behavior of the magnitude of the branch line show that it is much larger at the mode cutoffs than at other values of frequency. The total amplitude of the response shows a regular oscillation in the frequency range in which two modes are present, and somewhat irregular high and low values over the range in which three modes are present. This behavior reflects the difference in amplitude at frequencies for which modes reinforce or interfere with each other. by Roy J. Greenfield. Thesis (M. S.)

40|$|The recent {{determination}} of the gravity field of Mercury and new Earth-based radar observations of the planet’s spin state afford the opportunity to explore Mercury’s internal structure. These observations provide estimates of two measures of the radial mass distribution of Mercury: the normalized {{polar moment of inertia}} and the fractional polar moment of inertia of the solid portion of the planet <b>overlying</b> the <b>liquid</b> core. Employing Monte Carlo techniques, we calculate several million models of the radial density structure of Mercury consistent with its radius and bulk density and constrained by these moment of inertia parameters. We estimate th{{at the top of the}} liquid core is at a radius of 2020 ± 30 km, the mean density above this boundary is 3380 ± 200 kg m⁻³, and the density below the boundary is 6980 ± 280 kg m⁻³. We find that these internal structure parameters are robust across a broad range of compositional models for the core and planet as a whole. Geochemical observations of Mercury’s surface by MESSENGER indicate a chemically reducing environment that would favor the partitioning of silicon or both silicon and sulfur into the metallic core during core-mantle differentiation. For a core composed of Fe–S–Si materials, the thermodynamic properties at elevated pressures and temperatures suggest that an FeS-rich layer could form at the top of the core and that a portion of it may be presently solid...|$|R
40|$|Vesiculation of crystallising magma {{can produce}} either a mobile {{vesicular}} magma or a rigid network of crystals containing vesicular liquid. Where partially crystallized rigid mush underlies less-crystallized magma, such as {{near the base}} of a lava flow or in the cumulus pile of a magma chamber, evolved interstitial melt and/or gas may escape into the main body of magma. The consequences of this may include contamination of the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid</b> with gas and interstitial melt, or intrusion of diapirs of vesicular evolved liquids to form vertical vesicle cylinders and other segregation features found in many basaltic lava flows and sills. Analog experiments were used to investigate some of the phenomena that can arise during vesiculation within a crystal mush, which was simulated by pumping air through a porous plate that formed the floor of a container filled with a viscous liquid floored with a layer of glass beads. Experiments used either a single liquid or two stably stratified liquids with a liquid interface either coincident with the top of the porous layer of beads or slightly above the porous layer. For a range of liquid viscosities and air flow rates (vesiculation rates), individual bubbles emerged {{from the top of the}} porous layer of beads and carried a thin trail of interstitial liquid into the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid.</b> The number of bubble trains leaving the surface of the porous bed increased with decreasing liquid viscosity and flow rate, and with increasing bead size (and, hence, with increasing permeability). Analog vesicle cylinders, composed of diapirs of bubbly interstitial liquid, were produced only when a layer of buoyant bubbly liquid lay above the surface of the porous layer. The relative size of the bubbles and constrictions within the porous layer are argued to control whether individual bubbles (leading to bubble trains) or vesicular liquid (leading to vesicle cylinders) leaves the porous layer and hence whether vesicle cylinders can form. ...|$|E

Normalized displacement and the phase shift {{at the base of}} the crust as a function of angle of incidence and frequency are calculated for two continental models and an oceanic model. Complex reflection coefficients are inverse Fourier transformed to the time domain to show the change of pulse shape upon reflection. These time traces show that the water layer of the oceanic model causes the main difference between continental and oceanic reflections. Sample seismograms from a deep shock were compared to the theoretical records; they were found to be consistent. It is concluded that the amplitude ratio PP/P as a function of frequency obtained from seismograms can be used to decipher the detailed structure at the point of reflection only after the radiation pattern of the source, attenuation of waves during propagation, and crustal transmission response at the receiver are properly taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Monomer cholesteric liquid {{crystals}} have helical structures which {{result in}} a phenomenon known as selective reflection, wherein incident white light is reflected {{in such a way}} that its wavelength is governed by the instantaneous pitch of the helix structure. The pitch is dependent on temperature and external stress fields. It is possible to use such monomers in flow visualization and temperature measurement. However, the required thin layers of these monomers are quickly washed away by a flow, making their application time dependent for a given flow rate. The laminate structure according to the present invention comprises a liquid crystal polymer substrate attached to a test surface of an article. A light absorbing coating is applied to the substrate and is thin enough to permit bonding steric interaction between the liquid crystal polymer substrate and an <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid</b> crystal monomer thin film.

40|$|ABSTRACT Land {{application}} of both anaerobic lagoon liquid and sludge can increase nutrient accumulation beyond the soil&# 8217;s assimilative capacity {{and become a}} threat to water quality in regions with intensive, confined swine production. In a 15 -month meso-scale column study, we evaluated the effect of manure pretreatment on the reduction of total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive P (SRP), and total copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in swine lagoons using (i) enhanced solid-liquid separation (SS) and (ii) solid-liquid separation plus biological nitrogen treatment with nitrification-denitrification (SS + NDN). A conventional anaerobic lagoon treatment was included as a control. A mass flow balance revealed that with both pretreatments the net mass input of TP, Cu, and Zn in the lagoon columns declined 80 to 100 % {{when compared to the}} control. Even though both pretreatments significantly reduced P in the inflow, TP and SRP were negatively correlated (r = - 0. 51 to - 0. 87) with TSS in the liquid fraction because of the dissolution of P from sludge into the <b>overlying</b> lagoon <b>liquid.</b> On the other hand, the removal of solids by both pretreatments effectively reduced Cu and Zn concentrations in the lagoon liquid, and their concentrations were positively correlated (r = 0. 79 to 0. 90) with TSS. The decline in mass accumulation of TP, Cu, and Zn in sludge {{as a result of the}} reduction of input solids can help minimize both the frequency of sludge removal for lagoon maintenance and the land area for its disposal...|$|R
40|$|In {{chemical}} engineering applications, {{the operation of}} condensers and evaporators can be made more efficient by exploiting the transport properties of interfacial waves excited on the interface between a hot vapor <b>overlying</b> a colder <b>liquid.</b> Linear theory for the onset of instabilities due to heating a thin layer from above is computed for the Marangoni–Bénard problem. Symbolic computation in the long wave asymptotic limit shows three stationary, non-growing modes. Intersection of two decaying branches occurs at a crossover long wavelength; two other modes co-exist at the crossover point—propagating modes on nascent, shorter wavelength branches. The dispersion relation is then mapped numerically by Newton continuation methods. A neutral stability method is used to map the space of critical stability for a physically meaningful range of capillary, Prandtl, and Galileo numbers. The existence of a cut-off wavenumber for the long wave instability was verified. It {{was found that the}} effect of applying a no-slip lower boundary condition was to render all long waves stationary. This has the implication that any propagating modes, if they exist, must occur at finite wavelengths. The computation of 8000 different parameter sets shows that the group velocity always lies within 1 / 2 to 2 / 3 of the longwave phase velocity...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{climate model}} {{predictions}} over Earth's polar regions requires {{a comprehensive knowledge}} of polar cloud microphysics. Over the Arctic, there is minimal contrast between the clouds and background snow surface, {{making it difficult to}} detect clouds and retrieve their phase from space. Snow and ice cover, temperature inversions, and the predominance of mixed-phase clouds make it even more difficult to determine cloud phase. Also, since determining cloud phase {{is the first step toward}} analyzing cloud optical depth, particle size, and water content, it is vital that the phase be correct in order to obtain accurate microphysical and bulk properties. Changes in these cloud properties will, in turn, affect the Arctic climate since clouds are expected to play a critical role in the sea ice albedo feedback. In this paper, the IR trispectral technique (IRTST) is used as a starting point for a WV and 11 -{micro}m brightness temperature (T 11) parameterization (WVT 11 P) of cloud phase using MODIS data. In addition to its ability to detect mixed-phase clouds, the WVT 11 P also has the capability to identify thin cirrus clouds <b>overlying</b> mixed or <b>liquid</b> phase clouds (multiphase ice). Results from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) MODIS phase model (AMPHM) are compared to the surface-based cloud phase retrievals over the ARM North Slope of Alaska (NSA) Barrow site and to in-situ data taken from University of North Dakota Citation (CIT) aircraft which flew during the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (MPACE). It will be shown that the IRTST and WVT 11 P combined to form the AMPHM can achieve a relative high accuracy of phase discrimination compared to the surface-based retrievals. Since it only uses MODIS WV and IR channels, the AMPHM is robust in the sense that it can be applied to daytime, twilight, and nighttime scenes with no discontinuities in the output phase...|$|R
40|$|Electrolyte {{transport}} {{through and}} between airway epithelial cells controls {{the quantity and}} composition of the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid.</b> Many studies have shown acute regulation of transcellular ion transport in airway epithelia. However, whether ion transport through tight junctions can also be acutely regulated is poorly understood both in airway and other epithelia. To investigate the paracellular pathway, we used primary cultures of differentiated human airway epithelia and assessed expression of claudins, the primary determinants of paracellular permeability, and measured transepithelial electrical properties, ion fluxes, and La 3 + movement. Like many other tissues, airway epithelia expressed multiple claudins. Moreover, different cell types in the epithelium expressed {{the same pattern of}} claudins. To evaluate tight junction regulation, we examined the response to histamine, an acute regulator of airway function. Histamine stimulated a rapid and transient increase in the paracellular Na+ conductance, with a smaller increase in Cl− conductance. The increase was mediated by histamine H 1 receptors and depended on an increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration. These results suggest that ion flow through the paracellular pathway can be acutely regulated. Such regulation could facilitate coupling of the passive flow of counter ions to active transcellular transport, thereby controlling net transepithelial salt and water transport...|$|E

Using a finite-element simulator, distinctive 'convective signatures' are shown to exist for convectively unstable cases, where {{the instability of}} a system is shown to be largely {{a function of the}} thickness of an inverted density layer that exists ahead of the moving solidification front. With D the diffusion coefficient in the melt and V the solidification rate, the thickness of this layer, and therefore the stability of the systems studied, is shown to be a function of the length scale D/ V, where it is shown that channeling can be turned on or off simply by changing this length scale. This work also validates a finite element model of dendritic solidification by comparing predicted results to data resulting from eleven directionally solidified hypoeutectic Pb-Sn samples, which were produced under various thermal gradients and solidification rates. For {{all but one of the}} cases, which was thought to be borderline between channeling and not channeling, predictions of whether channel defects formed were supported by experiments. Finally, it was determined that, while the strength of the convection in the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid</b> depends on the square root of its height, one need not model the entire domain to predict channel defects...|$|E

Model parameterizations are still subject to a large number of t unable parameters; furthermore, accurate and representative in situ o bservations are very sparse, and satellite observations historically have significant quantitative uncertainties, particularly with respect to particle size distribution (PSD) and cloud phase. Ice Water Path (IWP), or amount of ice present in a cloud column, is an important cl oud property to accurately quantify, because it is an integral measur e of the microphysical properties of clouds and the cloud feedback pr ocesses in the climate system. This paper investigates near co-incident retrievals of IWP over tropical oceans using three diverse measurem ent systems: radar from CloudSat, Vis/IR from Aqua/MODIS, and microwa ve from NOAA- 18 IMHS. CloudSat 94 GHz radar measurements provide high resolution vertical and along-orbit structure of cloud reflectivity a nd enable IWP (and IWC) retrievals. Overlapping MODIS measurements of cloud optical thickness and phase allow estimates of IWP when cloud tops are identified as being ice. Periodically, NOAA 18 becomes co-inci dent in space I time to enable comparison of A-Train measurements to IWP inferred from the 157 and 89 GHz channel radiances. This latter m easurement is effective only for thick convective anvil systems. We s tratify these co-incident data (less than 4 minutes separation) into cirrus only, cirrus <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid</b> water clouds, and precipitating d eep convective clouds. Substantial biases in IWP and ice effective ra dius are found. Systematic differences in these retrievals are consid ered in light of the uncertainties in a priori assumptions ofPSDs, sp ectral sensitivity and algorithm strategies, which have a direct impact on the IWP product...|$|E
40|$|Europa, on {{the basis}} of its {{spectral}} characteristics and its apparently young surface age, is likely to be at least partially resurfaced by liquid water volcanic processes; however, convincing evidence for lava flow morphology in Voyager data has not previously been found, and the lower density of liquid water relative to an overlying solid water ice crust suggests that extrusive volcanism could be uncommon. We examine a candidate lava-flow-like feature (Thrace Macula) and compare its characteristics with theoretical predictions for the ascent and eruption of water magma on Europa, outlining a range of conditions under which water ice magma could plausibly be erupted to the surface. Thrace Macula (45 °S, 171 °W) is a dark lobate feature extending NNW to SSE; its northern part is centered in a 140 km diameter arcuate to circular lineament, and within this zone are radial and concentric lineaments and three dark lobes similar in appearance to flow lobes extending away from a central region for distances of 40, 50, and 160 km. The 160 km lobe appears to follow local topographic features, producing lobate margins at subdued structures, broadening locally parallel to structural trends, and terminating against a gray band. Models for the present structure and state of the predominantly H 2 O exterior of Europa range from solid water ice to a thin ice layer <b>overlying</b> a <b>liquid</b> water layer, and these conditions may even vary as a function of space and time. Ascent and eruption of H 2 O magma through a less dense water ice crust means that sustained effusive eruptions are very difficult to produce if a globally continuous liquid water (or salt-water) layer exists [e. g., Crawford and Stevenson, 1988; Kargel, 1991]. For flows as extensive as the Thrace Macula feature, we thus require magma source regions sufficiently localized that excess pressure can be built up in the source region. Given the elastic properties of ice at these source depths, the most likely scenario is intrusion of silicate magma into the base of an ice crust, and melting and mobilization of water magma. With this range of magma source settings, we model plausible surface vent geometries for a water lava flow interpretation of Thrace Macula. Modeling calculations show that flow lobes with the above geometries, and thicknesses on the order of 10 m, could be formed in water eruptions on Europa involving discharge rates of ∼ 2 × 105 m 3 /s through dikes with widths in the range 5 – 10 m. These discharge rates (about 3 times larger than those of terrestrial flood basalts) should not be unusual for water eruptions on Europa under these conditions and suggest that water volcanic resurfacing could be common on the satellite if source regions meeting these criteria were readily available. The lack of abundant similar dark flows could be due to brightening with time or might imply that conditions for their formation (grounded or nearly solid ice crust) only evolved in the latter part of Europan history...|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{there are}} few methods {{available}} for analyzing pressure transient data from two-phase reservoirs. Methods published in {{the oil and gas}} literature (Earlougher, 1977) have been adapted for analyzing data from geothermal reservoirs, assuming a uniform initial steam saturation. However, {{it is well known that}} two-phase conditions often prevail only in parts of the reservoir, primarily in the top portion, and that vapor saturations are not uniform. Thus, there is a need to examine the pressure behavior during well tests considering more realistic conditions. Two-phase effects are important in pressure transient analysis because the mobility of two-phase mixtures can differ significantly from that of single-phase fluids. Also, the compressibility of two-phase mixtures is orders of magnitude higher than for single-phase liquid and vapor (Grant and Sorey, 1979). In this paper we perform scoping calculations on the effects of two-phase zones on well pressure transients. Three different cases are considered (Figure 1). The first is that of a fully two-phase system (e. g. Krafla, Iceland; Stefansson, 1981). This problem has been studied by various authors, including Moench and Atkinson (1977, 1978), Grant (1978), Garg (1978, 1980), Grant and Sorey (1979), and Aydelotte (1980). Some of the complexities of this type of system are discussed. The second problem is that of a single-phase liquid reservoir with a localized two-phase zone. Possible field examples include Cerro Prieto, Mexico and Baca, New Mexico, USA. This problem was studied by Sageev and Horne (1983 a,b) and Sageev (1985); they used a constant pressure approximation for the two-phase zone. In this paper we investigate the pressure transients in a well located near an isolated two-phase zone in a single-phase liquid reservoir, and compare them to type curves based upon the constant pressure approximation. The third problem considered is that of a two-phase layer <b>overlying</b> a single-phase <b>liquid</b> layer. One example of such a reservoir is the Svartsengi geothermal field in Iceland (Gudmundsson e t al., 1985). Little research has been done on pressure transients in such systems. The numerical code MULKOM (Pruess, 1983) is used to simulate the three cases...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 68 - 71). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis is a two-part discussion concerning a Gulf of Mexico beach in Jefferson County, Texas. The first part involves collecting and analyzing shoreline evolution data for an ongoing Texas A&M University Ocean Engineering Program investigation. Excessive shoreline erosion exists along approximately 27 kilometers of highway in Jefferson County, Texas that has led to the subsequent destruction of State Highway 87. The hydrographic and land surveys conducted throughout the past year have quantified the volume of sand transported on the beach face. The entire survey area is receding except the eastern section where the shoreline has accreted a mean 6 meters during the investigation period. The survey confirmed the central region of the study area is the most severely eroding segment. Beach transect comparisons are presented for the Spring versus Winter walking surveys and for all offshore data. The data provide a baseline to facilitate designing a final roadway alignment for State Highway 87. The paper also investigates a natural 'fluid mud' phenomenon. A viscous seabed exists at the eastern survey area, causing water wave attenuation. The interdependent effects of seafloor mud on progressive surface waves are discussed. The reduction in wave height due to damping is quantified by data collected on a waverunner. It illustrates the wave height differential between the eastern coastline and the middle of the survey region. The thickness of fluid sediment is evaluated with a dual frequency echosounder and collected soil samples. Testing concluded that a dual frequency fathometer is employable in the surf zone, but that low frequency data must be collected in water depths greater than two meters of water. The observed wave data is employed to validate the model simulations. The finite difference model REF/DIF is implemented as a vehicle to simulate two dimensional, dual-layer viscous fluid attenuation. The analytical solution for the two-layer model consists of <b>liquid</b> <b>overlying</b> a denser fluid upon a rigid seafloor. The boundary layer approximation and the shallow water boundary layer approximation are discussed in detail. These two theories are compared for theoretical accuracy against published results for the complete model theory. The boundary layer theory agrees well except for shallow sediment beds because the mud layer becomes too thin for the model assumptions. The boundary layer theory is applied to the Jefferson County eastern seabed to compare with gathered wave data. The thinnest sediment seabed is used, 0. 28 cm, to satisfy the model assumptions and to simulate the actual site conditions. This is seven centimeters thicker than the value estimated with the echosounder results. This data comparison is the closest match between field conditions and model limitations. The model produces wave attenuation in excess of actual beach conditions. An empirical formula is evaluated for this region and shows good correlation. Damping varies with water depth and wave amplitude. Damping equals approximately ten times the amount of turbulent boundary layer damping associated with the same seabed and no fluid sediment. The model supports the concept that regional wave attenuation is affected more by viscous sediment than bathymetry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{hypothesis}} that chromite seams in the Stillwater Complex formed in response to periodic increases in total pressure in the chamber. Total pressure increased because of the positive AKof nucleation of CO 2 bubbles in the melt and their subsequent rise through the magma chamber, during which the bubbles increased in volume {{by a factor of}} 4 — 6. By analogy with the pressure changes in the summit chambers of Kilauea and Krafla volcanoes, the maximum variation was 0 - 2 -O 25 kbar, or 5 - 10 % of the total pressure in the Stillwater chamber. An evaluation of the likelihood of fountaining and mixing of a new, primitive liquid that entered the chamber with the somewhat more evolved liquid already in the chamber is based upon calculations using observed and inferred velocities and flow rates of basaltic magmas moving through volcanic fissures. The calculations indicate that hot, dense magma would have oozed, rather than fountained into the chamber, and early mixing of the new and residual magmas that could have resulted in chromite crystallizing alone did not take place. Mixing was an important process in the Stillwater magma chamber, however. After the new magma in the chamber underwent ~ 5 % fractional crystallization, its composition, temperature, and density approached those of the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid</b> in the chamber and the liquids then mixed. If this process occurred many times {{over the course of the}} development of the Ultramafic series, a thick column of magma with orthopyroxene on its liquidus would have been the result. Thus, the sequence of multiple injections, fractionation, and mixing with previously fractionated magma could have been the mechanism that produced the thick bronzite cumulate layer (the Bronzitite zone) above the cyclic units...|$|E
40|$|Energy sources {{involved}} {{in the early stages}} of planetary formation can cause partial or even complete melting of the mantle of terrestrial bodies leading to the formation of magma oceans. Upon planetary cooling, solidification is expected to take place from the bottom upwards because of the steeper slope of the liquid adiabat with respect to the liquidus (Elkins-Tanton, 2012; Solomatov, 2015). Fractional solidification, in particular, can lead to the formation of a compositional layering that can play a fundamental role for the subsequent long-term dynamics and evolution of the interior (Tosi et al., 2013; Plesa et al., 2014). In order to assess to what extent primordial compositional heterogeneities generated upon magma ocean solidification can be preserved, we investigate the cooling and solidification of a whole-mantle magma ocean along with the conditions that allow solid-state convection to start mixing the mantle before solidification has completed. To this end, we run 2 -D numerical simulations in cylindrical geometry using the finite-volume code GAIA (Hüttig et al., 2013). We treat the liquid magma ocean in a parametrized fashion while we self-consistently solve the conservation equations of thermochemical convection in the growing solid mantle accounting for pressure-, temperature- and melt-dependent rheology. We consider two end-member cases: fractional crystallization, where melt is instantaneously extracted into the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid</b> leaving beneath a differentiated mantle, and batch crystallization where melt remains in contact with the silicate matrix throughout solidification causing no differentiation. By testing the effects of different cooling rates and Rayleigh numbers, we show that for a lifetime of the liquid magma ocean between 1 and 10 Myr (Lebrun et al., 2013), the onset of solid state convection prior to complete mantle crystallization is possible and that part or even all of the compositional heterogeneities generated upon fractionation can be erased by efficient mantle stirring (Figure 1). We discuss the consequences of our findings in relation to the early and long-term evolution of compositional heterogeneities generated via fractional crystallization of magma oceans in terrestrial bodies with emphasis on Mars' thermochemical history...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{rotation}} on onset of convection during plane-front directional solidification of Pb-Sn and the pseudobinary system {{mercury cadmium telluride}} (Hg(1 -x) Cd(x) Te), and on dendritic solidification of Pb-Sn have been studied by means of linear stability analysis. Incorporating Coriolis and centrifugal accelerations into the momentum equation of Coriell et al., we find that under realistic processing conditions, a large degree of stabilization can be achieved using modest rotation rates for both Pb-Sn and mercury cadmium telluride. At a growth velocity of 5 micron/sec and nominal liquid-side temperature gradient of 200 K/cm in Pb-Sn, rotation at 500 rpm results in a hundredfold increase in the critical Sn concentration. Large increases in the maximum allowable growth velocity at fixed melt composition are also attainable with modest rotation rates. The effect is amplified under conditions of reduced gravitational acceleration. For Hg(1 -x) Cd(x) Te, we have also studied the nonrotating case. The key differences are due {{to the existence of}} a composition range for Hg(1 -x) Cd(x) Te in which the melt density has a local maximum as a function of temperature. When the melt solidifies by cooling from below, the liquid density may initially increase with distance above the interface, before ultimately decreasing as the melt temperature increases above the value at which the local density maximum occurs. In contrast to the Pb-Sn case where density depends monotonically on temperature and composition, for Hg(1 -x) Cd(x) Te there exists a critical value of the growth velocity above which plane-front solidification is unstable for all bulk CdTe mole fractions. Again, rotation leads to significant inhibition of onset. We identify the predicted stabilization with the Taylor-Proudman mechanism by which rotation inhibits thermal convection in a single-component fluid heated from below. In a binary liquid undergoing solidification, rotation inhibits the onset of buoyancy-driven convection, and has no effect on the short-wavelength morphological instability. At large growth velocities, the plane-front interface between liquid and solid becomes unstable with respect to a morphological instability and solidification occurs dendritically, with a mushy zone of dendrites and interdendritic fluid separating the solid from the melt. For the Pb-Sn system, rotation substantially suppresses the onset of convection in the mushy zone and in the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid,</b> holding open the promise that rotation can suppress freckling and other macrosegregation defects...|$|E
40|$|Superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} can retain {{gas pockets}} within their micro-scale textures when submerged in water. This property reduces direct contact between water and solid surfaces and presents opportunities for improving hydrodynamic performance by decreasing viscous drag. In most realistic applications, however, the flow regime is turbulent and retaining the gas pockets is a challenge. In order {{to overcome this}} challenge, {{it is crucial to}} develop an understanding of physical mechanisms that can lead to the failure of superhydrophobic surfaces in retaining gas pockets when the <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid</b> flow is turbulent. We present a study of the onset of failure in gas retention by analyzing direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows over superhydrophobic surfaces coupled with the deformation of air-water interfaces that hold the gas pockets. The superhydrophobic surfaces are modeled as periodic textures with patterned slip and no-slip boundary conditions on the overlying water flow. The liquid-gas interface is modeled via a linearized Young-Laplace equation, which is solved coupled with the overlying turbulent flow. A wide range of texture sizes and interfacial Weber numbers are considered in this study. Our analysis identifies flow-induced upstream traveling capillary waves that are coherent in the spanwise direction as one mechanism for failure in retention of gas pockets. To confirm physical understanding of these waves, a semi-analytical inviscid linear analysis is developed; the wave speeds obtained from the space-time correlations in the DNS data were found to match with the predictions of the semi-analytical model. The magnitude of the pressure fluctuations due to these waves were found to increase with decreasing surface tension, and increase with much stronger dependence on the slip velocity, when all numbers are reported in wall units. Based on a fitted scaling a threshold criterion for the failure of superhydrophobic surfaces is developed that is based on estimates of the onset condition required for the motion of contact lines. The second contribution of this work is the development of boundary maps that identify stable and unstable zones in a parameter space consisting of working parameter and design parameters including texture size and material contact angle. We provide a brief description of previously identified failure modes of superhydrophobic surfaces, namely the stagnation pressure and shear driven drainage mechanisms. In an overlay map the stable and unstable zones due to each mechanism are presented. For various input conditions, we provide scaling laws that identify the most critical mechanism limiting the stability of gas retention by superhydrophobic surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Part I: The basic {{formulae}} for {{estimating the}} {{energy in the}} seismic waves are derived. The formulae {{take into account the}} radiation pattern of the source, the compensation for the non-elastic absorption of the waves, the velocity-density structure of the earth, the effects of the crustal structure under the receiver and the response of the recording instruments. Operations are performed in the frequency domain. Estimation of the seismic energy of an earthquake is closely related to the determination of the source mechanism and the radiation pattern of the source. We have determined the surface wave radiation pattern of a shallow shock and the P wave radiation pattern of an intermediate shock to show the correspondence between the fault-plane solutions and the fault mechanisms derived from radiation pattern. We have obtained the energies of the two earthquakes mentioned above as well as 7 other earthquakes with known fault-plane solutions and/or radiation patterns. The "total" seismic energies for these earthquakes (magnitudes between 6 1 / 2 and 7 1 / 2) using the present procedures are at least an order of magnitude higher than those arrived at from the current magnitude-energy formula. The S wave energies are approximately an order higher than that of the P waves. The surface wave energies for the shallow shocks are three orders of magnitude less than the body wave energies. Thus, the S wave seems to be the main seismic wave energy carrier. Energies in the lower order spheroidal oscillations (ℓ = 2, 15) for the 1964 Alaskan earthquake have been calculated from Isabella strain data and Berkeley ultra-long period pendulum seismometer data. The sum of the energies is 10 23 ergs. Part II: Haskell's formulation for reflection of the body waves {{at the base of a}} solid crust is extended to include <b>overlying</b> <b>liquid</b> layers. Normalized displacement and the phase shift at the base of the crust as a function of angle of incidence and frequency are calculated for two continental models and an oceanic model. Complex reflection coefficients are inverse-Fourier transformed numerically to the time domain to show the change of pulse shape upon reflection. These time traces show that the water layer of the oceanic model causes the main difference between continental and oceanic reflections. Sample seismograms from a deep shock were compared to the theoretical records; they are found to be consistent. PP waves from a deep earthquake recorded at Tonto Forest Seismic Array were processed to display the details of an oceanic PP wave. ...|$|E
