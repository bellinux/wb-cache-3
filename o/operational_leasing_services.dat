40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} is to analyze the {{influence}} of leasing company image on the volume of sales of <b>leasing</b> <b>service.</b> The paper points to the significance of a company image in modern business, where image gains an extreme significance in buyer’s final decision-making on accepting <b>leasing</b> <b>services.</b> In general, <b>leasing</b> <b>services</b> have characteristics similar to other kinds of services.

40|$|The {{concept that}} {{suppliers}} retain ownership of building products and the materials encapsulated within these products {{and that their}} customers ‘only’ pay for services is a paradigm in Circular Economy. However in many legal systems, elements incorporated in a building such as the facade or the roof, or equipment in a plant, are seen as fixtures and therefore {{considered to be a}} part of real estate. Therefore ensuring multi-cyclic behaviour within the so-called technical loop of CE is not evident. At the moment the challenges of property law concerning CE, real estate and <b>operational</b> <b>lease</b> are hardly discussed within the literature. This paper explores the concept of service providing related to <b>operational</b> <b>lease</b> for real estate, with a focus on Dutch property law, illustrated by legal case studies. The paper ends with some conclusions that offer first guidelines for alternative implementations of the <b>operational</b> <b>lease</b> concept, taking into account the CE ambitions to reduce the extraction of the amount of raw materials.

50|$|Financing and <b>leasing</b> <b>services</b> {{provide a}} means for {{individuals}} or companies to acquire goods without any initial capital outlay. Financing is the act of acquiring capital for a purchase or some other activity. Financing services are offered by lenders (a bank or other institution) that provide capital to other individuals or companies {{in the form of}} a loan, which is then paid back within a predetermined time period for a set fee or interest rate. Leasing is the act of entering into a contractual arrangement (i.e. a lease) to obtain temporary possession of an asset (land, equipment, etc.) in exchange for a fixed compensation (for example, a monthly payment). <b>Leasing</b> <b>services</b> are provided by organizations that either manage the lease and payment transactions, furnish the assets or land that is being leased, or both. Financing and <b>leasing</b> <b>services</b> within the context of data center <b>services</b> might include <b>leasing</b> a data center facility; leasing data center equipment, such as servers; or financing a data center project, such as building or upgrading a data center facility.|$|R
