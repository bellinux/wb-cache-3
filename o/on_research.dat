40|$|The Chambless Task Force {{criteria}} {{have become}} the standard for the <b>research</b> <b>on</b> outcomes of psychological treatments.

The six sets of criteria emphasize the relation between the development of psychological treatments and the basic <b>research</b> <b>on</b> psychological processes, the <b>research</b> <b>on</b> the processes of change underlying a treatment, and the <b>research</b> <b>on</b> treatment efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency.

In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses and reports <b>on</b> <b>research</b> on global warming.
