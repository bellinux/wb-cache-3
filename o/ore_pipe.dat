40|$|A {{description}} of gold-quartz formation deposits in the Priamur gold province is presented. Prevalence of gold-quartz deposits defines metallogenic {{profile of the}} province and presence of numerous rich placers. Deposits are attributed to frontal, middle and near-bottom parts of the <b>ore</b> <b>pipe.</b> Frontal part of the <b>ore</b> <b>pipe</b> contains {{a major part of}} the deposits. They are small and consist of scattered quartz, feldspar-quartz and carbonate-quartz veins. The ore is characterized by erratic percentage of gold, bonanzas can be found. Gold is free, ranging from fine to big grains and small nuggets. It is associated with arsenopyrite, galenite, sometimes with antimonite. Among trace elements can be copper, mercury, antimony and arsenic. Prevalence of frontal deposits in the province points to significant prospects of finding a rich deep mineralization in the middle part of <b>ore</b> <b>pipe.</b> Middle part of the <b>ore</b> <b>pipe</b> contains intermediate and small deposits. Ore bodies are often represented by veined and veinlet-disseminated zones, sometimes zones of metasomatites. For gold-quartz ores, free native gold can commonly be found, usually of fine and very fine grain size. Among ore minerals, apart from arsenopyrite, pyrite and galenite, scheelite is frequently observed. Small deposits of near-bottom <b>ore</b> <b>pipe</b> are quite rare. Ore bodies are represented by quartz veins and zones of metasomatites. Gold is mostly free, of fine and super fine grain size. The prevailing trace element is mercury. Attribution of gold-quartz deposits to a certain part of <b>ore</b> <b>pipe</b> can facilitate more precise estimation of their prospects. In its own turn, this will allow to choose more favorable objects for further evaluation...|$|E

Construction of the A21 rockfill dike (like the other three ore bodies, A21 kimberlite pipe is under shallow waters of Lac de Gras) {{is expected to be}} complete in 2018 with first diamonds expected in the fall of that year. To build the dike, Diavik will use the same technologies as were used to build the A154 and A418 dikes.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the origin}} of breccia pipes is disputed, the most {{commonly}} accepted theory is that they formed at intersections of fractures. In these areas, hydrothermal solutions forced {{their way to the}} surface. However, there are some breccia pipes that are a result of limestone collapse by acidic water or other soluble rock types. [...] Areas that contains many examples of breccia pipes include Copper Creek, Arizona, which contains approximately 500 mineralized breccia pipes, and the gold mining area of Cripple Creek, Colorado which contains breccia <b>pipe</b> <b>ore</b> deposits associated with a volcanic diatreme.|$|R
40|$|A {{representative}} {{collection of}} hydrothermal manifestations was sampled practically from all hydrothermal mounds of the Broken Spur hydrothermal vent field {{with use of}} the Mir manned submersibles during three cruises of R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh. Mineral associations characteristic for different morphological types of sulfide <b>ores</b> from hydrothermal <b>pipes,</b> plates, and diffusers are assessed. Particular {{attention is paid to}} distribution of minor elements and their distribution patterns determined by mineralogical zonation. Measured isotopic composition of sulfur in sulfide minerals varies from 0. 4 to 5. 2 per mil that indicates their similarity with ores from the Snake Pit vent field and is related to dilution of hot ore-bearing solutions by seawater and reduction of water sulfate ions to H 2 S with heavy isotopic composition...|$|R

40|$|The {{properties}} of Roodepoort 222 KR and Groenfontein 227 KR are located within {{part of the}} Zaaiplaats tin mining district about 30 km north-west of Mokopane (Potgietersrus). Tin mineralisation occurs within {{the upper part of}} a sheet of Bushveld granite which overlies the mafic rocks of the Potgietersrus Limb of the Bushveld Complex. Tin has been commercially mined in this area since 1907 and has been recovered by Zaaiplaats Tin Mining Company from Zaaiplaats 223 KR, Roodepoort 222 KR and Groenfontein 227 KR, the latter two having been worked under tribute from Transvaal Consolidated Lands mining company (TCL). In 1978, a major drilling program was carried out with the aim of investigating the economic viability of the remaining resource on Roodepoort and Groenfontein. The programme background, implementation and results were assessed and reported on by I. M. Clementson in February 1979. The programme was divided into three drilling and sampling phases. The outcome of the first two phases revealed that mineralisation in the upper fine grained Lease Granite is largely restricted to the surface outcrop area of an exposed elongate dome-like structure and only extends for a limited distance down dip. It was observed that the overlying pegmatite zone and <b>pipe</b> <b>ore</b> bodies contain good but isolated and unpredictable tin grades. Twenty boreholes, RDP 077 to RDP 097, were collared in visibly mineralised Lease Granite within a surface geochemical anomaly and gave encouraging results. This prompted Phase 3 which involved percussion drilling on a 30 m by 30 m grid pattern over the major portion of the surface geochemical anomaly. Boreholes RDP 98 to RDP 213 were drilled and most of them intersected significant disseminated tin mineralisation with only 4 holes out of 107 not intersecting anomalous tin values(< 120 ppm Sn). The zone of anomalous tin values forms a roughly lenticular domical body, elongated NW-SE traceable for a distance of nearly 1 km. The mineralisation is thickest along central axis and tapers off in all directions. The results of the Phase 3 and adjacent boreholes from other Phases however were sufficient to warrant calculation of the economic potential of the disseminated tin mineralisation in the area covered by the drilling. Previous underground mining within the disseminated mineralisation zone targeted the rich, tin-bearing pipes, which represent only a small proportion of the zone of the disseminated mineralisation. Thus, in areas with underground workings, a conservative figure of 5...|$|R
40|$|Inventory in the Unisa Archives, German Africana Collection (ADA Acc 51). 12 Microfiches. HANS MERENSKY 1871 - 1952 Hans Merensky {{was born}} at Botshabelo in 1871 and he died at Westfalia in 1952. He was educated in South Africa and Germany and {{graduated}} as a mining engineer at the University of Berlin. In 1904 Merensky started practising as a consulting geologist and mining engineer. He received many commissions for geological reports {{on a variety of}} mineral deposits and his practice became exceptionally profitable. In 1923 Merensky learnt that platinum ore had been discovered in the Waterberge. A year later the first platinum <b>ore</b> bearing dunite <b>pipe</b> was discovered. Further follow-up work led to the discovery of the Merensky Reef, a pseudo-stratified, mineralised pyroxenite stratum in the norites of the Bushveld Complex. It is estimated that the Merensky Reef extends for some 300 kilometres and constitutes by far the largest known reserve of platinum on earth. In 1926 diamonds were discovered in Namaqualand. Through negotiation he obtained twenty-three claims which he later sold to the Oppenheimer-Barnato group for more than a million pounds. Merensky also {{played an important role in}} the discovery of gold in the famous West Wits Line as well as in the Free State. In 1937 he discovered one of the world’s richest deposits of vermiculite near Phalaborwa. He discovered phosphates of good quality sufficient to provide for the country’s needs for many years to come in 1946. The state took over the claims and Foskor was established. After his phosphate triumph, Merensky retired to Westfalia and set up the Merensky Trust of R 5 000 000. During his last years he devoted himself to soil conservation, forestry and the cultivation of fruit, especially citrus and avocado pears. In 1974 the Merensky Trust was converted into the Merensky Foundation with the intention to help develop South Africa’s natural resources and to preserve its water, soil, fauna and flora. HANS MERENSKY PAPERS (1900 – 1986) The Hans Merensky Papers were microfilmed in 1994 by the University of South Africa as a joint Unisa and Merensky Foundation Project. Microfiche copies of the Merensky Papers are available to researchers in the Unisa Archives as Accession 51 in the Hesse Collection of German Africana. The original Papers of the renowned mining engineer, geologist, prospector, farmer, nature conservationist and philanthropist are housed at the Westfalia Estate Museum in the Duiwelskloof District. The first section of the Papers reflect Merensky’s private life and his estate and the second part his geological and farming activities. A detailed index ensures easy access. The third part consists of speeches, articles, photographs, brochures and reports of the Merensky Foundation...|$|R
