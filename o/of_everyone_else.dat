25|$|In 1963 Hibs, battling to {{come out}} of a slump, paid £7,500 for Neil Martin from Queen of the South. Martin's goals helped add impetus to the club, and on 1 April 1964, Jock Stein was {{appointed}} manager of Hibernian. Within months of becoming manager he led them to Summer Cup success. The testimony of his contemporaries was that he was already “miles” ahead <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in his understanding of the game, and in studying how the investment of energy could be tailored to maximum effect. Stein was immersing himself {{in the structure of the}} game while the rest simply went out and played.|$|E
25|$|Seles {{returned}} to the tour in August 1995. In the runup to her comeback, then-WTA president Martina Navratilova proposed that Seles be reinstated alongside Steffi Graf as joint number one. The WTA did so despite some opposition from players including Arantxa Sánchez Vicario and Gigi Fernández, whose tournament placements would suffer greatly by suddenly being placed behind Seles. Graf supported Seles' co-ranking, but not the additional proposal that Seles' co-ranking not {{be determined by the}} minimum participation of 12 tournaments a year required <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> Graf felt that would give Seles an unfair advantage in the rankings. Seles won her first comeback tournament, the Canadian Open, beating Amanda Coetzer in the final and setting a tournament record for least number of games dropped by the champion throughout the tournament (14).|$|E

After telling him that Del will be very rich one day, Joan sees Freddie on a balcony in a tower opposite; she shows him Rodney and nods her head, to his delight.|$|E

500|$|Touring with Presley {{was like}} no other assignment. Presley and his entourage {{travelled}} in four or five jets to the next tour stop: one for Elvis and his closest colleagues, one for the band, one for Colonel Tom Parker (Presley's manager), one for concessions and crew, and a Learjet used by RCA Records management to fly ahead <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b> For two weeks during June and July 1973, Elvis flew on an all-black DC-9 airliner with a Playboy logo on the tail; the aircraft was named Big Bunny. Jackson said {{he and the other}} Elvis-chosen passengers were served food and drinks by elite Playboy Bunnies called [...] "Jet Bunnies".|$|E
500|$|In {{the romantic}} comedy Love & Friendship, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in early 2016, Beckinsale reunited with her Last Days of Disco {{collaborators}} Stillman and Sevigny. The film revolved around her character, a wry and calculating woman named Lady Susan, as she pursues a wealthy and hapless man for marriage originally intended for her daughter, though she eventually marries him herself. The film was universally acclaimed by critics and found commercial success in arthouse cinemas. Justin Chang of Variety described the role as [...] "one {{of the most}} satisfying screen roles of her career Beckinsale magnetizes the screen {{in a way that}} naturally underscores how far ahead <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> she is: an effect that doesn’t always work to the movie’s advantage." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter remarked, [...] "There aren’t great depths to the role, but Beckinsale excels with the long speeches and in defining her character as a very self-aware egoist." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Littlest Things" [...] has met mixed reviews; Heather Phares from AllMusic complimented the song, {{saying the}} ballad softens Allen's rough image and celebrates [...] "the mundane moments {{of a dying}} relationship", whereas Blender {{reporter}} Jon Dolan considers it a [...] "forlorn single", where the singer writes about the terror {{of being in a}} relationship [...] "with white-knuckled worry over a snip of florid piano from a ’70s soft-core porn flick". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine criticised Allen for being a [...] "poser who lacks charisma, bites off <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> and is so sickeningly contemptuous of everyone but herself that it makes the pretty, melancholy piano-and-drum-loop ballad 'Littlest Things' seem like a farce". While analysing Alright, Still, The Guardian reviewer, Sophie Heawood, described the lyrics as the [...] "perfect description of missing someone: 'We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt/ I was just so happy in your boxers and your T-shirt'." [...] Mark Pytlik from Pitchfork Media gave a positive review, saying that [...] "'Littlest Things' is a supple piano-tickler that provides one of Allen's sweetest lyrical moments while simultaneously leaving Ms. Dynamite in the dust on the R balladeering front". He believed that the song is made out of Allen's [...] "comfort zone" [...] of songs such as [...] "Smile", the result being of [...] "high order, if not a bit more erratic". IGN reviewer Todd Gilchrist named the song as the album's [...] "most affecting tune", while thought it [...] "compiles a sad and beautiful checklist of the intimate moments she no longer shares with her dearly departed boyfriend".|$|E

500|$|Frankie {{begins to}} hear their tiny voices calling to her and, though World tries to {{distract}} her from it, she finally discovers her friends. World finally becomes upset and scolds Frankie of planning to leave him alone in the toy box forever. She calms him down enough to befriend and unshrink the gang, but Mr. Herriman bursts in, having gotten into the toy box and somehow past the gang's obstacles, and harshly scolds World before preparing to take the gang home and leave World. World's world falls to pieces until it's nothing but a white void. World becomes angry and unstable and turns into a chimera-like creature to attack them all (made of the remaining refuse of his world). The gang manages to escape the toy box. Frankie climbs out as well and tries to convince everyone to let World out of the box. Herriman finally yields and releases World from the box, due to a realization of his long misjudgement of Frankie and newfound appreciation for her during her absence. World gets happy already and shouts that he's free and everyone is really confused, Frankie's answer is: [...] "Well, {{think of it this}} way: Imagine if you were able to have anything you wanted, except one thing, but that one thing is what you wanted more than anything else. For him, that thing is a friend. That's all he wanted; that's {{what he was trying to}} protect. So I brought him here. Here he can have all the friends in the world! I mean come on, isn't friendship what Foster's is all about?" [...] Instantaneously Bloo shouts, [...] " [...] No, it's all about me!"

[...] She {{is usually the}} only one who can purify Ryang's evil affinities, though her brother Pain and others with strong magical {{abilities}} can hold off the negative effects for an undisclosed amount of time. [...] Until her gown heals itself (since a gown is a living part of a faerie), Fanta lives with Ryang's family on earth. Rather than being upset, she is quite happy to stay, mostly because it is the best opportunity to find her father's reincarnation and learn more about him. [...] Ryang, Seho Yun, and Yuri Kim are the only humans who know that Fanta is a Faerie since Fanta has wiped the memories <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> who has seen her at work.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "musilanguage" [...] (or [...] "hmmmmm") {{refers to}} a pre-linguistic system of vocal {{communication}} from which (according to some scholars) both music and language later derived. The idea is that rhythmic, melodic, emotionally expressive vocal ritual helped bond coalitions and, over time, set up selection pressures for enhanced volitional control over the speech articulators. Patterns of synchronised choral chanting are imagined to have varied according to the occasion. For example, [...] "we're setting off to find honey" [...] might sound qualitatively different from [...] "we're setting off to hunt" [...] or [...] "we're grieving over our relative's death". If social standing depended on maintaining a regular beat and harmonising one's own voice with that <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> group members would have come under pressure to demonstrate their choral skills.|$|E
50|$|The {{spotlight}} {{effect is}} the phenomenon {{in which people}} tend to believe they are being noticed more than they really are. Being that one is constantly {{in the center of}} one's own world, an accurate evaluation of how much one is noticed by others has shown to be uncommon. The reason behind the spotlight effect comes from the innate tendency to forget that although one is the center of one's own world, one is not the center <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else's.</b> This tendency is especially prominent when one does something atypical.|$|R

Inspired by New York’s Paradise Garage, Berkmann set out to create London’s first club devoted to the American house music scenes of 1980s New York City, Chicago and Detroit. As opposed to {{striking}} {{a balance between the}} typical hallmarks of a live music venue, Ministry of Sound was conceived as an arena purely dedicated to sound. Berkmann stated: [...] "My concept for Ministry was purely this: 100% sound system first, lights second, design third (in that order); the reverse <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else’s</b> idea." ...|$|R

2500|$|Synesthesia {{is found}} in at least 4.4% of the population, as a high estimate, which is {{equivalent}} to 1 in 23 people. This study had also concluded that one common form of synesthesia—grapheme-color synesthesia (colored letters and numbers) – {{is found in}} more than one percent of the population, and this latter prevalence of graphemes-color synesthesia has now been independently verified in a yet larger sample. Earlier estimates of the prevalence of synesthesia were based on [...] "best-guess" [...] estimations only (e.g. 1 in 250,000) or had limitations in their methodologies because they required synesthetes to refer themselves for study (e.g. 1 in 2000) and for this reason the authors of those studies had been moderate in their claims. Also, some individuals will not self-classify as synesthetes because they do not realize that their perceptions are different from those <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

Balawaider had war service credentials {{and was able to}} fly ahead to Australia, but Florance had to deal with official obstacles before she and the three children could embark on the Aberdeen & Commonwealth Line vessel [...] "Esperance Bay" [...] on 6 March 1948. On arrival in Fremantle, Peter Oyston recalls that his mother [...] "ran down the gangplank ahead <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> and against the orders of the Captain or the crew, and knelt on the soil in the port, and then grabbed a handful of gravel and started eating it, and saying, 'Oh, Australia, Australia, I'm home, I'm home.

2500|$|The 23(a) {{criteria}} {{are referred to}} as numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. Numerosity refers to {{the number of people in}} the class. To be certified, the class has to have enough members that simply adding each of them as a named party to the lawsuit would be impractical. There is no bright-line rule to determine numerosity, but classes with hundreds of members are generally deemed to be sufficiently numerous. To satisfy commonality, there must be a common question of law and fact such that [...] "determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke." [...] The typicality requirement ensures that the claims or defenses of the named plaintiff are typical of those <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in the class. [...] Finally, adequacy requirement states that the named plaintiff must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the absent class members.|$|E
2500|$|The Blackhawks {{have worked}} with the American Indian Center to help educate their {{community}} and fan base by sharing Native American culture and history. Scott Sypolt, executive counsel for the American Indian Center, commented on the logo and name controversy: Joe Podlasek, {{the executive director of}} the American Indian Center of Chicago, commented on their relationship, stating, [...] " [...] are far and away ahead <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> in forward-thinking. What they have done is engaged the community. In the other cities (organizations) want nothing to do with native people but yet they're trying to say they respect us." [...] However, this stance is markedly different from the one taken by the American Indian Center up until recent years. In 2010, Joe Podlasek stated that, [...] "The stance is very clear. We want the Chicago Blackhawks logo to change. For us, that's one of our grandfathers. Would you do that with your grandfather's picture? Take it and throw it on a rug? Walk on it and dance on it?" [...] John Blackhawk, Chairman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, has suggested that the change in position may be tied to contributions the team has recently begun making to the center: [...] "We all do contributions, but we don't do it for the sake of wanting to be forgiven for something we've done that's offensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Springer {{was elected}} to the Cincinnati city council in 1971. He {{resigned}} in 1974 after admitting to hiring a prostitute. The episode was uncovered when a police raid on a Fort Wright, Kentucky massage parlor found a check Springer had written pinned to a wall in their office with [...] "for services rendered" [...] written in the memo. Springer came clean at a press conference. Long-time Cincinnati newsman Al Schottelkotte pronounced Springer's career over, but Springer's honesty helped him win back his seat in 1975 by a landslide. In a post-election interview, Schottelkotte good-naturedly reminded Springer that he had declared Springer's career over. Springer told the newsman, [...] "I'm glad that you were wrong." [...] In 1977, he was chosen to serve one year as mayor by the City Council. [...] Springer could only serve one year as mayor due to a political arrangement at the time (Cincinnati has since changed to direct election of its mayor) that required the Democrats to split the mayoral term with a local centrist group, the Charter Party, with whom the Democrats governed in an electoral alliance. [...] In the City Council, and as mayor, Springer supported changing the local election system so that council members would be elected by districts (thus better representing neighborhood interests) instead of [...] "9X" [...] at-large system, but his efforts (as well as those <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else,</b> to date, who has supported such a change) did not meet with success.|$|E

2500|$|Within the Lifehold, BLADE discovers a pool {{of genetic}} {{material}} {{which can be used}} to recreate Earth lifeforms and restore humanity, and Elma explains that none of their human bodies are actually kept in stasis and were destroyed with Earth, but that their memories, and thus, their consciousnesses, are kept in the Lifehold's powerful computers, and {{that it is possible to}} transfer their consciousnesses into their new bodies. As the ethics are highly questionable, this decision was made through the tough choices of their superiors. Luxaar attacks, but Lao fatally stabs him. Luxaar then accidentally merges with Lao in the genetic material, with BLADE being forced to kill their merged form. Before dying, Lao reveals that humanity's DNA was designed by their Samaarian ancestors to destroy the Ganglion using an in-built genetic failsafe. Though Lao dies, Elma assures the group that he can be revived using the Lifehold. With the Lifehold online and power restored, Elma deactivates her Mimeosome and reveals her true form as an alien. A narration by Lin reveals that Elma visited Earth thirty years before the aliens arrived, giving humanity the means of escaping. In a post-credits scene, a team led by Elma enter the Lifehold to find that the databases containing the memories <b>of</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>else</b> have been destroyed since the White Whale crashed on Mira.
