500|$|Hollywood used skyscrapers {{extensively}} in popular films. The Skyscrapers of New York in 1906 {{became the first}} of many, and in the 1920s Harold Lloyd produced his five [...] "skyscraper films", most prominently Safety Last!, in which the hero dangles from a clock <b>on</b> the side <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Los</b> Angeles building. In these early silent movies, skyscrapers were closely associated with masculine identity; Lloyd's climbing of skyscrapers closely associated with his characters' transformation from young men into mature adults, and the winning of the heroine. The 1933 film King Kong included another iconic use of the early skyscraper in its final scenes, as the giant ape scaled the Empire State Building shortly before his death; the scene {{can be interpreted as}} contrasting natural instinct with the insensitive rationality of the modern building and wider New York.|$|R
40|$|E xperiments were {{conducted}} on an aqueous growth medium containing cultures of Escherichia c oli (E. coli) XL 1 - Blue, to investigate, in a single experiment, the effect of two types of dynamic mechanical loading on cellular integrity. A bespoke shock tube was used to subject separate portions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planktonic bacteria l culture to two different loading sequences: (i) shock compression followed by cavitation, and (ii) shock compression followed by spray. T he apparatus allow s the generati <b>on</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> n adjustable <b>lo</b> <b>a</b> ding shock wave of magnitude up to 3 00 M Pa in a sterile laboratory environment. C ultures of E. coli were tested with this apparatus and the s pread - plate technique {{was used to measure}} the survivability after mechanical loading. T he loading sequence (ii) gave higher mortality than (i), suggesting that the bacteria are more vulnerable to shear deformation and cavitation than to hydrostatic compressi on. We present results of preliminary experi ments and suggestions for further experimental work; we discuss the potential applications of this technique to sterilise large volumes of fluid samples...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{literature}} on organisational cultural change and problems in its implementation, focusing <b>on</b> the case <b>of</b> building <b>a</b> learning organisation (<b>LO)</b> within university library context. Design/methodology/approach Key literature published within Library and Information Science, Business and Management and other related fields were reviewed to identify themes regarding organisational cultural change in relation to development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>LO</b> emerging in the recent years. Findings Reviewed in this paper highlights key challenges in examining organisational cultural change for the purpose <b>of</b> building <b>a</b> <b>LO.</b> These include there is no agreed definition <b>of</b> the <b>LO</b> concept, <b>a</b> lack <b>of</b> practical approaches and measure for assessing achievement of the cultural change. A need for in-depth studies which focus on current practices and related problems in this regard is also revealed and the Systems Approach is proposed as a suitable approach for holistic investigation of all critical elements possibly affect establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>LO.</b> Originality/value The paper raises awareness of the importance of examining organisational cultural change as a critical supportive influence <b>of</b> developing <b>a</b> <b>LO.</b> Problems to be considered in its implementation are synthesised and served as a basis for further investigation in the author?s doctoral research project.
