5|$|The Italian theologian Francesco Antonio Zaccaria criticised Augustine's {{concept of}} {{evil in the}} eighteenth century. He noted a {{distinction}} between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have <b>occurred</b> <b>before</b> suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.|$|E
5|$|The {{match is}} largely remembered for the {{disaster}} that <b>occurred</b> <b>before</b> the kick-off. Liverpool fans breached a fence separating {{the two groups}} of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds. Despite calls for an abandonment, the match went ahead because it was felt that further trouble would otherwise occur. The disaster prompted UEFA to ban English clubs from European football for five years.|$|E

Originally meant to focus on Zack, Last Order highlighted Tseng's feelings and position in the Shinra company, as well as his moral values.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have <b>occurred</b> <b>before</b> the age of 18, and cannot {{be attributed to the}} effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled out before conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Straits of Florida on September21, the storm resumed intensification, before striking near Boca Chica Key, Florida with winds of 120mph (195km/h). By early on September22, the system peaked as a Category4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (215km/h). Shortly thereafter, another landfall occurred near Chokoloskee, Florida {{at the same}} intensity. Severe damage {{was reported in the}} state due to strong winds. The storm was considered the worst in Key West since the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane. Throughout the state, 1,200homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 40businesses were demolished and 237suffered impact. Throughout Florida, there were three fatalities and approximately $12million (1948USD) in damage, over half of which was inflicted on crops. The storm rapidly weakened while crossing the state and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as only a Category1 hurricane later on September22. Slight fluctuations in intensity <b>occurred</b> <b>before</b> the hurricane became extratropical early on September24, while located northwest of Bermuda.|$|E

Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work. Thirty-two drop tests were conducted at Wendover, and only once did the bomb fail to fire. One last-minute modification was made, to allow the powder bags of propellant that fired the gun to be loaded in the bomb bay.|$|E
