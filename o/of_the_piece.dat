5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{first and}} last are set for choir as a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale. They frame alternating recitatives and arias with the text arranged by the librettist. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble: four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).

5000|$|Scott Yanow on Allmusic said [...] "due to <b>the</b> free nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces,</b> <b>the</b> {{music is}} less {{exciting}} {{than one might}} hope.

5|$|The {{music played}} during the {{broadcast}} of the 1939 radio speech at {{the climax of the}} film is from the 2nd movement (Allegretto) of Beethoven's 7th Symphony; it was added by Tariq Anwar, the editor.

Hooper further remarked that the stature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> helps elevate the status of the speech to a public event.|$|E
5|$|The {{music to}} The Sorcerer's Apprentice was {{recorded}} on January 9, 1938 at Culver Studios, California with Leopold Stokowski conducting {{a group of}} session musicians. The recording of Rhapsody in Blue used in the film is an edited version of Ferde Grofé's orchestration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra with conductor Bruce Broughton. The shortened version was made by cutting 125 bars of piano solo in three different places. A recording of James Levine conducting both pieces with the Philharmonia appears on the film's soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The ninth nocturne, {{dedicated}} to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Bréal, {{is the first}} of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors. The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Fauré's final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.|$|E

5|$|The second barcarolle, {{dedicated}} to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, {{and points to the}} influence of Saint-Saëns, Liszt and even, unusually for Fauré, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Fauré varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> {{is unusually}} symmetric. It opens and closes with a duet including a chorale text. Harmonically, the piece {{begins and ends}} in C major, and the central movement is in D minor. The second movement modulates from A minor to F major, while the fourth movement mirrors this motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{swell of}} the muzzle {{refers to the}} slight swell in the {{diameter}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> {{at the very end}} of the chase.

5|$|Walton's {{only other}} opera, The Bear, {{based on a}} comic {{vaudeville}} by Chekhov, is judged by critics as much more successful.

5|$|Written by David A. McIntee, {{this was}} a four-part Lovecraftian horror story set in Arkham, New England in 1927, {{although}} McIntee later began a rewrite to shift the action to Cornwall. The story involved alien bodysnatchers who could only inhabit {{the bodies of the}} dead. The villain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> would discover the remains of a Silurian god and try and clone itself a new body from the fossilized body.|$|E
5|$|A Hero's Song is musically {{structured}} like a four-movement symphony, {{beginning with}} an allegro con fuoco, transitioning {{to a slow}} poco adagio lacrimosa, then including a scherzo and concluding with a coda. The piece {{is based on a}} short, energetic theme in B minor played in the violas, cellos, and basses at the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b> This theme is featured in various forms throughout the first section. Following this, a slow section is marked by quiet music which symbolizes the hero's grief. It includes a funeral march, a musical form Dvořák also used in his Requiem, Stabat Mater, and Piano Quintet No. 2. The hero recovers from his grief as the mood of the music gradually brightens and goes into B major, leading into the dance-like scherzo. Finally, the triumph of the hero is represented by the victorious coda. The piece has a run time of approximately 22 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{introduction}} to <b>the</b> first edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five <b>pieces,</b> Klemm refers to them as compositions, not movements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same composition.

5|$|Any {{mechanical}} component will unavoidably possess both mass and stiffness. This translates in electrical terms to an LC circuit, that is, a circuit consisting of an inductor and a capacitor, hence {{mechanical component}}s are resonators {{and are often}} used as such. It is still possible to represent inductors and capacitors as individual lumped elements in a mechanical implementation by minimising (but never quite eliminating) the unwanted property. Capacitors may be made of thin, long rods, that is, the mass is minimised and the compliance is maximised. Inductors, on the other hand, may be made of short, wide pieces which maximise the mass {{in comparison to the}} compliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arp and Janco {{drifted away}} from the {{movement}} ca. 1919, when they created the Constructivist-inspired workshop Das Neue Leben. In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity. When Vinea submitted his poem Doleanțe ("Grievances") {{to be published by}} Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between the reserved tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piece.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 36 Cube is, however, subtly {{different}} from the 36 officer problem. Careful inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> reveals that two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> are special.

With this subtle modification, there are in fact 96 possible solutions to the 36 Cube puzzle.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is {{an often}} used fact that <b>the</b> control polygon <b>of</b> a Bézier curve approximates the curve {{and that the}} {{approximation}} gets better when the curve is subdivided. In particular, if a Bézier curve is subdivided into some number <b>of</b> <b>pieces,</b> then <b>the</b> arc-length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original curve is greater than <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chord-lengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces,</b> and less than <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polygon-lengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces.</b> Under repeated subdivisions, the difference between this lower and upper bound gets arbitrarily small. If Lc denotes <b>the</b> total chord-length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> and Lp denotes <b>the</b> total polygon-length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces,</b> <b>the</b> best estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> true arc-length is (2 Lc + (n − 1) Lp) (n + 1), where n is <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bézier curve. This convex combination of Lc and Lp is best {{in the sense that}} the error goes to zero under repeated subdivision asymptotically faster than <b>the</b> error <b>of</b> any other convex combination, and it forms the basis for a fast adaptive algorithm, which determines <b>the</b> arc-length <b>of</b> a Bézier curve. <b>The</b> energy <b>of</b> a curve is half <b>the</b> square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curvature integrated with respect to arc-length. Like in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arc-length, it is possible to use the chord-length and polygon-length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> a subdivided Bézier curve to estimate <b>the</b> energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bézier curve...|$|R
