25|$|Not all stops have ticket offices, some consist simply of a platform, {{sometimes}} {{even without a}} roof. A few of the stops are connected with railway stations, as the SKM tracks are paralleled by tracks used by long distance and regional trains. At these stations, high platforms have been built for SKM trains. Over 90% of stops are connected with <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> (both buses and trams, or trolley buses in Gdynia). For major stops, the timetables of the two services are synchronized, especially for night connections. The company makes a big effort to keep passengers well informed.

Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of an efficient, effective and reliable air transport infrastructure, especially in developing countries...|$|E

The Minister's main priorities were: development of an integrated transport system in Wales; construction, improvement and maintenance of trunk roads and motorways in Wales; Arriva Trains Wales passenger rail services; road safety strategies including speed limits, pedestrian crossings and on-street parking. The Minister also oversaw the provision of <b>other</b> public <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> such as buses.|$|R

50|$|Taxis have {{a unique}} and {{crucial role in the}} {{transport}} system. They are a vital link in the public transport network, providing a flexible, point-to-point mode of transport that fills the gaps in fixed-route train, tram and bus services. In particular, taxis are the only mode of transport available to a range of groups which cannot drive a motor vehicle and cannot access <b>other</b> public <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> due to factors such as age, disability or where they live.|$|R

30|$|The Station {{subsystem}} performs two functions—respectively interface and storage—firstly, {{for passengers}} and secondly, for vehicles. With regard to passengers, the interface function links a particular service line (route) {{to all the}} <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> (another route or another mode), whilst the storage function concentrates travellers within vehicles or waiting areas prior to vehicle loading. As regards the vehicles, the interface function separates the upstream and downstream parts of the route, hinging around the unloading of alighting passengers and the loading of boarding passengers; the storage function pertains to the division of platforms and tracks within the station between vehicles {{on the basis of}} their real-time allocation (operational service or temporary immobilisation).|$|E
30|$|In the 1980 s the {{positive}} experience with deregulated transport markets {{in countries like}} the US and the UK {{as well as an}} increasing pressure from the European Communities (EC) to also open transport markets for firms established in other EC member states led to a change in the German transport policy. The markets for air transport services as well as for road haulage have been liberalized, following a step-wise approach. Deutsche Lufthansa was fully privatized. The implementation of the European railway packages facilitated competition in railway markets. According to the Rail Liberalization Index, only Sweden and the UK show a higher degree of liberalization than Germany [32, 33]. DB provides rail as well as several <b>other</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> (regional and local bus transport, worldwide logistics via its branch DB Schenker). In 2015, DB’s market share was 61 % (based on ton kilometers) in rail cargo and 71 % (based on train kilometers) in regional passenger rail transport [22]. There is hardly any competition in the long-haul passenger market. Against this background, the Monopolies Commission (an independent advisory body to the German government and parliament) recommends a full vertical separation between infrastructure and operation in order to foster competition in the railway sector [38]. The prohibition of scheduled long-haul bus services, which had been introduced in the 1930 s to protect the railroad operator, lasted until the year 2013 [23]. Since then, the market for scheduled long-haul bus services has shown a tremendous growth [2].|$|E

25|$|The prime statute {{regulating}} bus {{services in}} Victoria is the Transport Integration Act 2010. The Act established the Department of Transport as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system. The Act also established {{and set the}} charters of the state agencies charged with providing public <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> including buses. The now-defunct Director of Public Transport was empowered by the Act to enter into contracts with operators {{for the provision of}} bus and <b>other</b> public <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> That function was taken over by Public Transport Victoria in 2012. Specific provisions relating to the contracting regime for buses in Victoria are set out in the Bus Services Act 1995.|$|R
