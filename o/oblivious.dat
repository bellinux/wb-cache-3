5|$|The scheme did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} enthusiasm, and from the beginning, there were some who doubted the true intentions of the promoters. Although many of the sinuous curves and deviations were due to having to maintain a 1 in 50 gradient {{where there was no}} leeway (most observers being <b>oblivious</b> to the fact that a straighter shorter line would have made the gradient even steeper), several were due to resistance by local landowners along the route.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many of them because he was <b>oblivious</b> to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E
