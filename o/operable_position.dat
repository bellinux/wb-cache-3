40|$|A {{foldable}} walker includes upstanding legs {{arranged in}} a generally square pattern, {{each of which is}} capped by a fixed joint member and each of which has a slider member slideably disposed on it. Two forward legs are interconnected by two rigid links {{arranged in a}} scissors arrangement with the uppermost end of each link pivotally connected to a fixed joint member and the lowermost end of each link pivotally connected to a slider. Each forward leg is interconnected to its associated rearward leg in the same way. Each pair of rigid links is interconnected to one another by a pivot pin. The linkage enables the width and the depth of the walker to be reduced to a very small space and telescoping legs reduce the height dimension of the walker. Handles are folded when the walker is stored and pivoted into their <b>operable</b> <b>position</b> when the walker is deployed...|$|E
40|$|Embodiments {{of systems}} and methods for {{enhancing}} {{the performance of}} rotary wing aircraft through reduced torque, noise and vibration are disclosed. In one embodiment, a method includes configuring the rotorcraft in a selected flight condition, communicating input signals to a control system <b>operable</b> to <b>position</b> sails coupled to tips of blades of a rotor assembly, processing the input signals according to a constraint condition to generate sail positional information, and transferring the sail positional information to the sail. Alternately, input signals may be communicated to a control system <b>operable</b> to <b>position</b> a plurality of sails, each sail having an aerodynamic shape and positioned proximate to a tip portion of the rotor blade. The input signals may be configured to rotate each sail about a longitudinal axis into a corresponding pitch angle independently of the other sails...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} a newly-developed compact heat removal system (HRS) with water used for coolant, <b>operable</b> in any <b>position</b> in space. In conditions of forced convection at output power of 120 Wt (160 Wt input power) thermal {{resistance of the}} HRS is 0. 1 K/Wt and the system provides the average temperature of the cooled object over the range of 58 to 60 Â°C. Heat transfer characteristics of the HRS can be improved, as there is potential for its modification...|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} discloses {{systems and}} methods {{for the performance}} enhancement of rotary wing aircraft through reduced torque, noise and vibration. In one embodiment, a system includes a sail having an aerodynamic shape positioned proximate to a tip of the rotor blade. An actuator may be configured to rotate the sail relative to the blade tip. a A control system receives information from a rotorcraft system and commands the actuator to rotate the sail to a predetermined favorable rotor blade operating condition. In another embodiment, a method includes configuring the rotorcraft in a selected flight condition, communicating input signals to a control system <b>operable</b> to <b>position</b> sails coupled to tips of blades of a rotor assembly, processing the input signals according to a constraint condition to generate sail positional information, and transferring the sail positional information to the sail...|$|R
5000|$|The {{abstract}} for the [...] "pattern generator {{for a light}} fixture" [...] reads: An apparatus {{includes a}} first flexible material that has a first area with a first texture that produces a first predetermined amount of diffusion of {{a beam of light}}, where the first texture produces at least some diffusion in the beam of light. The apparatus also includes a second flexible material attached to a first portion of the first area, where the second flexible material reduces the amount of diffusion of the beam of light produced by the first texture of the first portion of the first area. A light fixture includes a light fixture and the first flexible material coupled to a scrolling mechanism. The scrolling mechanism is <b>operable</b> to <b>position</b> a selected area of the first flexible material such that a beam of light from the light source passes through a first area of the first flexible material.|$|R
