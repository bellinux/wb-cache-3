The society began planning the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> at Jennings Park in 1986, {{but was unable to}} raise enough funds to begin construction until 2012. The museum opened on March 19, 2016, coinciding with the 125th anniversary of the city's incorporation, using donated funds to finish construction.|$|E
5|$|The idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> {{dedicated}} {{to the work of}} Hergé {{can be traced back to}} the end of the 1970s, when Hergé was still alive. After his death in 1983, Hergé's widow, Fanny, led the efforts, undertaken at first by the Hergé Foundation and then by the new Studios Hergé, to catalogue and choose the artwork and elements that would become part of the Museum's exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|The postwar {{communist}} regime developed {{the city as}} an industrial and commercial centre. It was elevated to the status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> town, {{as it was the}} birthplace of the leader of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, Enver Hoxha, who had been born there in 1908. His house was converted into a museum.|$|E

5|$|Even though Champollion {{was appalled}} by the rampant looting of ancient {{artefacts}} and destruction of monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts be strictly controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Leicester House was {{intermittently}} inhabited {{during the}} mid-18th century, and was finally {{sold to the}} naturalist Ashton Lever in 1775. Lever turned the house into a museum with {{a significant amount of}} natural history objects. In turn, the square began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments. Brothels started appearing around Leicester Square during the century, and visitors could pay to watch the severed heads of traitors executed at Temple Bar through a telescope. Leicester House became home <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> of natural curiosities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s. It was demolished in 1791–72 due to rising debts following the extinction of the Leicester peerage, and replaced by Leicester Place. That in turn was converted into a church in 1865 and is now the site of the Prince Charles Cinema.|$|E

5|$|The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago {{was created}} {{as the result}} of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics, {{collectors}} and dealers at the home of critic Doris Lane Butler to bring the long-discussed idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> of contemporary art to complement the city's Art Institute of Chicago, according to a grand opening story in Time. It opened in fall 1967 in a small space at 237 East Ontario Street that had for a time served as the corporate offices of Playboy Enterprises. Its first director was Jan van der Marck. In 1970 he invited Wolf Vostell to make the Concrete Traffic sculpture in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} in military ownership, {{but it became}} more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> from the 1920s onwards. During the Second World War, the castle was still in service {{as part of the}} Magazine Establishment and was damaged by two enemy bombs which fell in 1941. The bombing dislodged pieces of plaster in the castle's south tower and gatehouse, under which were discovered old graffiti, including a drawing of a ship dated to around 1700.|$|E

50|$|Accessioning is the formal, {{legal process}} <b>of</b> {{accepting}} <b>an</b> object into <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> collection.

5|$|The {{collection}} {{was at first}} housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, {{to put it on}} public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to support the opening <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> in August 1997. By 2003, it was attracting 5,200 visitors a year, of which 4,200 were from abroad. He put the museum up for sale in 2003, but also offered it to the city of Reykjavík as a gift. However, he was unsuccessful in obtaining financial support from the state or city. When he retired in 2004, he could no longer afford the rent on the museum's premises.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort is}} {{endorsed}} {{by the government of}} Sri Lanka, which has agreed to assist with demarcating the country's mangroves. The Sri Lankan navy has assisted with the effort to replant mangroves in several deforested areas, and President Maithripala Sirisena has attended several Sudeesa functions, including the opening <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> funded by the project designed to educate visitors about the mangrove ecosystem's ecological and economic importance. Following the success of its first nationwide project, Seacology is considering a similar effort in another island country.|$|E
5|$|Following The Red Sea Sharks (1958) and {{its large}} number of characters, Tintin in Tibet differs from other stories in the series in that it {{features}} only a few familiar characters and is also Hergé's only adventure not to pit Tintin against an antagonist. Themes in Hergé's story include extrasensory perception, the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, and friendship. Tintin in Tibet has been translated into 32 languages, is highly regarded by critics, and has been praised by the Dalai Lama, who awarded it the Light of Truth Award. The story was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Tintin in Tibet was adapted for television, radio, documentary, theatre, and a video game, and {{has been the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> exhibition.|$|E

5|$|In the mid- to late 1970s Kujau, an able amateur artist, {{turned to}} {{producing}} paintings which he claimed were by Hitler, {{who had been}} an amateur artist as a young man. Having found a market for his forged works, Kujau created Hitler paintings depicting subjects his buyers expressed interest in, such as cartoons, nudes and men in action—all subjects that Hitler never painted, or would want to paint, according to Charles Hamilton, a handwriting expert and author of books on forgery. These paintings were often accompanied by small notes, purportedly from Hitler. The paintings were profitable for Kujau. To explain his access to the memorabilia he invented several sources in East Germany, including a former Nazi general, the bribable director <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>museum</b> and his own brother, who he re-invented as a general in the East German army.|$|E
