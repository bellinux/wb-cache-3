5|$|During the inter-war {{years the}} {{navigation}} struggled {{to hold its}} own against competition from the railways and later the roads, and was affected by miners' strikes in the coal industry. Traffic was spasmodic, rising from 381,727 tonnes in 1926, {{the year of the}} general strike, to 815,329 tonnes in 1937, but much of the latter was short-haul traffic, rather than long-haul, and the revenues did not increase correspondingly. In an agreement with Hatfield Main Colliery and the Aire and Calder, Bramwith Lock on the Stainforth and Keadby Canal was lengthened in 1932, to allow compartment boats to be used for the coal traffic, while straightening <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretch</b> near Doncaster and {{the construction of a new}} warehouse and wharf were largely funded by Doncaster Corporation in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Delaware Route 9 Truck (DE 9 Truck) is a truck bypass <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretch</b> of DE 9 {{south of}} New Castle. It heads {{northwest}} from DE 9 on two-lane undivided Hamburg Road, passing through farmland with some development. In Tybouts Corner, the truck route turns northeast to join US 13 on the four-lane divided South Dupont Highway. The road passes through farmland with some {{residential and commercial}} development. Farther north, the road heads into business areas, passing under Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary railroad line before intersecting US 40 in State Road. At this point, US 40 joins US 13 and DE 9 Truck, with the road widening to eight lanes. In Hares Corner, DE 9 Truck turns east to follow DE 273 on two-lane undivided Frenchtown Road, heading east between business parks {{to the south and}} farm fields to the north. DE 9 Truck ends along with DE 273 at an intersection with DE 9 and the southern terminus of DE 141 west of New Castle.|$|E

The photographs accompanied the installation Journey into Fear (also 2001), which is based on Norman Foster's 1942 war-time thriller of the same name and its remake, shot in Vancouver in 1975 and directed by Daniel Mann.

25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} III can terminate transcription efficiently without {{involvement of}} additional factors. The Pol III termination signal consists <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretch</b> of thymines (on the nontemplate strand) located within 40bp downstream from the 3' end of mature RNAs. The poly-T termination signal pauses Pol III and causes it {{to back track}} to the nearest RNA hairpin to become a “dead-end” complex. Consistent with the allosteric mechanism of termination, the RNA hairpin allosterically opens Pol III and causes the elongation complex to disintegrate. The extensive structure embedded in the Pol III-transcript thus {{is responsible for the}} factor-independent release of Pol III {{at the end of a}} gene. RNA-duplex-dependent termination is an ancient mechanism that dates back to the last universal common ancestor.|$|E

NY366 proceeds eastward along Mitchell Street, a two-lane residential street until the intersecting with Ithaca Road, where NY366 turns to the north on Ithaca. Mitchell Street continues eastward, becoming County Route110 (CR110) at the city line. This intersection also served as the former western terminus of NY393, a designation eliminated in 1980. NY366 enters the neighborhood of North Belle Sherman, bending northward as Dryden Road after the intersection with Maple Avenue. After the intersection, NY366 passes along the southern edge of the campus for Cornell University. Heading northeast out of the city, the route intersects with CR122 (Caldwell Road) at {{the eastern edge of the}} campus.

25|$|A {{criticism}} {{of this approach}} is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretch</b> to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.|$|E

40|$|A {{conjugate}} {{heat transfer}} problem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second-grade viscoelastic fluid past a stretch-ing sheet has been studied. Governing equations include heat conduction equation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> sheet, continuity equation, momentum equation, and energy equation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second-grade fluid, analyzed by <b>a</b> combination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series expansion method, the sim-ilarity transformation, and a second-order accurate finite-difference method. These so-lutions {{are used to}} iterate with the heat conduction equation of the stretching sheet to obtain distributions of the local convective heat transfer coefficient and the stretching sheet temperature. Ranges of dimensionless parameters, the Prandtl number Pr, the elas-tic number E and the conduction-convection coefficient Ncc are from 0. 001 to 10, 0. 0001 to 0. 01, and 0. 5 to 2. 0, respectively. A parameter G, {{which is used to}} represent the dom-inance of the buoyant effect, is present in governing equations. Results indicated that elastic effect in the flow could increase the local heat transfer coefficient and enhance the heat transfer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> sheet. In addition, same as the results from Newtonian fluid flow and conduction analysis <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>stretching</b> sheet, <b>a</b> better heat transfer is obtained with a larger Ncc, G, and E.
