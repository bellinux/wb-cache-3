40|$|National audienceIn {{the present}} work we observe two {{subjects}} interacting in a collaborative task on a shared environment. During the experiment we measured the task completion time under two different conditions: either one interactant is wearing dark glasses and hence his/her gaze is not visible {{by the other}} one or no interactant is wearing dark glasses. The results show that if one subject wears dark glasses while telling the <b>other</b> <b>subject</b> {{the position of a}} certain object, the <b>other</b> <b>subject</b> needs significantly more time to locate and move this object. Hence, eye gaze - when visible - of one subject looking at a certain object speeds up the location of the cube by the <b>other</b> <b>subject...</b>|$|R

5|$|When he {{graduated}} from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the K. Ranganatha Rao prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum. He received a scholarship to study at Government Arts College, Kumbakonam, but was so intent on mathematics {{that he could not}} focus on any <b>other</b> <b>subjects</b> and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process. In August 1905, Ramanujan ran away from home, heading towards Visakhapatnam, and stayed in Rajahmundry for about a month. He later enrolled at Pachaiyappa's College in Madras. There he passed in mathematics, choosing only to attempt questions that appealed to him and leaving the rest unanswered, but performed poorly in <b>other</b> <b>subjects,</b> such as English, physiology and Sanskrit. Ramanujan failed his Fellow of Arts exam in December 1906 and again a year later. Without a FA degree, he left college and continued to pursue independent research in mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation.|$|E

5|$|Hebel was {{interested}} in botany, natural history and <b>other</b> <b>subjects.</b> His literary work began with Allemannische Gedichte, which {{is perhaps the most}} popular work written in Alemannic. He had success with his calendar stories in the Badischer Landkalender, and later with Rheinländischer Hausfreund (Rhenish family friend), but a dispute between Catholics forced him to resign as editor of the calendar. In his last years he devoted himself increasingly to religion, becoming a prelate in 1819, but his wish to become a parish priest was never fulfilled. His last works were biblical stories for young readers, which served as textbooks until 1855. Hebel died 1826 in Schwetzingen. Goethe, Tolstoy, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hesse and other writers have praised his works.|$|E
