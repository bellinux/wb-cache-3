60|$|But, {{it may be}} said, that it is biology, and not geology, which {{asks for}} so much time--that the {{succession}} of life demands vast intervals; but this appears {{to me to be}} reasoning in a circle. Biology takes her time from geology. The only reason we have for believing in the slow rate of the change in living forms is the fact that they persist through a series of deposits which, geology informs us, have taken a long while to make. If the geological clock is wrong, all the naturalist will {{have to do is to}} modify his notions of the rapidity of change accordingly. And I venture to point out that, when we are told that the limitation of the period during which living beings have inhabited this planet to one, two, or three hundred million years requires a complete revolution in geological speculation, the <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> rests on the maker of the assertion, who brings forward not a shadow of evidence in its support.|$|E

Now there is a rule, formed upon a just, solid {{presumption}} of law, that, if you find a man guilty of one offence contrary to known law, whenever there is a suspicious case against him of the same nature, the <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> that he is not guilty is turned upon him. Therefore, when I find the regulations broken,--when I find farms given of more than a lac of rupees,--when I find them given to the Governor-General's own banian, contrary to the principle of the regulation, contrary, I say, in the strongest way to it,--when I find that he accumulates farms beyond the regulated number,--when I find all these things done, and besides that the banian has great balances of account against him,--then, by the presumption of law, I am bound to believe that all this was done, not for the servants, but for the master.|$|E
6000|$|God is an {{hypothesis}}, and, as such, {{stands in}} need of proof: the <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> rests on the theist. Sir Isaac Newton says: Hypotheses non fingo, quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non deducitur hypothesis vocanda est, et hypothesis vel metaphysicae, vel physicae, vel qualitatum occultarum, seu mechanicae, in philosophia locum non habent. To all proofs {{of the existence of}} a creative God apply this valuable rule. We see a variety of bodies possessing a variety of powers: we merely know their effects; we {{are in a state of}} ignorance with respect to their essences and causes. These Newton calls the phenomena of things; but the pride of philosophy is unwilling to admit its ignorance of their causes. From the phenomena, which are the objects of our senses, we attempt to infer a cause, which we call God, and gratuitously endow it with all negative and contradictory qualities. From this hypothesis we invent this general name, to conceal our ignorance of causes and essences. The being called God by no means answers with the conditions prescribed by Newton; it bears every mark of a veil woven by philosophical conceit, to hide the ignorance of philosophers even from themselves. They borrow the threads of its texture from the anthropomorphism of the vulgar. Words have been used by sophists for the same purposes, from the occult qualities of the peripatetics to the effluvium of Boyle and the crinities or nebulae of Herschel. God is represented as infinite, eternal, incomprehensible; He is contained under every predicate in non that the logic of ignorance could fabricate. Even His worshippers allow that it is impossible to form any idea of Him: they exclaim with the French poet, ...|$|E

A 'formulary,' it seems, is a [...] collection of formulas, and formulas are simply propositions of [...] whatever kind touching religious faith. All such propositions, if [...] they cannot be accepted by all Christian denominations, are to be [...] proscribed; and it is added significantly that the Jews also are a [...] denomination, and so that any teaching distinctively Christian is [...] perhaps to be excluded, lest it should interfere with their freedom [...] and rights. Are we then to fall back on the simple reading of the [...] letter of the Bible? No! this, it is granted, would be an 'unworthy [...] pretence.' The teacher is to give 'grammatical, geographical, or [...] historical explanations;' but he is to keep clear of 'theology [...] proper,' because, as Professor Huxley takes great pains to prove, [...] there is no theological teaching which is not opposed by some sect [...] or other, from Roman Catholicism on the one hand to Unitarianism on [...] the other. It was not, perhaps, hard to see that this difficulty [...] would be started; and to those who, like Professor Huxley look at [...] it theoretically, without much practical experience of schools, it [...] may appear serious or unanswerable. But there is very little in it [...] practically; when it is faced determinately and handled firmly, it [...] will soon shrink into its true dimensions. The class who are least [...] frightened at it are the school teachers, simply because they know [...] most about it. It is quite clear that the school managers must be [...] cautioned against allowing their schools to be made places of [...] proselytism: but when this is done, the case is simple enough. [...] Leave the masters under this general understanding to teach freely; [...] if there in ground of complaint, let it be made, but leave the [...] <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> on the objectors. For extreme peculiarities of [...] belief or unbelief there is the Conscience Clause; as to the mass [...] of parents, they will be more anxious to have religion taught than [...] afraid of its assuming this or that particular shade. They will [...] trust the school managers and teachers till they have reason to [...] distrust them, and experience has shown that they may trust them [...] safely enough. Any attempt to throw the burden of making the [...] teaching undenominational upon the managers must be sternly [...] resisted: it is simply evading the intentions of the Act in an [...] elaborate attempt to carry them out. We thank Professor Huxley for [...] the warning. To be forewarned is to be forearmed." ...|$|E
60|$|What is Life? Were such a {{question}} proposed, we should be tempted to answer, what is not Life that really is? Our reason convinces us that the quantities of things, taken abstractedly as quantity, exist only in the relations they bear to the percipient; in plainer words, they exist only in our minds, ut quorum esse est percipi. For if the definite quantities have a ground, and therefore a reality, in the external world, and independent of the mind that perceives them, this ground is ipso facto a quality; the very etymon of this world showing that a quality, not taken in its own nature but in relation to another thing, is to be defined causa sufficiens, entia, de quibus loquimur; esse talia, qualia sunt. Either the quantities perceived exist only in the perception, or they have likewise a real existence. In the former case, the quality (the word is here used in an active sense) that determines them belongs to Life, per ipsam hypothesin; {{and in the other}} case, since by the agreement of all parties Life may exist in other forms than those of consciousness, or even of sensibility, the <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> falls on those who assert of any quality that it is not Life. For the analogy of all that we know is clearly in favour of the contrary supposition, and if a man would analyse the meaning of his own words, and carefully distinguish his perceptions and sensations from the external cause exciting them, {{and at the same time}} from the quantity or superficies under which that cause is acting, he would instantly find himself, if we mistake not, involuntarily identifying the ideas of Quality and Life. Life, it is admitted on all hands, does not necessarily imply consciousness or sensibility; and we, for our parts, cannot see that the irritability which metals manifest to galvanism, can be more remote from that which may be supposed to exist in the tribe of lichens, or in the helvell√¶, pezizee, &c., than the latter is from the phenomena of excitability in the human body, whatever name it may be called by, or in whatever way it may modify itself.(8) That the mere act of growth does not constitute the idea of Life, or the absence of that act exclude it, we have a proof in every egg before it is placed under the hen, and in every grain of corn before it is put into the soil. All that could be deduced by fair reasoning would amount to this only, that the life of metals, as the power which effects and determines their comparative cohesion, ductility, &c., was yet lower on the scale than the Life which produces the first attempts of organization, in the almost shapeless tremella, or in such fungi as grow in the dark recesses of the mine.|$|E

50|$|The {{burden of}} proof (<b>onus</b> <b>probandi)</b> {{is the duty of}} a party in a trial to produce the {{evidence}} that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets the benefit of the doubt, while the other side bears the {{burden of proof}}. When a party bearing the burden of proof meets their burden, the burden of proof switches to the other side. Burdens may be of different kinds for each party, in different phases of litigation. The burden of production is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the trier of fact to consider a disputed claim. After litigants have met the burden of production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have the burden of persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different standards of persuasiveness ranging from a preponderance of the evidence, where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.|$|E

40|$|O √¥nus da prova tem sido tradicionalmente distribu√≠do no processo civil brasileiro segundo disposi√ß√µes legais pr√©vias, contidas em geral no artigo 333 do C√≥digo de Processo Civil e que em geral seguem os brocados jur√≠dicos <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> incumbit ei qui allegat, probatio incumbit asserenti e semper necessitas probandi incumbit illi quit agit. Nos √∫ltimos anos, no entanto, tem crescido na doutrina e na jurisprud√™ncia a tend√™ncia de atribuir o <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> √† parte que supostamente tem mais facilidade em produzir a prova nos autos, independentemente da distribui√ß√£o predeterminada pela lei. A inspira√ß√£o para esta mudan√ßa vem da teoria {{argentina}} das cargas probat√≥rias din√¢micas, introduzida pelo juiz Jorge Peyrano e que teria suas ra√≠zes, supostamente, no trabalho de Jeremy Bentham. O projeto de um novo C√≥digo de Processo Civil, que est√° sendo discutido no Congresso Nacional, muito provavelmente incluir√° disposi√ß√£o autorizado expressamente que o juiz desloque o √¥nus da prova de uma parte para a outra quando entender que esta √∫ltima tem melhores condi√ß√µes de produz√≠-la. Os riscos invocados contra esta teoria s√£o o aumento da inseguran√ßa jur√≠dica, da possibilidade de arbitrariedade do julgador e da dificuldade de estabelecer previs√µes sobre sucesso processual, impedindo que as partes possam tomar as melhores decis√µes sobre como se portar antes e durante um eventual processo. Tamb√©m h√° cr√≠tica contra o enfraquecimento da imparcialidade do juiz, o que, segundo os defensores da teoria, n√£o ocorreria. Uma an√°lise dos argumentos contra e a favor da teoria do √¥nus din√¢mico da prova, dos instrumentos j√° existentes no direito brasileiro para os problemas que esta teoria vida atacar, e das novas disposi√ß√µes legais a serem em breve introduzidas demonstra que existe uma linha t√™nue a ser tra√ßada e seguida para que se atinjam os benef√≠cios pretendidos, sem cair em novos problemas. √â importante adotar e interpretar as novas normas processuais cuidadosa e atenciosamente, de modo a evitar preju√≠zo a garantias b√°sicas dos jurisdicionados. Burden {{of proof}} {{in the sense}} of burden of production has been traditionally established in Brazilian Civil Procedure by statute law, often associated with the Latin maxims <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> incumbit ei qui allegat, probatio incumbit asserenti and semper necessitas probandi incumbit illi quit agit. However, there has been a growing tendency between scholars and civil courts over the last years to shift the burden of proof to the party who could more easily produce the evidence, in despite of the statutory provisions on the matter. Inspiration for this change comes from the Argentinean legal theory of dynamic burden of proof introduced by Jorge Peyrano and with its roots supposedly rested on the work of Jeremy Bentham. A bill for a new Civil Procedure Code is being discussed in Brazilian Parliament and shall probably provide authorisation for judges to shift the burden of proof from one party to another when he thinks it is easier to the latest to produce the evidence needed. The risks involved in this new way of asserting the burden of proof are the increase of legal uncertainty, abuse of discretion and unpredictability of judicial outcomes, preventing parties from making better choices of how to conduct themselves before and during a legal case. There is also criticism regarding the weakening of judicial impartialness, something that for the adepts of this new theory just does not happen. An analysis of the arguments for and against the theory of dynamic burden of proof, the remedies already available in Brazilian law for the problems this theory is supposed to solve, and the new legal provisions to be soon introduced demonstrates that there is a thin line to be traced and followed in order to achieve the desired benefits without falling onto its feared pitfalls. It is important to adopt and construct the new procedural rules carefully and with caution in order to avoid infringement of basic guarantees...|$|E
40|$|Once the {{evidence}} is administered, the court has to judge {{it in order to}} decide whether to sentence thedefendant who was taken legal action against, for committing a crime set out in criminal law. Approaching the issue of evidence judgment in the criminal trial {{in the light of the}} provisions of otherstates‚Äô criminal legislations requires a comparative analysis of the two legal systems: Roman-German and thecommon law system. Does this comparative approach really have a basis?The leading rule in the Roman-German system is the rejection of legal evidence (which implies conviction ifthere is evidence) and acknowledgement of {{the evidence}} freedom system: the judge is free to judge the evidence,being allowed to pass the sentence when he is convinced that the defendant is guilty, after examining all theadministered evidence.

40|$|Having the actori incubit <b>onus</b> <b>probandi</b> apothegm as a {{starting}} point, we shall examine the particular aspects of probation in work -related conflicts, as stipulated in the 272 - 273 Article within the 53 / 2003 Law regarding The Labour Code and 212 Article within 62 / 2011 Law on Social Dialogue. The objective {{of this paper is}} to examine distinct features related to the functions of evidence, to the set of fundamental principles which underlie the judicial proceedings of probation in work -related conflicts, as well as the active role of the judge in order to assure a righteous and fair trial. All the elements referred to will be regarded from historical, hermeneutic, teleological and comparative points of view. The specific character of regulations underpinning the management procedures regarding probation in work -related conflicts, differing from the provisions under statutory law, highlights the legislator's choice towards establishing a simple and urgent procedure. It should be adjusted to the work terms and to the individual right to work, representing a genuine guarantee for bringing the law claims which derive from adequate or inadequate performance of individual or collective contracts, performed by the employer. Examples provided by judicial practice uncloak the difficulties encountered by both parties of the trial and court when it comes to enforcing the specific provisions for the application of the legislation, fact which is not always compatible with the legislature‚Äôs aim, by means of regulation. ...|$|E
