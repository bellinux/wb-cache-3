500|$|The social pre-wiring {{hypothesis}} was proved correct, [...] "The central advance <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> the demonstration that 'social actions' are already {{performed in the}} second trimester of gestation. Starting from the 14th week of gestation twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of social behavior: when the context enables it, {{as in the case}} of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} consequence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> {{that if we}} {{can find}} an affine transformation [...] such that [...] is a constant times the unit matrix, then we obtain a fixed-point that is invariant to affine transformations (Lindeberg 1994 section 15.4; Lindeberg and Garding 1997). For the purpose of practical implementation, this property can often be reached by in either of two main ways. The first approach is based on transformations of the smoothing filters and consists of: ...|$|E

50|$|A notable {{limitation}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} researchers examined young adults, {{rather than the}} population at-large.

30|$|A {{limitation}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> that cone-beam {{computed tomography}} {{was not used}} to examine discision and piezocision cuts. Although cone-beam computed tomography is a reliable method in three-dimensional imaging, we did not prefer it to not give the patients extra radiation doses. Another limitation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> that disc saw may damage alveolar soft tissues, so the operator must consider it.|$|R
