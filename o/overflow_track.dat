50|$|Physical records {{can have}} any size {{up to the}} limit of a track, but some devices had a <b>track</b> <b>overflow</b> feature that allowed {{breaking}} a large block into track-size segments within the same cylinder.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Due to {{increasing}} design complexities, routing congestion {{has become a}} critical problem in VLSI designs. This paper introduces a distributed metric to predict routing congestion and applies it to technology mapping that targets area and delay optimization. Our technology mapping algorithms are guided by a probabilistic congestion map for the subject graph to identify the congested regions, where congestion-optimal matches are favored. Experimental results {{on a set of}} benchmark circuits in a 90 nm technology show that congestion-aware mapping results in a reduction of 37 %, on an average, in <b>track</b> <b>overflows</b> with marginal gate-area penalty as compared to conventional areaoriented technology mapping. For delay-oriented mapping, our algorithm improves <b>track</b> <b>overflows</b> by 20 %, on an average, in addition to preserving or improving the delay, as compared to the conventional method...|$|R
500|$|CenturyLink Field is {{bordered by}} the Pioneer Square, International District, and Industrial District neighborhoods of Seattle. The stadium's {{referendum}} approval required a transportation management program to coordinate transportation options. First & Goal's facility lease agreement {{also included a}} provision to ease gridlock. A [...] "Dual Event Agreement" [...] with Safeco Field was established so that two events with a combined attendance of over 58,000 would not occur within four hours of each other. The agreement was also implemented to coordinate mass transit to the stadiums on game days. Local and regional buses service the area with stops within three blocks of the stadium, and the county's Metro bus service offers express routes from several area park and ride lots for games. Trains service the stadium through Seattle's King Street Station and <b>overflow</b> <b>tracks</b> accommodate extra trains during events. Regional commuter trains operate on Sundays if the Seahawks have a home game. Trains also run for mid-day Sounders FC games on Saturdays. In 2008, the commuter trains carried 64,000 event goers to the two nearby stadiums. Amtrak, primarily through the Pacific Northwest corridor's Cascades route, also serves the station. On July 18, 2009, light rail service between SeaTac and downtown began in time for an exhibition match between the Sounders and Chelsea. The light rail connects to the baseball and football stadiums via the Stadium station. The International District / Chinatown station also offers convenient access.|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} General Motors {{products}} were assembled in Tarrytown over the years; most were Chevrolet products, {{starting with the}} Chevrolet Series 490. Its last vehicles produced were GM's second generation minivans. These were the Chevrolet Lumina APV, Pontiac TranSport, and Oldsmobile Silhouette, but sluggish sales spelled the end for GM's Tarrytown operations with its 2100 employees. It was closed {{at the end of}} June 1996 when production of minivans was moved to Doraville Assembly in Georgia. Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line runs through the property, and some of the siding tracks that used to serve the factory have been taken over by Metro-North as <b>overflow</b> storage <b>tracks</b> for Maintenance of Way equipment.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} design complexity, routing congestion {{has become a}} critical problem in VLSI designs. This paper introduces a distributed metric to predict routing congestion for a premapped netlist and applies it to technology mapping that targets area optimization. Our technology mapping algorithm is guided by a probabilistic congestion map for the subject graph to identify the congested regions. Experimental results on the benchmark circuits in a 90 nm technology show that congestion-aware mapping results in a reduction of 37 %, on an average, in <b>track</b> <b>overflows</b> as compared to conventional technology mapping...|$|R
50|$|In some cases, {{three-way}} comparison can be simulated {{by subtracting}} A and B and examining {{the sign of}} the result, exploiting special instructions for examining the sign of a number. However, this requires the type of A and B to have a well-defined difference. Fixed-width signed integers may overflow when they are subtracted, floating-point numbers have the value NaN with undefined sign, and character strings have no difference function corresponding to their total order. At the machine level, <b>overflow</b> is typically <b>tracked</b> and can be used to determine order after subtraction, but this information is not usually available to higher-level languages.|$|R
40|$|Abnormal {{motor cortex}} {{activity}} {{is common in}} dystonia. Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation may alter cortical activity by decreasing excitability while anodal stimulation may increase motor learning. Previous results showed that a single session of cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation can improve symptoms in childhood dystonia. Here we performed a 5 -day, sham-controlled, double-blind, crossover study, where we measured <b>tracking</b> and muscle <b>overflow</b> in a myocontrol-based task. We applied cathodal and anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (2 mA, 9 minutes per day). For cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (7 participants), 3 subjects showed improvements whereas 2 showed worsening in <b>overflow</b> or <b>tracking</b> error. The effect size was small (about 1 % of maximum voluntary contraction) and not clinically meaningful. For anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (6 participants), none showed improvement, whereas 5 showed worsening. Thus, multiday cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation reduced symptoms in some children but not to a clinically meaningful extent, whereas anodal transcranial direct current stimulation worsened symptoms. Our results do not support transcranial direct current sti-mulation as clinically viable for treating childhood dystonia...|$|R
40|$|Routing {{congestion}} {{has become}} a serious concern in today’s VLSI designs. In this paper, we propose a technology mapping algorithm that minimizes routing congestion under delay constraints. The algorithm employs a dynamic programming framework in the matching phase to generate probabilistic congestion maps for all the matches. These congestion maps are then utilized to minimize routing congestion during the covering, which preserves the delayoptimality of the solution using the notion of slack. Experimental results on benchmark circuits in a 100 nm technology show that the algorithm can improve <b>track</b> <b>overflows</b> by 44 %, on an average, {{as compared to the}} conventional technology mapping while satisfying delay constraints...|$|R

40|$|Combined sewage {{overflows}} {{have created}} favorable {{conditions for the}} establishment of the southern house mosquito, Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), larvae in natural creeks that would otherwise be unsuitable for the development of this mosquito species. Here, we show the results from a seminatural experiment carried over the three seasons of mosquito activity (spring, summer, and fall) in Tanyard Creek, Atlanta, GA. In this study we manipulated the amount of nutrients by further enriching combined sewage <b>overflow</b> water, and <b>tracked</b> weather variables, organic nutrient concentration, exposure time to conspecifics, and the number of egg rafts collected in experimental containers. We found season and nutrient enrichment {{to be the most important}} variables explaining the differences in egg rafts counts. Further analyses suggest that temperature may also play a role in seasonal oviposition patterns. The results from this study suggest that nutrient enrichment and adequate temperatures are important factors shaping Cx. quinquefasciatus oviposition seasonality in combined sewage overflows...|$|R
40|$|ADAS is the {{air defense}} control system {{performing}} air surveillance and identification of ROK and near air. This system is self-developed by Air Force, currently operated successfully as the alternative system of MCRC. ADAS processes converting and combining transferred the real time radar data detected by radars. additionally, it displays significant radar data as producing in tracks. Then, {{it uses the}} message queue for IPC(Inter Process Communication). the various tactical data processed in the server is ultimately send to the network management process through the message queue for transmitting to the weapon director console. the weapon director receives this transmitted tactical data through the console to execute air defense operations. However, {{there is a problem}} that data packet is delayed or lost since the weapon Director does not receive as the amount of tactical data from the server <b>overflowed</b> with air <b>tracks</b> and missions increased. This paper improved the algorism to display and transmit the various tactical data processed from ADAS server to numbers of the weapon director console in the real time without any delay or lost. Improved the algorism, established at exercise, the development server in the real operation network and the weapon director console, is proved by comparing the number of sending tactical data packets in the server and receiving packets in the weapon director...|$|R
