In 1952, Macmahon established {{a table of}} P(n) for the first 200 values <b>of</b> n. <b>This</b> <b>paper</b> showed {{how to find the}} number of partition of n by using Macmahon’s table. In 1742, Euler also stated the series in the enumeration <b>of</b> partitions. <b>This</b> <b>Paper</b> showed how to generate the Euler’s use of series in the enumeration of partitions. In 1952, Macmahon also quoted the self-conjuate partitions <b>of</b> n. In <b>this</b> <b>Paper,</b> Macmahon’s self-conjugate partitions are explained with the help of array <b>of</b> dots. <b>This</b> <b>paper</b> showed how to prove the Euler’s Theorems with the help of Euler’s device of the introduction of a second parameter z, and showed how to prove the Theorem 3 with the help of Euler’s generating function for P(n), and also showed how t...|$|R
