5|$|Revithi {{arrived at}} the race location, the small village of Marathon, on Thursday, 9April , where the athletes had already {{assembled}} for the following day's race. She attracted the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> and was warmly greeted by Marathon's mayor, who sheltered her in his house. She answered the reporters' questions and was quick-witted when a male runner from Chalandri teased her, predicting that when she entered the Stadium, {{there would be no}} crowds left. Revithi retorted that he should not insult women, since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} gained international notoriety {{due in part}} to {{a photograph}} taken by photographer Frank Fournier of a young girl named Omayra Sánchez, who was trapped beneath rubble for three days before she died. Following the eruption, relief workers gathered around the girl, speaking with her and listening to her responses. She attracted the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> at the site because of her sense of dignity and courage, and caused controversy when people wondered why the media workers had not saved her (which was impossible without equipment).|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporters,</b> who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans {{expression}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluorescent <b>reporter</b> (Phsp- 16. 2 ::GFP) {{is driven}} by transcription of a stress-responsive promoter sequence and {{has been shown to}} predict subsequent stress resistance (thermotolerance) and lifespan of individual animals within an isogenic population (Rea et al., 2005). The mechanism behind <b>the</b> predictive nature <b>of</b> this reporter is poorly understood. To better understand how this reporter works, stress-responsive genes were examined to determine if they were required for <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> to predict thermotolerance or lifespan. Animals that had low or high expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Phsp- 16. 2 ::GFP reporter and contained loss-of-function mutations in select stress-responsive genes were tested to determine whether the animals with higher expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> still had improved thermotolerance or lifespan. The results revealed that none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tested stress-responsive genes were necessary for <b>the</b> predictive power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter.</b> In some mutants, <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> maintained its predictive ability even though the overall thermotolerance was greatly reduced. This implies that <b>the</b> predictive ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> is not linked to the stress resistance (thermotolerance) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animal, as originally expected...|$|R

25|$|While not {{commenting on}} {{the reasons for the}} {{charging}} decisions as to any other persons, we can say that the reasons why Mr. Libby was not charged with an offense directly relating to his unauthorized disclosures of classified information regarding Ms. Wilson included, but were not limited to, the fact that Mr. Libby's false testimony obscured a confident determination of what in fact occurred, particularly where the accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> with whom Mr. Libby spoke (and their notes) did not include any explicit evidence specifically proving that Mr. Libby knew that Ms. Wilson was a covert agent. On the other hand, there was clear proof of perjury and obstruction of justice which could be prosecuted in a relatively straightforward trial.|$|E
25|$|On July 1, 2005, Selig {{suspended}} Texas Rangers pitcher Kenny Rogers for 20 {{games and}} fined him US$50,000. Rogers {{got in trouble}} when on June 29, 2005, he purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman, resulting in one camera falling to the ground. When the cameraman proceeded {{to pick up his}} camera, Rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> then resumed filming and Rogers knocked him down again. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the 2005 All-Star Game in Detroit, where fans loudly booed him. On July 22, 2005, Selig heard Rogers' appeal of his suspension. Selig decided to uphold the 20 games, however, an independent arbitrator ruled that Selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to 13 games, but upheld the fine.|$|E

40|$|Here we {{describe}} a self-assembled sensing system composed of three separate modules: gold nano particles, a reporter element, and a recognition element. The gold nanoparticles {{serve as a}} multivalent platform for the interaction with both <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> and recognition element and the gold nucleus serves to affect <b>the</b> fluorescent properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reporter</b> element serves for generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> output signal. The recognition element serves to make the assay selective. The working principle is that <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> analyte with the recognition element leads to an increased affinity for the gold nanoparticle, which causes a displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> and a turn-ON of fluorescence. It is shown that <b>the</b> modular nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system permits straightforward tuning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dynamic detection range, the sensitivity, and the selectivity, simply by changing the recognition module. The system can detect Hg 2 + and Ag+ metal ions at nanomolar concentrations in aqueous buffer...|$|R
25|$|Many of {{organized}} baseball's earliest historical events {{took place at}} the park throughout the 1860s and early 1870s. The most notable event came on June 14, 1870, when the Atlantics defeated the Cincinnati Red Stockings to end their historic 84-game winning streak. Fred Goldsmith successfully demonstrated his curve ball at the Grounds in 1870, a pitch previously thought to have been only an optical illusion. In an 1865 game, Ned Cuthbert is credited with inventing the slide when he tried avoiding a tag when attempting to steal a base against the Athletic of Philadelphia. In addition to baseball, The Grounds hosted various events and exhibitions; most notably in 1873, when Washington Donaldson and two reporters attempted to fly a hot-air balloon across the Atlantic Ocean. The attempt turned tragic when the balloon crashed in Connecticut killing one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Former Minister for Social Affairs Mr Othman Wok in his {{autobiography}} mentioned {{that he had come}} to know from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporters</b> from the Utsan Melayu that the latter had already known about the potential riots even before the outbreak of the riots which raises the suspicions of the UNMO leaders of orchestrating this riot. Othman also makes references to some key important political meetings which took place among the Malay community in Singapore the politicians in Singapore to express their grievances. Accounts from the meetings prove that the Malays in Singapore had no major grievances and that UMNO’s Secretary-General Syed Ja’afar was responsible for instigating them. Some of the matters brought up by the Malay community included infrastructural issues that Malay schools faced and these issues were contrary to what the UMNO and Utusan Melayu had portrayed.|$|E

30|$|With <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> new cellular {{and gene}} therapies, {{there is a}} need for non-invasive, readily available methods for detecting and quantifying <b>the</b> fate <b>of</b> these therapies in animal and man. As a translational approach, PET and SPECT genetic reporters have shown promise and have supported numerous clinical trials [27 - 29]. Various PET/SPECT reporter proteins have been proposed including the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), the hNET and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) [16, 17, 30, 31]. Difficulties in translating these into clinic include availability of clinically approved complementary radiotracers, early planning necessary to integrate <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> protein and imaging protocol into trial design, incorporation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> gene into <b>the</b> vector without exceeding the packaging capacity or affecting cell function and limited sensitivity in tissues with endogenous expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> protein.|$|R
40|$|A label-free, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy-based assay for {{detecting}} DNA hybridization at an electrode surface and for distinguishing between mutations in DNA is demonstrated.

30|$|These {{include several}} types of in vitro assays (e.g. {{reporter}} gene assays using yeast and vertebrate cell lines), but also in vivo laboratory tests, as e.g. the Early Life Stage-test with the zebrafish Danio rerio or the growth inhibition tests with Lumbriculus variegatus or Lemna minor. <b>The</b> <b>reporter</b> gene bioassays are based on genetically modified cell lines, which have been stably transfected with specific reporter genes (e.g. firefly luciferase). Reporter genes are induced and translated in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> specifically acting compounds (e.g. estrogens, androgens etc.), and <b>the</b> enzymatic activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> protein is easily determined (e.g. measuring bioluminescence). <b>The</b> detection <b>of</b> antagonistic activity requires a background concentration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agonistic reference substance and, hence, antagonistic activity in the sample leads to a reduced expression and activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reporter</b> enzyme (i.e. decrease in luminescence or color change).
