5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a reverence for the past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... <b>of</b> <b>intercourse</b> with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E
5|$|As Lois finds Chris and {{his friends}} {{watching}} a pornographic film, she becomes convinced a proper sex-ed class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about safe sex, but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of Peter, who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform premarital sex, rather than abstinence. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She {{is replaced by a}} reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences <b>of</b> <b>intercourse</b> with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including Meg, who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, Stewie loses a tooth and is told about the tooth fairy. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes Brian's girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has bulimia nervosa, in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth fetish, stealing teeth to roll around in them.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of a self-report scale delineating {{the components of the}} experience <b>of</b> heterosexual <b>intercourse</b> <b>of</b> both men and women. In a preliminary study, 70 men freely expressed the feelings, thoughts, and motives involved in the experience <b>of</b> heterosexual <b>intercourse.</b> A content analysis revealed that the components of the experience <b>of</b> heterosexual <b>intercourse</b> found in the men’s sample are very similar to those found in a women’s sample in a previous study (Birnbaum, Glaubman, & Mikulincer, 2001). On this account, the Experience <b>of</b> Heterosexual <b>Intercourse</b> Scale (EHIS), which was used by Birnbaum and her colleagues, was administered to 181 women and 178 men. Overall, the results revealed that the experience of women was more centred on both the aversive and positive relational aspects <b>of</b> heterosexual <b>intercourse</b> than the experience of men. Findings are discussed in relation to sociobiological and social influence theories...|$|R

40|$|Past HIV {{interventions}} {{have been}} critiqued for {{their failure to}} incorporate relational factors linked to condom use. Furthermore, few {{studies have focused on}} the relational context of sexual risk behavior among adolescents at elevated risk for HIV/STI exposure in the context of substance use. Therefore, this study evaluated the influence of three key relational factors (rejection sensitivity, intimacy dating goals, intercourse-related anxiety) salient for understanding condom use among adolescents in outpatient substance abuse treatment in South Florida. Structural equation modeling was used to test relational factors as direct and indirect predictors of condom use. Specifically, the current study investigated the influence of rejection sensitivity and intimacy dating goals on percentage <b>of</b> protected <b>intercourse,</b> with intercourse-related anxiety modeled as a mediator of this association. ^ Results obtained from the hypothesized structural model suggest rejection sensitivity and intimacy dating goals are significant predictors of percentage <b>of</b> protected <b>intercourse.</b> As expected, rejection sensitivity was related to lower levels of percentage <b>of</b> protected <b>intercourse</b> via heightened levels of intercourse-related anxiety and was not related directly to percentage <b>of</b> protected <b>intercourse.</b> Intercourse-related anxiety was indicated as a partial mediator between rejection sensitivity and percentage <b>of</b> protected <b>intercourse.</b> In contrast, intimacy dating goals was related to lower levels of percentage <b>of</b> protected <b>intercourse</b> directly. The findings demonstrate the importance of relational factors in condom use among adolescents in outpatient substance abuse treatment. Levels <b>of</b> protected <b>intercourse</b> are likely to increase when relational factors are targeted among adolescents in this high-risk population. Implications for prevention strategies targeting this high-risk subgroup of adolescents are discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|In Vedic literature, Mitra and Varuna {{are portrayed}} as icons of affection and {{intimate}} friendship between males (the Sanskrit word mitra means “friend” or “companion”). They are depicted riding a shark or crocodile together while bearing tridents, ropes, conch shells and water pots. Sometimes they are portrayed seated side-by-side on a golden chariot drawn by seven swans. Ancient Brahmana texts furthermore associate Mitra and Varuna with the two lunar phases and same-sex relations: “Mitra and Varuna, on the other hand, are the two half-moons: the waxing one is Varuna and the waning one is Mitra. During the new-moon night these two meet {{and when they are}} thus together they are pleased with a cake offering. Verily, all are pleased and all is obtained by any person knowing this. On that same night, Mitra implants his seed in Varuna and when the moon later wanes, that waning is produced from his seed.” (Shatapatha Brahmana 2.4.4.19) Varuna is similarly said to implant his seed in Mitra on the full-moon night for the purpose of securing its future waxing. In Hinduism, the new- and full-moon nights are discouraged times for procreation and consequently often associated with citrarata or unusual types <b>of</b> <b>intercourse.</b>|$|E

25|$|Alex Comfort {{and others}} propose three {{potential}} social aspects {{of sexual intercourse}} in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational. The development of the contraceptive pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also {{as a means of}} emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects <b>of</b> <b>intercourse</b> on different occasions, being playful during one episode <b>of</b> <b>intercourse</b> (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).|$|E

25|$|Popular belief {{asserts that}} {{individuals}} of either sex {{who are not}} in sexually active relationships tend to masturbate more frequently than those who are; however, much of the time this is not true as masturbation alone or with a partner is often a feature of a relationship.
