The scheme is generally considered one of various internet scams. Michael later reveals having also fallen for a Nigerian 419 scam.|$|E

25|$|According to the agency, Groupon {{breached}} {{the conditions}} offered and contracted with consumers, in particular due to non-compliance with deadlines offered and committed for the delivery <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> It even accuses it of not delivering the items purchased by consumers, with the consequent unilateral cancellation of purchases or having offered {{products and services}} without stock available.|$|E

25|$|A pyramid scheme (commonly {{known as}} pyramid scams) is a {{business}} model that recruits members via a promise of payments or services for enrolling others into the scheme, rather than supplying investments or sale <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services.</b> As recruiting multiplies, recruiting becomes quickly impossible, and most members are unable to profit; as such, pyramid schemes are unsustainable and often illegal.|$|E
25|$|Affiliate {{marketing}} {{overlaps with}} other Internet marketing methods to some degree, because affiliates often use regular advertising methods. Those methods include organic search engine optimization (SEO), paid {{search engine marketing}} (PPC – Pay Per Click), e-mail marketing, content marketing and in some sense display advertising. On the other hand, affiliates sometimes use less orthodox techniques, such as publishing reviews <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> offered by a partner.|$|E
25|$|While {{trademark}} law {{seeks to}} protect indications {{of the commercial}} source <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services,</b> patent law generally seeks to protect new and useful inventions, and registered designs law generally seeks to protect the look or appearance of a manufactured article. Trademarks, patents and designs collectively form a subset of intellectual property known as industrial property because they are often created and used in an industrial or commercial context.|$|E
50|$|In selling technique, a sales {{presentation}} or {{sales pitch}} {{is a line}} of talk that attempts to persuade someone or something, with a planned sales presentation strategy <b>of</b> a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> designed to initiate and close a sale <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b>|$|R
30|$|Customer {{satisfaction}} {{is one of}} the most important key concepts of performance measurement. Customer satisfaction shows the perception of customers about the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> <b>of</b> the company.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s Kano {{and his colleagues}} laid the {{foundation}} for a new approach to modeling customer satisfaction. Kano challenged the conventional beliefs that improving each attribute <b>of</b> a company's <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> will lead to increased customer satisfaction. Kano believed that not all attributes <b>of</b> <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> performance are equal {{in the eyes of the}} customer, and that some attributes create higher levels of customer loyalty than others.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} {{function of}} a trademark is to exclusively identify the commercial source or origin <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services,</b> so a trademark, properly called, indicates source or serves as a badge of origin. In other words, trademarks serve to identify a particular business {{as the source of}} goods or services. The use of a trademark in this way is known as trademark use. Certain exclusive rights attach to a registered mark.|$|E
25|$|As a whole, a {{functional}} organization is best suited {{as a producer}} of standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost. Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in {{a functional}} structure, which makes producing a limited amount <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost. For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products instead of buying them.|$|E
25|$|Platforms like LinkedIn {{create an}} {{environment}} for companies and clients to connect online. Companies that {{recognize the need for}} information, originality/ and accessibility employ blogs to make their products popular and unique/ and ultimately reach out to consumers who are privy to social media. Studies from 2009 show that consumers view coverage in the media or from bloggers as being more neutral and credible than print advertisements, which are not thought of as free or independent. Blogs allow a product or company to provide longer descriptions <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services,</b> can include testimonials and can link to and from other social network and blog pages. Blogs can be updated frequently and are promotional techniques for keeping customers, and also for acquiring followers and subscribers who can then be directed to social network pages. Online communities can enable a business to reach the clients of other businesses using the platform. To allow firms to measure their standing in the corporate world, sites enable employees to place evaluations of their companies.|$|E

40|$|The classic {{definition}} of quality is “the ability <b>of</b> a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> to consistently meet or exceed a customer’s expectations. ” An {{important element of}} the definition, customer’s expectations, requires further defining since cus-tomers value certain aspects <b>of</b> a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> and they therefore associate those aspects with its quality. <b>Product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> quality has many facets. Quality might include the following elements: • Performance or the main characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Aesthetics, which include the “look and feel ” <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Special features <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Conformance <b>or</b> how well the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> aligns with the customer’s expectations. • Safety, which includes the element of risk of injury or harm. • Reliability {{or the ability to}} consistently deliver the intended results. • Durability or the useful life of the prod-uct <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> • Reputation <b>of</b> the <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service.</b> Different customers will have differ-ent expectations <b>of</b> a <b>product</b> <b>or</b> <b>service</b> based on the relative value they place on these components at a given moment in time. To make a determination of the quality of an educational program, one must identify the customers and their expectations of the program as they relate to the facets they deem most important. This is particularly true when a program, such as technology education, purports a significant change in it focus, content, and importance. In essence, the perceived quality of the new program will be influ-enced by the reputation of the program it has replaced, its academic home, and the faculty associated with the program...|$|R

2500|$|Such {{organizations}} seldom involve sales <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> with value. Without creating any {{goods or}} services, the only revenue streams for the scheme are recruiting more members or soliciting {{more money from}} current members. The behavior of pyramid schemes follows the mathematics concerning exponential growth quite closely. Each level of the pyramid is {{much larger than the}} one before it. For a pyramid scheme to make money for everyone who enrolls in it, it would have to expand indefinitely. [...] This is not possible because the population of Earth is finite. When the scheme inevitably runs out of new recruits, lacking other sources of revenue, it collapses. Because in a geometric series, the biggest terms are at the end, most people will be in the lower levels of the pyramid (and indeed the bottom level is always the biggest single layer).|$|E
2500|$|Trademarks {{may also}} serve as an {{incentive}} for manufacturers, providers or suppliers to consistently provide quality products or services to maintain their business reputation. Furthermore, if a trademark owner does not maintain quality control and adequate supervision {{in relation to the}} manufacture and provision <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>or</b> <b>services</b> supplied by a licensee, such [...] "naked licensing" [...] will eventually adversely affect the owner's rights in the trademark. For US law see, ex. Eva's Bridal Ltd. v. Halanick Enterprises, Inc. 639 F.3d 788 (7th Cir. 2011). This proposition has, however, been watered down by the judgment of the House of Lords in the case of Scandecor Development AB v. Scandecor Marketing AB et al. [...] UKHL 21; wherein it has been held that the mere fact that a bare license (equivalent of the United States concept of a naked license) has been granted did not automatically mean that a trademark was liable to mislead.|$|E
