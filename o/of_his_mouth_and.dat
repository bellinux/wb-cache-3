5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> a crater-like edge ulcer with a {{granulated}} surface {{on the left side of}} Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not easy}} finding a mate in this zone. Some species depend on bioluminescence. Others are hermaphrodites, which doubles their chances of {{producing}} both eggs and sperm when an encounter occurs. The female anglerfish releases pheromones to attract tiny males. When a male finds her, he bites on to her and never lets go. When a male of the anglerfish species Haplophryne mollis bites into {{the skin of a}} female, he release an enzyme that digests the skin <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> her body, fusing the pair {{to the point where the}} two circulatory systems join up. The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.|$|E
25|$|In {{some species}} of anglerfish, when a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and {{releases}} an enzyme that digests the skin <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> her body, fusing the pair {{down to the}} blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return. After fusing, males increase in volume and become much larger relative to free-living males of the species. They live and remain reproductively functional {{as long as the}} female lives, and can take part in multiple spawnings. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single individual female with up to eight males in some species, though some taxa appear to have a one male per female rule.|$|E

500|$|Pickett made a {{colorful}} general. He rode a sleek black charger named [...] "Old Black," [...] {{and wore a}} small blue kepi-style cap, with buffed gloves over the sleeves of an immaculately tailored uniform that had a double row of gold buttons on the coat, and shiny gold spurs on his highly polished boots. He held an elegant riding crop whether mounted or walking. His moustache drooped gracefully beyond the corners <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> then turned upward at the ends. His hair was {{the talk of the}} Army: [...] "long ringlets flowed loosely over his shoulders, trimmed and highly perfumed, his beard likewise was curling and giving up the scent of Araby." ...|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly {{described}} Scar as [...] "a {{figure of}} both pity and evil, and of treacherous comedy" [...] with [...] "Irons... filling this devious coward with elegantly witty self-loathing." [...] As an animator, Deja believes that [...] "If {{you have a}} great voice to work with, your work is half done." [...] Enjoying the way in which Irons [...] "has a way with words and phrasing," [...] Deja deliberately based much of Scar's appearance on the actor himself, specifically the shape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> facial expressions. Several of the actor's physical attributes were incorporated into Scar's design, with Irons admitting to recognizing his own baggy eyes in his character. Additionally, Deja studied Irons' performances in the films Reversal of Fortune (1990) and Damage (1992) for inspiration, while refusing to watch Disney's The Jungle Book while working on The Lion King in order to avoid being influenced by the film's villain Shere Khan, a tiger.|$|E
500|$|The ships {{then went}} to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers {{underwent}} surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company's monopoly. [...] When the ships finally dropped anchor in the Thames River on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company £6,000 (about £ at today's values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four percent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained £1,600 (now worth perhaps £) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. [...] The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. [...] However, the long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. [...] Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the post}} mortem report, {{the body of the}} man was found naked on Rosses Point beach with his clothes {{scattered}} along the shore, with no wallet, money or form of identification. The Sligo medical examiner deemed the cause of death to be drowning and found no signs of foul play that would give reason to believe the man's death was a homicide. The man's teeth were in good condition and showed signs of frequent dental work in his life. He had bridging, root canals, crowns and had a full gold tooth on the upper back right side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> a small silver filling along the gum of a tooth {{on the left side of}} the lower jaw.|$|E
2500|$|Isidore of Seville (AD 595) writes, [...] "Elias, borne in a chariot of fire, {{ascended to}} heaven, to come {{according}} to the prophet Malachi {{at the end of}} the world, and to precede Christ, to announce His last coming, with great deeds and wondrous signs, so that, on earth too, Antichrist will war against him, be against him, or him who is to come with him, and will slay them; their bodies also will lie unburied in the streets. Then, raised by the Lord, they will smite the kingdom of Antichrist with a great blow. After this, the Lord will come, and will slay Antichrist with the word <b>of</b> <b>His</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> those who worshiped him."

2500|$|However, {{the methods}} {{anglerfish}} use to locate mates vary. Some species have minute eyes that are unfit for identifying females, {{while others have}} underdeveloped nostrils, making them unlikely to effectively find females by smell. [...] When a male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an enzyme that digests the skin <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male becomes dependent on the female host for survival by receiving nutrients via their shared circulatory system, and provides sperm to the female in return.

2500|$|In November 1987, Dahmer—at {{the time}} {{residing}} {{with his grandmother}} in West Allis—encountered a 25-year-old from Ontonagon, Michigan, named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded {{him to return to}} the Ambassador Hotel, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, {{he had no intention of}} murdering Tuomi, but simply intended to drug and rape him as he lay unconscious. The following morning, however, he awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest [...] "crushed in" [...] and [...] "black and blue" [...] with bruises. Blood was also seeping from the corner <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had absolutely no memory of having killed Tuomi, and later informed investigators that he simply [...] "could not believe this had happened." [...] To dispose of Tuomi's body, he purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later, he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso, then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. He then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags. He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into splinters with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to complete, and all of Tuomi's remains—excluding the severed head—were disposed of in the trash.|$|E
