However Phoebe vows {{to get back at}} Monica. At the party, the apartment is overflowing with decorations and made of cups, and everyone is enjoying the snow cones Phoebe has made with the ice, meaning all of Monica's food is ignored. Rachel arrives home and is very surprised to find the party, given that Chandler's (Matthew Perry) birthday is before hers.|$|E
5|$|The Army {{presence}} at Oak Ridge increased in August 1943 when Nichols replaced Marshall {{as head of}} the Manhattan Engineer District. One of his first tasks was to move the district headquarters to Oak Ridge, although the name of the district did not change. In September 1943 the administration of community facilities was outsourced to Turner Construction Company through a subsidiary, the Roane-Anderson Company. The company was paid a fee of $25,000 per month on a cost-plus contract, about 1 percent of the $2.8 million monthly cost of running the town facilities. Roane-Anderson did not take <b>over</b> <b>everything</b> at once, and a phased takeover started with Laundry No. 1 on 17 October 1943; transportation and garbage collection soon followed. It assumed responsibility for water and sewage in November, and electricity in January 1944. The number of Roane-Anderson workers peaked at around 10,500 in February 1945, including concessionaires and subcontractors. Thereafter, numbers declined to 2,905 direct employees and 3,663 concessionaires and subcontractors when the Manhattan Project ended on 31 December 1946.|$|E

25|$|Florrie O'Donoghue, {{intelligence}} {{officer of the}} 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, described the scene in Cork {{on the morning of}} the 12th:Many familiar landmarks were gone forever– where whole buildings had collapsed here and there a solitary wall leaned at some crazy angle from its foundation. The streets ran with sooty water, the footpaths were strewn with broken glass and debris, ruins smoked and smoldered and <b>over</b> <b>everything</b> was the all-pervasive smell of burning.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{creation}} story in Genesis, Adam and Eve were the first man and woman. In the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible, chapters one through five, there are two creation narratives with two distinct perspectives. In the first, Adam and Eve (though not referenced by name) were created together in God's image and jointly given instructions to multiply and to be stewards <b>over</b> <b>everything</b> else that God had made. In the second narrative, God fashions Adam from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden where he is to have dominion over the plants and animals. God places a tree in the garden which he prohibits Adam from eating the fruit of. Eve is later created from one of Adam's ribs to be Adam's companion.|$|E

Meanwhile, Giga's and Ema's marriage is in turmoil as the couple constantly bickers <b>over</b> <b>everything</b> and she soon serves him with divorce papers.

Her will is revealed, stipulating that her brother's kids each stand to inherit substantial sums of money under specific conditions: Saša has to find a job, Violeta has {{to get married and}} celebrate a one-year anniversary, while Boba has to complete his final year of high school with at least a 4 (very good) grade average.|$|E
25|$|The series fleshes out Scrooge's {{upbringing}} by depicting {{his life}} as an individual who worked hard his entire life to earn his keep and to fiercely defend it against those who were truly dishonest, But also, he defend {{his family and friends}} from any dangers,including villains. His value teaches his nephews not to be dishonest with him or anybody else. It is shown that money is no longer {{the most important thing in}} his life. For one episode he was under a love spell, which caused him to lavish his time on a goddess, <b>over</b> <b>everything</b> else. The nephews find out that the only way to break the spell is make the person realize that the object of their love will cost them something they truly love. The boys make it appear that Scrooge's love is allergic to money; however, he simply decides to give up his wealth so he can be with her. Later, when he realizes he will have to give up his nephews to be with her, the spell is immediately broken, showing that family is the most important thing to him.|$|E

[...] The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.|$|E

[...] In 1965 the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: [...] "Timmons lacks a certain passion but I wonder {{if this is not}} the fault of his sidemen." [...] Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of [...] "Moanin'" [...] on From the Bottom. Recordings as a leader continued, usually as part of a trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons' album Got to Get It! featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.|$|E

[...] In fact they could be considered the epitome of Fisher's belief in the paramount importance of speed <b>over</b> <b>everything</b> else. Fisher's adherence to this principle is highlighted in a letter he wrote to Churchill concerning the battleships of the 1912–13 Naval Estimates. In the letter, dated April 1912, Fisher stated: [...] "There must be sacrifice of armour ... There must be further VERY GREAT INCREASE IN SPEED ... your speed must vastly exceed [...] your possible enemy!" ...|$|E

To God alone belongs this power; or, rather, not even to God himself. For his gracious gifts, it says, are irrevocable. (...) God would not therefore reduce the human race to slavery, since he himself, when we had been enslaved to sin, spontaneously recalled us to freedom. But if God does not enslave what is free, who is he that sets his own power above God's?" ...|$|E
