40|$|Abstract—Paper often {{includes}} pre-printed <b>ruling</b> <b>lines</b> to {{help people}} write more neatly. This particular example of realworld noise can have a serious impact on applications such as handwriting recognition and writer identification, however. In this work, we investigate the effects of <b>ruling</b> <b>lines</b> on writer ID. We study a method for detecting and removing <b>ruling</b> <b>lines</b> and test its utility for Arabic writer identification {{through a series of}} experiments. Our preliminary results show that under realistic assumptions where <b>ruling</b> <b>lines</b> are expected to have different properties across the collection, e. g., thickness, spacing, etc., removing them significantly improves identification performance. We conclude with a discussion of work-in-progress to examine followup questions raised by our initial investigations. Keywords-Writer Identification; Ruling-line Artifacts; I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Ruling {{lines are}} {{commonly}} used to help people write neatly on paper. In document image analysis, however, they create challenges for handwriting recognition and writer identification. In this paper, we model <b>ruling</b> <b>line</b> detection as a multi-line linear regression problem and then derive a globally optimal solution giving the Least Square Error. We demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} technique on both synthetic and real datasets. A comparative study shows that our algorithm outperforms a previously published method on the public Germana dataset. Keywords-handwritten documents; <b>ruling</b> <b>line</b> detection; I...|$|R

Ruled surface with hollowed features generated in our earlier work {{is used to}} develop toolpath planning. Ruling lines are reoriented to enable continuous and uniform size multi-material printing through them in two steps. Firstly, all <b>ruling</b> <b>lines</b> are matched and connected to eliminate start and stops during printing. Then, regions with high number of <b>ruling</b> <b>lines</b> are relaxed using a relaxation technique to eliminate over deposition. A novel layer-by-layer deposition process is progressed in two consecutive layers: The first layer with hollow shape based zigzag pattern and the next layer with spiral pattern deposition. Heterogeneous material properties are mapped based on the parametric distances from the hollow features...|$|R
