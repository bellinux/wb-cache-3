40|$|Lubrication oil-flow in {{the crank}} system of an medium size diesel engine running at 750 RPM was modeled and analyzed. The model was built up by {{combining}} models from several studies in both engine lubrication systems and pipe flow modal analysis. The model is first {{used to analyze}} a system where the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> are fully open during the complete engine cycle. The result showed that these designs need a very high <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> pressure to maintain a positive pressure in the connecting rod at all times. Having a positive pressure is important to prevent cavitation in the oil channels, and to ensure a continuous flow of cooling oil. Secondly the model was used to analyze a system where the big-end bearing tracks runs only half way around the circumference, closing the flow when the piston is in the BDC region. Such a design allowed for a lower <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> pressure, as the channel closes when the oil is forced back.

The number three engine <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> <b>line</b> was cut by flak, and the landing gear was hit and jammed. Flak also damaged an engine housing causing that prop to be shut down and feathered. The Aircraft was able to maintain an altitude of 17,500 feet and began its journey back to England when two jet propelled German fighters attacked. These two German aircraft were sighted and immediately reported to the pilot by TSgt. Rhodes. The B-17 was hit during the German fighter attack inflicting extensive damage to the aircraft's number three fuel tank, causing it to explode and tossed the right wing violently. Following this hit the aircraft went into a tight downward spin, within just a few thousand feet the tail section of the aircraft blew off causing the aircraft to level off slightly and continue falling in a shallow spin. This presented the opportunity for the Navigator, Turret Gunner, Co-Pilot and TSgt. Rhodes to bail out. TSgt. Rhodes and three other crew members landed near Biberach, Germany. Of the nine original crew members on the B-17, only four survived the aerial encounter. Upon landing, TSgt.

40|$|Test {{results that}} examine the {{influence}} of jacking-oil ports on a tilting pad journal (TPJ) bearing are presented. The static and dynamic characteristics before and after adding jacking-oil ports are compared. The test bearing is a four-pad, rocker-pivot, 57 % pivot offset TPJ bearing in load between pad configuration. This original bearing was modified to include jacking-oil ports on the two loaded pads and retested at the same operating conditions. The ports occupy 5 % of the pad?s surface area and have an approximate depth of 25 times the radial clearance. Pressurized jacking-oil was not used during testing; however, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> <b>lines</b> complete with check valves were added to emulate a typical industrial bearing assembly. This thesis compares both the static and dynamic bearing characteristics {{to determine the effects}} jacking-oil ports had. Rotordynamic coefficients are presented as dimensionless values, using a frequency-independent [K][C][M] model. The added jacking-oil ports caused a decrease in direct damping and increase in virtual-mass. Direct damping coefficients were reduced by an average of - 26 % in the loaded y-direction, and - 9 % in the orthogonal x-direction. The original bearing had all negative direct virtual-mass coefficients (stiffening with increasing frequency). The modified bearing had negative coefficients that were smaller in magnitude, and some virtual-mass coefficients that were positive. No significant changes were observed in any of the cross-coupled coefficients or the direct stiffness coefficients. The added jacking-oil ports has no significant impact on the static characteristics of the TPJ bearing. Static characteristics included the steady-state journal eccentricity, attitude angle, minimum film-thickens, and pad temperature. A predictive bearing code was modified to account for the jacking-oil port geometry but was unable to produce predictions matching the measured change in dynamic performance. Contrary to measurements, the code predicted frequency-dependent direct rotordynamic coefficients and no reduction in direct stiffness or damping for the bearing with jacking-oil ports. The influence of jacking-oil ports on a simple rotor-bearing system is presented. Rotordynamic predictions were made for a rigid rotor symmetrically supported by two TPJ bearings. Predictions showed that jacking-oil ports can significantly lower the first critical speed. This was attributed to the change in virtual-mass coefficients. There was only a small reduction in damping ratio predicted...|$|R

30|$|Figure  4 {{reveals a}} {{noticeable}} {{difference in the}} effect of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates across various quantiles. The sequence of the estimated coefficients can express the structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates. Panel A reveals the shock structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> on <b>oil</b> exporting countries. The structure of shock tends to be inverse S-shaped. Unlike the median quantile, in the lower and upper quantiles, the estimated coefficient on the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables tends to be statistically distinguishable from zero. This implies that for significant US dollar depreciations, the shock is mostly negative, whereas for significant US dollar appreciations it is mostly positive. This pattern is clearly apparent for Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. However, for Mexico, the shock structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> tends to be inverse U-shaped. In both the lower and upper quantiles, the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have negative and statistically significant impacts on its real exchange rate. The structure of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates in oil-importing countries {{is shown in the}} Panel B. These shock structures tend to be U-shaped in most cases. At the lower quantiles, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have positive and statistically significant effects on both Japan and the European Union.

40|$|World <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> {{disruptions}} lead to U. S. economic losses. Because oil is fungible in {{an integrated}} world oil market, increased oil consumption, whether from domestic or imported sources, increases the economic losses associated with <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions. Nevertheless, increased U. S. oil production expands stable <b>supplies</b> and dampens <b>oil</b> price shocks, whereas increased U.

Some of the economic losses associated with <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions—gross domestic product losses and some transfers abroad—are externalities that can be quantified as oil security premiums. To estimate such premiums for domestic and imported oil, we take into account projected world oil market conditions, probable <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions, the market response to <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disruptions, and the resulting U.

30|$|For a {{significant}} US dollar depreciation (at lower quantiles), the extreme impacts of <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> and demand shocks on exchange rates {{are shown in}} Table  4. For oil-exporting countries, the estimated coefficients on <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables are negative and statistically significant for Canada, Mexico and the UK at the 0.01 quantile, and for Norway at the 0.05 quantile. While for oil-importing countries, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks only have positive and significant impacts on exchange rate returns in the EU. These results can be easily explained. The <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks possibly reflect the discovery of new oil fields, better extraction technologies or a decline in OPEC’s control over the <b>oil</b> <b>supply.</b> Following an <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock that alters the oil balance, the real exchange rate moves to ensure an offsetting adjustment in the non-oil trade balance in order to stabilize net foreign assets. Therefore, a positive <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock has negative impacts (US dollar depreciation) on exchange rate returns in oil-exporting countries while having positive impacts (US dollar appreciation) in oil-importing countries.|$|R
