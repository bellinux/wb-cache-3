5|$|Ford, {{serving as}} General Quarters Officer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deck,</b> {{was ordered to}} go below to assess the raging fire. He did so safely, and {{reported}} his findings back to the ship's commanding officer, Captain Stuart Ingersoll. The ship's crew was able to contain the fire, and the ship got underway again.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the {{overpass}} {{bridge over}} Pottery Road, {{north of the}} Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> It was worn down due to {{the cumulative effect of}} heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} {{side of the}} pier, causing four shops and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage to the pier {{was estimated to be}} £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E

5|$|The {{total of}} the round points the player (or pair) has gained is {{calculated}} as the sum of values of the cards collected in the baza and {{the values of the}} declared combinations. The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points. The total value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> (and thus the maximum amount of round points) is 230 points.|$|E
5|$|Experience with {{previous}} battlecruiser designs {{led to the}} adoption of a continuous upper deck, which raised the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> aft. This was necessary because the aft decks of earlier designs were usually awash when steaming at high speed, even in calm seas. The ships were also equipped with a bulbous bow to reduce drag on the hull, the first time the feature was used in the German Navy. The ships as designed required a crew of 46 officers and 1,140 enlisted sailors. Service as a squadron flagship would increase that number by an additional 14 officers and 62 sailors. The vessels carried a number of small boats, including two picket boats, one barge, two launches, two cutters, and three yawls.|$|E
5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose and plunged into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck.</b> There were ten men on the wheel and more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as sea spray and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E
40|$|Skewed bridges {{collapsed}} due to unseating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> {{from their}} support resulted from rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> around <b>the</b> vertical axis in past earthquakes. Skewed bridges show very unique structural response {{as a result}} <b>of</b> poundings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> to <b>the</b> substructures and <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> restrainers. This paper clarifies <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> rotations of skewed bridges and shows <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> cable restrainers on <b>the</b> mitigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotations. Three configurations of cable restrainers are clarified here: 1) cable restrainers in the weak axis, 2) cable restrainers in the longitudinal direction, and 3) cable restrainers crossing <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> adjacent <b>decks.</b> It is found that the cross cable restrainers are effective on <b>the</b> mitigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> skewed bridges...|$|R

50|$|Four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> were armoured. <b>The</b> {{forecastle}} <b>deck,</b> {{upper deck}} and maindeck {{were all of}} 1.5 in armour and <b>the</b> middle <b>deck</b> was <b>of</b> 1 in, increasing to 3 in over the machinery and magazines.|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} KB-4, the surface ship design bureau of the Baltic Shipyard, was {{selected}} for further development although the lead designers were convinced that only a larger ship could fulfill the ambitious requirements. They did manage to get agreement on 22 November 1936 for a thickening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> armor that raised the displacement to about 47,000 tons. Design work continued on this basis and technical work was completed for a ship of 47,700 tons in April 1937, but the designers continued to press their case for larger ships. The issue was resolved by Premier Stalin at a meeting on 4 July when he agreed to increase displacement to about 56,000 tons. This forced the project to begin again.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the trick takes the first card from the stock, and the loser the second; thus, until the stock runs out, they each hold ten cards {{at the start of}} every trick. When the trump card at the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> is {{superior}} to a 7 (Ace, Three, King, Knight, or Knave), the player that holds the 7 of the trump suit is able to exchange it for any of these. The 7, and cards of lesser value (6, 5, and 4), can later be exchanged only by a 2. The trump exchanges are allowed anytime in the game until only the last two cards are left in the stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Stord Bridge was undertaken {{as part of the}} same contract as the Bømla Bridge, which was awarded in December 1998 to Triangle Contractors, a joint venture between NCC and HBG Steel Structures. Most of the work was carried out by NCC with HBG having responsibility for the steel parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and the cables. HBG had previously built the steel for the Osterøy Bridge, which opened in 1997. The responsibility for the cables was given to Brown Beach Associates and Hordaland Mekaniske Verksted. Construction started on 20 February 1999. After the pylons were completed on 25 September 1999, two catwalks were erected between them, with the constructors choosing two continuous catwalks instead of three separate pairs. Extra stability to the catwalks was achieved by building connections between the two.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, {{abnormally}} {{high temperatures}} caused <b>the</b> steel <b>decking</b> to expand {{to the point}} the bridge would not open or close properly. This necessitated <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> about 1 in <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decking.</b>|$|R
50|$|Participants {{are unaware}} that 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> {{correspond}} to net winnings - low payoffs and even lower losses. <b>The</b> other 2 <b>decks</b> correspond to net losses - high payoffs and even higher losses.|$|R

5|$|The {{first signs}} of panic were seen {{when a group of}} {{passengers}} attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No.14 as it was being lowered with 40people aboard. Fifth Officer Lowe, {{who was in charge of}} the boat, fired three warning shots in the air to control the crowd without causing injuries. No.16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of Titanics sister ships, , in the First World War. Collapsible boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> as most of those on deck had moved to the stern of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director J. Bruce Ismay, Titanics most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.|$|E
5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main trusses, each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main trusses. Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main trusses, one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main trusses were the deck trusses, 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main trusses. The transverse deck beams, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> truss, rested on top of the main trusses. These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E

30|$|The {{complete}} stress–strain curve, {{elastic modulus}} Es and yield stress fyp <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel <b>decking</b> were also measured from tests on three coupons cut from <b>the</b> sheet <b>of</b> <b>decking.</b> <b>The</b> yield stress fyp and {{the elastic modulus}} Es <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel <b>decking</b> were 532  MPa and 203  GPa, respectively. Similarly, from tests on three samples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reinforcing bars, the average values were fy =  495  MPa and Es =  205  GPa, respectively.|$|R
50|$|With {{a launch}} price <b>of</b> US$299, <b>the</b> N-Gage was not commercially popular. In its first weeks <b>of</b> {{availability}} in <b>the</b> United States, it was outsold by the Game Boy Advance 100 to 1. Within 17 days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck's</b> release, popular retailers GameStop and Electronics Boutique began offering $100 rebates on <b>the</b> <b>deck's</b> price.|$|R
25|$|The single {{arrangement}} uses {{a single}} column for cable support, normally projecting {{through the center}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> {{but in some cases}} located on one side or the other.|$|E
25|$|All the {{vehicles}} were thrown off <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> {{except for a}} motorcycle, which was entangled in the railing. One vehicle floated briefly before filling with water and sinking; the rest sank immediately.|$|E
25|$|The first cables {{were hung}} from the towers in 2004—as a time-saving measure, this was done before the towers were wholly completed. Sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> were built outward {{from each of the}} towers as more cables were hung.|$|E
60|$|Here {{it may be}} {{observed}} that as, on <b>the</b> first visit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat, the American had not permitted his men to board the ship, neither did he now; being unwilling to add to <b>the</b> confusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{tower is}} an {{inverted}} Y-shaped reinforced concrete structure with one connecting girder between tower legs. <b>The</b> bridge <b>deck</b> is a steel box girder with internal transverse and longitudinal diaphragms and fairing noses at both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> total width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge <b>deck</b> is 41 metres including the fairing noses.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> object <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play {{is to win}} tricks {{containing}} {{more than}} half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> points. <b>The</b> team which takes more than 60 points scores one game. The first team to score four games wins the set (called a [...] "rubber").|$|R
