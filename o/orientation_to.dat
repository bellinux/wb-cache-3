40|$|This article {{identifies}} the <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> learning {{of a group}} of mature students, all practising managers, who were on part-time postgraduate management courses. The <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> learning approach provided an effective framework for gaining insights into the complexities of learner motivations and how these influence learning behaviour. A social cognitive framework was used to analyse the processes by which <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> learning develop, and this enabled a systematic investigation to be carried out of the meanings that managers made of their management education experience, as well as the significance that the learning outcomes from courses assumed in their professional and personal lives. The typology of <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> learning reported here differs significantly from those found in earlier studies and provides some basis for a consideration of the elements which appear to be common to different sectors of the student population and those which are specific to a particular set of student characteristics. The findings also begin to establish a link between <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> learning and different learning outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was <b>to</b> {{investigate}} managers' <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> happiness and the relationship thereof to individual and organisational outcomes. A cross-sectional survey design was used with managers in the agricultural sector in South Africa (N = 507). The <b>Orientations</b> <b>to</b> Happiness Questionnaire (Revised), Satisfaction with Life Scale, Affect Balance Scale, Job Satisfaction Scale, Organisational Commitment Scale, and Organisational Citizenship Behaviour Scale were administered. The results showed that <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> happiness (i. e. pleasure, meaning and engagement) had strong direct effects on subjective well-being, job satisfaction and organisational citizenship behaviour. <b>Orientations</b> <b>to</b> happiness also impacted job satisfaction and organisational commitment indirectly through subjective well-being. Subjective well-being had a strong direct and positive effect on job satisfaction, as well as a positive indirect effect on organisational commitment. The results build on the knowledge regarding individual and organisational outcomes of authentic happiness. [URL]...|$|R

5|$|Seen {{as likely}} to provoke {{controversy}} even before its publication, Sexual Preference received considerable media attention, and reviews that were mainly mixed or negative. Critics questioned Bell et al.′s reliance upon a statistical technique, originally developed {{for use in the}} biological sciences, called path analysis, disputed the representativeness of their sample of homosexuals, pointed out the difficulty and potential unreliability of adult recall of childhood feeling and the vague and general nature of the questions respondents were asked, and disagreed with Bell et al.′s suggestion that sexual orientation is innate. Nevertheless, some reviewers complimented Sexual Preference for its authors' challenge to established views about the causes of homosexuality, and it eventually came to be considered a classic work. It {{is one of the most}} frequently cited retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation, credited by psychologists with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality. In 2009, the American Psychological Association credited Bell et al. with helping to discredit theories attributing sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>to</b> family dynamics or trauma.|$|E

The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and cis-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Mason Verger runs an orphanage, {{from which}} he calls {{children}} to verbally abuse {{as a substitute for}} his no longer being able to molest them. He also has a sister, Margot, whom he had raped when they were children and who is a lesbian. When she disclosed her sexual <b>orientation</b> <b>to</b> her family, their father disowned her. As she is sterile due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a semen sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. Also, in the novel, Verger literally has no face and has to be kept in a sterile room at all times to keep bacteria from affecting exposed muscle and tissues. At the book's end, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates her brother to ejaculate with a rectally inserted cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming his pet Moray eel down his throat.|$|E

A conceptual model is presented in order to clarify the processes {{that lead to the}} formation and maintenance of different types of motive. It is then argued that motivation derives from variations in <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> work and these develop because of the influences of opportunity structures and reference groups. It is <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> work which determine work behaviour. Analysis of interview data, from sixteen academics working in a large university, reveals that differences in <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> work are strongly related to experiences of different opportunity structures and reference groups. It also reveals that, {{for more than half of}} those interviewed, orientations remained stable once formed.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the antecedents of careerist <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> work. Hypotheses are drawn from {{referent}} cognitions theory. First, it is proposed that trust mediates the relationship between an individual's perceptions of procedural justice and their careerist <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> work. Second, perceptions of distributive justice, regarding the allocation of career development opportunities, will moderate the relationship between trust and careerist <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> work. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 325 employees of a large UK financial institution completed a structured questionnaire. Regression analysis (using SPSS version 11) {{was used to test}} the presented hypotheses. Findings – All hypotheses were confirmed. However, the interaction effect observed was different from that hypothesised. It appears that trust only matters, in terms of the development of careerist <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> work, when individuals feel that they are receiving equitable career development opportunities. Research limitations/implications – Much more research is required in different organisational contexts if one is to fully confirm and understand these relationships. However, these findings suggest that employers will only reduce the development of careerist attitudes in their workforce if they ensure the fair distribution of career development opportunities and engender trusting relations through the implementation of fair decision-making procedures. Originality/value – This paper adds much needed empirical research to the literature on new career realities and careerist <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> work. Moreover, referent cognitions theory is presented as a new theoretical framework for understanding the cognitive processes involved in an individual's development of careerist attitudes...|$|R

40|$|Career adapt-ability has {{recently}} gained momentum as a psychosocial construct {{that not only}} has much to offer the field of career development, but also contributes to positive coping, adjustment and self-regulation through the four dimensions of concern, control, curiosity and confidence. The positive psychology movement, with concepts such as the <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> happiness, explores the {{factors that contribute to}} human flourishing and optimum functioning. This research has two main contributions; 1) to validate a German version of the Career Adapt-Abilities Scale (CAAS), and 2) to extend the contribution of adapt-abilities to the field of work stress and explore its mediating capacity in the relation between <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> happiness and work stress. We used a representative sample of the German-speaking Swiss working population including 1204 participants (49. 8 % women), aged between 26 and 56 (Mage = 42. 04). Results indicated that the German version of the CAAS is valid, with overall high levels of model fit suggesting that the conceptual structure of career adapt-ability replicates well in this cultural context. Adapt-abilities showed a negative relationship to work stress, and a positive one with <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> happiness. The engagement and pleasure scales of <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> happiness also correlated negatively with work stress. Moreover, career adapt-ability mediates the relationship between <b>orientations</b> <b>to</b> happiness and work stress. In depth analysis of the mediating effect revealed that control is the only significant mediator. Thus control may be acting as a mechanism through which individuals attain their desired life at work subsequently contributing to reduced stress levels...|$|R
