5|$|The kakapo has a {{well-developed}} {{sense of}} smell, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported {{in only one}} other parrot species. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. Given their well-developed sense of smell, this odour may be a pheromone. The smell often alerts predators {{to the presence of}} kakapos.|$|E
5|$|At times, when a {{new king}} came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and {{replaced}} with new ones, or they might be broken. When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> archaeological markers of such an invasion is {{the destruction of the}} defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down. At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador, where most of the stelae were found smashed.|$|E
5|$|Galveston's {{attitudes toward}} race were at times {{unique in the}} region. The strict segregationalist attitudes {{prevalent}} {{in many parts of}} the U.S. were not always as stark in Galveston's society as in some other parts of Texas. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> examples of this was the gradual establishment of biracial labor unions of waterfront workers beginning in the 19th century, although eventually this alliance fell victim to segregationist influence. Racist ideology was always an ever-present factor in the city, however, as evinced by the name of the group which ran the Mardi Gras, the Kotton Karnival Kids (KKK, the same initials as the Ku Klux Klan).|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> pieces {{is a large}} dish {{weighing}} , in {{the centre}} {{of which is a}} relief depiction of the Last Supper. Around the edge at the top, bottom and sides are four engravings of biblical scenes: the Washing of the Feet, the Walk to Emmaus, the Coming of the Holy Ghost, and Christ's Commission to the Apostles, divided by scrolls of foliage. Made by London goldsmith Henry Greenway in 1664 for the Duke of York and later acquired by CharlesII, it stands on the high altar during the coronation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Pursuit of {{specific}} and narrow {{areas of interest}} is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> possible features of AS. Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic. For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography. This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6. Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction {{so much that the}} entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Vargas Llosa {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a {{membership}} he still holds today. That year, he also published Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (La tía Julia y el escribidor), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel. She later wrote a memoir, Lo que Varguitas no dijo (What Little Vargas Didn't Say), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career. Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter is considered <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature. The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, Tune in Tomorrow.|$|E

25|$|Voyager 2 {{found that}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> {{effects of the}} {{sideways}} orientation of Uranus is {{the effect on the}} tail of the planetary magnetic field. This is itself tilted about 60° from the Uranian axis of rotation. The planet's magneto tail was shown to be twisted by the rotation of Uranus into a long corkscrew shape following the planet. The presence of a significant magnetic field for Uranus was not at all known until Voyager 2s arrival.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> {{features}} of Shad Thames are the walkways which criss-cross the street high overhead. Most {{of them now}} connect the Butlers Wharf building and the Cardamom Building, and were originally used as bridges to roll barrels and the like between warehouses. They are now used as balconies by the adjoining flats. Photographs from the early 20th century show that {{at the peak of}} warehouse usage there were many more of these bridges than survive today.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> of Socotra's {{plants is}} the dragon's blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari), {{which is a}} strange-looking, umbrella-shaped tree. Its red sap {{was thought to be}} the dragon's blood of the ancients, sought after as a dye, and today used as paint and varnish. Also {{important}} in ancient times were Socotra's various endemic aloes, used medicinally, and for cosmetics. Other endemic plants include the giant succulent tree Dorstenia gigas, the cucumber tree Dendrosicyos socotranus, the rare Socotran pomegranate (Punica protopunica), Aloe perryi, and Boswellia socotrana.|$|E
25|$|The 1986 LeSabre was {{introduced}} {{on the new}} front wheel drive H platform, after departing from rear wheel drive on the GM B platform. Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the Oldsmobile Delta 88 and the 1987 Pontiac Bonneville, which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a mid-size on the G platform. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was the hood was hinged towards the front instead of towards the back near the cowl and windshield {{in the same fashion}} as that of the Buick Electra and Chevrolet Corvette of that era.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> {{aspects of}} the {{organization}} of the Inquisition was its form of financing: devoid of its own budget, the Inquisition depended exclusively on the confiscation of the goods of the denounced. It is not surprising, therefore, that many of those prosecuted were rich men. That the situation was open to abuse is evident, as stands out in the memorial that a converso from Toledo directed to Charles I: Your Majesty must provide, before all else, that the expenses of the Holy Office do not come from the properties of the condemned, because if that is the case, if they do not burn they do not eat.|$|E

25|$|Interpretations abound. Perhaps this {{particular}} formation represents a council of some sort—the fifteen other figurines {{seem to be}} listening to the red granite one, with the celts forming a backdrop. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> offerings found at La Venta, the celts in Offering Number 4, depict {{a person with a}} ceremonial headdress “flying” and also the maize deity. There appears to be a definite symbolic link here, but it is unclear whether it is tied to the Olmec rudimentary writing system. To the red granite figurine's right, there seems be a line of three figurines filing past him. Another researcher has suggested that the granite figure is an initiate.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of flight is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> and demanding in animal evolution, and has {{attracted the attention}} of many prominent scientists and generated many theories. Additionally, because flying animals tend to be small and have a low mass (both of which increase the surface-area-to-mass ratio), they tend to fossilize infrequently and poorly compared to the larger, heavier-boned terrestrial species they share habitat with. Fossils of flying animals tend to be confined to exceptional fossil deposits formed under highly specific circumstances, resulting in a generally poor fossil record, and a particular lack of transitional forms. Furthermore, as fossils do not preserve behavior or muscle, {{it can be difficult to}} discriminate between a poor flyer and a good glider.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, wooden {{buildings}} were razed {{and replaced with}} brick ones. During this period, many {{buildings were}} constructed in the architectural style of the Renaissance. Buildings of this period are very recognisable with their stepped gable façades, which is the common Dutch Renaissance style. Amsterdam quickly developed its own Renaissance architecture. These buildings were built according {{to the principles of}} the architect Hendrick de Keyser. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>striking</b> buildings designed by Hendrick de Keyer is the Westerkerk. In the 17th century baroque architecture became very popular, as it was elsewhere in Europe. This roughly coincided with Amsterdam's Golden Age. The leading architects of this style in Amsterdam were Jacob van Campen, Philips Vingboons and Daniel Stalpaert.|$|E
