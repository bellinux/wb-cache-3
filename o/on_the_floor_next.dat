5|$|The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in a Four Way Tag Team Monster's Ball {{match with}} Steve McMichael as Special Guest Referee {{in the fifth}} contest. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) defended the title against the team of Abyss and Matt Morgan, The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide), and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). Jacqueline {{accompanied}} Beer Money, Inc. to the ring. The duration of the bout was 20 minutes and 20 seconds. This bout was contested under no count-outs and no disqualification rules with weapons legal {{and the only way}} to win was for a competitor to either pin or make another wrestler submit. The match started off with Hernandez jumping over the top rope onto Roode and Storm. Several competitors bled during the contest, such as Devon and Abyss, who was cut open by a cheese grater by Ray. McMichael was directly involved in the match several times. The first being an altercation with Beer Money, Inc., resulting in McMichael attacking Roode. Another time was near the end of the contest when Jacqueline interrupted a pin attempt by Homicide on Storm, with McMichael spanking her in retaliation. The last time was when he aided Hernandez in opening a tied bag of thumbtacks. Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter when Team 3D were assaulting Abyss with various weapons, such as a staple gun. Devine hit Abyss with a kendo stick from behind and helped Devon set up a table <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>next</b> to the stage. Ray and Devon then sprayed the table with lighter fluid. Devine lit the table on fire before Ray and Devon slammed Abyss through the flaming table off of the stage. The match ended when Team 3D forced Hernandez through a table covered in thumbtacks with their signature 3D tag team maneuver, before Storm spat beer in Devon's eyes and Roode covered Hernandez for the pinfall to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship.|$|E

25|$|The {{drip line}} or trickle acclimating method {{is a safe}} and gentle way to {{introduce}} saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure {{can be used to}} acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>next</b> to the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.|$|E
25|$|Nowell {{was married}} to Troy Dendekker on May 18, 1996. Seven days later, {{on the morning of}} May 25, Sublime was {{supposed}} to begin a five-day tour through Northern California, followed by a European and East Coast tour. However, while the band was staying at the Ocean View Motel in San Francisco, drummer Bud Gaugh woke up to find Nowell lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>next</b> to his bed. His dalmatian, Lou Dog, was curled up on the bed whimpering. Bradley had tried waking up his fellow band-mates to go to the beach with him that morning, but they were too hung-over and tired to get out of bed. Initially, Gaugh assumed Nowell was too intoxicated to get into bed; however, he noticed a green film around his mouth, and it became apparent he had overdosed on heroin. Gaugh called for paramedics, but Nowell had died several hours earlier, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Nowell was cremated and his ashes were spread over his favorite surfing spot in Surfside, California. A headstone was placed at Westminster Memorial in Westminster, California in his memory.|$|E

The video was shot in black and white, and features Burke in different outfits and dresses, {{as well as in}} a variety of sets with props.

Throughout the video, Burke is visibly in a studio with different backdrops, where she is preparing to be photographed. During the first verse, Burke is shown in the two sets while she sings the lyrics.

During the second verse, another set is introduced of Burke posing against a stuffed animal. During the bridge, Burke sings the lyrics standing in front of the camera without any props surrounding her; prior to sustaining a long note, Burke has her back to the camera and is nude from the waist up. During the final verse, Burke's anger and desperation is shown to be heightened, as she sings to her herself in the mirror and places more emphasis on her movement. The video ends with the singer nude from the waist up and facing the camera, covering herself with her arms crossed over her chest.|$|E

How we did laugh when he came up and {{explained}} that our neighbor, old Mrs. Dodd, had sent in a hop-pillow for me, in case of headache, and a pie to begin housekeeping with. She seemed so disappointed at being too late that Will promised to get them to me, if he ran all the way to town. The pillow was easily disposed of, but that pie! I do believe it was stowed in every part of the wagon, and never staid anywhere. I found it in my lap, then <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> <b>next,</b> upside down among the books, then just on the point of coasting off a trunk into the road, and at last it landed in my rocking-chair. Such a remarkable pie as it was, too, for in spite of all its wanderings, it never got spilt or broken, and we finally ate it for lunch, in order to be left in peace. Next, my kitty got away, and I had a chase over walls and brooks before I got her, while Mr. Brown sat shaking with fun, to see me run. We finished off by having the book-shelves tumble on our heads as we went down a hill, and losing my chair off behind, as we went up a hill. A shout made us pause, and, looking back, there was the poor little chair rocking all by itself in the middle of the road, while a small boy sat on the fence and whooped. It was great fun, I do assure you." ...|$|E
