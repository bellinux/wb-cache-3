When the frequency increases, the harmonic distortion decreases. The harmonic distortion rate reaches the minimum value at frequency 50  Hz.|$|R

25|$|The {{voltage drop}} VF across the forward biased diode {{in the circuit}} of a passive {{rectifier}} is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> across the load with the input voltage and increases its own <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> with the value of VF. As a result, the voltage drop VF is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (super) diode with VF = 0 V.|$|E

30|$|The {{equivalent}} output impedances of {{the parallel}} inverters {{are different from}} each other at PCC [59] in an AC or hybrid microgrid since the control strategies, filter parameters and length of transmission lines [60], are not the same. Consequently, it will cause the fundamental and harmonic circulating currents, and also the fluctuations of the amplitude and frequency of the PCC voltage of the islanded microgrid [61, 62]. There have three types of circulating currents in the islanded mode, i.e., active circulating current, reactive circulating current and harmonic circulating current. The active circulating current is caused by the frequency and phase deviations of inverter <b>output</b> <b>voltages.</b> The reactive circulating current results from the magnitude deviations of inverter <b>output</b> <b>voltages.</b> The harmonic circulating current is the result of harmonic components of inverter <b>output</b> <b>voltages.</b> The slight deviations of the frequency, phase and magnitude of the inverter <b>output</b> <b>voltages</b> will lead to large fundamental or harmonic circulating currents [63]. Moreover, the circulating currents will reduce the output capacities of the DG units, and increase the line losses, also endanger the safe operation of the microgrid [64, 65].|$|R

For lower voltages, Schottky diodes are commonly used as the rectifier elements; they have the advantages of faster recovery times than silicon diodes (allowing low-loss operation at higher frequencies) and a lower voltage drop when conducting.

25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the <b>output</b> <b>voltage</b> tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.|$|E
