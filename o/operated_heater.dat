40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} of vehicles has received increased attention in recent years; however one neglected area {{that can have}} a large effect on this is the energy usage for the interior climate. This study aims to investigate the energy usage for the interior climate for different conditions by measurements on a complete vehicle. Twelve different NEDC tests in different temperatures and thermal states of the vehicle were completed in a climatic wind tunnel. Furthermore one temperature sweep from 43 ° to– 18 °C was also performed. The measurements focused on the heat flow of the air, from its sources, to its sink, i. e. compartment. In addition the electrical and mechanical loads of the climate system were included. The different sources of heating and cooling were, for the tested powertrain, waste heat from the engine, a fuel <b>operated</b> <b>heater,</b> heat pickup of the air, evaporator cooling and cooling from recirculation. It was found that a separation of the sources and sink was possible and increased {{the understanding of the}} energy usage. Further the study showed that the sources were very dependent on the powertrain and that ambient conditions and thermal state of the vehicle, i. e. thermal load, had a very large impact on the needed energy...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{numerical simulation}} of a micromachined thermal accelerometer and experimental measurements. The sensor principle {{consists of a}} heating resistor, which creates a symmetrical temperature profile, and two temperature detectors symmetrically placed {{on both sides of}} the heater. When an acceleration is applied, the free convection is modified, the temperature profile becomes asymmetric and the two detectors measure the differential temperature. This temperature profile and sensor sensitivity according to the distance heater-detector have been studied using numerical resolution of fluid dynamics equations with the commercial code CFD 2000 /STORM: it shows that the optimum distance between the temperature detectors and the heater is about 300 μm. A thermal accelerometer with 3 pairs of detectors placed at 100, 300 and 500 μm from the heater was manufactured using the techniques of micromachining silicon and experimental measurements have shown a good agreement with the numerical simulations: the experimental optimum distance between heater and detectors seems to be close to 400 μm and the differential temperature of detectors is about 3 °C/g for an <b>operating</b> <b>heater</b> power of 54 mW and an heater temperature rise AT of 238 °C.

25|$|Following World War II, tubes {{intended}} {{to be used in}} series heater strings were redesigned to all have the same ("controlled") warm-up time. Earlier designs had quite-different thermal time constants. The audio output stage, for instance, had a larger cathode, and warmed up more slowly than lower-powered tubes. The result was that heaters that warmed up faster also temporarily had higher resistance, because of their positive temperature coefficient. This disproportionate resistance caused them to temporarily <b>operate</b> with <b>heater</b> voltages well above their ratings, and shortened their life.|$|R

40|$|Fired heaters are {{the largest}} {{consumers}} of energy in refineries and petrochemical plants. Most heaters in the industry are not operating at their peak efficiency.

One of the common reasons is the fluctuation in the <b>heater</b> <b>operating</b> conditions and continuous need for optimization of the <b>heater</b> <b>operating</b> parameters. It {{is not possible to}} optimize the heater operation with fluctuating loads using current equipment. FIS has developed a two-prong approach {{to take care of this}} problem. The Heater Performance Index software is built into the DCS and monitors the key performance indicators round the clock. It is based on modeling of the heater and provides direction to the operators to optimize the heater. In addition, FIS has developed hardware based control schemes which can optimize the heater automatically. Optimizing the heater operation will prolong heater life and reduce NOx emissions...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{need for}} better HEPA filter materials, {{especially}} those able to withstand higher temperatures as experienced in fire conditions. In order to test these materials our team built a Mini High Temperature Testing Unit (MHTTU) that can rapidly, efficiently, and inexpensively test a large number of new and innovative materials for HEPA filter components. MHTTU test results will be used to down select the most promising materials for HEPA filter components (e. g., media, sealants, gaskets) for full scale testing in the HTTU. There are already some pieces of equipment that exist {{in other parts of the}} country that produce similar effects, but do not fulfil our specific needs of 1300 °F air at the low flow rates of 1. 25 - 12 ACFM. Our attempts to source heaters were iterative due to the difficult nature of finding items that fulfilled both extreme specifications. The design decided upon pre-testing involved using two individually <b>operating</b> <b>heaters,</b> one for each end of flow regime. After initial testing, the immersion heater, originally intended solely for the low range of flows proved better able to handle our complete range than the higher flow heat torch. With the current design, we were only able to reach a temperature of 1116 F, but we were able to meet all of our other specifications, including flow rates, warm up time, and differential pressure drop across the test section. We believe that the majority of our heat loss was shed through the uninsulated housing of the heat torch, and recommend removing the heat torch and transfer section from the device. This would lessen the mass of stainless steel to be heated as well as remove a relatively large heat shedding fin from the device...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Compared with {{internal}} combustion engine, the electric vehicle has {{a limitation of}} low driving range due to low battery capacity due to relatively low energy density.

40|$|The Yucca Mountain Project is {{currently}} evaluating the coupled thermal-mechanical-hydrological-chemical (TMHC) {{response of the}} potential repository host rock through an in situ thermal testing program. A drift scale test (DST) was constructed during 1997 and heaters were turned on in December 1997. The DST includes nine canister-sized containers with thirty <b>operating</b> <b>heaters</b> each located within the heated drift (HD) and fifty wing heaters located in boreholes in both ribs with a total power output of nominally 210 kW. A total of 147 boreholes (combined length of 3. 3 km) houses most of the over 3700 TMHC sensors connected with 201 km of cabling to a central data acquisition system. The DST {{is located in the}} Exploratory Studies Facility in a 5 -m diameter drift approximately 50 m in length. Heating will last up to four years and cooling will last another four years. The rock mass surrounding the DST will experience a harsh thermal environment with rock surface temperatures expected to reach a maximum of about 200 C. This paper describes the process of designing the DST. The first 38 m of the 50 -m long Heated Drift (HD) is dedicated to collection of data that will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the complex coupled TMHC processes in the host rock of the proposed repository. The final 12 m is dedicated to evaluating the interactions between the heated rock mass and cast-in-place (CIP) concrete ground support systems at elevated temperatures. In addition to a description of the DST design, data from site characterization, and a general description of the analyses and analysis approach used to design the test and make pretest predictions are presented. Test-scoping and pretest numerical predictions of one way thermal-hydrologic, thermal-mechanical, and thermal-chemical behaviors have been completed (TRW, 1997 a).
