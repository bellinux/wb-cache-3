Marge and the Simpsons slyly imply that the aliens could not possibly destroy every politician, and they fly <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
5|$|Stepbrothers Phineas and Ferb, {{along with}} their father Lawrence and sister Candace, go to an Egyptian-themed movie theater where they see a movie about two archeologists who {{discover}} an undead mummy. Phineas and Ferb are inspired {{to find their own}} mummy and go out to the basement of the theater, where there is rumored to be a mummy. Candace sees them going <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this and follows them, hoping to get them in trouble with their father. However, as Phineas and Ferb go searching for the mummy through the basement hallways wearing archeologist hats, they run into what they believe are booby traps; they avoid the traps but Candace ends up getting hit by them all. Eventually, she becomes caught up in raggy toilet paper and cannot talk properly (due to eating stale bubble gum), which leads to the boys mistaking her for the mummy and capturing her.|$|E

25|$|A {{few more}} {{details of the}} battle against the Anti-Monitor are later {{revealed}} during the New 52 comic mini-series (leading into DC's Rebirth event). After the defeat of Anti-Monitor, Pre-New 52 Clark and Lois decide to start life anew in the closest universe they can find (mysteriously yet unable to see their old universe even though {{the rest of the}} multiverse had been restored) while Pre-Crisis Kara Zor-El, along with her contemporary Barry Allen and Zero Hour Parallax/Hal Jordan, decide to find their place in the universe and go <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Her fate as of that story arc is yet to be revealed.|$|E
500|$|... "No Future" [...] {{was nearly}} {{cut from the}} record. It was {{inspired}} by punk rock history, as many songs—for example, the Sex Pistols' [...] "God Save the Queen"—contain a [...] "no future" [...] lyric. [...] "Home Is Such a Lonely Place" [...] is a ballad with [...] "clean arpeggiated finger-picking guitars with strings underneath it." [...] Its lyrics are themed around lost love; it emerged from an early-morning coffee meeting between Hoppus and Feldmann, who both imagined how lonely their homes would be when their children grow up and move away. [...] "Kings of the Weekend" [...] was also nearly moved off the final track listing, but kept because of its recognizable guitar riff. Feldmann described it as [...] "the party song. We've all had day jobs {{and we all know}} what it's like to have that day <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what we want." [...] "Teenage Satellites" [...] is based around [...] "being a kid and not knowing who you are, not having enough courage to say what you mean." [...] It was the last song recorded for the album, and it was at first written without a hook or melody in mind. [...] "Left Alone" [...] made the album cut because the band liked Skiba's vocal performance. [...] "Rabbit Hole" [...] was one of Hoppus' favorites, and revolves around [...] "standing your ground and not falling for people's nonsense." ...|$|E

2500|$|At long last, Garuda alighted {{in front}} of the waiting serpents. [...] Placing the elixir on the grass, and thereby {{liberating}} his mother Vinata from her servitude, he urged the serpents to perform their religious ablutions before consuming it. [...] As they hurried <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, Indra swooped in to make off with the elixir. The serpents came back from their ablutions and saw the elixir gone but with small droplets of it on the grass. They tried to lick the droplets and thereby split their tongues in two. From then onward, serpents have split tongues and shed their skin as a kind of immortality. From that day onward, Garuda was the ally of the gods and the trusty mount of Vishnu, as well as the implacable enemy of snakes, upon whom he preyed at every opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|The Sacrifice is {{the story}} of Gilthas, the weak son of Tanis Half-Elven and Laurana. [...] It begins with two elves meeting with Dalamar the Dark, a black-robed mage, gaining his help to trap Gilthas in Qualinesti that he might become a puppet ruler of the elves. [...] The scene goes to Gilthas, the {{protected}} and weak youth, who is rebellious against his parents. [...] He receives a letter from a Qualinesti Senator, Rashas, to meet him in an inn, and Gilthas runs <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Tanis goes after him and discovers signs that make him believe that Gilthas was ambushed, though it is in fact not true. [...] Dalamar appears to him and Tanis is knocked out. [...] Gilthas's fate is revealed; he was met by Rashas, who rode a griffin, and taken to Qualinost, capital of the elves. [...] There, he is taken to a room where the elven Queen Alhana Starbreeze resides against her will. [...] Rashas goes to make preparation for Gilthas's coronation, and Gilthas is forced to stay in the city. [...] Dalamar reveals to Tanis that Gilthas is to be made king of the Qualinesti, and they begin to make plans. [...] Gilthas is told he will be crowned the next day. [...] Dalamar reveals to Tanis that what has transpired has destroyed the chance for a massive alliance as was planned, thanks to Rashas. [...] Alhana's servant Samar comes to rescue them, but Rashas arrives in time to stop it. [...] Samar is arrested, and Gilthas and Alhana are separated. [...] Gilthas tells Rashas he will not swear the oath to become King, but Rashas threatens to kill Alhana if he doesn't; Gilthas agrees. [...] Tanis and Dalamar, aided by magic, go to try to stop the coronation, and when Tanis commands Gilthas to take off the medallion that allows him to be King, Gilthas refuses and swears to become Speaker.

[...] Tanis is sent to the border where he meets Dalamar and discovers Alhana has already gone on with Samar. [...] Gilthas appears to say good-bye to his father, and after he does so returns to Qualinesti. [...] Tanis and Dalamar then depart.|$|E

50|$|The {{best way}} to {{describe}} Credit Fracking is if 1 or 2 investors buy a company and then break it up into smaller pieces and sell it <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{hundreds or thousands of}} individuals for a profit. The same thing applies to credit history. Most companies have large credit lines and have made thousands of payments on time and even after that business is no longer in operation, its credit history remains intact and can be sold <b>off</b> <b>to</b> investors <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with as they please. Investors buy the credit history and sell off pieces of it to other companies and private individuals to piggyback and raise their credit score or loan availability. Credit fracking is frowned upon in the banking community but it is not illegal.|$|R

50|$|Enticing the batsman to {{edge and}} hit a catch to the wicket-keeper or slips is the {{standard}} wicket-taking tactic in <b>off</b> theory. <b>To</b> <b>do</b> so, the bowler tries to make the ball deviate off its expected line away from the batsman's body on the off-side. Outswingers or leg cutters, or the standard leg spinner are delivery types that have this effect. Unsurprisingly, bowlers bowling these deliveries effectively generally have larger slip cordons {{than those who are}} not.|$|R
