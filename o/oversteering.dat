5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when <b>oversteering,</b> the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|Bottas, Ricciardo, Magnussen and Räikkönen made pit {{stops to}} change to {{intermediate}} tyres on lap 12. After his early pit stop, Button moved up to eighth place on the lap. Massa and Vettel made their pit stops the following lap, with Vettel moving in front of Massa and rejoining ahead of teammate Ricciardo. Rosberg made his pit stop on the 14th lap and rejoined in second position, 22 seconds behind Hamilton (who recorded fast sector times {{in an attempt to}} move ahead of Rosberg after the latter's pit stop). Hamilton went off the track at the Spoon Curve, rejoining the race at the run-off area. The mistake reduced the time deficit by one second. Rosberg reclaimed first position when Hamilton approached the exit of the pit lane after the latter's stop. He reported that his car was <b>oversteering,</b> and Button held a 6.5-second advantage over both Williams cars. The Red Bull cars reduced the gap to Massa in sixth by lap 16, and began a challenge for the position. Vettel moved to the inside lane and passed Massa with a narrow margin at the hairpin on the lap. Although Ricciardo attempted a similar manoeuvre on the outside at the Spoon Curve, Massa accelerated clear heading into 130R corner.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fifth pole position of the season and his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:50.646; although he was optimistic about his race prospects, he was concerned about the start. Häkkinen was joined in the front row of the grid by Trulli, who equalled his best qualifying performance of the season (at the Monaco Grand Prix). Trulli was also optimistic about his chances because of the Jordan team's strong record at the circuit. Button qualified third, and said he was happy with his starting position. Michael Schumacher secured fourth position, nine-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, setting a lap time which pushed Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard into fifth. Coulthard, who had problems with grip, believed that he could have had a faster lap time. Ralf Schumacher secured sixth position after being caught in traffic during his final run, keeping the Williams driver from a quicker lap time. Villeneuve, in seventh, reported <b>oversteering.</b> Frentzen qualified eighth; his best lap time was disqualified after Coulthard blocked him at the Bus Stop chicane, which caused Frentzen to run onto the grass. Herbert and Barrichello rounded out the top ten drivers, with Barrichello spinning at the chicane during his third run after locking his brakes. Fisichella, eleventh, missed the top ten by three-tenths of a second on his only quick run of the session. Herbert's teammate, Eddie Irvine, qualified twelfth with tyre-grip problems. He was ahead of Zonta in the slower of the two BARs (which lost a half-second through Eau Rouge), Heidfeld in the faster Prost, Sauber's Pedro Diniz and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa. Alesi qualified 17th, despite spinning at the chicane and triggering a yellow flag. Salo qualified 18th, ahead of Wurz (who had engine problems and shared the spare Benetton monocoque with Fisichella). Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the back of the}} grid, in positions 20 to 22.|$|E
25|$|Rosberg {{made his}} second pit {{stop on the}} same lap, handing the lead back to Hamilton. Bottas also made a pit stop but was heavily delayed after his seat belt had undone itself and his team made {{adjustments}} to it, allowing Button into fourth and Bottas rejoined in 12th place. Hamilton began to lap faster than any other driver {{in an effort to}} move into the lead upon making his pit stop. He was asked by his team on lap 28 to make an energy recover switch to increase his car's harvesting rate but had not made a forward brake bias adjustment. When Hamilton applied his brakes for the Descida do Lado turn, his rear tyre locked and attempted to regain control of his <b>oversteering</b> car but went off into the corner's run-off area. He returned to the track but lost seven seconds worth of time. He made his pit stop on the same lap and emerged in second, 7.4 seconds behind teammate Rosberg. Button closed up to Kvyat and feigned a passing move on the latter but waited until the main straight to overtake Kvyat with DRS assistance heading into the Senna chicane on lap 30. Hamilton reduced the gap to teammate Rosberg to five seconds by the 35th lap despite running on blistered rear tyres. Räikkönen made a pit stop from third on the same lap but lost time after the front jack was lowered before his right-front tyre was installed and emerged in 13th behind Grosjean.|$|E
25|$|Qualifying {{took place}} in warm weather conditions. In {{the first group of}} five runners, where all drivers elected to take time to {{increase}} tyre temperature, Rosenqvist paced the session, half a second faster than second-placed Engel and Sarrazin was third. Piquet was fourth-fastest, while Heidfeld was affected by a throttle sensor malfunction that prevented him from recording a maximum power lap. After completing his lap, Heidfeld stopped his car on the track to rectify the problem which caused him to start {{at the back of the}} grid. Buemi drove cleanly was the fastest driver in the second group; Abt was 0.013 seconds slower than Buemi in second and Prost third. Dillmann and Carroll (who missed the turn nine apex) were the slowest drivers of the second group. In the third group, López recorded the fastest time, ahead of Turvey and di Grassi. Evans took fourth and Félix da Costa rounded out the top five. Despite losing time in the second sector, Bird set the fastest overall time of any competitor in the group qualifying stages in the fourth group at one minute and 7.805 seconds. Vergne was second-fastest, ahead of the Dragon pairing of Duval and d'Ambrosio. Frijns was the slowest driver in the fourth group, and at the end of group qualifying, the times set by Bird, López, Vergne, Buemi and Rosenqvist were fast enough to enable progression into super pole. Rosenqvist clinched the second position of his career with a time of one minute and 8.208 seconds despite contending with an <b>oversteering</b> car. He was joined on the grid's front row by Buemi who recorded a lap 0.098 seconds slower than Rosenqvist. López struggled with wheelspin, and lost time with oversteer entering turn six, restricting him to third. Bird was close to Rosenqvist's pace in the first sector, but took fourth after drifting slightly through the seventh turn. Vergne struggled with his car's handling because of oversteer and persistent brake locking, causing him to start from fifth place.|$|E
500|$|By {{the fifth}} orbit, Schirra {{had begun to}} relax, commenting {{that it was the}} first rest he had had since December 1961. He used a small bungee cord {{exercise}} device for [...] "a little bit of stretching", before dropping into manual attitude control, where he reported a sudden burst of <b>oversteering</b> and high fuel use. Over the Atlantic he returned to observation and photography; he failed to spot the planned high-power light near Durban, in South Africa, due to cloud cover, but did make out the brightly lit city of Port Elizabeth. Over the Philippines, he reported on his fuel status; after four and a half of the planned six orbits, he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks. Passing over Quito, Ecuador, towards the end of his fifth orbit, Schirra was asked by the tracking station if he had any message to pass on [...] "in Spanish to the fellows down here", and he made some comments on how beautiful the country appeared from orbit, ending with a cheery [...] "Buenos Dias, y'all!" [...] Schirra later noted that he was [...] "furious" [...] at this point—he was preparing for re-entry and didn't want to be distracted with making public statements.|$|E
2500|$|On-the-job {{training}} at sea is critical to a helmsman developing ability to [...] "sense" [...] or anticipate how a ship will respond in different conditions.

50|$|Z-bar and roll-inducing springs: Mercedes-Benz introduced, to {{help their}} low-pivot swing-axle, a coil spring mounted transversally above the differential, which would {{transfer}} load {{from one side to}} the other, so as to force down one wheel when the other side went up. This coil spring increases the load bearing capacity of the rear suspension, so a new lower pressure set of springs was substituted for the usual ones to maintain ride suppleness. A similar effect was achieved by VW's Z-bar, a roll-bar, as opposed to anti-rolling bar. Both devices increase the rolling tendency of the rear axles, thus reducing the <b>oversteering</b> tendency. Aftermarket roll-inducing springs, also called camber compensators, are available for Porsche, VW and early Corvairs, which reduce <b>oversteering</b> tendencies at the cost of increasing suspension harshness.|$|E

The game was built on an overhauled engine for better visuals and Internet connectivity with tracks that include skinnable advertisement panels. This version also features two new gameplay modes: ...|$|E
50|$|Lift-off {{oversteer}} (also {{known as}} snap-oversteer, trailing-throttle oversteer, throttle off oversteer, or lift-throttle oversteer) {{is a form}} of oversteer in automobiles that occurs while cornering when closing the throttle causes a deceleration, causing the vertical load on the tires to shift from the rear to the front, in a process called weight transfer. This decrease in vertical load on the rear tires causes a decrease in the lateral force they generate, so that their lateral acceleration (into the corner) is also decreased. This causes the vehicle to steer more tightly into the turn, hence <b>oversteering.</b> In other words, easing off the accelerator can cause the rear tires to lose traction, with the potential for the car to leave the road tail first.|$|E
5000|$|Fixing {{understeer}} or oversteer {{conditions is}} achieved by either an increase or decrease in grip on the front or rear axles. If the front axle has more grip than a similar vehicle with neutral steer characteristics, the vehicle will oversteer. The <b>oversteering</b> vehicle may be [...] "tuned" [...] by hopefully increasing rear axle grip, or alternatively by reducing front axle grip. The opposite is true for an understeering vehicle (rear axle has excess grip, fixed by increasing front grip or reducing rear grip).The following actions will have the tendency to [...] "increase the grip" [...] of an axle. Increasing moment arm distance to cg, reducing lateral load transfer (softening shocks, softening sway bars, increasing track width), increasing tire contact patch size, increasing the longitudinal load transfer to that axle, and decreasing tire pressure.|$|E
5000|$|With Magna now {{competing}} well {{in terms}} of overall size, the AWD development was an attempt by MMAL to counter Australians' long held perception that its perennial RWD rivals - the market-dominant Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore - offered better handling. This led to a [...] advertising campaign including on television, which portrayed a high speed sprint involving a Magna AWD, Holden Commodore (VT) and Ford Falcon (AU), with the latter RWD cars <b>oversteering</b> wildly out of control on a dirt bend. The television advertisement {{became the subject of}} complaints alleging that it promoted unsafe driving. This resulted in MMAL being forced to make changes following the intervention of the Advertising Standards Board finding the company to be in breach of a then new national code for car advertising.|$|E
5000|$|EBD {{may work}} in {{conjunction}} with ABS and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) to minimize yaw accelerations during turns. ESC compares the steering wheel angle to vehicle turning rate using a yaw rate sensor. [...] "Yaw" [...] is the vehicle's rotation around its vertical center of gravity (turning left or right). If the yaw sensor detects more/less yaw than the steering wheel angle should create, the car is understeering or <b>oversteering</b> and ESC activates one of the front or rear brakes to rotate the car back onto its intended course. For example, if a car is making a left turn and begins to understeer (the car plows forward {{to the outside of}} the turn) ESC activates the left rear brake, which will help turn the car left. The sensors are so sensitive, and the actuation is so quick that the system may correct direction before the driver reacts. ABS helps prevent wheel lock-up and EBD helps apply appropriate brake force to make ESC work effectively and easily.|$|E
50|$|For 1986 Cogan joined Patrick Racing {{to drive}} the #7 7-Eleven March 86C-Cosworth DFX.

It {{was also the first}} time Cogan led the CART standings in his career. With 13 laps to go in the Indianapolis 500, Cogan made a bold move to pass Rick Mears and Bobby Rahal in less than a lap when both were held up by the slower car of Randy Lanier. Despite his car conspicuously <b>oversteering</b> in the turns, Cogan pulled away to a 3-second lead before a caution came out on lap 195 for a crash by Arie Luyendyk in turn four. Cogan did not get a good restart on lap 198 and was passed by Rahal, {{eventually}} finishing in 2nd place.

The contestants have three attempts to accelerate to 35 km/h (originally 40 km/h, but lowered {{at the last}} moment) and swerve in the direction opposite where a fake taxi appears, either {{to the left or}} the right. Amy, going first, fails her three runs (the first when she swerved towards the fake taxi, the second one when she was confused by the absence of either fake taxi, the third by swerving too wide). Emily also fails her three runs, partly due to her poor vision and partly due to poor cornering. Ashley, motivated by her son's first birthday {{at the end of the}} week (which she will miss if she does not graduate this episode), also fails her three runs, driving into the fake cab every time. She is also there to watch Lindsay fail her three runs (once while underspeed). Teagan also fails his three runs from <b>oversteering.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When the Porsche 911 Turbo {{debuted in}} August 1974, with large, flared, rear spoilers, they were {{immediately}} dubbed whale tails.
