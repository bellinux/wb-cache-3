Clouzot's time in the sanatorium would be very influential on his career. While bedridden, Clouzot read constantly and learned the mechanics of storytelling to help improve his scripts. Clouzot also studied the fragile nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in the sanatorium. Clouzot had little money during this period, and was provided with financial and moral support by his family and friends. By the time Clouzot left the sanatorium and returned to Paris, World War II had broken out. French cinema had changed {{because many of the}} producers he had known had fled France to escape Nazism.|$|E

25|$|To {{investigate}} {{if people}} would help {{others in the}} presence of bystanders alone or when introducing an accountability cue, van Bommel set out to perform two experiments. For the first experiment, participants were invited to join an online forum. A sample of 86 students was used and in the forum participants saw their own name and the names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> that were online in the left upper half of the screen. To operationalize the accountability cue, participants' names were displayed in either red or black. Red (salient condition), utilized to attract attention and stand out, was used to raise public self-awareness while black (non-salient) was used for participants to have the same color as other bystanders. In random order, five different messages were presented to the participants. Each of these messages was a personal story of a person in distress. The number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants and as expected, the results showed that names in black (non-salient condition) were linked to the bystander effect with the amount of help being 2. However, when names were in the red (salient condition), the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help being 3. This exemplifies the role of self-awareness in the reversal of bystander effect.|$|E

Seyfried said that neither of them {{wanted to do the}} kiss because they felt it was just for promotional purposes. She agreed with Fox that she was uneasy about acting out the scene. [...] "It was my first time doing a real kissing scene with a woman", she stated. [...] "It is just weird. It is a woman. With a woman's smell—soft and floraly—and maybe the pheromones are different.

500|$|The Second World War {{demonstrated}} that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. To avoid a brain drain to the United States, twelve European countries {{banded together to}} create CERN, a research organisation {{along the lines of}} the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake Big Science projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site. Pierre Auger, who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr's presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and Geneva was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957. Victor Weisskopf, who later became the Director General of CERN, summed up Bohr's role, saying that [...] "there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of CERN. The enthusiasm and ideas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> would not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it." ...|$|E

[...] "Stick It Out" [...] contains lyrical references to Zappa's songs [...] "What Kind Of Girl", [...] "Bwana Dik", [...] "Sofa No. 2", and [...] "Dancin' Fool". [...] "Dong Work For Yuda" [...] was written as a tribute to Zappa's bodyguard, John Smothers, and features Terry Bozzio imitating Smothers' dialect and speech. [...] "Keep It Greasy" [...] is a lyrical tribute to anal sex. Following Joe's imprisonment and release, the libretto describes a dystopian future, accompanied musically by long guitar solos, which Joe imagines in his head. The penultimate song, [...] "Packard Goose", criticizes rock journalism, and features a philosophical monologue delivered by the character Mary, who had been absent since the first act. In the epilogue song [...] "A Little Green Rosetta," [...] Joe gives up music, returns to sanity, hocks his imaginary guitar and gets [...] "a good job" [...] at the Utility Muffin Research Kitchen Facility (a self-reference to Zappa's own personal studio), and the Central Scrutinizer turns off the plastic megaphone that he has been whispering into, sings the last song on the album in his regular voice, and joins in a long musical number with most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> that worked with Zappa around 1979.

40|$|European {{colonial powers}} invaded then {{dominated}} {{a large part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world from the Renaissance to <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 th century. Across this long history and numerous geographical settings, colonialism took various forms, was associated with diverse practices, and was justified by different ideologies. However, it created unprecedented situations <b>of</b> encounters between <b>the</b> original inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonised countries and European colonisers, locking them in “the most complex and traumatic relationship in human history” (Loomba, 2005, p. 8). This long traumatic relationship had a tremendous influence on <b>the</b> psychologies <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> colonised and the colonisers, deeply affecting their views <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples,</b> and <b>of</b> themselves. This influence did not cease once the independence treaties were signed, as the colonial experience continues to impregnate the cultures and identities of both formerly-colonising and formerly-colonised peoples. As a consequence, colonialism still affects their current interactions, be it in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> international relationships or in that of contacts between majority members and immigrants or indigenous peoples in western countries. Accordingly, psychological analyses have occupied a central position in anti-colonial and post-colonial critiques. This article will summarize some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main features <b>of</b> these analyses. After defining key concepts, it will address the colonial situation as a source <b>of</b> representations about <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> for <b>the</b> Europeans. Then it will address <b>the</b> psychological characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonial situation for both the colonised and the colonisers and their mutual relationships, before and after decolonisation. Finally, it will situate colonialism as a topic in current psychological research. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

50|$|By the 17th century, the Sioux, {{who would}} later come to {{dominate}} much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, had settled in what is today central and northern Minnesota. The Sioux spoke a language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Siouan language family, and were divided into four general branches - the Santee, the Yankton, the Yanktonnais, and the Lakota (also known as the Teton). During this time, <b>the</b> lifestyle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sioux resembled that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eastern woodlands more so than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plains.

However, by the late 17th century and early 18th century the Sioux would begin to move south and then west into the plains. This migration was due to several factors, including greater food availability to the west, as well as the fact that the rival Cree had obtained rifles from the French at a time when the Sioux were still using the bow and arrow.|$|R
