50|$|A {{number of}} motivations have been {{suggested}} to explain why mobile telecoms providers use convergent charging & billing.

60|$|When we {{were again}} in motion, I begged to be {{informed}} what was the largest poster His Majesty had ever seen. The King replied, 'A thirty-six sheet poster.' I gathered, also, that there were about {{a hundred and fifty}} bill-stickers in London, and that His Majesty considered an average hand equal to the posting of <b>one</b> hundred <b>bills</b> (<b>single</b> sheets) in a day. The King was of opinion, that, although posters had much increased in size, they had not increased in number; as the abolition of the State Lotteries had occasioned a great falling off, especially in the country. Over and above which change, I bethought myself that the custom of advertising in newspapers had greatly increased. The completion of many London improvements, as Trafalgar Square (I particularly observed the singularity of His Majesty's calling THAT an improvement), the Royal Exchange, &c., had of late years reduced the number of advantageous posting-places. Bill-Stickers at present rather confine themselves to districts, than to particular descriptions of work. One man would strike over Whitechapel, another would take round Houndsditch, Shoreditch, and the City Road; one (the King said) would stick to the Surrey side; another would make a beat of the West-end.|$|R

50|$|RoHS is not {{the only}} {{environmental}} standard of which electronic product developers should be aware.
