30|$|FTIR {{spectra of}} C–O–C bond at 1030  cm− 1 for {{alginate}}, alginate–TMC, and alginate–TMC–PEG microcapsules {{are related to}} alginate (Coates 2000; Hu et al. 2013). The <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1441  cm− 1 in alginate–TMC spectrum is related to N–CH 3 bond of amino group that indicates the presence of TMC layer. The angular deformation of N–H bond of amino groups occurs at 1600  cm− 1 (1500 – 1620  cm− 1), though it is weaker due to N-methylation in TMC (Mourya and Inamdar 2009). Intensity of the <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1030  cm− 1 increased in alginate–TMC–mPEG microcapsules due to grafting mPEG–SVA on alginate–TMC microcapsules. The <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1600  cm− 1 {{is associated with the}} presence of amino I group (bending bond) (Sadeghi et al. 2004). The reduced peak intensity for alginate–TMC–mPEG microcapsules, in comparison with alginate–TMC, could be related to the bonding of NH 3 + groups of TMC to COO− groups of mPEG. Additionally, the <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 3000 – 3500  cm− 1 is related to hydroxyl and stretching amino groups. Figure  1 shows that addition of a layer to the microcapsules would result in a wider peak in this range. This clearly indicates the presence of TMC on alginate–TMC microcapsules and mPEG on alginate–TMC–mPEG microcapsules corresponding to their amino groups (Coates 2000; Trif and Socaciu 2007; Pavia et al. 2008).|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, the <b>observed</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 1400, 1600  cm− 1 illustrate aromatic CC stretching, 3058  cm− 1 clarify aromatic CH stretching, and 1183  cm− 1 show out of {{plane bending}} aromatic CH bond for brominated poly(2, 6 -diphenyl-p-phenylene oxide) (BPPPOdp). Also, monitored peaks around 1030 – 1050 and 1183  cm− 1 imply C–Br and C–O stretching bond, respectively.|$|R
50|$|In {{statistical}} signal processing, {{the goal}} of spectral density estimation (SDE) is to estimate the spectral density (also known as the power spectral density) of a random signal from a sequence of time samples of the signal. Intuitively speaking, the spectral density characterizes the frequency content of the signal. One purpose of estimating the spectral density is to detect any periodicities in the data, by <b>observing</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> the frequencies corresponding to these periodicities.|$|R
30|$|In Figure 2 b, the PL {{spectrum}} of P-doped ZnO nanowires {{at room temperature}} has only one <b>peak</b> centered <b>at</b> 380 nm, which is the near band edge (NBE) emission due to recombination of free excitons (FX). No defect-related emission is observed, especially the commonly <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 520 nm caused by oxygen vacancy and the peak around 480 nm caused by zinc vacancy [18]. Magnified spectrum from 475 ~ 625 nm part (inset of Figure 2 b) demonstrates that the defect-related emission disappears. The absence of such defect-related emission suggests the good quality of the as-synthesized P-doped ZnO nanowires.|$|R

The methyne carbon appears <b>at</b> the <b>range</b> 95.9 - 96.6 ppm. Four <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> the <b>range</b> 24.3 - 28.7, 20.3 - 20.6, 21 – 22.8 and 20.7 - 21.2 ppm are due to carbons of the six methyl groups (CH 3 C=NAr, CH 3 CNHAr and CH(CH 3) 2) respectively. In addition, their identities have also been confirmed by a molecular ion peak [M+] from GC-MS mass spectra.|$|R

30|$|The UV–visible {{spectrum}} of the reaction mixture recorded {{as a function of}} time is shown in graph. An <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 423 – 452  nm is assigned to the surface plasmon resonance band of the AgNPs, which is comparable with the literature values and exhibits continuous rise in intensity without any change in the peak position as a function of time. During 0 – 150  min intervals, the absorption peak was weak and broad, which indicates the smaller size of AgNPs. The absorption peaks are found to increase with the time which is in accordance with the color change observed in visual examination [20]. However, the peaks do not last after 180  min which also confirms the observation by visual examination.|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{taken by}} the International Ultraviolet Explorer {{spacecraft}} of the stars RY Sgr and R CrB have been analyzed using Mie theory. The extinction data, which show a 2400 - 2500 A peak, are consistent with a distribution of 5 - 60 nm glassy or amorphous carbon particles obscuring the stellar flux. The data are also fairly consistent with a cloud ejection model. Since the extinction data lack the commonly <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 2170 A, it is proposed that this difference {{is due to the}} conditions present when the dust condenses. Interstellar carbon grains appear to originate in normal carbon stars which are carbon and hydrogen rich.

30|$|PL spectra clearly {{show that}} the {{prepared}} Ag NPs exhibit photoluminescence due to excitation of electrons from occupied d bands into states above the Fermi level. Subsequent electron–phonon and hole–phonon scattering process leads to an energy loss and finally photoluminescent radiative recombination of an electron from an occupied sp band with the hole [32]. In the present study, the PL spectrum of Ag/ORE measured with the excitation wavelength 330  nm in the region 350 – 650  nm revealed the very weak broad emission <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 425  nm (2.89  eV) and 468  nm (2.63  eV). The <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 468  nm is {{in accordance with the}} peak corresponding to Ag nanoparticles prepared by chemical citrate reduction noticed in paper [31]. In the case of Ag/ORE/PVP sample, a broad emission <b>peak</b> located <b>at</b> 468  nm with very high PL intensity is observed indicating that the introduction of PVP into the system enhances the photoluminescence emission intensity.|$|R
30|$|The {{interstellar}} extinction curve (i.e. {{the variation}} of extinction with wavelength) is usually {{expressed by the}} ratio E(λ — V)/E(B — V) versus 1 /λ. We use the extinction efficiencies of the composite grains, with a power-law size distribution (i.e. n(a) ~ a− 3.5) (Mathis et al., 1977), to evaluate the interstellar extinction curve in the wavelength region of 3.4 – 0.10 µm. In addition to the composite grains, a separate component of small graphite grains is required to produce the <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 2175 Å in the interstellar extinction curve (Mathis, 1996).

30|$|Low-frequency Raman {{modes of}} nanometric Si {{crystallites}} were first observed in porous Si[39, 40]. Gregora et al.[39] <b>observed</b> a well-defined <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 37  cm- 1 in the low-frequency spectra of nanostructured porous silicon with 70 % porosity. Confined acoustic phonons were also observed in Si nanocrystals, of diameter 3.1  nm, dispersed in SiO 2 [41], {{and a broad}} peak between 20 and 40  cm- 1 was observed both in polarized and depolarized spectra, which {{could be attributed to}} a Boson peak, even though the authors did not explicitly name it as such. In addition, the Raman spectrum of porous silicon studied in[42] revealed a Boson <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 150  cm- 1.

30|$|As {{also shown}} in Fig.  3, the FTIR spectroscopic {{analysis}} indicated broad band at 3276  cm− 1, representing bonded –OH groups. The band observed at about 2918 – 2850  cm− 1 {{was assigned to}} the aliphatic C–H group. The peak around 1604  cm− 1 corresponds to the C=O stretch. The <b>peak</b> <b>observed</b> around 1375  cm− 1 corresponds to the symmetric bending of CH 3, while the <b>peak</b> <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> 1314  cm− 1 corresponds to the C–H bending. Moreso, the <b>peak</b> <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> 1012  cm− 1 corresponds to C=O bonds of ether, ester or phenol. The <b>peak</b> <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> 633  cm− 1 corresponds to –CN stretching and the <b>peak</b> <b>observed</b> <b>at</b> 594  cm− 1 corresponds to S–O. As seen in Figs.  1 and 3, the spectral analysis of raw M. oleifera and base activated M. oleifera indicated that mostly the bonded –OH groups, and C=O stretching will be involved in adsorption. There were clear band shifts and intensity decrease at 3280, 1632, 1381, 1048, 664, 513  cm− 1, respectively. The changes in FTIR spectra confirmed the effect of base activation on raw M. oleifera (Fig.  1). The shifts in the spectra show that M. oleifera leaves will be a useful adsorbent in the removal of dyes and heavy metals. This also correlates with many other works reported in the literatures (Al-Ghouti et al. 2003; Bekci et al. 2009; Sekhar et al. 2009).|$|R

For the pure Pt contacts we see a clear difference between point contacts and short chains in good agreement with experiments. We identify a tilted bridge configuration for the Pt-CO-Pt contact, which is stable and has a conductance close to $ 0. 5 G_ 0 $ ($G_ 0 = 2 e^ 2 /h$), and we propose that this structure is responsible for an <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> $ 0. 5 G_ 0 $ in the conductance histogram for Pt exposed to a CO gas.

30|$|Sample B (CHP) is {{basically}} an InGaAs quantum well (QW) sandwiched between the GaAs buffer and GaAs capping layers. The lattice-mismatched QW is 50 -nm thick, {{much greater than}} the critical thickness for strain relaxation by the formation of interfacial MDs which for In 0.13 Ga 0.87 As on GaAs is estimated at 15 nm [27]. The dislocations thus formed act as traps and non-radiative recombination centers [28]. PL from such layer is thus expected to be weak or absence. The <b>observed</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1.377 eV is indeed weak with respect to sample A, yet it suggests that a significant fraction of excitons are able to combine radiatively. The 1.377 -eV peak energy is higher than the bulk In 0.13 Ga 0.87 As bandgap of 1.323 eV and agrees well with the electron and hole eigenenergies estimated from self-consistent solutions of coupled Poisson-Schrodinger equation [29].|$|R

The results confirm that boron-loaded LAB is suitable for neutron detection in a gamma ray environment. To study indirectly the LAB pulse shape discrimination (PSD) capability between neutrons and gamma rays, a dissolved 212 Pb source emitting alpha and beta particles was used to emulate the conditions in a mixed radiation field for detecting neutrons {{in the presence of}} a high gamma ray background. The quenching factor depends on the alpha energy and increases from 10 to 25 as the alpha energy decreases from 10 to 1 MeV. 10 B loaded LAB-based LS has been tested in a neutron beam of energy which is equal to 14. 56 meV.

40|$|We study numerically the {{dynamics}} of bosons on a triangular lattice after quenching both the on-site interactions and the external trapping potential to negative values. In a similar situation on the square lattice, {{the dynamics}} can {{be understood in terms}} of an effectively reversed Hamiltonian. On the triangular lattice, however, the kinetic part of the reversed Hamiltonian is frustrated and whether coherence can develop is an open question. The strength of the frustration can be changed by tuning the ratio of the hopping rates along different directions. We calculate time-of-flight images at different times after the quench for different values of the hopping anisotropy. We <b>observe</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> the maxima of the original non-interacting dispersion relation both in the isotropic case and also in the rhombic limit of high hopping anisotropy.
