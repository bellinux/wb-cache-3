25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record we started first.

25|$|The {{story was}} nearly {{finished}} on the whiteboards when Chibnall began writing the script. After about two weeks, Chibnall had {{a draft of}} the first few episodes. But he had not yet settled on a killer. About two weeks later, Chibnall woke <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> realised the main suspect should be Joe Miller, DS Ellie Miller's husband. By making Joe the main suspect, Chibnall focused the series more closely on Ellie, and improved the narrative structure of the series so that it became about two families (the Millers and the Latimers). He then redrafted the first script and re-plotted and re-outlined the series. However, Chibnall kept the script loose enough that he could choose another character as the murderer, in case his preferred solution leaked to the press during shooting.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the film came when Emmerich and Devlin were in Europe {{promoting}} their film Stargate. A reporter asked Emmerich why he made a film with content like Stargate {{if he did not}} believe in aliens. Emmerich stated he was still fascinated by the idea of an alien arrival, and further explained his response by asking the reporter to {{imagine what it would be}} like to wake up <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> to discover 15 mile-wide spaceships were hovering over the world's largest cities. Emmerich then turned to Devlin and said, [...] "I think I have an idea for our next film." ...|$|E

500|$|Vanderbilt {{was drawn}} to the notion that Graysmith went from a {{cartoonist}} {{to one of the most}} significant investigators of the case. He pitched the story as: [...] "What if Garry Trudeau woke up <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> tried to solve the Son of Sam"? As he worked on the script, he became friends with Graysmith. The filmmakers were able to get the cooperation of the Vallejo Police Department (one of the key investigators at the time) because they hoped that the film would inspire someone to come forward with a crucial bit of information that might help solve this decades-old cold case.|$|E
500|$|Although Thomas had {{previously}} {{written for the}} BBC, it was a minor and intermittent source of income. In 1943 he wrote and recorded a 15-minute talk entitled [...] "Reminiscences of Childhood" [...] for the Welsh BBC. In December 1944 he recorded Quite Early One Morning (produced by Aneirin Talfan Davies, again for the Welsh BBC) but when Davies offered it for national broadcast BBC London turned it down. On 31 August 1945 the BBC Home Service broadcast Quite Early <b>One</b> <b>Morning,</b> <b>and</b> {{in the three years}} beginning October 1945, Thomas made over a hundred broadcasts for the corporation. Thomas was employed not only for his poetry readings, but for discussions and critiques.|$|E
500|$|Stipe had {{difficulty}} writing lyrics for the Up album. In {{the case of}} [...] "At My Most Beautiful", it took the singer a year to write the song's verse because he needed {{to figure out what}} one could do to prompt the action described in the opening line. The solution finally occurred to him <b>one</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> he finished writing the words in 45 minutes. After a conversation with Patti Smith, Stipe was convinced that he needed to be fearless in his songwriting approach. In regards to [...] "At My Most Beautiful", he had grown tired writing ironic love songs and consequently endeavored to create [...] "the most romantic song I'd ever written".|$|E

500|$|When Tom Norman {{first saw}} Merrick, he was {{dismayed by the}} extent of his deformities, fearing his {{appearance}} might be too horrific to be a successful novelty. Nevertheless, he exhibited Merrick in the back of an empty shop on Whitechapel Road. Merrick had an iron bed with a curtain drawn around to afford him some privacy. Norman observed Merrick asleep <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> learned that he always slept sitting up, with his legs drawn up and his head resting on his knees. His enlarged head was too heavy to allow him to sleep lying down and, as Merrick put it, he would risk [...] "waking with a broken neck". Norman decorated the shop with posters that had been created by Hitchcock, depicting a monstrous half-man, half-elephant. A pamphlet titled [...] "The Autobiography of Joseph Carey Merrick" [...] was created, outlining Merrick's life to date. This biography, whether written by Merrick or not, provided a generally accurate account of his life. It contained an incorrect date of birth but, throughout his life, Merrick was vague about when he was born.|$|E
500|$|During {{the editing}} phase, Singer {{thought that they}} had {{completed}} the film two weeks early, but woke up <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> realized that they needed that time {{to put together a}} sequence that convinced the audience that Dean Keaton was Söze — and then do the same for Verbal Kint because the film did not have [...] "the punch that Chris had written so beautifully." [...] According to Ottman, he assembled the footage as a montage but it still did not work until he added an overlapping voice-over montage featuring key dialogue from several characters and had it relate to the images. Early on, executives at Gramercy had problems pronouncing the name Keyser Söze and were worried that audiences would have the same problem. The studio decided to promote the character's name. Two weeks before the film debuted in theaters, [...] "Who is Keyser Söze?" [...] posters appeared at bus stops, and TV spots told people how to say the character's name. [...] Despite these efforts, all the actors in the film consistently mispronounce his name as [...] "Soze" [...] instead of [...] "Söze".|$|E

500|$|As {{was common}} with Pixar features, the {{production}} became difficult as delivery dates loomed and hours inevitably became longer. Still, Toy Story 2, with its highly compressed production schedule, was especially trying. While {{hard work and}} long hours were common to the team by that point (especially so to Lasseter), running flat-out on Toy Story 2 for month after month began to take a toll. The overwork spun out into carpal tunnel syndrome for some animators, and repetitive strain injuries for others. Catmull would later disclose that [...] "a full third of the staff" [...] ended up with some form of RSI {{by the time the}} film was finished. Pixar did not encourage long hours, and, in fact, set limits on how many hours employees could work by approving or disapproving overtime. Employees' self-imposed compulsions to excel often trumped any other constraints, and were especially common to younger employees. In one instance, an animator had forgotten to drop his child off at daycare <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and,</b> in a mental haze, forgot the baby {{in the back seat of}} his car in the parking lot. [...] "Although quick action by rescue workers headed off the worst, the incident became a horrible indicator that some on the crew were working too hard," [...] wrote David Price in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch.|$|E
500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he woke up <b>one</b> <b>morning</b> <b>and</b> didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he had to be careful because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school <b>one</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>and</b> reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E
