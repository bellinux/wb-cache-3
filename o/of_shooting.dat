5|$|The first {{shooting}} thalers were cantonal pieces, minted by {{the sovereign}} cantons of Switzerland. All of these pieces, {{as well as}} the 1855 Solothurn issue, were strictly legal tender. Nineteenth-century Confederation shooting thaler issues were minted to legal fineness, and were thus allowed to bear the denomination of five francs. Beginning in 1865, Switzerland {{became a member of the}} Latin Monetary Union. Shooting thalers were not included in the mintages authorized by the Union. Therefore, these issues are commonly considered semi-medallic, though they could circulate due to their size and weight being the same as that of the regular five franc issues. This series <b>of</b> <b>shooting</b> thalers, following the standards of the Latin Monetary Union, began in 1855 with the Solothurn issue and ended in 1885 with the Bern issue. In 1927, the Monetary Union ceased to exist. Mintage began on a new series <b>of</b> <b>shooting</b> thalers in 1934 in honor of the shooting festival in Fribourg, and another design was issued in 1939 for the Lucerne festival. The 1934 issue was the last official shooting thaler that matched the circulating counterpart in both diameter and weight. The 1939 issues were not the same size and weight as their circulating counterparts, but both issues were redeemable only at the shooting festival or participating businesses. Production <b>of</b> <b>shooting</b> thalers was cut short with the outbreak of World War II. In 1984, a new series <b>of</b> <b>shooting</b> thalers began mintage, due largely to the efforts of California-based coin dealer Richard Nelson. These issues, like those minted in 1934 and 1939, are not minted to legal fineness and are not considered legal tender.|$|E

40|$|Masters Thesis {{completed}} in 1987 by P. M. Kotanen at the University of Toronto. Supervised by Dr. R. L. Jefferies. SUMMARY: 1. The responses to herbivory of above-ground organs of the sedges Carex subspathaces and Carex X flavicans were investigated at La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba. Demographic techniques {{were used to}} compare the production and turnover <b>of</b> leaves and <b>shoots</b> and the elongation of leaves between plants of swards on which lesser snow Geese fed and plants of swards from which geese were excluded. The effects of herbivory on the <b>shoot</b> demography <b>of</b> carex aquatilis were also studied. 2. Patterns of foraging by the geese varied seasonally. Following their arrival at La Pérouse Bay, the geese fed by pulling <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> carices and by grubbing the roots and rhizomes of graminoids. After the hatch of the goslings, the geese fed by clipping the leaves of grasses and sedges. 3. Within one summer, gazing increased the cumulative production of leaves of Carex subspathaceaand of Carex X flavcas. Though the geese removed few leaves, leaves <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> both species in grazed plots had shorter lifespans than leaves <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> in ungrazed plots. Grazing also increased the total number <b>of</b> leaves per <b>shoot</b> which died during the growing season. 4. The rates of elongation <b>of</b> leaves <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> Carex subspathacea and Carex X flavicans in grazed plots did not consistently differ from the rates of elongation <b>of</b> leaves <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> in ungrazed plots. 5. Herbivory by geese did not consistently alter the production <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> Carex aquatilis, Carex subspathacea, or Carex X flavicans. 6. The increased production of leaves is the primary response of above-ground organs of these carices to herbivory by geese. The unresponsiveness <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> production suggests that these carices are more vulnerable to damage from the loss <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> than from the clipping of leaves...|$|R

For both Pelargonium cultivars, the application of cytokinins greatly increased the production of axillary and adventitious shoots compared with the shoots produced on the medium without growth regulators. In the case of P. x hederaefolium no significant differences it were found in the number <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> formed for BAP and m-Topolin treatments.

Kranji (Pongamia pinnata Merril) is one type of forest plants that have the potential as a source of renewable energy in the future. Kranji seed produces vegetable biofeul material, so we need another way to get the seedlings, one of them by cuttings. Moreover, the traits of the parent will be derived through vegetative propagation. This study aimed to determine the effect of plant material to the success of cuttings kranji. The plant treatment factors included the types <b>of</b> buds, <b>shoots</b> age, the part of buds and leaf on buds. The experiment based on the type <b>of</b> <b>shoots</b> used a randomized block design consisted of two treatments, dormant buds and growing shoots, with 5 replications, each treatment combination consisted of 50 cuttings. The experiment based on the age <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> used a randomized block design consisted of 5 treatments (ages of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months) with 5 replications, each treatment combination consisted of 50 cuttings. The experiment based on the part <b>of</b> <b>shoot</b> used a randomized block design consisted of three treatments (base, middle, and end <b>of</b> <b>shoots)</b> with 5 replications, each treatment combination consisted of 50 cuttings.
