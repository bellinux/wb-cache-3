25|$|The link-and-pin coupler {{consisted}} of a tube-like body that received an oblong link. During coupling, a rail worker had to stand between the cars as they came together and guide the link into the coupler pocket.

This procedure was exceptionally dangerous and many brakemen lost fingers or entire hands when they did not get them out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupler pockets in time. Many more were killed as a result of being crushed between cars or dragged under cars that were coupled too quickly.

The Northern Celestial Masters were a continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Celestial Masters as it had been practiced in Sichuan province by Zhang Lu and his followers. After the community was forced to relocate in 215 CE, a group of Celestial Masters established themselves in Northern China. [...] Kou Qianzhi, from a family who followed the Celestial Master, brought a new version of Celestial Master Daoism to the Northern Wei. The Northern Wei government embraced his form of Daoism and established it as the state religion, thereby creating a new Daoist theocracy that lasted until 450 CE. [...] The arrival of Buddhism had great influence on the Northern Celestial Masters, bringing monasticism and influencing the diet of practitioners. Art produced in areas dominated by the Northern Celestial Masters also began to show Buddhist influence. When the theocracy collapsed, many Daoists fled to Louguan, which quickly became an important religious center. The Northern Celestial Masters survived as a distinct school at Louguan until the late 7th century CE, when they became integrated into the wider Daoist movement.|$|E
