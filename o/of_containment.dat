5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure vessel and force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E

5|$|The United States {{and other}} anti-communist {{countries}} fought against North Vietnam and its communist allies during the Vietnam War {{in an attempt}} to prevent the communist takeover of South Vietnam and, more broadly, to implement the United States' policy <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> {{to prevent the spread of}} communism.

5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on one side and the USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> towards the expansion of communist influence.

5|$|By lending his {{prestige}} to Kennan's position, {{the president}} tacitly signaled {{his intention to}} formulate the strategy of his administration {{within the framework of}} its predecessor's, despite the misgivings of some within the Republican Party. The critical difference between the Truman and Eisenhower policies <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> had to do with Eisenhower's concerns that the United States could not indefinitely afford great military spending. The new president thus sought to minimize costs not by acting whenever and wherever the Soviets acted (a strategy designed to avoid risk) but rather whenever and wherever the United States could afford to act.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to President Ngo Dinh Diem's abrogation of the 1956 reunification election and suppression of communists {{during the late}} 1950s, Hanoi had begun sending arms and material to the guerrillas of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), who were fighting an insurgency to topple the American-supported Saigon government. To combat the NLF and {{to shore up the}} government in the south, the U.S. initially delivered monetary aid, military advisors, and supplies. Between 1957 and 1963, the U.S. found itself committed, through its acceptance of the policy <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> and belief in the domino theory, to defending South Vietnam from what it saw as expansive communist aggression.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} impacts <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> was {{the outbreak of the}} Korean War. In June 1950, Kim Il-sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea. Stalin approved and sent advisers to plan the North Korean invasion. To Stalin's surprise, the UN Security Council backed the defense of South Korea, though the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest that Taiwan and not Communist China held a permanent seat on the Council. A UN force of personnel from South Korea, the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, Colombia, Australia, France, South Africa, the Philippines, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand and other countries joined to stop the invasion.|$|E

5|$|The US government's {{response}} to this announcement was the adoption <b>of</b> <b>containment,</b> the goal of which was {{to stop the spread}} of Communism. Truman delivered a speech that called for the allocation of $400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine, which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes. Even though the insurgents were helped by Josip Broz Tito's Yugoslavia, American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence.|$|E

They also appreciated that such an attack would expose the German and Ottoman left flank. Murray's plan was to firstly delay the attackers and {{make it very difficult}} for them to gain ground south of Katib Gannit, and secondly, only when the German and Ottoman force was totally committed, to then disorganise their flank attack with an attack by Section Troops at Hill 70 and Dueidar, with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and the Mobile Column operating more widely against the flank and rear.|$|E

5|$|The {{escalation}} of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman's approval of NSC-68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> policy whereby the U.S. and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document was drafted by Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for building up the U.S. both militarily and economically.|$|E

On 18 March 1945, the battalion took part in its only major battle of the war when it launched an assault on Bacon Hill and captured it. In April 1945, the 14th/32nd Battalion was withdrawn back to Australia in preparation for involvement in future operations, however, in July {{the decision was made to}} disband the unit as the end of the war became apparent. During the course of the conflict the battalion suffered 77 casualties, of which 31 were killed in action or died of wounds or other causes.

40|$|AbstractThe problem <b>of</b> query <b>containment</b> is {{fundamental}} to many aspects of database systems, including query optimization, determining independence of queries from updates, and rewriting queries using views. In the data-integration framework, however, the standard notion <b>of</b> query <b>containment</b> does not suffice. We define relative containment, which formalizes the notion <b>of</b> query <b>containment</b> relative to the sources available to the data-integration system. First, we provide optimal bounds for relative containment for several important classes of datalog queries, including the common case of conjunctive queries. Next, we provide bounds for the case when sources enforce access restrictions {{in the form of}} binding pattern constraints. Surprisingly, we show that relative containment for conjunctive queries is still decidable in this case, even though it is known that finding all answers to such queries may require a recursive datalog program over the sources. Finally, we provide tight bounds for variants <b>of</b> relative <b>containment</b> when the queries and source descriptions may contain comparison predicates...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} problem <b>of</b> query <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> (unions of) conjunctive queries over {{annotated}} databases. Annotations are typically attached to tuples and represent metadata such as probability, multiplicity, comments, or provenance. It is usually assumed that annotations {{are drawn from}} a com-mutative semiring. Such databases pose new challenges in query optimization, since many related fundamental tasks, such as query containment, have to be reconsidered {{in the presence of}} propagation of annotations. We axiomatize several classes of semirings for each <b>of</b> which <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> conjunctive queries is equivalent to existence of a particular type of homomorphism. For each of these types we also specify all semirings for which existence of a corresponding homomorphism is a sufficient (or neces-sary) condition for the containment. We exploit these tech-niques to develop new decision procedures for <b>containment</b> <b>of</b> unions of conjunctive queries and axiomatize corresponding classes of semirings. This generalizes previous approaches and allows us to improve known complexity bounds...|$|R
25|$|The Asilomar Conference {{also gave}} {{recommendations}} for matching the types <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> necessary for {{different types of}} experiments. These recommendations {{were based on the}} different levels of risk associated with the experiment, which would require different levels <b>of</b> <b>containment.</b> These levels were minimal, low, moderate and high risk. The minimal risk level <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> was intended for experiments in which the biohazards could be accurately assessed and were expected to be minimal. Low risk containment was appropriate for experiments that generated novel biotypes but where the available information indicated that the recombinant DNA could not either alter appreciably the ecological behavior of the recipient species, increase significantly its pathogenicity or prevent effective treatments of any resulting infections. The moderate risk level <b>of</b> <b>containment</b> was intended for experiments in which there was a probability of generating an agent with a significant potential for pathogenicity or ecological disruption. High-risk containment was intended for experiments in which the potential for ecological disruption or pathogenicity of the modified organism could be severe and thereby pose a serious biohazard to laboratory personnel or to the public. These levels of containments, along with the previously mentioned safety measures, formed the basis for the guidelines used by investigators in future experiments that involved the construction and propagation of recombinant DNA molecules using DNA from prokaryotes, bacteriophages and other plasmids, animal viruses and eukaryotes.|$|E
