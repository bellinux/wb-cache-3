40|$|Many {{settlement}} agreements in lawsuits involving either multiple plaintiffs or multiple defendants include so-called "most-favored-nation" clauses. If a defendant facing multiple claims, for example, settles with some plaintiffs early and settles with additional plaintiffs later {{for a greater}} amount, then the early settlers will receive the more favorable terms as well. These MFN provisions have been prominent in the recent MP 3. com case, as well as tobacco litigation, class actions, and many antitrust lawsuits. This paper considers a defendant who is facing {{a large group of}} heterogeneous plaintiffs. Each plaintiff has private information about the (expected) award that he or she will receive should the case go to trial. MFN clauses are valuable because they commit the defendant not to raise his offer over time. This has two important effects.

Negotiations are modeled in a three player, non-cooperative, dynamic bargaining framework that admits the possibility of both bilateral and multilateral agreements. The central result is that bargaining in the presence <b>of</b> <b>MFN</b> results in Pareto efficient, mutually advantageous, multilateral trade agreements. The free-rider problem commonly attributed to the presence <b>of</b> <b>MFN</b> does not arise, and, under a condition of symmetry, each country receives equal gains (or reciprocity) from the agreement. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>MFN,</b> many of these properties may not hold. Examples are given in which at most two of the three countries benefit from agreement.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Myocardial {{hypertrophy}} is {{a common}} clinical finding leading to heart failure and sudden death. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn 2), a hyperplasia suppressor protein, is downregulated in hypertrophic heart. This study examined the role <b>of</b> <b>Mfn</b> 2 in myocardial hypertrophy and its potential signal pathway. Methods and Results: In in vitro studies, neonatal cardiac myocytes were isolated and cultured. Incubation of cultured cardiomycytes with angiotensin II (Ang II) inhibited gene expression <b>of</b> <b>Mfn</b> 2; induced cell hypertrophy and protein synthesis; and activated protein kinase Akt. Pretreatment of cells with AdMfn 2 —a replication-deficient adenoviral vector encoding ratMfn 2 gene—upregulatedMfn 2 expression and subsequently attenuated Ang II-induced cell hypertrophy; protein synthesis; and Akt activation. In in vivo studies, direct gene delivery of AdMfn 2 into myocardium decreased the infusion of Ang II-induced atrial natriuretic factor (ANF, a hypertrophic marker) expression and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Consistently, upregulation <b>of</b> <b>Mfn</b> 2 in myocardium decreased the thicknesses of anterior and posterior walls of left ventricle (LV) and the ratio of LV mass/body weight in Ang II-treated rats. Of note, AdGFP (control for AdMfn 2) {{did not affect the}} effects of Ang II in vitro or in vivo. Conclusions: Upregulation <b>of</b> <b>Mfn</b> 2 inhibits Ang II-induced myo-cardial hypertrophy.

Mitofusin 2 (Mfn 2) regulates mitochondrial morphology and signaling and is involved in the development of numerous mitochondrial-related diseases; however, a functional role for Mfn 2 in chronic liver cholestasis which is characterized by increased levels of toxic bile acids remain unknown. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the expression levels <b>of</b> <b>Mfn</b> 2 in liver samples from patients with extrahepatic cholestasis and to investigate the role Mfn 2 during bile acid induced injury in vitro. Endogenous Mfn 2 expression decreased in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis. Glycocheno-deoxycholic acid (GCDCA) is the main toxic component of bile acid in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis. In human normal hepatocyte cells (L 02), Mfn 2 {{plays an important role in}} GCDCA-induced mitochondrial damage and changes in mitochondrial morphology. In line with the mitochondrial dysfunction, the expression <b>of</b> <b>Mfn</b> 2 decreased significantly under GCDCA treatment conditions. Moreover, the overexpression <b>of</b> <b>Mfn</b> 2 effectively attenuated mitochondrial fragmentation and reversed the mitochondrial damage observed in GCDCA-treated L 02 cells. Notably, a truncated Mfn 2 mutant that lacked the normal C-terminal domain lost the capacity to induce mitochondrial fusion.

Gp 78 {{is also the}} cell surface receptor for autocrine motility factor (AMF), which prevents Gp 78 -dependent mitofusin degradation. Gp 78 ubiquitin ligase activity promotes ER–mitochondria association and ER–mitochondria Ca 2 + coupling, processes that are reversed by AMF. Electron microscopy of HT- 1080 fibrosarcoma cancer cells identified both smooth ER (SER; ∼ 8 nm) and wider (∼ 50 – 60 nm) rough ER (RER) –mitochondria contacts. Both short hairpin RNA (shRNA) -mediated knockdown ofGp 78 (shGp 78) andAMF treatment selectively reduced the extent of RER–mitochondria contacts without impacting on SER–mitochondria contacts.

Additionally, we determined the blastocyst formation rate and measured ATP levels, mtDNA levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and apoptosis in all of the embryos. The results indicate that the Mfn 2 and Bcl- 2 levels were markedly decreased, whereas Bax levels were increased in the T group (embryos transfected with Mfn 2 -siRNA) compared with the C group (embryos transfected with control-siRNA). The blastocyst formation rate was significantly decreased in the T group. The ATP content and the relative amounts of mtDNA and cDNA in the T group were significantly reduced compared with the C group. In the T group, ΔΨm and Ca(2 +) levels were reduced, and the number of apoptotic cells was increased. Low in vitro expression <b>of</b> <b>Mfn</b> 2 attenuates the blastocyst formation rate and cleavage speed in mouse zygotes and causes mitochondrial dysfunction, as confirmed by the ATP and mtDNA levels and mitochondrial membrane potential.

This affects the general equilibrium of the treaties, as recent case law from investment arbitration tribunals illustrates. In these cases the controversial issue is the applicability <b>of</b> the <b>MFN</b> clause to the dispute settlement provisions of the BITs. Arbitration practice and mainstream literature so far have focussed on the specific nature of the dispute settlement mechanism, asking whether the MFN clause should cover it or not. This article analyses the arguments put forward so far on this issue, and argues that by reason of the 'effet utile' the MFN clause always covers the dispute settlement mechanism, unless the opposite intention of the Contracting states can be demonstrated. Furthermore, this article considers that the prevailing focus on the entire mechanism is misleading.

However, underlying mechanisms of the fission/fusion balance are not well understood. Mitochondrial fission in mammals requires the dynamin-like protein DLP 1 /Drp 1 that is recruited to the mitochondrial surface, possibly through the membrane-anchored protein Fis 1 or Mff.
