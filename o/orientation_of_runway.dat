50|$|Over 95% of {{aircraft}} operations {{take place on}} Runway 8-26 because the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Runway</b> 3-21 makes direct flights over residential and commercial areas unavoidable. Night and early morning flights are directed to arrive from and depart towards the east, where largely vacant land acts as a noise buffer. Day flights maintain a west to east pattern. Although this results in arriving aircraft coming closer to the downtown area, pilots attempt to remain over Hilo Bay {{for as long as}} possible before aligning their aircraft with the runway, crossing over near the Hilo Iron Works building. Also, aircraft landings are quieter than take-offs. All aircraft, in fact, are directed to avoid overflying residential and commercial areas to the extent possible. In addition, the U.S. military transferred some of its training activities to Kona International Airport.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{provide a}} methodology, and {{examples}} of application, for analyzing wind data for the correct <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> airport <b>runways.</b> Design/methodology/approach: More than 90000 observed wind data have been analyzed for {{each one of the}} three airports used as case studies. Both observed and estimated gusts have been considered. Findings: If only observed data are considered, each single <b>runway</b> <b>of</b> the three airports used as case studies is correctly oriented. When estimated gusts are considered, the FAA requirements are not satisfied by a single runway in some airports (which anyway satisfy such requirements by using more runways). Practical implications: The correct <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> <b>runways</b> minimize the crosswind components, then increase the safety of the airports. Originality/value: The paper provides a methodology to evaluate the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> existing <b>runways</b> and to design new runways. Such methodology is based on the analysis wind data, considering both observed values and estimated gusts. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Precise {{knowledge}} of terrain is vital in aviation, especially for low-flying routes and maneuvers (see terrain collision avoidance) and airport altitudes.

50|$|Because of the {{restricted}} airspace {{immediately to the}} south <b>of</b> the <b>runway,</b> and the noise-sensitive residential area just west <b>of</b> the <b>runway,</b> Los Alamos Airport employs a non-standard traffic pattern. All takeoffs, regardless of wind conditions, are to the east on runway 9. All landings, regardless of wind, are to the west on runway 27. Unlike many airports, the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>runway</b> at Los Alamos was chosen due to geographic necessity rather than preferential wind alignment. Pilots will frequently encounter a gusty crosswind at this airfield, particularly in spring. This fact, combined with the rugged terrain off the east end <b>of</b> the <b>runway,</b> has given LAM {{a reputation for being}} a challenging airport at which to land.|$|R
40|$|TechCon 2017 (CRUSER) Presented by ENS Tyler McCarthy, USN: NPS Systems EngineeringIncludes slidesThis {{presentation}} outlines {{an approach}} to develop a robust, real-time runway detection and tracking system for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using computer vision and standard guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) equipment. Feature extraction techniques, specifically the Hough transform, are used to identify the position and <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>runway</b> from cameras on board an aircraft. Information relating {{the position of the}} aircraft and the runway is then integrated into a control system for the final approach and landing stages of UAV flight. While conceptual in nature, this presentation utilizes modeling and simulation to demonstrate the feasibility of a computer vision approach to an autoland capability for a UAV. This approach could also have potential applications in other autonomous fields by illustrating the practicality of vision-based feedback for guidance and control of unmanned autonomous systems.
