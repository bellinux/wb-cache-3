5|$|Haywood <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> the {{government}} frequently took {{the side of}} business to defeat the tactics and the aspirations of the miners. During an 1899 organizing drive in Coeur d'Alene, with pay cuts as a motivating issue, the company hired spies and then fired organizers and pro-union miners. Some frustrated miners responded with violence and when two men were killed, martial law was declared. As they had done in a strike in Coeur d'Alene seven years earlier, soldiers acted as strike breakers. They rounded up hundreds of union members without formal charges {{and put them in}} a filthy, vermin-infested warehouse without sanitation services for a year. They were so crowded that the soldiers locked the overflow of prisoners in boxcars. One local union leader was imprisoned for 17 years.|$|E
5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive warnings about Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a number of {{implants}} made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.|$|E

25|$|E. carinatus {{is mostly}} crepuscular and nocturnal, {{although}} there have been reports of activity during daylight hours. During the daytime they hide in all kinds of places, such as deep mammal burrows, rock fissures and fallen rotted logs. In sandy environments, they may bury themselves leaving only the head exposed. Often, they are most active after rains or on humid nights. This species is often found climbing in bushes and shrubs, sometimes as much as 2 m above the ground. When it rains, up to 80% of the adult population will climb into bushes and trees. Once, it was <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> some 20 individuals had massed on top of a single cactus or small shrub.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, Carnegie was 66 {{years of}} age and {{considering}} retirement. He reformed his enterprises into conventional joint stock corporations as preparation to this end. John Pierpont Morgan was a banker and perhaps America's most important financial deal maker. He had <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> efficiently Carnegie produced profit. He envisioned an integrated steel industry that would cut costs, lower prices to consumers, produce in greater quantities and raise wages to workers. To this end, he needed to buy out Carnegie and several other major producers and integrate them into one company, thereby eliminating duplication and waste. He concluded negotiations on March 2, 1901, and formed the United States Steel Corporation. It was the first corporation in the world with a market capitalization over $1 billion.|$|E

As {{a young boy}} in Angeles, Pampanga, he {{followed}} a routine wherein he would watch his childhood idol Robert Jaworski on television at night and by noon the next day, he would mimic what he saw on television on the cement courts of Bayanihan Park. He <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> Jaworski {{became one of the}} PBA's best rebounders of all-time despite being a guard and tried his best to duplicate the legendary grit with his pals. Aside from basketball, Abueva also played volleyball during his childhood years. Calvin also has a younger brother, Richard Ramsey, who after being raised by foster parents after being left for adoption at the age of three months, finally met Calvin, mother Evelyn and his three other siblings in 2010. Like his brother, Richard also plays basketball, playing for De Ocampo Memorial College in Sta. Mesa, Manila and currently serves as an assistant coach for the De Ocampo Cobras.|$|E

500|$|... "Beat of My Drum" [...] is a dance-pop {{track with}} themes of indie pop, {{and has been}} {{compared}} to the work of M.I.A. and Daphne & Celeste. The verses, choruses and bridge are all distinctively different; the chorus consists of chants, the verses are spoken-sung (half spoken. half sung), and the bridge are dancehall themed. The bridge gathered comparisons to the music of Major Lazer, which it samples. The vocals are performed against sirens. Music journalist James Montgomery <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> the song [...] "mashes together every notable pop moment from recent history", pointing out the dancehall rhythms, drum breaks and [...] "electro-vocal tics".|$|E
500|$|Brandon Soderberg from Spin <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> {{the song}} was a {{narrative}} against her [...] "haters", a theme predominant in rap music. This is enunciated with the lyrics addressing Ritchie and tabloids, {{along with some of}} Minaj's verses being directed against pop singer Lady Gaga, with whom Madonna had been compared to previously. Soderberg deduced that Madonna might have noticed the shifting themes in rap music, where it had become acceptable to boast about one's wealth, hence the lyrics had more of a Sex and the City vibe with its depiction of Madonna's [...] "fairly awesome life".|$|E

Scholar Jamaluddin Bin Aziz has <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> [...] "the shadow of Philip Marlowe lingers on" [...] in such other [...] "future noir" [...] films as 12 Monkeys (1995), Dark City (1998) and Minority Report (2002).

He portrayed three roles, including King Rudolf IV and King Rudolf V—rulers of {{the fictional}} small nation of Ruritania—and Syd Frewin, Rudolf V's half-brother. Upon its release in May 1979, the film was well received; Janet Maslin of The New York Times <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> Sellers divided [...] "his energies between a serious character and a funny one, {{but that it was}} his serious performance which was more impressive". However, Philip French, for The Observer, was unimpressed by the film, describing it as [...] "a mess of porridge" [...] and stating that [...] "Sellers reveals that he cannot draw the line between the sincere and the sentimental".|$|E
500|$|In 1930, McClintock was {{the first}} person to {{describe}} the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The following year, McClintock and Creighton proved the link between chromosomal crossover during meiosis and the recombination of genetic traits. They <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> the recombination of chromosomes seen under a microscope correlated with new traits. Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that genetic recombination could occur during meiosis, although it had not been shown genetically. McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9. [...] This information provided necessary data for the crossing-over study she published with Creighton; they also showed that crossing-over occurs in sister chromatids as well as homologous chromosomes. In 1938, she produced a cytogenetic analysis of the centromere, describing the organization and function of the centromere, as well as the fact that it can divide.|$|E

He continued, [...] "Aguilera dramatically simplifying her usual histrionic vocal delivery, which leads to some surprising results. The lyrics are throwaway, but clever like a dunce who has a happy knack of making a lucky guess". The Village Voice editor Drew Hinshaw wrote that her and M.I.A.'s lyrical chemistry acts as a [...] "the real amorous game", calling it [...] "a fun duet, suggesting a two-girls-at-play theme that doubles in size". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian deemed it the best song from the album, praising M.I.A.'s [...] "incredible pop melody" [...] and [...] "off-kilter backing of squelching electronics and sub-bass" [...] and <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> her instrumentation [...] "has also uniquely managed to calm down Aguilera's usual attention-all-shipping vocal approach into something weirder: dead-eyed, thickly smeared with dubby echo".

500|$|Although Huntington's {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a disorder {{since at least the}} Middle Ages, the cause has been unknown until fairly recently. Huntington's was given different names throughout this history as understanding of the disease changed. Originally called simply 'chorea' for the jerky dancelike movements associated with the disease, HD has also been called [...] "hereditary chorea" [...] and [...] "chronic progressive chorea". The first definite mention of HD was in a letter by Charles Oscar Waters, published in the first edition of Robley Dunglison's Practice of Medicine in 1842. Waters described [...] "a form of chorea, vulgarly called magrums", including accurate descriptions of the chorea, its progression, and the strong heredity of the disease. In 1846 Charles Gorman <b>observed</b> <b>how</b> higher prevalence seemed to occur in localized regions. Independently of Gorman and Waters, both students of Dunglison at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, Johan Christian Lund also produced an early description in 1860. He specifically noted that in Setesdalen, a secluded mountain valley in Norway, there was a high prevalence of dementia associated with a pattern of jerking movement disorders that ran in families.|$|E
