This study considers the effects of the Holocaust on the well-being rather than trauma of offspring <b>of</b> Holocaust <b>survivors</b> in Australia. 285 Jewish participants completed a questionnaire to measure components of subjective well-being. Analyses revealed that offspring <b>of</b> Holocaust <b>survivors</b> reported lower general positive mood than non-OHS. This result was limited to offspring <b>of</b> Holocaust <b>survivors</b> with two survivor parents.

5|$|Infection with {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before disseminating. In the skin it results in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent <b>of</b> <b>survivors.</b> Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases.|$|E
5|$|Most {{long-term}} survivors {{alive today}} had low or intermediate risk disease and milder courses of treatment compared to high-risk disease. The majority <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> have long-term {{effects from the}} treatment. Survivors of intermediate and high-risk treatment often experience hearing loss. Growth reduction, thyroid function disorders, learning difficulties, and greater risk of secondary cancers affect survivors of high-risk disease. An estimated two of three survivors of childhood cancer will ultimately develop at least one chronic and sometimes life-threatening health problem within 20 to 30 years after the cancer diagnosis.|$|E
