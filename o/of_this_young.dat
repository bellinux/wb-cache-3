5|$|Austen met, danced with, {{and perhaps}} {{fell in love}} with Thomas Lefroy during the Christmas {{holidays}} in 1795. However, Lefroy departed to begin his law studies in January 1796 and he and Jane never saw each other again. Samuel Blackall, a Fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and a friend of Mrs. Anne Lefroy, was seriously interested in marrying Austen in 1797. Austen family tradition holds that Jane and an unnamed young clergyman fell in love while the Austen family visited the seaside at Sidmouth in the summer of 1801. Cassandra is said to have approved <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> man, but he died unexpectedly several months later, before he and Jane could be together again. Austen received her only proposal of marriage from Harris Bigg-Wither, brother of her friends Alethea, Elizabeth and Catherine Bigg, while visiting them at their home in December 1802. Austen at first accepted the proposal, then realized she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance the next day. Austen biographer Park Honan suggests that Jane may have received a proposal of marriage from Edward Bridges, a brother of Edward Austen's wife Elizabeth, in 1805, but biographer Claire Tomalin dismisses this claim.|$|E
25|$|Today, Trần Quốc Toản {{is still}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} finest examples of Vietnamese patriotism, especially for the young generation. Stories about his spirit and action are taught in schoolbooks of several grades while many streets, schools and gymnasiums in Vietnam are named in honour <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> hero. Trần Quốc Toản is also the main character of several historical novels such as Lá cờ thêu sáu chữ vàng (The flag embroidered with six golden characters) by Nguyễn Huy Tưởng.|$|E
25|$|The {{risks are}} higher for young {{adolescents}} because their brains are not neurally mature. Several brain {{regions in the}} frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex and in the hypothalamus that are deemed important for self-control, delayed gratification, risk analysis, and appreciation are not fully mature. The brain is not fully mature until age 25. Partially, because <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>young</b> adolescents are generally less equipped than adults to make sound decisions and anticipate consequences of sexual behavior, although brain imaging and behavioral correlation studies in teens {{have been criticized for}} not being causative thus possibly reaffirming cultural biases.|$|E

Although {{there were only a few}} historical records about Trần Quốc Toản, he is still widely known as an example of patriotism in Vietnam while he participated and ultimately sacrificed himself for the country at a very young age. Today, story about Trần Quốc Toản is taught in Vietnamese schoolbooks and many places in Vietnam are named in honour <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> hero.|$|E
25|$|Though {{his rule}} over the Nagao and Uesugi clan were now unquestioned, much of Echigo was still {{independent}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> warlord's grasp. Kenshin immediately {{set out to}} cement his power in the region, but these efforts were still in their infant stages when far more pressing concerns appeared. Ogasawara Nagatoki and Murakami Yoshikiyo, two Shinano lords, both appeared before Kenshin requesting his help in halting the advances of the powerful warlord Takeda Shingen. Around the time Kenshin became the new lord of Echigo, Shingen had won major victories in Shinano Province. With the Takeda's conquests taking them remarkably close to the borders of Echigo, Kenshin agreed to take the field on two fronts, however the conflicts between the three lords showed also various alliances and treaties.|$|E
25|$|According to the New York Times, {{the leading}} element has {{consisted}} of young urban professionals, the well-educated and successful working or middle class {{people such as}} workers in social media. These groups had benefited from substantial growth in the Russian economy until the 2008 economic crisis but have been alienated by increasing political corruption as well as recent stagnation in their income. The number of such individuals is large and growing in urban centers and is thought to represent a challenge to continuation of authoritarian rule. According to Putin the legitimate grievances <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> and active element of Russian society are being exploited by opportunistic elements which seek to destabilize Russia. Nationalist elements {{play a significant role}} in the coalition which is organizing and participating in the protests.|$|E

500|$|Vanbrugh {{is assumed}} to have {{attempted}} to tailor his play to the talents of particular actors and to what audiences would expect from them, as was normal practice (Holland), but this was exceptionally difficult to accomplish in 1695–96. Love's Last Shift had been cast from {{the remnants of the}} Patent Company—"learners" [...] and [...] "boys and girls"—after the walkout of the stars. Following the surprising success <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> cast, Vanbrugh and Rich had even greater difficulty in retaining the actors needed for The Relapse. However, in spite of the continuous emergency in which the Relapse production was mounted, most of Vanbrugh's original intentions were eventually carried out.|$|E
500|$|After {{arriving}} in The Hague, Nannerl developed a severe cold and {{was unable to}} participate in the initial concerts before the Princess during their first week, nor in a performance before the Prince a few days later. Leopold was sufficiently confident of Nannerl's recovery to announce the appearances of both prodigies at a concert to be given at the hall of the Oude Doelen on 30 September. The notice for this concert gives Wolfgang's age as eight (he was nine), but correctly gives Nannerl's as fourteen. The advertisement concentrates on Wolfgang: [...] "All the overtures will be from the hands <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> composer [...] Music-lovers may confront him with any music at will, and he will play it at sight". It is not certain whether this concert in fact took placeSadie believes it may have been postponed. If it did happen, Wolfgang appeared alone, for by this time Nannerl's cold had turned into typhoid fever. Her condition grew steadily worse, and on 21 October she was given the last sacrament. A visit from the royal physician turned the tide; he changed the treatment, {{and by the end of}} the month she was recovering. Then Wolfgang fell ill, and it was mid-December before he was on his feet again.|$|E

2500|$|Young {{was awarded}} the NFL Rookie of the Year honors for 2006. In spite <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>Young</b> {{considered}} ending his career.

2500|$|Sonnet 41 {{is one of}} the sonnets {{within the}} Fair Youth section of sonnets (1-126) thought to be {{addressed}} to an unnamed young man. [...] Taking note of the romantic and loving language used in the sonnets, commenters have suggested a relationship between them extending past platonic love and into a sexual relationship. [...] Many scholars have tried to identify the young man, with the most common suggestion being Shakespeare's one time patron, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. [...] Others have also suggested Shakespeare's later patron, William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke.

2500|$|Deprivation {{manifests itself}} {{in the form of}} high youth unemployment, an above average {{proportion}} of workers in manual occupations, low mean income and a low percentage of people with higher degrees. High educational attainment up to GCSE and A-level demonstrates the depth of local talent, however, poor job opportunities and the absence, until recently, of a university in Cornwall has meant that much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> talent leaves the area and never returns. [...] As such Penwith was listed as an Objective 1 area by the European Social Fund, however, this status expired in 2006 with the programme closing on 31 December 2008. [...] Traditionally, like {{much of the rest of}} Cornwall, Penwith's economy relied heavily on mining and fishing and was badly affected by the decline of these industries. Although the district has tried to stimulate employment through tourism, many of these jobs are by definition seasonal or part-time and do not replace the skilled jobs lost by the closure of the mines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{death of}} Kurdi and reports {{that his family}} {{had been trying to}} {{ultimately}} reach Canada had an immediate impact on domestic Canadian politics.

Canadian Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander announced he would be temporarily suspending his campaigning in the 2015 Canadian federal election to return to Ottawa to resume his ministerial duties and investigate the case of Alan Kurdi, whose uncle's application for refugee status had been rejected by his ministry.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, Botvinnik founded his own school {{within the}} Soviet {{coaching}} system, and its graduates include world champions Anatoly Karpov, Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik, and other top-class {{players such as}} Alexei Shirov, Vladimir Akopian and Jaan Ehlvest. Botvinnik was not an infallible spotter of chess talent: although {{he said of the}} 11-year-old Kasparov, [...] "The future of chess lies in the hands <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>young</b> man", he said on first seeing Karpov, [...] "The boy doesn't have a clue about chess, and there's no future at all for him in this profession." [...] But Karpov recounts fondly his youthful memories of the Botvinnik school and credits Botvinnik's training, especially the homework he assigned, with a marked improvement in his own play. Kasparov presents Botvinnik almost as a kind of father figure, going some way towards balancing the common public perception of Botvinnik as dour and aloof; and Kasparov inherited Botvinnik's emphasis on preparation, research and innovation. Botvinnik was still playing a major teaching role in his late 70s, when Kramnik entered the school, and made a favorable impression on his pupil.|$|E
