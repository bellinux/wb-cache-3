40|$|The present {{investigation}} provides a {{confirmation of the}} dependence of droplet sedimentation on particle concentration. It is shown {{that it is possible}} to determine the maximum particle concentration which can remain stable on a given liquid from droplet sedimentation experiments. Droplet sedimentation can be reduced but not totally eliminated by the addition of appropriate amounts of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to reduce the van der Waals forces to zero. It was found that, at 12 % DMSO, a maximum particle concentration of 6. 3 x 10 to the 8 th cells/ml of glutaraldehyde-fixed human erythrocytes suspended in physiological saline can remain stable on a D 2 <b>O</b> <b>cushion...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with a fractionation procedure involving the separation of particles, a dilute suspension of these particles in a liquid is carefully layered on a dense liquid. Under ideal conditions, the suspension forms a zone of finite thickness with a 'sharp' interface between the suspension layer and the supporting liquid. Under an applied field, e. g., gravitational or electrical, the particles in the suspension layer migrate to form different layers according to their size and/or density or according to their electrophoretic mobilities. However, {{in many cases the}} ideal conditions necessary for the fractionation process are not obtained. Many studies have been conducted to explore the reasons for suspension layer 'instability'. The present investigation represents an extension of a study conducted by Omenyi et al. (1981). An electrostatic repulsion-van der Waals mechanism was used to study the stability of fixed erythrocyte suspensions layered on a D 2 <b>O</b> <b>cushion...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{attempted}} {{to show that}} the use of heavy water (D 2 <b>O)</b> as starting <b>cushion</b> for the cells combines the advantages of the required density difference, with no lasting biochemical or physiochemical influence on the cells. Phosphate buffers of low ionic strength were prepared in distilled water or heavy water. A vertical starch gel electrophoresis was used to support a cylindrical polystyrene electrophoresis tube used for lymphocyte separations, 25 cm in length and 0. 75 cm I. D., prepared from a 10 ml disposable pipet. Erythrocyte separations were carried out in a jacketed rectangular plexiglas chamber. It is pointed out that the described preparative D 2 O gradient electrophoresis method cannot be readily used for the measurement of electrophoretic mobilities for analytical purposes. However, for the preparative separation of cells with only slightly different electrokinetic properties the method appears promising, simple, and entirely inocuous to the cells...|$|R
