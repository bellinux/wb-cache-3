5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E

30|$|We {{determined}} {{the relationship between}} number <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> and area burned on a monthly basis, using linear regression, as data conformed to a normal distribution. We used Statistica, version 13 (Dell Inc., Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA) for all statistical analyses. To explore fire-size distribution, we categorized fires into size classes (i.e., small < 10 ha, medium ≥ 10 ha, large ≥ 100 ha, and very large ≥ 1000 ha). We explored the seasonality <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> by assessing the frequency distribution <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> (in terms <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> and area burned) across months. We furthermore assessed the seasonality of fire-prone weather conditions by calculating daily fire danger index (FDI) scores according to the South African Lowveld Model (Strydom and Savage 2013) for the study period. We used daily weather records for the town of Port Alfred (situated 30 km northeast of Mkambati) of maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, rainfall, and average wind speed. The FDI scores were categorized as safe (FDI 0 to 20), moderate (21 to 45), dangerous (46 to 60), very dangerous (61 to 75), or extremely dangerous (75 to 100) (Meikle and Heine 1987). We explored {{the relationship between the}} seasonality <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> and the seasonality of fire-prone weather conditions by relating the monthly incidence <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> to average monthly FDI using two different regressions: number <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> vs. FDI and area burned vs. FDI. We also used regression to explore the relationship between fire size and FDI on the day <b>of</b> the <b>fire.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract] The number <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> {{in forest}} areas of Galicia (north-west of Spain) {{during the summer}} period is quite high. Local {{authorities}} are interested in analyzing the factors that explain this phenomenon. Poisson regression models are good tools for describing and predicting the number <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> per forest areas. This work employs area-level Poisson mixed models for treating real data about fires in forest areas. A parametric bootstrap method is applied for estimating the mean squared errors <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> predictors. The developed methodology and software are applied to a real data set <b>of</b> <b>fires</b> in forest areas of Galicia.

40|$|AbstractTo {{explore the}} {{influence}} of government on the power-law distribution <b>of</b> city <b>fires,</b> the dataset consisting <b>of</b> 24, 645 <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> Jiangxi from 2006 to 2010 was analyzed. The frequency-loss distribution <b>of</b> city <b>fires</b> in Jiangxi was found to satisfy a power-law relation in each year. The difference between the distribution of small and large fires suggests that there may be some factors influencing the distribution patterns <b>of</b> city <b>fires</b> with different losses. The stability <b>of</b> large <b>fire</b> distribution and the variance <b>of</b> small <b>fire</b> distribution indicate the existence of influencing factors. The influence of government was examined by comparing the distribution <b>of</b> small <b>fires</b> in periods with and without serious <b>fires</b> <b>of</b> Fuzhou, Jiujiang, and Yichun. The smaller slope of fitting lines for small fires in periods without serious fires demonstrates that the government is one of the factors influencing the distribution <b>of</b> small <b>fires.</b> However, it can also be concluded that there may also be other factors affecting the distribution because the frequency-loss distribution <b>of</b> small <b>fires</b> still differs from that <b>of</b> large <b>fires</b> in period without serious fires...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the wildland fire management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E
