40|$|We study {{theoretically}} and empirically whether {{natural resource}} windfalls affect political regimes. We show that windfalls {{have no effect}} <b>on</b> <b>democracies,</b> while they have heterogeneous political consequences in autocracies. In deeply entrenched autocracies, the effect of windfalls is virtually nil, while in moderately entrenched autocracies, windfalls significantly exacerbate the autocratic nature of the political system. To frame the empirical work, we present a simple model in which political incumbents choose the degree of political contestability and potential challengers decide whether to try to unseat the incumbents. The model uncovers a mechanism for the asymmetric impact of resource windfalls <b>on</b> <b>democracies</b> and autocracies, {{as well as the}} the differential impact within autocracies...|$|R

25|$|Trudeau's {{legacy in}} Quebec is mixed.

However, his imposition of the War Measures Act—which received majority support at the time—is remembered by some in Quebec and elsewhere as an attack <b>on</b> <b>democracy.</b> Trudeau is also credited by many for {{the defeat of the}} 1980 Quebec referendum.|$|E

25|$|His leading views <b>on</b> <b>democracy</b> included: “First, Dewey {{believed}} {{that democracy is}} an ethical ideal rather than merely a political arrangement. Second, he considered participation, not representation, the essence of democracy. Third, he insisted on the harmony between democracy and the scientific method: ever-expanding and self-critical communities of inquiry, operating on pragmatic principles and constantly revising their beliefs in light of new evidence, provided Dewey with a model for democratic decision making...Finally, Dewey called for extending democracy, conceived as an ethical project, from politics to industry and society”. This helped to shape his understanding of human action and the unity of human experience.|$|E

25|$|A second {{dilemma for}} U.S. {{democracy}} promotion in the MENA region is aid prioritization. Critics say {{the priorities of}} Western aid must {{be viewed as a}} whole, and therefore question the vastly greater amounts spent on military aid than democracy aid. Massive foreign aid to countries like Jordan and Egypt, for example, gives regimes the ability to both co-opt and repress their populations by supporting state job and economic infrastructures and funding state security apparatuses. This results in often contradictory U.S. positions <b>on</b> <b>democracy,</b> with officials praising Arab security structures that are used to crack down on activists and civil society while simultaneously funding technical assistance aimed at promoting democracy in Egypt and Palestine for example.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, Ambedkar {{moved to}} the United States {{at the age of}} 22.
