So we must camouflage <b>our</b> <b>plan</b> by sending the special forces out to the country. That will deceive them." [...] The loyalists were unaware that Đính's real intention was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung's men in the countryside where they could not defend the president. Tung and the palace agreed to send all four Saigon-based special forces companies out of the capital on 29 October.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle comfort Bree at the {{hospital}} was the last scene of the season involving the four principal characters. Teri Hatcher commented: [...] "It was a heavy scene. There was a very genuine and deeply felt recognition that all four of us {{together as a team}} appreciated the ride we'd had this season and were grateful that we'd survived it together." [...] An extension of the scene, in which the women discuss Susan's discovery of Martha Huber's journal, was cut for time, though it was aired on Good Morning America on May 23, 2005, one day after the episode's broadcast, and was included on the first season DVD set. The death of one housewife's husband was confirmed prior to the episode's broadcast. Steven Culp was not surprised when his character was killed off, stating [...] "I had a sneaking suspicion someone was going to go." [...] Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character: [...] "As we neared the end of season 1, <b>our</b> <b>plan</b> was that each woman would enter a new life chapter. Gabrielle would learn to function without Carlos, Susan and Mike would build their relationship, Lynette would go back to work, and Bree would become a single woman. We either had to have Rex divorce her or die." [...] Cherry named the {{scene in which}} Bree finishes her spring cleaning before mourning the death of her husband as one of his top three favorites of the season, stating: [...] "It was one of the favorite things I wrote because it was so true to her character. She had to finish the cleaning she started, and she comes in and everything’s perfect." [...] A scene between Gabrielle and John was also cut for time.|$|E
500|$|... "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] {{concluded}} Anna Torv's [...] "Bellivia" [...] arc. Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. And we think that if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of <b>our</b> <b>plan</b> has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{the season}} finale, Tancharoen stated, [...] "This season, we've {{explored}} {{a lot of}} different themes: There's the notion of purpose. We also introduced an Inhuman who has a strong sense of faith. We talk a lot about destiny and all these things intertwine." [...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what <b>our</b> <b>plan</b> was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like that we were able to open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
