Most sharks have eight fins. Sharks can only drift away from objects {{directly in front}} <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> their fins do {{not allow them to}} move in the tail-first direction.|$|E

Just as he is out of money and risks being evicted, Devushkin has a stroke of luck: his boss takes pity on him and gives him 100 rubles to buy new clothes. Devushkin pays off his debts and sends some to Dobroselova. She sends him 25 rubles back because she does not need it. The future looks bright for both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> he can now start to save money and it may be possible for them to move in together.|$|E
5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> the pain and other sensations {{in the head and}} neck areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin went to Australia {{to learn}} more about Aboriginal culture, {{specifically}} the songlines or dreaming tracks. Each songline is a personal story and functions as a creation tale and a map, and each Aboriginal Australian has their own songline. Chatwin thought the songlines could be a metaphor he could use to support his ideas about humans' need to wander, which he believed was genetic. However, he struggled to fully understand and describe the songlines and their place in Aboriginal culture. This was due to Chatwin's approach to learning about the songlines. He spent several weeks in 1983 and 1984 in Australia, during which he primarily relied on non-Aboriginal people for information. Chatwin was limited by his inability to speak the Aboriginal languages. He interviewed people involved in the Land Rights movement, and he alienated many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> he was oblivious to the politics and also because he was an admirer of Strehlow's work.|$|E
5|$|Including the two disqualifications, ten drivers {{failed to}} finish the race, six <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> of {{accidents}} including Kubica. Four of them gearbox failures. Several cars were damaged during the race: Wurz's rear wing was damaged in the incident that took out Speed, while Davidson hit a groundhog on the racetrack. This meant that the safety car had to be deployed on four occasions. At the final restart on lap sixty, all of the remaining twelve cars {{were on the same}} lap creating some close racing and a lot of overtaking. Hamilton sustained his consistent pace throughout all of the incidents and pulled clear of Heidfeld in the closing stages, taking his first race win relatively comfortably. Barrichello dropped ten places on his final pit stop. Hamilton's championship lead was strengthened when Sato overtook the reigning world champion to move into sixth place around the outside of the final chicane, having switched to the harder tyres on his final stop.|$|E
5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team. Some black players believed white teammates were getting to play ahead <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> of their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders and told them the racism had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E
50|$|Some United States Senators, both real-life and fictional Democrats and Republicans, were {{suspected}} {{as a part}} of plot to {{kill the}} president, many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> just <b>because</b> they were present in D.C. at a certain time.|$|R

[...] The men in armour were then given up, {{but they certainly}} were beginning to be effective. At 6 P.M., when the men were there, it had become impossible to pass the shop without going {{into the middle of}} the street, and on one or two occasions the policemen had spoken to Mr. Brown.

25|$|Yang Yi had {{disagreements}} with Wei Yan, a senior Shu general, and frequently quarrelled with him. Zhuge Liang was {{upset by the}} lack of harmony between his two subordinates, but was unwilling to side with either <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> he appreciated the talents of both men. In 234, Yang Yi followed Zhuge Liang on another campaign against Wei which led to the stalemate at the Battle of Wuzhang Plains. Zhuge Liang died of illness during the standoff, after which Yang Yi and the others ordered a retreat back to Shu. Around this time, relations between Yang Yi and Wei Yan deteriorated the point of conflict – they accused each other of treason and nearly started a civil war in Shu. The conflict concluded with the downfall and death of Wei Yan.|$|E

25|$|In one of {{her last}} public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee, which issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's {{scientific}} claims. Following the report's release, Carson also testified before a U.S. Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, {{she was unable to}} accept most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> her health was steadily declining, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she could, and appeared on The Today Show and gave speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal from the National Audubon Society, the Cullum Geographical Medal from the American Geographical Society, and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year of the IBMXF World Championship in 1982 after having your {{standard}} racers to decide the World Champions in the various Classes, both Amateur and Professional, an overall World Champion was decided by racing all of the class winners including the Pro Champion and Amateur champion in a single race called the Trophy Dash. In 1982, Greg Hill, the professional World Champion refused to race the Amateur World Champion the American Nelson Chanady, claiming that there was no point to it. Nelson Chanady raced and won the Trophy Dash without Hill's participation, capturing the Overall title. However, since Mr. Hill did not race, the World Championship title lost a considerable amount of luster, since American professional racers were regarded collectively as the best in the world with Mr. Hill being among the best <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> of this lost of stature due to Mr. Hill not racing that final race in 1982, the Trophy Dash to determine the World Champion was abolished and in 1983 when the American professional Clint Miller won the World Professional Championship he was also considered the overall World Champion.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{most of her}} novels, {{which had}} a print run of only several hundred copies, the Livess print run of about 4,000 for each volume became, {{in the words of}} one scholar, [...] "one of her most {{influential}} political interventions". However, Shelley's biographies have not been fully appreciated until recently. The Lives were not reprinted until 2002, and little study has been made <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> of a critical tradition that [...] "dismiss the Lives as hack work churned out rapidly in order to pay off debts".|$|E
500|$|Neutrinos {{are also}} {{released}} by the fusion reactions in the core, but, unlike photons, they rarely interact with matter, so almost all are able to escape the Sun immediately. For many years measurements {{of the number of}} neutrinos produced in the Sun were lower than theories predicted by a factor of 3. This discrepancy was resolved in 2001 through the discovery of the effects of neutrino oscillation: the Sun emits the number of neutrinos predicted by the theory, but neutrino detectors were missing [...] <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> the neutrinos had changed flavor {{by the time they were}} detected.|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} chapter, [...] "Bog People in Denmark", Glob notes {{that there have}} been over 150 bog bodies found in Denmark, and {{proceeds}} to provide a number of examples including Haraldskær Woman and the Borremose bodies, in doing so highlighting the similarities that exist between them. Noting that many of these were discovered in the 19th and early 20th centuries, he explains that little can be known for most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> methods of archaeological investigation and conservation were unavailable at the time. Chapter four, [...] "Bog People in Other Countries", explores similar bog bodies which have been discovered in neighbouring Germany and the Netherlands, such as Windeby I, making reference to the cataloging project undertaken by the German archaeologist Alfred Dieck.|$|E

500|$|On 24 May, the day Howe sailed for England, General Clinton {{took over}} as {{commander-in-chief}} of British armies in America, and made preparations for an overland march to New York. Howe arrived back in England on 1 July, {{where he and his}} brother faced censure for their actions in North America. [...] It is likely that the resignation of both William and his brother Richard was due to their desire to hurry home to vindicate their conduct during the campaign. In 1779 Howe and his brother demanded a parliamentary inquiry into their actions. [...] The inquiry that followed was unable to confirm any charges of impropriety or mismanagement levelled against either <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Because</b> of the inconclusive nature of the inquiry, attacks continued to be made against Howe in pamphlets and the press, and in 1780 he published a response to accusations levelled by Loyalist Joseph Galloway, who issued a reply that harshly criticized the general's conduct and accused him of deliberately undermining the war effort {{for the benefit of the}} anti-war Whig faction in Parliament.|$|E
500|$|For casting Vanaja and Lacchi, he {{said that}} they met {{approximately}} 2500 children, interviewed about 260, and finally selected two from a shortlist of five to play the roles of Vanaja and Lacchi. Parents of these children were distrustful <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>because</b> their wards would have to frequently commute to Domalpalli's house for acting lessons for at least a year. Domalpalli felt that [...] "to convince people to devote so much of their children's time and energy was hard enough, but to find the right combination of intelligence, commitment and talent as well was probably the steepest cliff they had to climb." [...] While visiting schools for identifying the child cast, Mamatha Bhukya at first was not selected because her hair was short. But after she sang a song on Mahatma Gandhi, she was selected for the role. Srinivas Devarakonda, a disciple of well-known Kuchipudi guru Vempati Chinna Satyam, taught Mamatha the classical dance form for a year in the basement of Domalpalli's house. Due to this sustained effort, she altered her ambitions from becoming a doctor to an actress and a Kuchipudi dancer. Bhavani Renukunta was chosen for Lacchi's role after an interview at the Hyderabad office of Varija Films, the company that handled the publicity.|$|E
