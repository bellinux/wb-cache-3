50|$|An OWS {{needs to}} be fitted with an oil content meter (OCM) that samples the OWS <b>overboard</b> <b>discharge</b> water for oil content. If the oil content is less than 15 ppm, the OCM allows the water to be {{discharged}} overboard. If the oil content is higher than 15 ppm, the OCM will activate an alarm and move a three-way valve that, within {{a short period of}} time, will recirculate the <b>overboard</b> <b>discharge</b> water to a tank on the OWS suction side.|$|E
5000|$|A {{sample point}} on the {{discharge}} line allows for the analyzer to determine the oil content of the ballast and slop water in PPM. [...] The analyzer is self-maintaining by periodical cleansings with fresh water, and therefore requires a minimum of active maintenance from the crew. [...] The results of the analyzer are sent to a computer, which determines whether the oil content values are to result in <b>overboard</b> <b>discharge</b> or not. [...] The valves that direct the ballast water either over board or to slop tank are controlled by the integrated computer, and a GPS signal further automates the process by including special areas and completes the required input for the Oil Record Book.|$|E

50|$|Sea {{water cooling}} {{is often the}} last stage of cooling on board a ship. These coolers are oftentimes the largest on board a vessel {{in order to ensure}} maximum heat {{transfer}} to the sea water. The sea water is then <b>discharged</b> <b>overboard</b> after passing through the coolers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the Marine Sanitation Device is to treat the {{incoming}} blackwater and graywater that accumulates on board a floating vessel. Graywater is water that drains directly from a shower, sink, or machinery located in the scullery. Normally, graywater is <b>discharged</b> directly <b>overboard</b> since it is not technically considered sewage and not damaging to the environment. However, in most ports around the world, discharge of fluids is strictly prohibited. To compensate for this situation, graywater piping is rerouted to the MSD. Blackwater is another word for sewage or human body wastes and wastes from toilets. According to the international maritime organization or the IMO, untreated sewage cannot be <b>discharged</b> <b>overboard</b> unless it is 12 nautical {{miles from the nearest}} land. Due to regulations issued by the IMO and the United States Maritime Administration or MARAD, every ship must have an approved marine sanitation device aboard their ship. Blackwater is therefore treated through a process that utilizes chlorination and/or biological treatment before being <b>discharged</b> <b>overboard.</b>|$|R
50|$|An OCM takes {{a trickle}} sample from the OWS <b>overboard</b> <b>discharge</b> line and shines a {{light through the}} sample to an optical sensor. Since small oil {{droplets}} will diffract and diffuse light, a change in signal at the sensor will indicate the presence of oil. At a certain signal setting that is roughly equivalent to 15 ppm, the sensor will conclude that {{there is too much}} oil going though the discharge line. This calibration generally takes place in a lab, but can be tested by use of a three-sample liquid aboard the vessel. If the OCM ends up sampling a certain amount of heavy oil, the OCM will be fouled and it will need to be flushed or cleaned.The cleaning can be done by running fresh water through the OCM via a permanent connection or can be performed by opening the OCM sample area and scrubbing the sample area with a bottle brush.|$|E
40|$|Chevron (formerly Unocal) Thailand {{has been}} {{producing}} {{natural gas and}} crude oil in the Gulf of Thailand since 1981. Co-produced water is contaminated with hydrocarbons, mercury and arsenic. Where feasible, Unocal Thailand pursued a philosophy which entails re-injecting produced water back into the rock formations from whence it originated. Currently, over 50, 000 bwpd are injected in two fields in legacy Unocal’s contract area. Re-injection of all produced water is projected to be implemented by year-end 2007. <b>Overboard</b> <b>discharge</b> limits for produced water are 40 mg/L TPH, 10 ppb Hg and 250 ppb As. Characterization of the produced water has shown that hydrocarbons are present as stabilized emulsions, mercury is primarily present in the elemental form, Hg, and arsenic is present as As 3 +. A patented process was developed several years ago to remove these contaminants from produced water prior to <b>overboard</b> <b>discharge.</b> The process consists of a three-phase separator to remove gas and condensate. Water leaves {{the bottom of the}} separator and passes through desanding and deoiling hydrocyclones. The water then enters the chemical treatment process.

30|$|The studied {{field is}} a multi-reservoir, faulted anticline, heavy oil {{accumulation}} {{at a depth}} ranging from approximately 2200 – 2600  m subsea, in Campos Basin block BC- 4. Water depth within the areal extent of the field ranges from 1050 to 1300 m. Studied field was developed as an all subsea well peripheral water flood project, with all injection below the various oil water contacts. The project uses vertical or deviated water injection wells and long, horizontal open-hole gravel pack production wells. At {{the time of this}} evaluation, a final decision has not been made regarding injection completion selection and also regarding whether produced water will be processed for <b>overboard</b> <b>discharge</b> or re-injected into the reservoir; therefore, this study will examine multiple completion geometries and the effects of alternative produced water strategies. The field data as reported in (Idialu 2014) were sourced in field report Wehunt (2002), Guo (2000), Meyer et al.  2003 a, b.|$|E
50|$|Two spherical fire {{extinguisher}} containers can discharge their contents to either engine. A check valve prevents reverse flow between the containers. Monobromotrifluoromethane (CF3BR) {{is used as}} extinguishing agent. Two disc-type indicators are flush mounted under the left engine. If the yellow disc is ruptured, either or both containers have been discharged into the engine nacelle. If the red disc is ruptured, either or both the containers have been <b>discharged</b> <b>overboard</b> {{as a result of}} an overheat condition causing excessive pressure within the containers.|$|R

40|$|Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), {{or small}} round {{structured}} viruses, {{are known to}} cause acute gastroenteritis associated with eating contaminated shell®sh. Between 1993 and 1996, three oyster-related gastroenteritis outbreaks attributed to NLV occurred in Louisiana. Intensive trace-back and environmental investigations revealed that the overboard disposal of sewage by oyster harvesters into oyster-bed waters was the most likely source of contamination {{in at least two}} of the outbreaks. The small infectious dose of NLV, the large quantity of virus particles in stool, and the ability of oysters to concentrate virus particles suggest that oyster-related outbreaks will continue unless strong control measures are established. Efforts to halt improper sewage disposal in oyster-harvesting waters, including <b>overboard</b> sewage <b>discharge,</b> must be undertaken if future outbreaks are to be prevented. Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), also referred to as small round structured viruses (SRSVs), are members of the family Cali-civiridae and are known to cause acute gastroenteritis associated with eating raw shell®sh, especially oysters [1].

50|$|The vessel {{should always}} have a {{positive}} speed over the ground. It is possible to regulate {{the density of the}} sucked substance. If the head is lowered, more material will be sucked but there is a greater possibility of damaging the installation because the material can get stuck inside the pipes. Once the mixture is loaded inside the hopper, the substance will sink and the water is <b>discharged</b> <b>overboard,</b> creating more room for extra substance. A trailing suction hopper dredger is only capable to suck relatively loose substance because the steel teeth are not so big. Harder substances such as rock, or ironbased rock must be destroyed by a cutter.|$|R

When the crew on completion of cargo transfer operations, comes to the cargo tanks - tank washing, tank washing waters are collected on ship. Management of tank washing waters, according to the position of the ship has several possible solutions. In coastal zones, straits, bays, and special areas where tank washing water is not allowed <b>discharging</b> <b>overboard,</b> there are three options: • be discharged ashore (see Fig. 1), paying for the service; • be kept on board, where it is always not enough space; In this situation, the crew is forced to compromise between the existing legislation, environmental pollution problems and the charter of the vessel and company requirements...|$|R

50|$|Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, {{as amended}} by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, applies to cruise ships and prohibits {{discharge}} of oil or hazardous substances in harmful quantities into or upon U.S. navigable waters, or into or upon {{the waters of the}} contiguous zone, or which may affect natural resources in the U.S. EEZ (extending 200 mi offshore). Coast Guard regulations prohibit discharge of oil within 12 mi from shore, unless passed through a 15-ppm oil water separator, and unless the discharge does not cause a visible sheen. Beyond 12 mi, oil or oily mixtures can be discharged while a vessel is proceeding en route and if the oil content without dilution is less than 100 ppm. Vessels are required to maintain an Oil Record Book to record disposal of oily residues and <b>discharges</b> <b>overboard</b> or disposal of bilge water.|$|R
50|$|Pretoria {{began her}} maiden voyage from Hamburg on 19 December 1936. Her {{destination}} was Lourenço Marques, Mozambique via Southampton, United Kingdom; Lisbon, Portugal; Casablanca, Morocco; Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria, South Africa. On 24 December, having departed from Southampton with 470 passengers and 300 crew on board, she ran aground on the East Lepe Bank in the Solent. Although five tugs attempted to free her, she remained aground. After 900 tons of water had been <b>discharged</b> <b>overboard</b> and 400 tons of fuel oil had {{been transferred to}} a tanker, she was freed {{with the aid of}} seven tugs on 26 December, losing her port anchor in the process. Pretoria returned to Southampton for inspection, resuming her voyage the next day. As a result of the delays incurred, the calls at Lisbon and Casablanca were omitted. Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie operated her mainly between Hamburg, South-West Africa and South Africa.|$|R
5000|$|All OWS equipment, new or old, can, in a {{laboratory}} setting, separate oil and water, do so automatically, and produce clean water for <b>discharge</b> <b>overboard</b> that contains no more than 15 parts per million oil. OWS equipment is approved by testing it with specific cocktails of mixed oil and water. Initially these combinations were very simple, basically {{no more than a}} mixture of clean water and diesel fuel, but they have become more sophisticated under MARPOL MEPC 107(49). The vast majority of these many equipment models, manufacturers, and types start with some sort of gravity separation of bilge water. Simply letting oil and water sit is called decanting, and this does not always meet the 15 ppm criterion, which is why each manufacturer has added additional features to his equipment to ensure that this criterion can be met. The separation that takes place inside the OWS allows oil that floats to the top to be automatically skimmed off to a sludge tank or dirty oil holding tank. [...] There is no official standard for tank naming convention but there are some proposals for that.|$|R
50|$|Solid waste {{generated}} {{on a ship}} includes glass, paper, cardboard, aluminium and steel cans, and plastics. It can be either non-hazardous or hazardous in nature. Solid waste that enters the ocean may become marine debris, and can then {{pose a threat to}} marine organisms, humans, coastal communities, and industries that utilize marine waters. Cruise ships typically manage solid waste by a combination of source reduction, waste minimization, and recycling. However, as much as 75 percent of solid waste is incinerated on board, and the ash typically is discharged at sea, although some is landed ashore for disposal or recycling. Marine mammals, fish, sea turtles, and birds can be injured or killed from entanglement with plastics and other solid waste that may be released or disposed off of cruise ships. On average, each cruise ship passenger generates at least two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day. With large cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers, the amount of {{waste generated}} in a day can be massive. For a large cruise ship, about 8 tons of solid waste are generated during a one-week cruise. It has been estimated that 24 percent of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide (by weight) comes from cruise ships. Most cruise ship garbage is treated on board (incinerated, pulped, or ground up) for <b>discharge</b> <b>overboard.</b> When garbage must be off-loaded (for example, because glass and aluminium cannot be incinerated), cruise ships can put a strain on port reception facilities, which are rarely adequate to the task of serving a large passenger vessel.|$|R
5000|$|The system {{consists}} of all vital components for monitoring and controlling the {{discharge from the}} vessel's oily water separator. The white box includes a stainless steel cage with a locked door. The bilge water from the oily water separator is pumped through the white box and analyzed by an oil content meter. A flow switch secures that there is flow through the oil content meter and a flow meter counts the accumulated <b>discharged</b> <b>overboard</b> volume. If the door is opened, the oil content exceeds the legal limit of 15 parts per million (PPM) or the flow to the oil content meter is lost the three way valve will immediately redirect the bilge water back to the bilge water holding tank. All components inside the system are connected to a digital recorder mounted in the engine control room that records the oil content, three way valve position, flow through oil content meter, accumulated discharged volume, door position together with the vessels geographical position and time. The chief engineer possesses the key and when locked, the system [...] cannot be tampered with and equally importantly provides {{the evidence that the}} vessel has been compliant.
