The model set-up is designed to study the variability in the deep-water mass formation areas and was therefore regionally better resolved in the deep-water formation areas in the Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, Weddell Sea and Ross Sea. The sea-ice model reproduces realistic sea-ice distributions and variabilities in the sea-ice extent of both hemispheres as well as sea-ice transport that compares well with observational data. Based on a comparison between model and <b>ocean</b> <b>weather</b> <b>ship</b> data in the North Atlantic, we observe that the vertical structure is well captured in areas with a high resolution.

40|$|Marine air {{temperature}} reports from ships can contain significant biases {{due to the}} solar heating of the instruments and their surroundings. However, there have been very few attempts to derive corrections. The biases can reverse {{the sign of the}} measured air–sea temperature differences and cause significant errors in the sea surface latent and sensible heat flux estimates. In this paper a new correction for the radiative heating errors is presented. The correction is based on the analytical solution of the heat budget for an idealized ship, using empirical coefficients to represent the physical parameters. For the first time heat storage is included in the correction model. The heating errors are estimated for the <b>Ocean</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Ship</b> Cumulus and the coefficients determined. When the correction is applied to the Cumulus data the average estimated error is reduced from 0. 32 ° to 0. 04 °C and the diurnal cycle in the error is removed. The rms error is reduced by 30 %.

Since 1995, there has been a steady increase in both temperature (from 9. 1 to 10 °C) and salinity (from 35. 32 to 35. 41) as the Subpolar Gyre has retreated west. The historical record suggests that such increases could be compatible with decadal scales of natural variability. Nutrient (nitrate, phosphate, and silicate) concentrations have been measured systematically since 1996 and exhibit interannual variability, particularly in nitrate, the causes of which are not immediately clear. Average phosphate concentrations in the upper 800 m declined from 0. 80 to 0. 63 ?M by 2009, consistent with the recent incursion of depleted Subtropical Gyre water.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe role of strong atmospheric forcing events {{in determining the}} evolution of the upper ocean during the fall and early winter cooling season was investigated. The historical series of surface and near-surface marine observations at three mid-latitude <b>ocean</b> <b>weather</b> <b>ships</b> (PAPA (OWS P), NOVEMBER (OWS N), and VICTOR (OWS V)) support the hypothesis that the integrated effects of these events dominate this evolution. For example, periods when the mechanical forcing was greater than the long-term mean accounted for approximately 35 % of the time in the record examined at the three stations. However 85 %/ 68 %/ 57 % of the sea-surface temperature change at OWS N/OWS P/OWS V occurred during these periods. Forty-nine data sets were examined and modeled during periods of intense fall and winter forcing. The significant thermal structure modifications observed during these strong events were simulated successfully using three modifications of the Kraus and Turner (1967) one- dimensional model. Evidence is presented which demonstrates that the amount of mechanically-generated turbulent kinetic energy available for entrainment decreases as the mixed-layer depth increases. Furthermore, in agreement with Gill and Turner (1976), these case studies suggest that {{only a small percentage of}} the convectively-generated turbulent kinetic energy is available for increasing the potential energy of the ocean by entrainment.

40|$|Here 11 {{years of}} surface data (1961 – 72, {{excluding}} 1963) taken at <b>ocean</b> <b>weather</b> <b>ship</b> N (OWS N) are analyzed. OWS N {{is located in}} the subtropical eastern Pacific Ocean (1408 W, 308 N). Bulk formulas are employed to calculate each component of the surface heat flux (sensible, latent, longwave, and shortwave) from the 3 -h measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), air temperature, surface humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness. Analyses are performed on fluxes averaged over daily and monthly intervals. Results indicate a large fraction of the variance in net surface energy flux is associated with anomalies in the latent heat flux; the latter are principally due to variability in the surface wind speed. Cross correlation and regression analyses of monthly anomalies of SST and SST tendency (]SST/]t) with the surface heat flux components indicate over 50 % of the variance in SST-tendency anomalies is accounted for by local anomalies in the net surface energy flux. In the summer, the summed variance in the four components of the surface heat flux is explained almost completely by two modes of variability that are nearly orthogonal. The first (second) mode is defined as the combination of surface flux components that optimally covaries with the SST-tendency anomaly (SST anomaly) and it contains 74 % (26 %) of the summed variance in all of the surface heat flux components.

The ecosystem model resolves dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N),phytoplankton (P), zooplankton (Z) and detritus (D), therefore calledNPZD-model. Physical forcing, such as temperature, eddy diffusivitiesand surface radiation are taken from an eddy-permitting generalcirculation model of the North Atlantic Ocean, covering a period from 1989 through 1993. When an optimized parameter set is applied, theNPZD-model produces substantial differences in the biogeochemicalfluxes with respect to model results using previously published``traditional'' parameter values. Annual nitrogen fluxes are determined forthe upper 126 meters together with standard deviations which areassociated with uncertainties in the optimal parameter estimates. Incontrast to earlier models the rapid cycling of organic matter forsustaining primary production is significantly enhanced. An analysis ofprimary production reveals systematic discrepancies between$^{ 14 }$C-fixation rates and modelled primary production under nutrientdepleted conditions. The chosen physical boundary conditions are adequate to simulate thebiogeochemical fluxes at the BATS and NABE sites. At high latitudes(OWS-INDIA), however, the physical-biological interactions in themodel cannot represent the observed chlorophyll distribution in spring.

Neither Hs nor Hmax show a significant trend in the period 2000 – 2009. These data are combined with earlier observations. The long-term trend over the period 1980 – 2009 in annual Hs is 2. 72 ± 0. 88 cm/year. Mean Hs and Hmax are both correlated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index during winter. The correlation with the NAO index is highest for the more frequently encountered (75 th percentile) wave heights. The wave field variability associated with the NAO index is reconstructed using a 500 -year NAO index record. Hs and H max are found to vary by up to 1. 42 m and 3. 10 m respectively over the 500 -year period. Trends in all 30 -year segments of the reconstructed wave field are lower than the trend in the observations during 1980 – 2009. The NAO index does not change significantly in 21 st century projections from CMIP 5 climate models under scenario RCP 85, and thus no NAO-related changes are expected in the mean and extreme wave fields of the Norwegian Sea...|$|E

This paper analyses 10 years of in-situ measurements of significant wave height (Hs) and maximum wave height (Hmax) from the <b>ocean</b> <b>weather</b> <b>ship</b> Polarfront in the Norwegian Sea. During the period 2000 to 2009, surface elevation was recorded every 0. 59 s during sampling periods of 30 min. The Hmax observations scale linearly with Hs on average. A widely-used empirical Weibull distribution {{is found to}} estimate average values of Hmax/H s and Hmax better than a Rayleigh distribution, but tends to underestimate both {{for all but the}} smallest waves. In this paper we propose a modified Rayleigh distribution which compensates for the heterogeneity of the observed dataset: the distribution is fitted to the whole dataset and improves the estimate of the largest waves. Over the 10 -year period, the Weibull distribution approximates the observed Hs and Hmax well, and an exponential function can be used to predict the probability distribution function of the ratio Hmax/Hs. However, the Weibull distribution tends to underestimate the occurrence of extremely large values of Hs and Hmax. The persistence of Hs and Hmax in winter is also examined. Wave fields with Hs > 12 m and Hmax > 16 m do not last longer than 3 h. Low-to-moderate wave heights that persist for more than 12 h dominate the relationship of the wave field with the winter NAO index over 2000 – 2009. In contrast, the inter-annual variability of wave fields with Hs > 5. 5 m or Hmax > 8. 5 m and wave fields persisting over 2. 5 days is not associated with the winter NAO index...|$|E

The ecosystem model is based on nitrogen and resolves dissolved inorganic nitrogen (N), phytoplankton (P), zooplankton (Z) and detritus (D), therefore called the NPZD-model. Physical forcing, such as temperature and eddy diffusivities are taken from an eddy-permitting general circulation model of the North Atlantic Ocean, covering a period from 1989 through 1993. When an optimized parameter set is applied, the recycling of organic nitrogen becomes significantly enhanced, compared to previously published results of the NPZD model. The optimized model yields improved estimates of the annual ratio of regenerated to total primary production (f-ratio). The annual f-ratios are 0. 09, 0. 31, and 0. 42 for the locations of BATS, NABE, and OWS-INDIA, respectively. Nevertheless, three major model deficiencies are identified. Most conspicuous are systematic discrepancies between measured 14 C-fixation rates and modeled primary production under nutrient depleted conditions. This error is primarily attributed to the assumption of a constant carbon-to-nitrogen ratio for nutrient acquisition. Secondly, the initial period of the modeled phytoplankton blooms is hardly tracked by the model. That particular model deficiency becomes most apparent at the OWS-INDIA site. The interplay between algal growth and short-term alterations in stratification and mixing is believed to be insufficiently resolved by the physical model. Eventually, the model's representation of the vertical nitrogen export appears to be too simple in order to match, at the same time, remineralization within the upper 300 meters and the biomass export to greater depths...|$|E
40|$|Boundary layers {{with small}} thermal and {{mechanical}} inertia {{are close to}} steady-state conditions. This underlies the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory and explains why the surface values of the fluxes can be chosen as external parameters. For fluids with large thermal inertia, such as the ocean, the thermal time scale is relatively large, and the density flux is a complex function of depth; thus, the external thermal forcing {{is no longer a}} governing parameter. However, the mechanical inertia of the upper ocean is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the thermal inertia. Consequently, the upper ocean can be considered as steady-state in the dynamic sense, to any dynamic property depends primarily on the depth, the surface momentum flux, and the vertical density structure. This property allows us to suggest an alternative formulation of the similarity theory for the stratified boundary layers through specification of a new stratification parameter which characterizes the internal density structure instead of the external density flux. The turbulent mixing coefficient is derived as dependent on the stratification parameter. The latter includes the surface stress and the integral density deficit for the entire layer above. The general form and the asymptotic behavior of the nondimensional turbulent mixing coefficient {{as a function of the}} stratification parameter are obtained using dimensional considerations. Determination of numerical parameters is based on 8 years of temperature profiles acquired at the <b>Ocean</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Ship</b> (OWS) PAPA. Finally, a method for calculating the profile of the turbulent mixing coefficient is obtained. This approach reproduces the 8 -year evolution of the upper ocean with the maximum rms difference of approximately 1 C and the bias of 1 C over the depth range 0 - 150 m. Additional 1 -year simulation of the upper ocean at OWS CHARLEY and 9 -year simulation at OWS NOVEMBER confirms reasonable applicability of this approach. The proposed simple turbulent mixing scheme reproduces the evolution of the upper ocean with accuracies similar to those obtained using much more complicated models...|$|E

An extensive set of direct, eddy covariance measurements of momentum, latent heat, sensible heat and CO 2 flux was obtained over a wide range of open ocean conditions. The maximum recorded 20 -minute mean wind speed was 25 m. s- 1. The maximum significant wave height was 11 m. The initial CO 2 flux results were subject to a large, commonly observed humidity cross-sensitivity error. A novel iterative correction procedure was developed, tested against an independent data set and proved to be robust (Prytherch et al., 2010 a). Open-path sensors may now be used for air-sea CO 2 flux measurement, greatly increasing the number of measurements available for analysis. There are large differences between existing gas transfer to wind speed relationships, particularly at high wind speeds, and there is significant uncertainty over the form (quadratic or cubic) of the relationship. From the 3938 direct CO 2 flux measurements made onboard Polarfront, a new relationship between gas transfer velocity, k 660, and wind speed, U 10 n has been obtained: k 660 = ? 0. 51 + 0. 095 U 10 n 2. 7 0 ?U 10 n ? 20 m. s- 1 The motion corrected fluxes were found to have a large signal at frequencies associated with platform motion.

40|$|This study aims to {{validate}} {{the ability of the}} Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model (FESOM) to reproduce a reliable deep water formation in North Atlantic ocean and to analyse its variability on interannual to decadal time-scales. The FESOM approach works on unstructured triangular surface meshes, which allows us to faithfully resolve coastlines and local areas of interest. The first part of the thesis presents the characteristics of a global FESOM setup designed to study the variability in the deep-water formation areas over five decades for the period 1958 - 2004. The setup features a regionally increased resolution in the deep water formation areas in the Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, Weddell Sea and Ross Sea as well as in equatorial and coastal areas. Further, this part of the thesis deals with the applied spinup procedure and the general validation of the FESOM model setup with respect to the performance of the sea-ice and ocean model component. Based on the analysis of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) we demonstrate that the upper ocean is converged within the applied spinup procedure. The sea ice model reproduces realistic sea-ice distributions and variabilities in the sea ice extent on both hemispheres as well as sea ice transport that compares well with observational data. The general ocean circulation model is validated based on a comparison of the model results with <b>Ocean</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Ship</b> data in the North Atlantic. We can prove that the vertical structure is well captured in areas with improved resolution. Further, we are able to simulate the decadal ocean variability in the Nordic Sea Overflows as well as several salinity anomaly events and corresponding fingerprint in the vertical hydrography. The second part of the thesis focuses on the validation of the model capability to reproduce a realistic deep-water formation in the Labrador Sea. Therefor, we examine two classes of Labrador Sea water (LSW) which are analysed and compared to observed LSW layer thicknesses derived from profile data for the time interval 1988 - 2007. We show, that the model setup reproduces in the temporal evolution of the potential density, temperature and salinity two different phase since the late 1980 s. These two phases are well known in observational data and are characterized by a significantly different LSW formation. Whereas the first phase features a dominant increase in the layer thickness of the deep Labrador Sea water (dLSW), is the second phase characterized by a degeneration of dLSW. To highlight the processes that are responsible for the variability in dLSW layer thickness we apply a Composite Map Analysis (CMA) between an index of dLSW and sea level pressure, as well as the thermal and haline contributions to the surface density flux. The composite maps reveal that a North Atlantic Oscillation like pattern {{is one of the main}} triggers for the variability of LSW formation in the model. Our model results indicate that a massive dLSW formation can act as a low-pass filter to the atmospheric forcing, so that only persistent NAO events correlate with the dLSW index. Additionally our results show that the central Labrador Sea in the model is dominated by the thermal contributions of the surface density flux, while the haline contributions are shielded from the central Labrador Sea by the branch of the Labrador Sea Boundary Current system. In our model, this shielding allows only a minor haline interaction with the central Labrador Sea by lateral mixing. Another aim of the thesis is to examine the general model variability on interannual to decadal time scales. Therefore we study the variability in a normal and random forced FESOM run. By definition of a North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) index for the normal and random forced FESOM run we could identify an interannual and quasi decadal variability of 7. 1 yr and 14. 2 yr, respectively. It is found that the normal forced run is dominated by the quasi decadal variability and the random forced run by the interannual variability. The quasi decadal variability could be attributed to the atmospheric forcing, while the interannual variability could be linked to internal modes of the ocean. We defined in analogy to the baroclinic mass transport index (BMT) a dGyre index from the horizontal barotropic streamfunction. The comparison of the observed BMT index and the modeled dGyre index reveals that the model is able to reproduce the variability of the index comparing to the observed one, although the model tends to overestimate the magnitude of the index. To further isolate the horizontal but also the vertical variability in the model we apply a principal oscillation pattern (POP) analysis in a three dimensional context. We discovered two exceptional strong interannual modes whose variability could be attributed to a propagating Rossby wave structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{modeling}} {{and understanding of}} the deep-water formation variability, especially in the North Atlantic sector, is of crucial importance for the common global ocean variability, in particular on interannual to decadal time-scales. The local restriction of the deep water formation areas makes it necessary to follow new model approaches that are able to resolve these areas with a sufficient high resolution without ignoring the global context. This study aims to validate the ability of the Finite-Element Sea-Ice Ocean Model (FESOM) to reproduce a reliable deep water formation in North Atlantic ocean and to analyse its variability on interannual to decadal time-scales. The FESOM approach works on unstructured triangular surface meshes, which allows us to faithfully resolve coastlines and local areas of interest. The first part of the thesis presents the characteristics of a global FESOM setup designed to study the variability in the deep-water formation areas over five decades for the period 1958 - 2004. The setup features a regionally increased resolution in the deep water formation areas in the Labrador Sea, Greenland Sea, Weddell Sea and Ross Sea as well as in equatorial and coastal areas. Further, this part of the thesis deals with the applied spinup procedure and the general validation of the FESOM model setup with respect to the performance of the sea-ice and ocean model component. Based on the analysis of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) we demonstrate that the upper ocean is converged within the applied spinup procedure. The sea ice model reproduces realistic sea-ice distributions and variabilities in the sea ice extent on both hemispheres as well as sea ice transport that compares well with observational data. The general ocean circulation model is validated based on a comparison of the model results with <b>Ocean</b> <b>Weather</b> <b>Ship</b> data in the North Atlantic. We can prove that the vertical structure is well captured in areas with improved resolution. Further, we are able to simulate the decadal ocean variability in the Nordic Sea Overflows as well as several salinity anomaly events and corresponding fingerprint in the vertical hydrography. The second part of the thesis focuses on the validation of the model capability to reproduce a realistic deep-water formation in the Labrador Sea. Therefor, we examine two classes of Labrador Sea water (LSW) which are analysed and compared to observed LSW layer thicknesses derived from profile data for the time interval 1988 - 2007. We show, that the model setup reproduces in the temporal evolution of the potential density, temperature and salinity two different phase since the late 1980 s. These two phases are well known in observational data and are characterized by a significantly different LSW formation. Whereas the first phase features a dominant increase in the layer thickness of the deep Labrador Sea water (dLSW), is the second phase characterized by a degeneration of dLSW. To highlight the processes that are responsible for the variability in dLSW layer thickness we apply a Composite Map Analysis (CMA) between an index of dLSW and sea level pressure, as well as the thermal and haline contributions to the surface density flux.
