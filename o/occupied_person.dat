40|$|Abstract The paper {{analyzes}} the characteristics {{and evolution of}} income distribution in the Brazilian agricultural sector, comparing it with the overall distribution or with the non-agricultural sector, considering two dimensions: the per capita household income and the income of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons.</b> The main data source is the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD). In order to fulfill this purpose, the per capita household income was divided into nine components (for Brazil and considering only the agricultural households) to evaluate {{their contributions to the}} decrease in inequality. In the second part, the paper {{analyzes the}} characteristics of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons</b> and the determining factors of their income, always comparing the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. The estimated effects were analyzed over the period 1992 - 2012, adjusting one earnings equation for each year. In both cases (per capita household income and earnings of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons),</b> the agricultural sector showed a markedly different behavior. Regarding the per capita household income, though from 2001 to 2009 the rate of reduction in inequality among agricultural households is similar to the one observed in Brazil as a whole, the determinants associated with this reduction are clearly different in the agricultural sector. Concerning the income of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons,</b> the reduction in inequality is less intense and more irregular in the agricultural sector. The various factors that determin...|$|R

40|$|Earnings {{equations}} for <b>occupied</b> <b>persons</b> in {{the state}} of Minas Gerais are estimated using data from the 2000 Demographic Census of Brazil. Such equations allow us to evaluate the effect of age, gender, schooling, color (race), position in the occupation, weekly working time and other factors on earnings, taking into account as well the differences among 12 regions of the state. Data limitations are discussed, particularly the understatement of incomes, and the composition of household income is also analyzed. Regarding the specification of the earnings equations, the paper shows that it is wrong to assume that the influence of schooling can be represented as a linear function, since there is an important threshold effect after 10 years of schooling. The paper also shows that there are important differences among earnings equations fitted {{for each of the three}} economic sectors. In agriculture, for instance, the most relevant variable explaining differences in earnings of <b>occupied</b> <b>persons</b> is their position in occupation, and not schooling, while in industry and services the main explanatory variable is schooling. earnings equations, inequality, education, Brazil, Minas Gerais...|$|R

40|$|From {{a simple}} {{observation}} of data it arises that when bigger the "per capita" income {{of a nation}} is, lesser the participation of agricultural section will be, in national product. Consequently, underdeveloped countries must apply to industrialization to secure its growth. Industry must act as an absorption element of human resources and savings for a new investment. The fundamental question is to know up to what degree should industrialization be supported, and {{which is the most}} economic value for agricultural production volume. The problem's knot is the increase of produce per <b>occupied</b> <b>person.</b> The more efficient distribution of resources, would be that in which medium productivity per <b>occupied</b> <b>person</b> be the same in every sector of production. Attached to this statement, it is necessary to establish some requirements for the system of prices, the deepest question being that of the determination of national production prices, in front of the complications in the matter of exchange...|$|E
30|$|We now {{highlight}} the empirical {{significance of the}} distinction between SEWNEs and SEWEs, one of the main interests of this paper. For this purpose, we use Spanish data on occupational groups and output per <b>occupied</b> <b>person</b> and productivity, both across regions and over time. The data separate the self-employed in own-account self-employed and employers, and separate salaried employees into those who occupy top management positions, managers, and other salaried employees. The National Statistical Office has collected the data with the same methodology in all of the 18 Spanish Autonomous Communities (AACC). The managers perform similar entrepreneurial and management functions as the employers, so we add the two groups of employers and managers to get what in the model is referred to as SEWEs.|$|E

To do so, this work makes use of the data presented in the System of National Accounts and the National Survey of Households (PNAD), both from IBGE, and the Leontief model. The results show: a) {{the importance of}} the Tertiary sector for the Brazilian economy in terms of employment (around 61 % of the <b>occupied</b> <b>persons),</b> and income generation (around 67 % of the economy Value Added); b) the high share of the informal sector in the Brazilian economy (around 58 % of the <b>occupied</b> <b>persons</b> and 34 % of the income); c) the combination of these factors results in an economy with low wages and salaries and with an high concentration of income; and d) that the present productive structure of the Brazilian economy contributes to the concentration of income in the country. ...|$|R
