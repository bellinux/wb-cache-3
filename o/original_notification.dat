40|$|Abstract Background Routinely {{collected}} {{infectious disease}} surveillance data provide a valuable means {{to monitor the}} health of populations. Notifiable disease surveillance systems in Australia have consistently reported high levels of completeness for the demographic data fields of age and sex, but low levels of completeness for Aboriginality data. Significant amounts of missing data associated with case notifications can introduce bias in the estimation of disease rates by population subgroups. The aim of this analysis was {{to evaluate the use}} of data linkage to improve the accuracy of estimated notification rates for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and blood borne viruses (BBVs) in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal groups in Western Australia. Methods Probabilistic methods were used to link disease notification data received in Western Australia in 2004 with core population health datasets from the established Western Australian Data Linkage System. A comparative descriptive analysis of STI and BBV notification rates according to Aboriginality was conducted based on the <b>original</b> and supplemented <b>notification</b> datasets. Results Using data linkage, the proportion of STI and BBV notifications with missing Aboriginality data was reduced by 74 per cent. Compared with excluding notifications with unknown Aboriginality data from the analysis, or apportioning notifications with unknown Aboriginality based on the proportion of cases with known Aboriginality, the rate ratios of chlamydia, syphilis and hepatitis C among Aboriginal relative to non-Aboriginal people decreased when Aboriginality data from data linkage was included.

This state could include basic information, such as location and head pose, but also more useful information such as whether the person is present or busy. These applications are perceptive because they provide an alternative to the traditional screen-based GUI, using physical presence and gestures to replace the traditional keyboard and mouse. They are also presence applications because they seek to share information about a person or location across some distance. For example, perceptive presence applications can share information about {{the number of people in}} an area as well as their location, activity level, or line of site (where they are looking).

40|$|A materialização {{original}} do Paradigma Orientado a Notificações (PON) implementada na linguagem de programação C++ possibilitou a criação de aplicações sob o domínio desse paradigma. Apesar de tais contribuições para com o paradigma, o desenvolvimento de aplicações no PON ainda apresenta baixo nível de maturidade e certo nível de dificuldade. Tais dificuldades advêm principalmente da nova forma de estruturar os programas, onde os mesmos seguem um fluxo de notificações, o que difere da programação convencional. Ademais, até o momento, apenas algumas aplicações foram desenvolvidas, com escopos relativamente pequenos, o que não contribui efetivamente para a consolidação do paradigma e, particularmente, para o aprendizado via um conjunto efetivo de exemplos. Neste sentido, primeiramente, a própria estrutura geral do framework foi relida e reapresentada sob o viés de padrões de projeto, assim como houve contribuições na própria implementação desse. Subsequentemente, este trabalho teve como objetivo principal de estudo o nortear do desenvolvimento de aplicações baseadas no PON de maneira mais simplificada e eficiente, usando os avanços aqui citados. Isso se deu particularmente pela apresentação de padrões de desenvolvimento de software voltados para esse paradigma e infraestrutura, os quais buscam uma implementação mais purista envolvendo quesitos como redução do uso de implementações multiparadigmas, simplificação no desenvolvimento, garantia de determinismo, entre outras. De modo geral, as novas funcionalidades/recursos para a concepção de aplicações através do Framework PON facilitaram e melhoraram seu uso. The <b>original</b> materialization of <b>Notification</b> Oriented Paradigm (NOP) previously {{implemented in}} the C++ programming language allowed the creation of applications under the domain of this paradigm. Although these contributions to the paradigm, the development of NOP applications still has {{a low level of}} maturity and a certain degree of difficulty. Such difficulties arise essentially from the new form of structuring programs, in which such applications follow a notification flow, which differs from the conventional programming. Moreover, so far, only a few applications have been developed, with relatively small scope, which does not contribute effectively to the consolidation of the paradigm, and particularly for learning through an effective set of examples. Henceforth, firstly, the general structure of the framework has been reread and reintroduced under the bias of design patterns, even as there were contributions in its implementation. Subsequently, the main goal {{of this paper is to}} guide the development of applications based on NOP in a more streamlined and efficient manner, using the advances mentioned here. This was achieved particularly by the presentation of technical software implementations aimed to this paradigm and its infrastructure, which pursues a manner to conceive more purist implementations, involving issues such as reducing the use of multiparadigms implementations, simplifying the development, ensuring determinism, and so far. In general, the new features for conceiving applications based on the NOP Framework made easier and better its use...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Web Services are {{becoming}} more and more relevant also in the domain of embedded devices as they {{are becoming}} an important aspect of the Internet of Things. Embedded devices, especially in the field of automation, require real-time behavior. The Devices Profile for Web Services defines WS-Standards for embedded systems. The WS-Eventing is one of this standards within DPWS and enables the distributions of events. However, WS-Eventing has a scalability problem as in ad-hoc networks the notification is transmitted sequential by an event source. Under these circumstances, it is not suitable for large-scale networks with a high amount of devices. Therefore, a new approach is presented to solve this issue by acquiring helping devices. The communication is only based on unicast IP communication and thus is easy to integrate into automation infrastructures and could be established over several subnets. This approach has been investigated with an experimental setup and shows the high scalability compared to the <b>original</b> <b>notification</b> mechanism. Additionally, the real-time capability is given due to the chosen platform and real-time operating system. Thus, the new approach enables the idea of Internet of Things in automation scenarios.

40|$|In {{a cohort}} {{study of the}} {{incidence}} of cancer and mortality among 7996 men and 584 women employed in the Danish asbestos cement industry between 1928 and 1984 over 99 % were traced. Chrysotile asbestos was the only fibre type used until 1946, when amosite and (in 1952) crocidolite were also introduced. Chrysotile constituted 89 %, amosite 10 %, and crocidolite 1 % of the asbestos used. During the first 25 years of manufacture the exposure levels were high, especially {{in areas where the}} asbestos was handled dry. Measurements from 1948 indicate that the fibre levels may have ranged from 100 to 1600 times over the present Danish threshold limit value of 0. 5 fibre/ml. In 1973 more than 41 % of personal samples were higher than 2 f/ml. About 76 % of the workforce left the factory within five years of starting employment. A total of 1346 deaths and 612 cases of cancer were observed in the cohort between 1943 and 1984. Among employed men the overall mortality (O/E 1. 18; 95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 25), cancer mortality (O/E 1. 32; 95 % CI 1. 19 - 1. 46), and overall incidence of cancer (O/E 1. 22; 95 % CI 1. 12 - 1. 32) were significantly increased compared with all Danish men. This was not so among employed women. For men, significant excess risks were found for cancer of the lung (O/E 1. 80; 95 % CI 1. 54 - 2. 10), pleura (O/E 5. 46; 95 % CI 2. 62 - 10. 05), mediastinum (O/E 5. 00; 95 % CI 1. 01 - 14. 61), stomach (O/E 1. 43; 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 93), and other male genital organs (O/E 3. 03; 95 % CI 1. 11 - 6. 60).
