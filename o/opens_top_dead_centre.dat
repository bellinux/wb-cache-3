50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> of piston #1 is {{the point}} from which ignition system measurements are made and the firing order is determined. For example, ignition timing is normally specified as degrees of crankshaft rotation before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BTDC).

50|$|As the {{ignition}} system is normally arranged to produce sparks before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{there is a}} risk of the engine kicking back during hand starting, to avoid this problem one of the two magnetos used in a typical aero engine ignition system is fitted with an 'impulse coupling', this spring-loaded device delays the spark until <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and also increases the rotational speed of the magneto to produce a stronger spark. When the engine fires, the impulse coupling no longer operates and the second magneto is switched on.|$|R
50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} engine, the <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> is {{the position}} of a piston in which it is farthest from, or nearest to, the crankshaft. The former is known as <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) while the latter is known as bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (BDC).|$|R
50|$|At <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> {{the piston}} gets {{very close to}} the flat portion of the {{cylinder}} head above, and the resultant turbulence produces excellent mixing of the fuel and air.|$|R
5000|$|High {{piston speed}} around <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) and a fast power stroke {{expansion}} enhances fuel-air mixing {{and reduces the}} time available for heat transfer losses {{and the formation of}} temperature-dependent emissions such as nitrogen oxides (NOx).|$|R
50|$|Process 2-3 is a constant-volume heat {{transfer}} to the working gas from an external source while the piston is at <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> This process is intended to represent the ignition of the fuel-air mixture and the subsequent rapid burning.|$|R
50|$|The valve {{is usually}} {{constructed}} as a circular poppet valve with a conical seat, {{inserted into the}} cylinder from the outside. A protrusion on the inside is hit by the piston as it approaches <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> forcing the valve open.|$|R

40|$|Recent papers [1], [2], [3], [4] and [5] have {{proposed}} two different systems to more efficiently and more rapidly burn the fuel in highly boosted, high compression ratio, directly injected internal combustion engines permitting multi-mode combustion operation. In a first system, a second direct injector is {{coupled with the}} standard Diesel direct injector and glow plug. The second direct injector introduces {{the most of the}} fuel while the Diesel direct injector only introduces a minimum amount of fuel to control the start of the combustion about <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> The fuel injected before the Diesel ignition injection burns premixed, the fuel injected after the Diesel ignition injection burns diffusion. This design permits combustion premixed gasoline-like if all the fuel is injected before the Diesel ignition injection, diffusion Diesel-like if all the fuel is injected after the Diesel ignition injection (as done in the Westport High Pressure Direct Injection concept [12]), and mixed gasoline/Diesel like injecting the fuel before and after the Diesel ignition injection. The premixed gasoline-like mode is actually a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) -like mode, where an amount of fuel smaller than the threshold value producing <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> auto ignition is then ignited at <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> by the Diesel ignition injection in a more robust, stable and repeatable operation unaffected by small changes in properties and composition of the fuel and air mixture...|$|R
50|$|At the <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> {{and bottom}} <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> valves open briefly {{with the rest}} of the time the valves being closed. Both the {{displacer}} piston and power piston move together in the same direction at the same time. The clever bit is that at the end of each stroke a valve is opened. This releases pressure or vacuum so the next cycle can begin.|$|R
50|$|Hand {{starting}} {{of aircraft}} piston engines by swinging the propeller {{is the oldest}} and simplest method, {{the absence of any}} onboard starting system giving an appreciable weight saving. Positioning of the propeller relative to the crankshaft is arranged such that the engine pistons pass through <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> during the swinging stroke.|$|R
30|$|The {{results show}} optimal {{power and torque}} is {{achieved}} at 31 °CA before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> and volumetric efficiency, BMEP have increased with rising ignition timing. O 2, CO 2, CO has been almost constant, but HC with advance of ignition timing increased and the lowest amount NOx is obtained at 10 BTDC.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> is also {{extended}} to pistonless rotary engines, and means {{the point in}} the cycle in which the volume of a combustion chamber is smallest. This typically occurs several times per rotor revolution; In the Wankel engine for example it occurs three times for every one revolution of the rotor.|$|R
50|$|The MA is an all-aluminium straight-4 SOHC 0.9 L, 1.0 L, or 1.2 L engine made by Nissan. It had an 8-valve {{hemispherical}} cylinder head. Unusually, {{the specified}} ignition timing for the MA10 {{running on the}} specified 90 RON gasoline was 2 degrees after <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre,</b> reflecting a very high flame speed in the compact combustion chambers.|$|R
50|$|This term is {{also used}} {{in the realm of}} {{production}} equipment. A mechanical punch press employs a crankshaft similar to that found in an engine. In the punch press the crankshaft drives a ram which when it is farthest away from the platen of the press is considered to be in the position of <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MA10S is {{the engine}} {{used in the}} K10 (1982-1992) type Nissan Micra. It has a hemi-head and, unusually, the spark is fired after <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> because of the very high flame speed in a compact engine with this head design. Compression in the 50bhp version was {{relatively}} low so {{it was able to}} run on 90 RON petrol where available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> for {{cylinder}} one {{is often}} {{marked on the}} crankshaft pulley, the flywheel or dynamic balancer or both, with adjacent timing marks showing the recommended ignition timing settings as decided during engine development. These timing marks {{can be used to}} set the ignition timing either statically by hand or dynamically using a timing light, by rotating the distributor in its seat.|$|R
50|$|When a crank moves 90 {{degrees from}} the <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) in a single {{cylinder}} engine positioned upright, the bigend up-down position is exactly at the half-way point in the stroke, but the conrod is at the most tilted position at this time, and this tilt angle makes the small-end position to be lower than the half-way point in its stroke.|$|R
5000|$|Ignition {{typically}} occurs around 15 degrees before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> The {{spark plug}} must be sited {{so that the}} flame front can progress throughout the combustion chamber. Good design should avoid narrow crevices where stagnant [...] "end gas" [...] can become trapped, as this gas may detonate violently after the main charge, adding little useful work and potentially damaging the engine.|$|R
50|$|The Scuderi Engine {{addresses}} the breathing problem {{by reducing the}} clearance between the piston and the cylinder head through various turbo charging techniques. The Scuderi design {{requires the use of}} outwardly opening valves that enable the piston to move very close to the cylinder head without the interference of the valves. Scuderi {{addresses the}} low thermal efficiency via firing after <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (ATDC).|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the {{compression}} stroke just before piston's <b>Top</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Centre</b> exhaust valves are open briefly again to release [...] "bleed" [...] compression thus again slowing the piston on its subsequent downwards movement and consequently achieving engine braking effect while also storing the pressure in the exhaust manifold again using the exhaust brake shutter ready for the next repeat of the cycle.|$|R
40|$|The {{indicator}} {{diagram of the}} Diesel engine is a valuable source of information, delivering many important data. In order to obtain from it the indicated horse power, the exact position of the <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> is needed. Using a measuring system containing a piezoelectric sensor, a charge amplifier and a fast data aquisition system, {{it is possible to}} store, analyze and process many successive thermodynamic cycles for each cylinder {{in such a way as}} to obtain the exact position of the <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> without using any additional signal from, or any mark on the flywheel. For that purpose, the experimental compression part of many successive cycles is compaired continuously to a simulation compression model containing varying parameter values determined by the measured cycle itself. After the experimental and the simulation compression curves fit each other, the <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> can be determined. Different known heat transfer models of the compression have been used and tested, and a new method, using stepwise chaning parameters along the compression is proposed. The method has been tested for different Diesel engines running at speeds between 100 and 2500 r. p. m. with a very good success. The results given concern three types of Diesel Engines i. e. one MAN W 4 V 17, 5 / 22 A DG, 140 BHP, 1000 r. p. m. coupled to a Zoellner hydraulic brake, a ship's Diesel SULZER 5 RND 68, 7500 BHP, 137 r. p. m. measured on sea trials and two stationary FIAT GMT A 420. 8, 55000 BHP, 500 r. p. m., coupled to a synchronous electric generator. © 1987 VDI Verlag GmbH...|$|R
30|$|The {{results show}} that Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) tends to {{increase}} with ignition timing till 31 ° Before <b>Top</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>Centre</b> (BTDC) and then drop off. Best performance will be achieved when he greatest ignition 31 ° BTDC. If ignition timing isn’t advance enough, original portion of the maximum pressure will creative in the expand stroke {{and in this case}} we lose useful efficiency and decreasing performance.|$|R
50|$|John Allen and Sons used {{a number}} of engine types, the most common being a Villiers {{two-stroke}} with magneto ignition and rope start. The engines may fail to start because of ignition problems. The spark should occur when the piston is 3/16 of an inch before <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) on all Villiers engines except for the Villiers Mk. 11C & 25C which should spark 5/32 of an inch before TDC.|$|R
50|$|The infeed and outfeed tables can {{be raised}} or lowered {{independently}} {{of each other and}} in relation to the cutter head although the outfeed table is normally set so that it is level with the knives when at the <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> of the rotation of the cutter head. The infeed table is adjusted so that it is lower than the outfeed table and this gives the depth of cut.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an engine}} {{designed}} {{to use the}} squish effect, at <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> (TDC) the piston crown comes very close, (typically less than 1 mm), to the cylinder head. The gases are suddenly [...] "squished" [...] out within the combustion chamber, creating turbulence which promotes thorough fuel/air mixing, a factor beneficial to efficient combustion. Squish effect {{may be found in}} ohv and ohc engines, including engines with a Heron cylinder head.|$|R
5000|$|The {{displacement}} {{is defined}} as the total volume of air/fuel mixture an engine can draw in during one complete engine cycle. In a piston engine, this is the volume that is swept as the pistons are moved from <b>top</b> <b>dead</b> <b>centre</b> to bottom <b>dead</b> <b>centre.</b> To the layperson this is the [...] "size" [...] of the engine. Motorcycle engines range from less than 50 cc (cubic centimetres), commonly found in many small scooters, to 5735 cc, a Chevrolet V8 engine, currently used by Boss Hoss in its cruiser style motorcycle.|$|R
