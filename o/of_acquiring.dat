5|$|Donayre's {{tenure as}} Commanding General {{of the army}} was {{controversial}} from the start due to corruption allegations and an international incident with Chile. Opposition leader Ollanta Humala criticized Donayre's designation as irregular because at that time he was not serving as general {{of any of the}} three major army divisions as stipulated by Peruvian law. As commander of the Army, Donayre was also accused <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> 50,000 American-made MREs— military rations— to supply troops deployed against Shining Path guerrillas in the Apurímac and Ene river valleys, instead <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> cheaper, locally-made alternatives. An attempt to buy 50,000 more rations led to an inquiry by the Ministry of Defense.|$|E
5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls {{are at greater risk}} of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual activity that is often unconsensual.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} by three main routes: sexual contact, significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as vertical transmission). There is no risk <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> HIV if exposed to feces, nasal secretions, saliva, sputum, sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood. It {{is possible to}} be co-infected {{by more than one}} strain of HIV—a condition known as HIV superinfection.|$|E

The owner, editor, and naval editor were all in favor <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> American-designed dreadnoughts. In addition, the paper found {{evidence}} of British wrongdoing in a related naval contract. Under public pressure, the naval commission was forced to reconsider its original list, which had placed Italy first and Britain second.

5|$|As {{there was}} no defined anti-shipping role in pre-war plans, obtaining {{information}} on the enemy's seaborne commercial traffic did not receive high priority, and once the war started, {{it was difficult to}} establish quickly the means <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> this information, especially after the fall of Norway and France in April and May 1940. The extent of the intelligence vacuum at the start of Coastal Command's campaign is demonstrated by the fact that Air Ministry planners were unaware of the heavy anti-aircraft armament being fitted to enemy merchant vessels. Casualty rates, often in excess of 20 percent, clarified matters in 1940.|$|E

5|$|Bessell {{noted that}} Thorpe, {{for all his}} gregariousness and warmth, {{appeared}} to have no female friends and lacked any interest in girls. The former Liberal MP Frank Owen confided to Bessell his suspicions that Thorpe was a homosexual; other West Country Liberals had formed the same opinion. Aware that exposure as a homosexual would end Thorpe's career, Bessell became his self-appointed protector, even to the extent, he later said, of falsely claiming to be bisexual, as a means <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> his friend's confidence.|$|E
5|$|By late November 1917, the Germans in East Africa {{were left}} with few options {{if they wanted to}} {{continue}} the war. They were outnumbered drastically and were split up into several different columns. The two largest of these, under Theodor Tafel and Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, were completely cut off from each other. Although von Lettow-Vorbeck's column had defeated a large British force at the Battle of Mahiwa he had lost a large number of troops and expended virtually his entire supply of modern ammunition. With only antiquated weapons and no way of resupplying, von Lettow-Vorbeck decided to invade Portuguese East Africa in hopes <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> sufficient supplies to continue the war. There was no legal impediment to this attack; Germany had declared war on Portugal on 9 March 1916.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{transmitted}} in about 93% of blood transfusions using infected blood. In developed countries the risk <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> HIV from {{a blood transfusion}} is extremely low (less than one in half a million) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed; for example, in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it was one in 1.5 million in 2008. In low income countries, only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened (as of 2008), and {{it is estimated that}} up to 15% of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products, representing between 5% and 10% of global infections. Although rare because of screening, it is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation.|$|E

5|$|High {{amounts of}} {{ionizing}} radiation exposure {{can increase the}} risk of AML. Survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had an increased rate of AML, as did radiologists exposed to high levels of X-rays prior to the adoption of modern radiation safety practices. People treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer have the highest chance <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> AML, but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed in the general population after 12 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details of the terms of annexation became public and the question <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Rand {{published}} her best-known work, {{the novel}} Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, {{she turned to}} non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated reason as the only means <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> knowledge, and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral, and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.|$|E
40|$|Less than 60 cases <b>of</b> <b>acquired</b> factor (F) XIII {{deficiencies}} {{have been}} reported, most having distinct clinical features. To illustrate the therapeutic challenges <b>of</b> <b>acquired</b> FXIII inhibitors, we report {{a case of}} a 65 -year-old patient with no previous bleeding history who suddenly developed massive haemorrhages associated to a strong and isolated FXIII inhibitor. No underlying disorder has been detected till now after three years of follow-up. Despite aggressive treatment with prednisone, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, immunoglobulin, immunoadsorption and immune tolerance his inhibitor is still present, although at low titre and with a clinical benefit since the patient has no more bleed since more than one year. Moreover the patient had a venous thromboembolic complication.

5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. A meta-analysis conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
5|$|Iron mining {{occurred}} in several locations, including the main English centre in the Forest of Dean, {{as well as}} in Durham and the Weald. Some iron to meet English demand was also imported from the continent, especially by the late 13th century. By the end of the 12th century, the older method <b>of</b> <b>acquiring</b> iron ore through strip mining was being supplemented by more advanced techniques, including tunnels, trenches and bell-pits. Iron ore was usually locally processed at a bloomery, and by the 14th century the first water-powered iron forge in England was built at Chingley. As a result of the diminishing woodlands and consequent increases in the cost of both wood and charcoal, demand for coal increased in the 12th century and it began to be commercially produced from bell-pits and strip mining.|$|E
5|$|On 22 June 1941, contravening the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, 5.5 million Axis troops {{attacked}} the Soviet Union.

The reaction among Germans was one of surprise and trepidation as many were concerned about how much longer the war would drag on or suspected that Germany could not win a war fought on two fronts.|$|E
