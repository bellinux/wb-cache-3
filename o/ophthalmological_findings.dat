40|$|Retinal {{nerve fiber}} layer {{measurement}} {{in patients with}} Alzheimer's disease The current ophthalmologist's possibilities in diagnostics of Alzheimer's disease Alzheimer disease (AD) {{is the most common}} cause of dementia syndrome and mild cognitive impairment. To enroll the disease most securely there are used so called biomarkers using evidence of changed brain metabolism by pozitron emission tomography (PET) and in cerebrospinal fluid or the brain's structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These methods are expensive, organisationally and temporally challenging and burdening for the patients. According to that reasons we are still seeking for alternative attitudes suitable for early diagnosis. The evaluation of thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) which is well accessible to examination through optical aparatus of the eye could be one of the options. The aim of our work was to present current knowledges about Alzheimer's disease targeting relations of Alzheimer's disease and an <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>finding.</b> In the next part of this paper we introduce the retinal nerve fiber layer measurement by optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a potential diagnostics method by screening of patients with Alzheimer's disease and to present our results measured in our cohort of patients.

40|$|AIMS—To {{examine a}} large family with an {{autosomal}} dominant fundus dystrophy and to investigate whether or not mutations in TIMP- 3 gene were involved.  METHODS—A large family of 58  individuals with an autosomal dominant fundus dystrophy was examined ophthalmologically. A DNA linkage analysis in the 22 q 12. 1 -q 13. 2 region was performed. The TIMP- 3 gene was screened for mutations in all five exons.  RESULTS—In this large family 15  individuals were affected. All other individuals {{were found to be}} clinically unaffected. Pisciform flecks in the midperiphery and drusen-like deposits were the most typical <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>finding</b> in this family and were encountered from the fifth decade on. Chorioretinal atrophy and neovascularisation with disciform lesions characterised the disease from the sixth decade on. Linkage analysis using an affected only analysis, showed a maximum positive lod score of 3. 94  at θ =  0. 0  with marker D 22 S 283. No mutations possibly causing Sorsby fundus dystrophy were found in either the exonic sequences, the promotor region, or the 3 'UTR.  CONCLUSION—The family in this pedigree has an autosomal dominant fundus dystrophy, which is most probably Sorsby fundus dystrophy. Although, in the linkage analysis, significant positive lod scores were found with the region 22 q 12. 1 -q 13. 2, no causative mutations could be identified in the TIMP- 3 gene. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Neuro-Behçet’s disease (NBD) {{involves}} {{the central nervous}} system; peripheral nervous system involvement is not often reported. NBD is quite common in adult patients and occurs rarely during childhood and adolescence. Young patients may share symptoms and signs of NBD with other neuro-ophthalmological disorders (e. g. idiopathic intracranial hypertension); thus, making the differential diagnosis difficult. Neuroimaging is mandatory and necessary for a correct NBD diagnosis but in children radiological examinations are often difficult to perform without sedation. From 1971 to 2011, 130 patients aged ≤ 16 years have been reported with NBD, according to retrospective surveys, case series, and case reports. The origin of the reported cases met the well-known geographical distribution of Behçet’s disease (BD); the mean age at presentation of neurological findings was 11. 8 years, with male gender prevalence (ratio, 2. 9 : 1). We considered in detail the neuro-ophthalmological features of the 53 cases whose neuroimaging alterations were described with an assigned radiological pattern of the disease (parenchymal: 14 cases, non-parechymal: 35 cases, and mixed: 4 cases). In 19 / 53 patients (36 %), neuro-ophthalmological symptoms anticipated any pathognomonic sign for a BD diagnosis, or only occasional aphtae were recalled by the patients. Family history was positive in 17 % of subjects. Headache was reported in 75 % of the patients; in those presenting with cerebral vascular involvement, headache was combined to other symptoms of intracranial hypertension. Papilledema was the most frequently reported <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>finding,</b> followed by posterior uveitis. Treatment consisted of systemic steroids in 93 % of patients, often combined with other immunosuppressive drugs (especially colchicine and azathioprine). Clinical recovery or improvement was documented in {{the large majority of}} patients. Nine subjects had definitive alterations, and one died. Based on our review and personal experience, a delayed diagnosis, and the consequently delayed immunosuppressive treatment, may favour permanent sequelae, in particular, optic atrophy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To present ocular {{findings}} {{in a patient}} who showed negative scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) and reduced ON response, but normal dark adaptation. Case: A 18 -year-old Japanese male patient who complained of severe asthenopia. His corrected visual acuities were 1. 2 in both eyes. His fundi were normal. He had normal contrast sensitivity and normal dark adaptation. Methods: The patients underwent ERG (including the standard protocol and photopic long flash recordings). Results: The amplitudes of the rod ERG b-wave were reduced. The scotopic standard combined ERG response showed negative configuration. The photopic response to long flash revealed the reduced b-wave (ON response), while the amplitude of the first peak of the d-wave (OFF response) was within the normal range. Conclusions: Postsynaptic abnormalities in both the rod and cone ON-pathways, which are often found in patients with night blindness, were suggested in the ERG findings, but the dark adaptation of our patient was normal.

40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of {{dementia}} in the world. Patients with AD frequently complain of vision disturbances that do not manifest as changes in routine <b>ophthalmological</b> examination <b>findings.</b> The main causes of these disturbances are neuropathological changes in the visual cortex, although abnormalities in the retina and optic nerve cannot be excluded. Pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and pattern visual evoked potential (PVEP) tests are commonly used in ophthalmology to estimate bioelectrical function of the retina and optic nerve. The aim of this study was to determine whether retinal and optic nerve function, measured by PERG and PVEP tests, is changed in individuals in the early stages of AD with normal routine ophthalmological examination results. Standard PERG and PVEP tests were performed in 30 eyes of 30 patients with the early stages of AD. The results were compared to 30 eyes of 30 normal healthy controls. PERG and PVEP tests were recorded in accordance with the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standards. Additionally, neural conduction was measured using retinocortical time (RCT) —the difference between P 100 -wave latency in PVEP and P 50 -wave implicit time in PERG. In PERG test, PVEP test, and RCT, statistically significant changes were detected. In PERG examination, increased implicit time of P 50 -wave (P <  0. 03) and amplitudes reductions in P 50 - and N 95 -waves (P <  0. 0001) were observed. In PVEP examination, increased latency of P 100 -wave (P <  0. 0001) was found. A significant increase in RCT (P <  0. 0001) was observed. The most prevalent features were amplitude reduction in N 95 -wave and increased latency of P 100 -wave which were seen in 56. 7 % (17 / 30) of the AD eyes. In patients with the early stages of AD and normal routine ophthalmological examination results, dysfunction of the retinal ganglion cells as well as of the optic nerve is present, as detected by PERG and PVEP tests. These dysfunctions, at least partially, explain the cause of visual disturbances observed in patients with the early stages of AD...|$|R

Forty-two eyes with ultrasonographic biometry, PCI, and OLCR measurements performed in the same visit {{were included in the}} study. <b>Ophthalmological</b> and systemic <b>findings</b> of the patients, axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), intraocular lens (IOL) power calculations recommended for emetropy, and keratometry measurements (K 1, K 2) in all eyes, and deviations from target refraction in 20 eyes were noted. Results: The mean age of the patients was 68. 00 ± 13. 15 years; female/male ratio was 7 / 20. There were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} devices with respect to AL, K 2, and recommended IOL power measurements, whereas ACD measured by PCI was 0. 02 mm more shallow and K 1 values in PCI were 0. 27 D steeper (p= 0. 003 and p= 0. 037, respectively). There was a goodcorrelation between the measurements of the two devices (p< 0. 0001). Moreover, deviations from target refractions measured at 1 week and 1 month did not differ significantly between the two devices (p= 0. 152 and p= 0. 181, respectively). Conclusion: It is important to know the correlation and differences between measurements obtained by different biometry devices. In our study, as measurements of PCI and OLCR correlated well despite the negligible differences, we suggest that both methods can be used interchangeably.

40|$|ABSTRACTPatients (n = 36) {{diagnosed}} with pneumococcal endophthalmitis from six Spanish hospitals between 1986 and 2004 were studied retrospectively. The diagnosis {{was based on}} clinical <b>findings,</b> <b>ophthalmological</b> examination, and isolation of Streptococcus pneumoniae from vitreous and/or aqueous humours of 19 patients (definite diagnosis), and from other ocular specimens of 17 patients (probable diagnosis). The mean (± SD) age was 69. 3 (± 16. 5) years (range 1. 5 – 89 years), and 20 (55. 5 %) patients were male. The origin of endophthalmitis was considered exogenous for 34 (94. 5 %) patients. The most common predisposing factors were previous ocular surgery (n = 25, 69. 4 %), ocular trauma (n = 5, 13. 9 %), and close-to-eye radiotherapy (n = 3, 8. 3 %). Eleven (30. 5 %) patients underwent evisceration as the first therapeutic measure (primary evisceration), and evisceration was performed after antibiotic treatment failure (secondary evisceration) for six (16. 7 %) patients. Primary evisceration was performed more commonly (63. 6 %) during 1998 – 2004, while secondary evisceration was only performed during 1986 – 1997. Eighteen (50 %) patients received intra-vitreous antibiotics (mainly vancomycin), and 31 (86. 1 %) patients were given systemic antibiotic therapy. The most frequent pneumococcal serogroups isolated were 6, 19, 9, 15 and 23. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of 23 isolates revealed that four belonged to the international clones Spain 23 F- 1, Spain 6 B- 2, Spain 9 V- 3 and Sweden 15 A- 25.

However, the correlation between <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings</b> and disease staging remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the staging, acute ophthalmological manifestations, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of orbital complications of paranasal sinusitis during a 27 -year period. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients with orbital complications of paranasal sinusitis hospitalized at the National Cheng Kung University Hospital, a medical center in Taiwan during 1988 - 2015. Sex, age, symptoms, history, <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings,</b> laboratory and imaging findings, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed by staging. Eighty-three patients aged 9 days to 80 years had stage I (preseptal cellulitis, n = 39 patients), II (postseptal orbital cellulitis, n = 8), III (subperiosteal abscess, n = 16), IV (orbital abscess, n = 8), or V (intracranial involvement, n = 12) complications. Peak incidences occurred in patients aged 0 - 19 and 60 - 69 years. Chronic sinusitis and diabetes mellitus were common preexisting diseases. Extraocular movement limitation and proptosis predicted postseptal (stage II or more) involvement. The likelihood of elevated intraocular pressure increased with stage. Reduced visual acuity and presence of relative afferent pupillary defect indicated consideration of magnetic resonance imaging to investigate possible intracranial extension. Ipsilateral maxillary (81. 7 %) and ethmoidal (75. 6 %) sinuses were the most common sources of infection, and the most frequently implicated pathogens were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (25. 3 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (20. 5 %). All patients received intravenous antimicrobial therapy (multi-drug therapy in 88. 0 %), and 55. 4 % underwent surgery, most commonly endoscopic sinus surgery. One (1. 2 %) diabetic man with stage V complications died of fungal sinusitis with intracranial invasion. Five (6. 0 %) patients, all stage V, lost vision despite intensive treatment. The average length of hospital stay was 13. 8 days (range 2 - 72 days), and significantly longer stays were associated with stages II-V as compared to stage I. Orbital infection originating from paranasal sinusitis can cause vision loss and death due to intracranial extension. Acute <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings</b> predict staging and prognosis.

The aim of this prospective {{study was to examine}} cats suffering from systemic diseases for acute, pathological, <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings.</b> Cats that were presented to the Clinic for Small Animals, Freie Universität Berlin over a period of 36 months suffering certain systemic diseases or defined laboratory abnormalities were examined for ophthalmological changes. The inclusion criteria included evidence of anemia (hematocrit 180 mmHg), diabetes mellitus or feline malignant lymphoma. An extensive diagnostic evaluation of the underlying disease including clinical examination, laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging, blood pressure measurement and, where appropriate cytology and / or histopathology was carried out. Furthermore, an eye examination with slit - lamp biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, Schirmer – tear - test, fluorescein test, tonometry, and optionally a documentation by fundus photography were made. 80 cats with anemia, 45 cats with systemic hypertension, 28 cats with diabetes mellitus and nine cats with malignant lymphoma were included in the study. An assignment of the cats in more than one diagnostic group was possible. Anemic cats were evaluated for severity and cause of anemia. 29 cats had a mild anemia (hematocrit 0. 20 l / l to 0. 24 l / l), 30 cats a moderate anemia (hematocrit 0. 15 l / l – 0. 19 l / l) and 21 cats had a high degree of anemia (hematocrit < 0. 15 l / l). The cause of the anemia was acute blood loss in 31 cats, hemolysis in nine cats, an anemia of inflammatory disease (AID) in 15 cats, the cause was intramedullary induced in three cats and extramedullary induced in 12 cats. In 10 cats, the cause could not be determined. Overall, acute, pathological, ophthalmological changes were detected in 14 cats. A correlation was found between the severity of anemia and the occurrence of acute, pathological, <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings.</b> No correlation with the cause of the anemia could be demonstrated. Retinal bleeding was the main finding, but uveitis and retinal detachment were also seen. Of the 45 cats with systemic hypertension only six cats had any acute pathologic ophthalmologic changes. Acute pathologic ophthalmologic findings were unilateral in nine cats unilateral and bilateral in 30 cats. These included hyphema, iris hemorrhage, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal edema, retinal detachment, retinal hemorrhage, retinal degeneration, glaucoma and uveitis. There was no statistically significant difference in the level of systolic blood pressure in cats without, with unilateral and with bilateral, acute, pathological, <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings.</b> In cats with diabetes mellitus, chronic <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings</b> were also taken into account. A cataract was seen in seven of 28 cats, eight cats had a decreased - tear - test and retinal hemorrhages were found in two cats. Ocular abnormalities were found in eight of the nine cats with malignant lymphoma. Among the findings were protrusion of the nictitating membrane, exopthalmus, corneal defect, exposue keratopathy, Vitreitis, tortuous retinal vessels, uveitis, glaucoma, and subluxation of the lens. This study shows that ocular manifestations {{can be found in a}} majority of systemic diseases in cats. The eye examination should therefore be used as a diagnostic window. It can be a good tool to provide a systemic diagnosis, to initiate an appropriate therapy and also to give a prognosis...|$|E
40|$|Patient was {{followed}} {{up over the}} course of 30 years. In 1978, after severe systemic infection followed by fever, pulmonary edema, and numerous neurological manifestations, patient was differentially diagnosed with apoplectic form of multiple sclerosis (MS), which was confirmed a year later via neurological and MRI findings. Approximately 20 years following the initial attack, sarcoidosis was diagnosed during the regular preoperative procedures required for cataract surgery. As consequence of lower immune system, infectious granulomatosis in form of pulmonary tuberculosis developed. <b>Ophthalmological</b> <b>findings</b> revealed bilateral retrobulbar neuritis (RBN) approximately six years after initial attack. This developed into total uveitis with retinal periphlebitis and anterior granulomatous uveitis—all of which are clinically similar in both MS and sarcoidosis...|$|E
40|$|Duane&#x 2032;s {{retraction}} syndrome (DRS) includes {{changes in}} palpebral fissure width along with restriction of ocular motility. Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) includes presence of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) with obesity, mental retardation, polydactyly and renal abnormalities. We report {{a case of}} rare association of DRS with BBS in a seven-year-old child. The ocular motility examination revealed left DRS with esotropia. Fundus examination revealed findings characteristic of an atypical retinitis pigmentosa. The electro-retinogram waveforms were extinguished both for rods and cones. He was diagnosed as a case of BBS {{on the basis of}} the <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings</b> plus association with the systemic features of obesity, polydactyly, hypogonadism, mental retardation and renal abnormalities. This case gives further evidence of the fact that BBS may be associated with abnormalities of eye movements...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of {{cerebral malaria}} is poorly understood. Direct and indirect ophthalmoscope examinations of 141 Malawian children with strictly defined cerebral malaria revealed 2 distinct and prognostically significant findings: papilloedema and extramacular retinal oedema. The relative {{risk of death}} in patients with papilloedema was 6. 7 times that in patients without papilloedema. Extramacular retinal oedema {{was associated with a}} 2. 9 fold increase in the relative risk of dying. The mortality rate in patients with neither of these signs was only 1. 3 % compared to an overall mortality rate of 9. 2 %. The clinical and laboratory features associated with each of these <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings</b> were different, suggesting that there may be at least 2 different pathogenetic processes in patients with cerebral malaria...|$|E
40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the paper by Robins et al. (Archives, 1976, 51, 799) reporting a child with nephronophthisis and liver fibrosis. This observation reinforces the feeling that such association is not fortuitous, as we stated when publishing a similar case (Proesmans et al., 1975) shortly after the original description by Boichis et al. (1973). Our patient also had tapetoretinal degeneration, a condi-tion frequently found in children with nephronophthisis and generally {{referred to as the}} Senior syndrome. The <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings</b> in our patient have been described in detail in a separate paper (Stanescu et al., 1976), where we stressed the value of the electroretinogram (ERG) in diagnosing retinal diseases. Robins et al. state, 'There was no evidence of retinal changes in the present case'. We wonder if an ERG was performed. The author...|$|E
40|$|A 90 -day oral {{toxicity}} {{study of}} Î³-oryzanol, a rice-derived triterpenoid ferulate, {{was performed by}} oral gavage administration to male and female Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 0, 1000, and 2000 Â mg/kg body weight/day. All rats administered Î³-oryzanol survived throughout the study period. Both male and female rats showed no toxicologically significant changes of the general signs, examination findings, body weight, food consumption, functional observational battery results, <b>ophthalmological</b> <b>findings,</b> urinalysis, hematology tests, clinical chemistry tests, organ weights, and necropsy findings. Moreover, there were no histopathological changes related to administration of Î³-oryzanol in males and females from the 2000 Â mg/kg body weight/day group. In conclusion, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of Î³-oryzanol exceeded 2000 Â mg/kg body weight/day for {{both male and female}} rats under the conditions of this study.
