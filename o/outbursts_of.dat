5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary incontinence can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E
5|$|Cataclysmic or {{explosive}} {{variable stars}} {{are those that}} undergo {{a dramatic change in}} their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A binary star system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> moderate amplitude.|$|E

5|$|In 1534, Mary {{prepared}} {{a proposal for}} a defensive union of all the provinces in her councils. She made the proposal at the States General in Mechelen in July, citing her brother, who had requested the provinces assist each other. The plan had to be given up and, after Mary and Eleanor's failure to negotiate peace between the Empire and France, Mary's letters to Charles began to resemble the theatrical <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> their aunt Margaret.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the recall of the state militia, the mine owners closed the mines. Bowers arrested Calderwood, 18 other miners, and the mayor and town marshal of Altman (who had supported the miners). They were taken to Colorado Springs and quickly tried on several different charges, but found not guilty. Meanwhile, <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> violence, such as stone-throwing and fights between union miners and scabs, increased in frequency. Stores and warehouses were broken into, and guns and ammunition stolen.|$|E
5|$|Leo Phokas {{released}} the Byzantine prisoners after {{providing them with}} provisions, and took the booty and Arab prisoners back to Constantinople, where he celebrated a triumph at the Hippodrome. Indeed, the battle of Andrassos made a deep impression among contemporaries, provoking <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> celebration in the Empire, and grief and lamentation in the Syrian cities; it is mentioned by all historical sources of the time, and upheld in the contemporary Byzantine treatise De velitatione bellica {{as one of the}} chief examples of a successful ambush.|$|E

5|$|The 13th century saw popular <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> ecstatic piety {{in support}} of the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212. Large groups of young adults and children spontaneously gathered, believing their innocence would enable success where their elders had failed. Few, if any at all, journeyed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Though little reliable evidence survives for these events, they provide an indication of how hearts and minds could be engaged for the cause.|$|E
5|$|William I. McLaughlin {{proposed}} {{a new strategy}} {{in the search for}} extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in 1977. He suggested that widely observable events such as nova explosions might be used by intelligent extraterrestrials to synchronise the transmission and reception of their signals. This idea was tested by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in 1988, which used <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> Nova Cygni 1975 as the timer. Fifteen days of observation showed no anomalous radio signals coming from Epsilon Eridani.|$|E
5|$|At home, Bart {{comes up}} with a {{character}} called Angry Dad, based on the frequent angry <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> his father, Homer. Bart rolls out the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a hit with the kids in school. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site. He wants to make Angry Dad into an online animated cartoon series, and Bart agrees in exchange for stock. The cartoon becomes an Internet hit, becoming the single most popular non-pornographic website of all time. The only one still unaware of Angry Dad is Homer, who finds out one day at work. Once the humiliated Homer gets home, he finds Bart and strangles him. Marge and Lisa stops him and calms him down, and Homer agrees to suppress his anger from that point on.|$|E

5|$|Milk's {{continuing}} campaign, {{run from}} the storefront of Castro Camera, was a study in disorganization. Although the older Irish grandmothers and gay men who volunteered were plentiful and happy to send out mass mailings, Milk's notes and volunteer lists were kept on scrap papers. Any time the campaign required funds, the money came from the cash register without any consideration for accounting. The campaign manager's assistant was an 11-year-old neighborhood girl. Milk himself was hyperactive and prone to fantastic <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> temper, only to recover quickly and shout excitedly about something else. Many of his rants were directed at his lover, Scott Smith, who was becoming disillusioned {{with the man who}} was no longer the laid-back hippie he had fallen in love with.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they thought might be their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E

25|$|Ratzinger became {{emotional}} {{at certain}} parts of his homily, especially in reflection of the inability of Pope John Paul to speak {{in the last days}} of his life. Altogether, the homily was interrupted approximately ten times with <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> applause by the congregants.|$|E
25|$|Some alexithymic {{individuals}} {{may appear to}} contradict the above-mentioned characteristics because they can experience chronic dysphoria or manifest <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> crying or rage.

25|$|The Dreyfus {{affair of}} the late nineteenth century had {{consequences}} in the Arab world. Passionate <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> antisemitism in France were echoed in areas of French influence, especially Maronite Lebanon. The Muslim Arab press, however, was sympathetic to the falsely accused Captain Dreyfus, and criticized the persecution of Jews in France.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{and colleagues}} {{generally}} agree that Shockley {{was a poor}} manager and businessman. From early childhood he was prone to <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked aggression, which were suppressed due to the internal discipline of his past working environment. He also tended to see rivals, even in his own subordinates.|$|E
25|$|The girls {{complained of}} being pinched and pricked with pins. A doctor, {{historically}} {{assumed to be}} William Griggs, could find no physical evidence of any ailment. Other young women in the village began to exhibit similar behaviors. When Lawson preached as a guest in the Salem Village meetinghouse, he was interrupted several times by <b>outbursts</b> <b>of</b> the afflicted.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Holocaust, undisguised, racial hatred of Jews became unacceptable in British society. <b>Outbursts</b> <b>of</b> antisemitism emanating from far right groups continued however, leading to the formation of the 43 Group led by Jewish ex-servicemen which broke up fascist meetings. Far-right antisemitism was motivated principally by racial hatred, rather than theological hatred which accused Jews of killing Christ.|$|E
