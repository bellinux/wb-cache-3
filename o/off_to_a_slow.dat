5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|Speedie resurfaced in 1960, when he {{was named}} the end coach for the new American Football League's Houston Oilers under former {{teammate}} and Oilers head coach Lou Rymkus. The Oilers won the AFL championship in 1960, but Rymkus was fired after the team got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start the following year. Team owner Bud Adams urged Speedie {{to stay on the}} staff, but Speedie resigned out of loyalty to Rymkus.|$|E
5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the problem}} in {{evaluation}} is also the uncertainty of decline curve analysis from early data: shale gas wells can fall off sharply during the first year or two, then level <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> decline rate; the shape of the curve, and therefore the ultimate recovery, is difficult to predict from early production rates.|$|R

40|$|Australia did not {{participate}} in the large international genomics initiatives of the 1990 s, and chose not <b>to</b> establish <b>a</b> national molecular data facility {{along the lines of the}} DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), or the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). As a consequence, Australian bioinformatics got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> and less organized start than many other countries. The Australian Research Council (ARC) Center in Bioinformatics (ACB) has played a key role in many of these developments as the first nationally funded center for bioinformatics R&D in Australia...|$|R
5|$|The captive {{breeding}} program, {{led by the}} San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles Zoo, {{and with}} other participating zoos around the country, including the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden, got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start due to the condor's mating habits. However, utilizing the bird's ability to double clutch, biologists began removing the first egg from the nest and raising it with puppets, allowing the parents to lay another egg.|$|E
5|$|With a {{new head}} coach {{who is a}} first-time head coach, the 2011–12 Tigers got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start with a 1–5 record, but won 18 of its final 24 games and started its conference {{schedule}} with a 2–3 record, but won 8 of its final 9 games. Eventually, Princeton earned its first home win against a ranked opponent since the 1976–77 team's January 3, 1977 victory over Notre Dame by defeating Harvard (No. 21 Coaches/25 AP) on February 11, 2012. The win was also its first against a ranked opponent on any court since November 11, 1997, which is when the 1997–98 team opened its season with a victory over a ranked Texas team at Meadowlands Arena (now named Izod Center) in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Princeton also defeated eventual 2012 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament Champion Florida State five weeks after Harvard did. The team qualified for the 2012 CBI Tournament and earned a first round 95–86 victory over Evansville. In the subsequent game against Pittsburgh, Princeton lost 8261 to end the season.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Australian season, Poulton was {{selected}} for the ODI team the ICC Women's Quadrangular Series in Chennai, India. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in the round-robin phase. Poulton scored only 8 and 0 from 21 and 8 balls respectively as Australia lost their first two matches against New Zealand and India respectively. She was then dropped for the next two games. She was recalled for the penultimate round-robin match against England but did not bat in a six-wicket win, and then made 27 as Australia defeated India by four wickets in the last match. The Australians needed 231 for victory—4.62 runs per over—and Poulton got their innings <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start, taking 75 balls to accumulate her runs, scoring at {{less than half of the}} required rate. However, her teammates sped up and reached the target from the last ball of the match to qualify for the final against New Zealand. Australia won by six wickets with the dropped Poulton watching from the sidelines. She ended the series with 35 runs at 11.66 with a strike rate of only 33.65, was then overlooked for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand held in Darwin in July.|$|E

5000|$|The Chamber got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> initial <b>slow</b> {{start with}} its primary {{supporters}} focusing {{most of their}} efforts on tariff policy lobbying, especially in setting up a [...] "Protection Union", in direct opposition to the [...] "Free Traders" [...] led by Sir Henry Parkes.|$|R
5|$|The Browns next {{beat the}} Los Angeles Dons 31–14 in Cleveland {{to extend their}} winning streak to seven games. The crowd of 71,134 people who {{attended}} the game on a sunny October day was a professional football record. Cleveland got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start, falling behind 7–3 at halftime. The Browns' only score {{in the first half}} came on a 49-yard Lou Groza field goal, then the fourth-longest kick in professional football history. A flurry of scoring {{at the end of the}} third quarter and in the fourth quarter, however, won Cleveland the game. Otto Graham passed 36 yards to end Dante Lavelli and then ran in a touchdown with less than three minutes left in the third. It was the first of four touchdowns in 14 minutes of play. Fullback Marion Motley ran in two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, one of them a 68-yard run that tied an AAFC record for a rush from scrimmage. The Browns won despite a strong ground attack by the Dons, who gained 274 yards of rushing. The Dons had 21 first downs compared to Cleveland's 10. Groza made all of his extra point attempts, extending his streak to 22 in a row.|$|E
25|$|Tampa Bay got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> {{start as}} Kansas City took the opening drive 69 {{yards for a}} touchdown.

50|$|As {{it turned}} out, Zuvella got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{extremely}} <b>slow</b> {{start with the}} Yankees, going hitless in his first 28 at bats.

25|$|Going into spring {{training}} in , newly acquired Kevin Kouzmanoff was slated {{for the job}} at third base. This left Branyan as a bench player going into the season. Branyan addressed the issues stating that {{he just wanted to}} play, no matter the circumstances. However, Branyan was seen as a good option if Kouzmanoff failed to produce at third base and at the plate. He got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start out of {{spring training}}.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals {{would get}} <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start as coach Al Cervi was fired and {{replaced}} by Paul Seymour. Under Seymour the Nats would rebound and finish the 1956–57 season in second place {{with a record of}} 38–34. In the playoffs the Nats would have trouble knocking off the defending champion Philadelphia Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with 2 straight wins. However, the Nats would be swept in 3 straight games by the eventual champions, the Boston Celtics.|$|E
25|$|América got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> {{start in}} the Colombian tournament, not {{achieving}} even the runner-up position until 1960 and not playing its first Copa Libertadores until 1969. The team, however, went through a radical change in 1979, hiring Gabriel Ochoa Uribe as its coach. During the 12 years Gabriel Ochoa Uribe worked {{as coach of the}} team, América obtained its first seven National Cups and rapidly created an immense diversity of fans that cheered it around the country. During these years, América finished second place in the Copa Libertadores consecutively in 1985 to 1987.|$|E

50|$|The Cortina {{went on sale}} on 23 October 1970, but sales got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{particularly}} <b>slow</b> start {{because of}} production difficulties that culminated with a ten-week strike at Ford's plant between April and June 1971, which {{was at the time}} reported to have cost production of 100,000 vehicles, equivalent <b>to</b> almost <b>a</b> quarter of the output for a full year.|$|R
25|$|Bopara {{made just}} {{three in the}} first ODI in New Zealand. He made 23 in the next match, but did not bowl in either matches.

The Magic outscored the Lakers in the 3rd quarter to take a 2-point lead in the 4th.|$|E
25|$|The tournament got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> {{start for}} the Kings XI Punjab, with the team losing their first two games. However, 94 runs by Kumar Sangakkara helped them to take game 3. Despite the absence of Brett Lee and Simon Katich (who were {{committed}} to tour the West Indies with Australia), the team found its groove. Powered by their balanced bowling lineup and effective top order, the team won 9 of its next 10 matches, clinching a berth in the semi-final, where their run in the tournament {{came to an end}} with a comprehensive 9-wicket loss to the Chennai Super Kings.|$|E
2500|$|The 1990s saw {{continued}} overseas success from {{groups such}} as AC/DC, INXS, Men at Work, Midnight Oil, The Bad Seeds, and a new indie rock scene started to develop locally. Sydney-based Ratcat were the first new band <b>to</b> achieve <b>a</b> mainstream following, while bands such as the Hoodoo Gurus got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> start; their debut album Stoneage Romeos earned a small following but failed <b>to</b> captivate <b>a</b> mainstream {{that at the time}} [...] "didn't get it". Later reviews would describe the band as [...] "integral to the story of Aussie indie music", influencing bands including Frenzal Rhomb and Jet. The band would go on <b>to</b> become <b>an</b> ARIA Hall of Fame inductee. The Church, meanwhile, was highly successful in the 1980s, only to see their careers diminish in the next decade; 1994's Sometime Anywhere saw the band recede from a mainstream audience.|$|R

25|$|Brooks got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> start, {{completing}} {{just one}} pass for two {{yards in the}} first quarter, but he heated up {{in the second and}} third periods, engineering one first-half touchdown drive and throwing two scoring passes in the third quarter. By the end of the game, he had a strange mix of numbers, completing just nine of 25 passes for 155 yards but throwing two touchdowns and no picks. Added to his two-touchdown day in a season-opening, 26–20, overtime Saints win in Tampa, Brooks has four TD passes against Tampa Bay this season; the rest of the league has three in 10 games.|$|E

25|$|Chennai's run-chase got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> {{start as}} Smith was {{struggling}} to time the ball. Mitchell McClenaghan dismissed Michael Hussey in the fifth over for 4. Suresh Raina then arrived at the crease and Smith started to score boundaries. Their partnership had reached 66 runs and was broken when Harbhajan Singh dismissed Smith for 57 in the 12th over. Harbhajan got the wicket Raina in his next over, after which Chennai lost a wicket in each of their following five overs with the required run rate increasing after every over. McClenaghan and Lasith Malinga bowled economically in each of their four overs and had figures of 3 for 25 and 2 for 25 respectively. Ravindra Jadeja and Mohit Sharma added 24 runs for the ninth wicket but their 20 overs ended 41 runs short of the target.|$|E
