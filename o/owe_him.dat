5|$|He {{was a most}} {{delightful}} man, {{a bizarre}} hidalgo with enormous moustachios, a flat-brimmed sombrero in the purest Spanish style, and button boots which he used to rap my shins when I didn't change the pedalling enough.... I admired him madly, because, at this time, in 1914, {{he was the only}} virtuoso who played Debussy and Ravel. That meeting with Viñes was paramount in my life: I <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> everything... In reality it is to Viñes that I owe my fledgling efforts in music and everything I know about the piano.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} two weeks since Sheriff Graham's (Jamie Dornan) death, and the {{citizens}} of Storybrooke continue to mourn. Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) convinces Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) {{she ought to be}} sheriff, but Regina (Lana Parrilla) has already appointed Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito) for the job. Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) suspects Regina is responsible for Graham's death and starts to believe good cannot defeat evil because good plays by the rules. Gold offers Emma his support and reveals to her the town charter which states the Mayor can only choose a candidate for Sheriff and therefore an election must be held. Emma decides to run, so Regina declares Sidney Glass will as well. Henry becomes worried when he finds out Gold is Emma's benefactor, considering how dangerous it is to <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> one favor, let alone two. Regina is furious that Gold would work against her.|$|E
25|$|On September 10, the 49ers placed Smith {{on injured reserve}} after Dr. James Andrews {{confirmed}} the team's diagnosis of a broken bone in his shoulder, {{believed to have been}} caused by a wire left in his shoulder from the previous surgery, which had sawed through the bone. Regardless, the 49ers' general manager, Scot McCloughan, said that the 49ers expected to release Smith before the 2009 season, when they would <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> a salary of $9,625,000.|$|E

25|$|William Hawi {{created a}} “Military Police” {{in charge of}} {{controlling}} the disorder and chaos that were everywhere and introduced a regulatory mechanism to guarantee road safety and guide the citizens to these safe roads. Perhaps the most terrible ordeal he had to face was that famous massacre on December 6, 1975, that was later called the “Black Saturday” where he was also subjected to menaces and humiliation {{when he tried to}} rescue as many innocents as he could. Several persons <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> their lives, their dignity and their properties.|$|E
25|$|Essie then {{brings a}} letter to Grandpa that's from the {{government}}. Grandpa had lied to the government {{that he was actually}} Martin Vanderhof Jr., and that the Martin Vanderhof the government was looking for was his father. This is confirmed because the family had buried the deceased milkman who had lived with them prior to De Pinna under Grandpa's name, since they never knew the milkman's real name. Grandpa's trick works, as the government tells him that they now <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> a refund, instead of him owing them taxes.|$|E

500|$|Although Kertész rarely {{received}} bad reviews, it was {{the lack}} of commentary that lead to the photographer feeling distant from recognition. Now, however, he is often considered to be the father of photojournalism. Even other photographers cite Kertész and his photographs as being inspirational; Henri Cartier-Bresson once said of him in the early 1930s, [...] "We all <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> a great deal." [...] When he was 90 years old, a person asked him why he was still taking photographs. He replied, [...] "I'm still hungry." ...|$|E
500|$|Boycott was {{involved}} in a number of disputes while on Achill. Two years after his arrival, he was unsuccessfully sued for assault by Thomas Clarke, a local man. Clarke said that he had gone to Boycott's house because Boycott owed him money. He said that he had asked for repayment of the debt, and that Boycott had refused to pay him and told him to go away, which Clarke refused to do. Clarke alleged that Boycott approached him and said: [...] "If you do not be off, I will make you." [...] Clarke later withdrew his allegations, and said that Boycott did not actually <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> any money.|$|E

Mr. Gold then offers a deal for Emma in which he'll give up his questionable claim to the child and in return, Emma will <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> a favor. Emma agrees. After she leaves, Sean shows up to see his child, and they name the girl Alexandra. Later, Emma agrees to Graham's offer to become his deputy. While on the phone, it is revealed that the sheriff had just gotten out of the shower at his home, just moments after he had a presumed sexual tryst with Regina.|$|E

500|$|Clinton was {{defeated}} by Donald Trump in the November 8, 2016 presidential election. By {{the early morning hours}} of November 9, Trump had received 279 projected electoral college votes, with 270 needed to win and media sources proclaimed him the winner. Clinton then phoned Trump to concede and to congratulate him on his victory, whereupon Trump gave a victory speech. The next morning Clinton made a public concession speech in which she acknowledged the pain of her loss, but called on her supporters to accept Trump as president, saying [...] "We <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> an open mind and a chance to lead." [...] Though Clinton lost the election by only capturing 232 electors to Trump's 306, a month after the election the popular vote count showed her leading by more than 2.7 million votes, with many votes yet to be counted. She is the fifth presidential candidate in U.S. history to win the popular vote but lose the election.|$|E
500|$|Randolph's writ of quo warranto {{required}} {{a response from}} Massachusetts {{by the end of}} [...] "Michaelmas term." [...] Empty-handed, Randolph and his brother boarded a pink bound for England on December 14. [...] A few days later, Phips began making preparations but was detained by problems with the Boston government and the ongoing search for victuals. [...] In a discussion with Phips, Knepp allows, as a purser, that many of the crew <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> money, and says that he would have them thrown into jail except that it would hinder His Majesties treasure hunt. Phips finally sailed clear of the Boston Harbor on January 19, 1684 but unfortunately not before some of his rogue-ish crew could cause a small riot in Boston and perpetrate a despicable assault in Hull, according to Knepp. [...] Knepp was not on board, meaning he had effectively deserted according to the Articles, [...] "though I should be almost undone by it" [...] and so it became all the more important for Knepp to show Phips in a bad light.|$|E
500|$|Sylvester was openly gay, with Gamson {{noting that}} he tended to enter into {{relationships}} with men who were [...] "white, self-doubting and effeminate." [...] In 1978, he entered into {{a relationship with a}} young white model named John Maley; Sylvester later devoted the song [...] "Can't Forget the Love" [...] from his Too Hot to Sleep album to his young lover. Maley ended the relationship to move to Los Angeles, later recollecting that Sylvester [...] "was a lovely man, and I <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> a lot." [...] In 1981, Sylvester entered into a relationship with a slim brunette from Deep River, Connecticut named Michael Rayner, but unlike his predecessors, he did not move into Sylvester's house; their partnership ended when Rayner admitted that he had not fallen completely in love with Sylvester. Sylvester's next major relationship was with Tom Daniels, a hairdresser whom he met in 1982, but their romance ended after six months when Daniels discovered that Sylvester had been having sex with other men while on tour. The singer's final partner, the architect Rick Cranmer, was a six-foot two blonde, and the duo moved into a house together in the hills. Cranmer died of AIDS-related complications in 1987, the year before Sylvester succumbed to the virus.|$|E

500|$|As A Short History of Film notes, A Trip to the Moon {{combined}} [...] "spectacle, sensation, {{and technical}} wizardry {{to create a}} cosmic fantasy that was an international sensation." [...] It was profoundly influential on later filmmakers, bringing creativity to the cinematic medium and offering fantasy for pure entertainment, a rare goal in film at the time. In addition, Méliès's innovative editing and special effects techniques were widely imitated and became important elements of the medium. The film also spurred {{on the development of}} cinematic science fiction and fantasy by demonstrating that scientific themes worked on the screen and that reality could be transformed by the camera. In a 1940 interview, Edwin S. Porter said that it was by seeing A Trip to the Moon and other Méliès films that he [...] "came to the conclusion that a picture telling a story might draw the customers back to the theatres, and set to work in this direction." [...] Similarly, D. W. Griffith said simply of Méliès: [...] "I <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> everything." [...] Since these American directors are widely credited with developing modern film narrative technique, the literary and film scholar Edward Wagenknecht once summed up Méliès's importance to film history by commenting that Méliès [...] "profoundly influenced both Porter and Griffith and through them the whole course of American film-making." ...|$|E
500|$|Armitage {{believes}} {{that when it}} is Lucas's turn to leave the series, he would [...] "leave in style," [...] and has no preference how he would exit, whether [...] "sending Lucas to Manchester or severing his head," [...] he believes the producers would <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> a [...] "brilliant exit." [...] In an interview with Lorraine Kelly on GMTV on May 2010, Armitage revealed that in the ninth series, [...] " [...] is not who you thought he was. He's not who I thought he was." [...] He admitted to being surprised at the development while reading the script. With the series theme being [...] "deception", Armitage felt that playing another side of Lucas was [...] "interesting," [...] "quite exciting to play" [...] and like [...] "working in reverse because we've already established his background and then we've {{had to go and}} establish a much deeper background." [...] Writers Jonathan Brackley and Sam Vincent (both head writers of the ninth series, having written five of the episodes) made the decision about Lucas' story-arc in the series during the initial meetings with the producers. Throughout the process of developing Lucas' arc, they worked through [...] "a bazillion different versions." [...] For example, in the series finale, they considered that Lucas would release the Albany weapon on the Grid. Both writers admitted that they were [...] "not-half" [...] concerned with possible negative reactions from fans of both Armitage and the character. In September 2011, co-star Peter Firth confirmed Lucas was killed off in the ninth series finale. He stated that the character [...] "was always going to die." [...] At some point the producers considered having Harry shoot him {{at the top of the}} building where he would fall to his death. However, this changed to have Lucas just jumping off the building instead.|$|E
2500|$|Hansen {{resigned}} his Senate seat on December 31, 1978, {{three days}} before the expiration of his term to give a slight seniority edge to his moderate Republican successor Alan Kooi Simpson of Cody, brother of Peter Simpson and son of conservative Milward Simpson, Hansen's U.S. Senate predecessor. Alan Simpson would later become the Senate Republican whip. At the Hansen funeral, Alan Simpson paid tribute, accordingly: [...] "I <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> much. All of Wyoming and the nation <b>owe</b> <b>him</b> much[...] [...] [...] He was a dear and special man who gave much and asked very little, and fought on always with integrity, courage, and an uncommon degree of common sense.
