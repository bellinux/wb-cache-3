500|$|As governor, Clements {{enjoyed a}} three-to-one Democratic {{majority}} {{in both houses}} of the state legislature. As a result, much of his proposed legislative agenda was passed. In the 1948 legislative session, the General Assembly attracted new businesses by lowering taxes <b>on</b> <b>stocks</b> and bonds and the inheritance tax, but offset these cuts by approving Clements' proposals to increase taxes on gasoline and distilled spirits. Clements also reversed his campaign stance against a tax on parimutuel betting, reportedly proposing a three percent tax because he feared a higher rate would be proposed if he did not take the initiative. With this new revenue, Clements authorized $6million to improve and expand the state park system. The improvement program included twelve large parks and several smaller ones, with Kentucky Dam Park being the centerpiece. To oversee the developments, he appointed Henry Ward as commissioner of conservation. Between 1948 and 1950, New York was the only state that spent more than Kentucky on its park system. Clements was one of several people who have been referred to as the [...] "father of Kentucky's state parks". Although the park system was started in 1926 by Willard Rouse Jillson, Clements did much to develop them during his administration.|$|E

O'er pathless rocks, [...] Through beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets, [...] 15 [...] Forcing my way, I came to one dear nook [8] [...] Unvisited, where not a broken bough [...] Drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign [...] Of devastation; but the hazels rose [...] Tall and erect, with tempting clusters [9] hung, [...] 20 [...] A virgin scene!--A little while I stood, [...] Breathing with such suppression of the heart [...] As joy delights in; and, with wise restraint [...] Voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed [...] The banquet;--or beneath the trees I sate [...] 25 [...] Among the flowers, and with the flowers I played; [...] A temper known to those, who, after long [...] And weary expectation, have been blest [...] With sudden happiness beyond all hope. [...] Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves [...] 30 [...] The violets of five seasons re-appear [...] And fade, unseen by any human eye; [...] Where fairy water-breaks do murmur on [...] For ever; and I saw the sparkling foam, [...] And--with my cheek {{on one of those}} green stones [...] 35 [...] That, fleeced with moss, under [10] the shady trees, [...] Lay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep-- [...] I heard the murmur and the murmuring sound, [...] In that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay [...] Tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure, [...] 40 [...] The heart luxuriates with indifferent things, [...] Wasting its kindliness <b>on</b> <b>stocks</b> and stones, [...] And on the vacant air. Then up I rose, [...] And dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crash [...] And merciless ravage: and the shady nook [...] 45 [...] Of hazels, and the green and mossy bower, [...] Deformed and sullied, patiently gave up [...] Their quiet being: and, unless I now [...] Confound my present feelings with the past; [...] Ere from the mutilated bower I turned [11] [...] 50 [...] Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings, [...] I felt a sense of pain when I beheld [...] The silent trees, and saw the intruding sky.--[12] [...] Then, dearest Maiden, move along these shades [...] In gentleness of heart; with gentle hand [...] 55 [...] Touch--for there is a spirit in the woods.|$|E
