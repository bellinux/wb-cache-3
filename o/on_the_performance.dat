5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced runway length has a severe impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In Research Infosource's 2011 {{ranking of}} Canada's 50 top {{research}} universities, Queen's ranked 11th, with sponsored research income of $197.016 million. With {{an average of}} $237,900 per faculty member, Queen's ranked Canada's sixth most research-intensive university. The federal government is the largest funding source, providing 49.8 percent of Queen's research budget, primarily through grants. Corporations contribute another 26.3 percent of the research budget. In terms of research performance, High Impact Universities 2010 ranked Queen's 185th out of 500 universities. The Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT), an organization which evaluates universities based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of scientific papers, ranked Queen's 272nd.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of National Education is {{responsible}} for pre-tertiary education. This is compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, {{middle school and high}} school. Less than half of 25- to 34-year-old Turks have completed at least high school, compared with an OECD average of over 80 percent. Basic education in Turkey is considered to lag behind other OECD countries, with significant differences between high and low performers. Turkey is ranked 32nd out of 34 in the OECD's PISA study. Access to high-quality school heavily depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> in the secondary school entrance exams, to the point that some students begin taking private tutoring classes when they are 10 years old. The overall adult literacy rate in 2011 was 94.1 percent; 97.9 percent for males and 90.3 percent for females.|$|E
