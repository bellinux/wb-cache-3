Impact Time is disabled in multiplayer and the gameplay is some modes is tweaked. Single Race {{is analogous to the}} single-player version except AI drivers are replaced with other players. Online Road Rage functions differently to the <b>offline</b> <b>mode.</b> The online version is a team-based mode that supports up six players and the objective is to destroy the rival team's cars before a certain number of miles have been driven. The remaining three modes are variations on the Crash mode that can be played online and locally. Team Crush and Double Impact are both two-player modes where both players causes pileups on a Crash junction simultaneously.

25|$|EA came {{furthermore}} under fire, as {{the game}} as released in 2013 required an internet connection to even play the singleplayer mode; however, reports surfaced that the internet connection requirement could be easily removed. According to a blog post in October 2013 by Maxis Emeryville General Manager, Patrick Buechner, the team was considering an <b>offline</b> <b>mode,</b> which would allow for mod support. An <b>offline</b> <b>mode</b> for SimCity was subsequently made available by EA in March 2014.|$|E

5000|$|While most games {{remained}} playable {{in their}} <b>offline</b> <b>modes,</b> the PlayStation 3 {{was unable to}} play certain Capcom titles in any form. Streaming video providers throughout different regions such as Hulu, Vudu, Netflix and LoveFilm displayed the same maintenance message. Some users claimed {{to be able to}} use Netflix's streaming service [...] but others were unable.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} console {{version of}} the game included an <b>offline</b> multiplayer <b>mode.</b> The <b>offline</b> multiplayer <b>mode</b> featured up to 30 minute deathmatch rounds in which 1 - 4 players could fight against each other as well as AI characters. However, this feature was not included on the PC {{version of the}} game as well as versions available on newer consoles such as PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4.|$|R
25|$|The Offline Files feature, which {{maintains}} a client-side cache of files shared over a network, has been significantly improved. When synchronizing {{the changes in}} the cached copy to the remote version, the Bitmap Differential Transfer protocol is used so that only the changed blocks in the cached version are transferred, but when retrieving changes from the remote copy, the entire file is downloaded. are synchronized on a per-share basis and encrypted on a per-user basis and users can force Windows to work in <b>offline</b> <b>mode</b> or online mode or sync manually from the Sync Center. The Sync Center can also report sync errors and resolve sync conflicts. Also, if network connectivity is restored, file handles are redirected to the remote share transparently.|$|E
500|$|Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{includes}} several game modes from the original, including Arcade Mode, where the player fights against AI-controlled opponents {{to reach the}} final boss character, Galactus; Versus Mode, where two players engage in combat; Mission Mode, which includes a series of trials for each playable character; and Training Mode.

500|$|In {{accordance}} with its Acceptable Use Policy, Valve retains {{the right to}} block and unblock customers' access to their games and Steam services when Valve's Anti-Cheat (VAC) software determines that the user is cheating in multiplayer games, selling accounts to others or trading games to exploit regional price differences. Blocking such users initially removed access {{to his or her}} other games, leading to some users with high-value accounts losing access because of minor infractions of the AUP. Valve later changed its policy to be similar to that of Electronic Arts' Origin platform, in which blocked users can still access their games but are heavily restricted, limited to playing in <b>offline</b> <b>mode</b> and unable to participate in Steam Community features. Customers also lose access to their games and Steam account if they refuse to accept changes to Steam's end user license agreements; this occurred in August 2012. In April 2015, Valve added Game Bans to its service, allowing developers to set bans on players for their games but enacted and enforced at the Steam level, allowing developers to police their own gaming communities in customizable manner.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom 3 {{features}} various <b>offline</b> game <b>modes,</b> such as Arcade Mode, {{where the}} player fights against AI-controlled opponents {{to reach the}} final boss character, Galactus, a supervillain from Marvel Comics' Fantastic Four series.

This means that offensive words are not allowed, in both online and <b>offline</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Resistance: Fall Of Man also {{features}} an <b>offline</b> co-operative <b>mode</b> that allows players to play through the campaign mode with a friend.|$|R
500|$|Players {{may create}} their {{characters}} {{based on a}} number of preset body shapes and color schemes and may choose a class (such as Wavemaster or Twin Blade) and character name. In online mode, players may enter a lobby and search for a maximum of two other players to join them on an adventure. The game includes an expanded communication interface that allows players to chat, send e-mail, post to an in-game Bulletin Board System, and receive server news updates. It is possible to establish ad-hoc chat rooms separate from the public-access ones. Guilds are permanent, exclusive chat rooms for members. In <b>offline</b> <b>mode,</b> players may level up, obtain items, and learn new skills as one of their online mode characters without the need for an Internet connection. Players may invite characters from the [...]hack games, [...]hack//Sign, and [...]hack//Legend of the Twilight into their party. The [...] "story mode" [...] of [...]hack//fr√§gment is identical to that of the [...]hack games, with the player's created character replacing Kite. While offline, players may use a PC utility called [...] "HackServer" [...] to create areas and dungeons and release them online. The creators of the most popular areas are given the ability to add strong monsters for players to defeat.|$|E
500|$|Prior to 2009, most games {{released}} on Steam had traditional anti-piracy measures, including the assignment {{and distribution of}} product keys and support for digital rights management software tools such as SecuROM or non-malicious rootkits. With an update to the Steamworks SDK in March 2009, Valve added its [...] "Custom Executable Generation" [...] (CEG) approach into the Steamworks SDK that removed the need for these other measures. The CEG technology creates a unique, encrypted copy of the game's executable files for the given user which allows them to install it multiple times and on multiple devices, and make backup copies of their software. Once the software is downloaded and installed, the user must then authenticate through Steam to de-encrypt the executable files to play the game. Normally this is done while connected to the Internet following the user's credential validation, but once they have logged into Steam once, a user can instruct Steam to launch in a special <b>offline</b> <b>mode</b> {{to be able to}} play their games without a network connection. Developers are not limited to Steam's CEG and may include other forms of DRM and other authentication services than Steam; for example, some titles from publisher Ubisoft require the use of their UPlay gaming service, and prior to its shutdown in 2014, some other titles required Games for Windows‚Äì Live, though many of these titles have since transitioned to using the Steamworks CEG approach.|$|E
2500|$|The PC {{version of}} Assassin's Creed: Revelations does not force players {{to always be}} online to work like its predecessors, despite Ubisoft's recent claims that its policy is a success, insisting it has seen [...] "a clear {{reduction}} in piracy of our titles which required a persistent online connection". Even then, the always-online DRM was permanently removed from all single-player games. It does, however, require a one-time-only online activation {{the very first time}} the player plays the game, which will permanently bind the activation code to the player's account, and thus, it {{does not need to be}} activated again on the same account if the game is reinstalled for some reason. This also applies to reinstalling on another computer. Following that, the player can permanently play the game in <b>offline</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} tuning of {{the finite}} prediction horizon of soft-constrained model predictive control. The findings {{presented in this}} paper prove that there exists a finite horizon such that the infinite horizon soft-constrained model predictive control problem can be solved as a finite horizon soft-constrained model predictive control problem. Algorithms are proposed to compute the upper-bound of the prediction horizon in online and <b>offline</b> <b>modes.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by illustrative example...|$|R
50|$|In September 2016, the {{developers}} added an online multiplayer feature (in {{addition to the}} standard <b>offline</b> <b>modes),</b> allowing players {{to hook up with}} opponents over the internet and play a variety of games, including 8-ball, 9-ball, 6-ball, snooker and killer. Winning matches increases the player's 'reputation score', and when sufficient points have been gained the multiplayer trophy is awarded. The new mode also incorporates an in-game chat facility, as well as allowing communication between players in the lobby.|$|R
50|$|Users perform {{significant}} {{additional work}} {{outside of the}} formal processes {{of a line of}} business (LOB) system as they collaborate with other people via phone and email, obtain information from multiple sources in the form of documents and spreadsheets, and switch between online and <b>offline</b> <b>modes</b> for meetings and business trips. Applications and documents can be extended to add enterprise-specific features, and LOB systems can be integrated with Microsoft Office to make the LOB system more accessible.|$|R
