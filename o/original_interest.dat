5|$|Another flaw {{with both}} Wilberforce's and Millett's {{explanations}} {{is that if}} the interest is retained by the lender from the outset of the contract, it is not a resulting trust at all; the complete transfer of money should end the lender's equitable interest. It could be argued that the creation of a Quistclose trust is not based on the recovery of the <b>original</b> <b>interest,</b> but {{the creation of a new}} one. Doubts have also been raised about the Twinsectra case in general, in that the facts of the case did not create a stereotypical Quistclose trust; this causes problems with applying Millett's analysis.|$|E

25|$|Braun and Gearhart {{note that}} {{although}} unions do {{participate in the}} structure of a number of these agreements, their <b>original</b> <b>interest</b> in codes of conduct differed from the interests of human rights and other non-governmental activists. Unions believed that codes of conduct would be important first steps in creating written principles that a company would be compelled to comply with in later organizing contracts, but did not foresee the establishment of monitoring systems such as the Fair Labor Association.

25|$|By 1968, {{the attempt}} to defend the dollar at a fixed peg of $35/ounce, {{the policy of the}} Eisenhower, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, had become {{increasingly}} untenable. Gold outflows from the U.S. accelerated, and despite gaining assurances from Germany and other nations to hold gold, the unbalanced fiscal spending of the Johnson administration had transformed the dollar shortage of the 1940s and 1950s into a dollar glut by the 1960s. In 1967, the IMF agreed in Rio de Janeiro to replace the tranche division set up in 1946. Special drawing rights (SDRs) were set as equal to one U.S. dollar, but were not usable for transactions other than between banks and the IMF. Nations were required to accept holding SDRs equal to three times their allotment, and interest would be charged, or credited, to each nation based on their SDR holding. The <b>original</b> <b>interest</b> rate was 1.5%.|$|E
25|$|As {{this is all}} happening, Greenlee and Leo's {{feelings}} for each other continue to deepen and they finally admit that they have {{fallen in love with}} each other. The road to romance starts out rocky, with the two of them ending up in many misunderstandings. During one of Greenlee's attempts to win him back after a fight, Greenlee and Leo inadvertently learn that Leo's friend, Bianca Montgomery is a lesbian. Greenlee promptly nicknames the young woman LesBianca. Jealous of his friendships with Bianca and Laura English, a drugged Greenlee pushes Laura off a yacht, while a horrified Bianca looks on. In order to silence her, Greenlee threatens to tell Bianca's mother, Erica Kane, that Bianca is gay. Greenlee later makes good on her threat and publicly outs Bianca. Leo finds out and ends his relationship with Greenlee, although the two eventually reconcile. When Greenlee proposes to Leo, he accepts, though he is worried that she will find out that his <b>original</b> <b>interest</b> in her was to steal her trust fund. Although he no longer cares about the money and is truly in love with her, Greenlee feels too betrayed to believe Leo when she learns the truth and breaks up with him.|$|E
500|$|The single-reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on December 27, 1910. The film likely had a wide national release, theaters {{are known to have}} shown the film in Pennsylvania, Kansas, Indiana, and South Dakota. The film received positive reviews from trade publications including The Moving Picture World, which praised the acting and the execution of the film as an education for audiences by exposing them to literary masterpieces. The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer was less enthusiastic, writing that [...] "The production gave a very praiseworthy portrayal of the period, but a moving picture needs such different treatment from a novel that its interpretation in a picture is bound to lose much of the <b>original</b> <b>interest.</b> The acting was in every way adequate, although not great." ...|$|E

Zaffis became interested in demonology at a young age, which led into his involvement with cases of spirit possession and exorcism and working with prominent exorcists in that field. He has studied the work of Roman Catholic priests, monks, Buddhists, rabbis, and Protestant ministers.

[...] He has written {{extensively}} on Yell in the book Among Islands (1994), which contains subject matter ranging from St Kilda and the Hebrides to Shetland. He says his <b>original</b> <b>interest</b> in islands sprung from seeing Inchcape out in the distance, as a teenager. He worked for over twenty years in various newspapers, usually writing about Scottish wildlife and landscapes; his later work has included a number of books on the Scottish islands, and mountains, often including his own photographs.|$|E

6000|$|A {{man will}} be given a book, and when the donor's back is turned, will {{carelessly}} drop it in the first corner; he is not over-anxious to be bothered with the book. But now personally point out to him the author, and ten to one he goes back to the corner, picks up the book, dusts the cover, and very carefully reads that invaluable work. One does not vitally believe in a man till one's own two eyes have beheld him. If then, by the force of peculiar circumstances, Pierre while in the stage, had formerly been drawn into an attentive perusal of the work on [...] "Chronometricals and Horologicals;" [...] how then was his <b>original</b> <b>interest</b> heightened by catching a subsequent glimpse of the author. But at the first reading, not being able--as he thought--to master the pivot-idea of the pamphlet; and as every incomprehended idea is not only a perplexity but a taunting reproach to one's mind, Pierre had at last ceased studying it altogether; nor consciously troubled himself further about it during the remainder of the journey. But still thinking now it might possibly have been mechanically retained by him, he searched all the pockets of his clothes, but without success. He begged Millthorpe to do his best toward procuring him another copy; but it proved impossible to find one. Plotinus himself could not furnish it.|$|E
5000|$|Hawkins' <b>original</b> <b>interests</b> were as a poet, {{which he}} {{addressed}} {{in the summer of}} 1963, through attending an intensive writing course for aspiring poets offered by the English department of the University of British Columbia. The course became known as the Vancouver 1963 Poetry Conference, which took place over three weeks in July and August, and involved approximately sixty attendees. The course, designed by Warren Tallman and Robert Creeley, involved a juried assessment of a student's work, with invited faculty members including Allen Ginsberg, Charles Olson and Robert Duncan. [...] Other attendees included Denise Levertov, Margaret Avison and Philip Whalen.|$|R

50|$|Lee's {{life has}} been {{documented}} elsewhere, and the popularity of his painting remains his lasting legacy. Many of his works have brought substantial prices when sold in recent times. He had a long career with over 90 identified paintings to his credit. However, some recent information has come to light detailing more than 300 of his paintings, suggesting many still reside in private hands or in the unpublished care of museums/National Trust properties. The Constable influence remained throughout his career and he was apparently not tempted to follow the Turner impressionist style, but remained true to his <b>original</b> <b>interests</b> despite the industrial revolution taking place around him.|$|R

In the same year, she opened Maison Myrbor (an abbreviation of her maiden name), a gallery and design house in Paris on Rue Vignon designed by Jean LurÃ§at. The street included established art dealers, such as Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. Maison Myrbor produced embroidered and appliquÃ© dresses, some designed by Natalia Goncharova, offered a decoration department, and held major painting exhibitions for artists such as Salvador DalÃ­ and Francis Cyril Rose.|$|R

I want to raise some critical questions, returning to my <b>original</b> <b>interests</b> in the psychic life of neoliberalism â€“ in particular its individualism. I will make three brief arguments: first arguing against individualization and calling for a collective struggle and resistance; secondly, calling for an expanded notion of precariousness that can speak to the multiplicity {{of ways in which}} precarity operates in the neoliberal University; and thirdly and relatedly discussing what I will call â€˜difficult solidaritiesâ€™ â€“ particularly the need to work collectively across differences and to resist the pressures towards competition and division...|$|R
