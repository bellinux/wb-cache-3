50|$|The focus forming assay (FFA) is a {{variation}} of the plaque assay, but instead of relying on cell lysis in order to detect plaque formation, the FFA employs immunostaining techniques using fluorescently labeled antibodies specific for a viral antigen to detect infected host cells and infectious virus particles before an actual plaque is formed. The FFA is particularly useful for quantifying classes of viruses that do not lyse the cell membranes, as these viruses would not be amenable to the plaque assay. Like the plaque assay, host cell monolayers are infected with various dilutions of the virus sample and allowed to incubate for a relatively brief incubation period (e.g., 24-72 hours) under a semisolid <b>overlay</b> <b>medium</b> that restricts the spread of infectious virus, creating localized clusters (foci) of infected cells. Plates are subsequently probed with fluorescently labeled antibodies against a viral antigen, and fluorescence microscopy is used to count and quantify the number of foci. The FFA method typically yields results in less time than plaque or TCID50 assays, but it can be more expensive in terms of required reagents and equipment. Assay completion time is also dependent on the size of area that the user is counting. A larger area will require more time but can provide a more accurate representation of the sample. Results of the FFA are expressed as focus forming units per milliliter, or FFU/mL.|$|E
40|$|A plaque {{assay method}} was {{developed}} for Teschen disease virus using primary pig kidney cultures in which neutral red stain was incorporated in the agar <b>overlay</b> <b>medium.</b> Certain factors associated with the plaque-forming ability of the virus were standardized. Cultures allowed to adsorb the virus for 45 - 60 minutes at 28 and 37 C, gave maximal plaque count. The virus infected the cellular layer through the agar medium. Plating efficiency of the virus was enhanced by using a small volume of inoculum. Addition of serum to the medium was not required. Neutral red concentration in the agar <b>overlay</b> <b>medium</b> affected the number of plaques. Statistical analysis demonstrated the uniformity of the plaque counts and their linear relationship to virus concentration.

The SP virus was {{inhibited}} under normal agar overlay but the addition of 100, 1, 000 and 2, 000 µg DEAE dextran/ml of agar overlay permitted plaque development. By using untreated and DEAE dextran-treated agar <b>overlay</b> <b>medium,</b> plaque formation by the SP virus was enhanced when the pH of agar medium was raised to a more alkaline level before overlay. Plaques formed by the LP virus were relatively uninhibited under the regular overlay but were larger {{in the presence of}} 1, 000 µg DEAE dextran/ml. The enhancement of LP virus plaques occurred at various pH levels and was also inversely related to the hydrogen ion concentration of agar overlays; regular and DEAE dextrantreated alkaline overlays produced larger plaques...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop {{techniques}} to sterilise the surface of silica gels containing encapsulated cells and the liquid broth they were immersed in, so that the observed metabolic activities could be unambiguously assigned to fully encapsulated cells. Gel surfaces were sterilised by UV-irradiation daily. The surfaces of the gels and the <b>overlaying</b> <b>medium</b> remained sterile for 20 days following irradiation, as demonstrated by the lack of visible surface growth and viable cells in the medium. We report the encapsulation of a viable, metabolically active, aerobic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum, and the aerobic Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces rimosus in gels derived from aqueous silica sols. Carbohydrate consumption (catabolism) and antibiotic biosynthesis (penicillin or oxytetracycline) (anabolism) were monitored in both cultures, demonstrating that the encapsulated cells remained viable within the gel matrix. This demonstrates that the silica gels are sufficiently porous to sustain metabolic activities of aerobic cells, which require the diffusion of oxygen and other substrates within the gel's nanopore network...|$|R

An increase in size was found for most strains under methyl-cellulose <b>overlay</b> <b>medium.</b> Markedly larger plaques were found under this medium for both Calif-RO and Calif-CG strains. Heterogeneity in plaque size was most pronounced in velogenic (high virulence) strains.

Statistical analysis showed that the plaque size of velogenic strains differed significantly from mesogenic strains. None of the 11 plaque-producing strains had a normal distribution of plaque sizes, owing primarily {{to the presence of}} different genotypes within the plaquing population of a strain.

Hantavirus infection is commonly diagnosed using serologic techniques and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
