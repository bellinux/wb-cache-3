50|$|Winklebury {{is a large}} suburb located {{two miles}} north-west of central Basingstoke in the UK. Until the late 1960s Winklebury was a {{collection}} of small holdings but Basingstoke's growth as a London <b>Overspill</b> <b>town</b> saw the area developed for housing.|$|E
50|$|Ironically {{this was}} done just as the town was {{undergoing}} {{a significant increase in}} population levels and associated housing development, having been designated as one of the second wave of new towns in 1961 (it was chosen, along with Runcorn as an <b>overspill</b> <b>town</b> for Liverpool).|$|E
50|$|As {{its name}} {{indicates}} {{it is on}} {{the eastern side of the}} city, and includes the <b>overspill</b> <b>towns</b> of Camilo Cienfuegos and Alamar as well as the beach towns of Boca Ciega, Tarará, Santa María del Mar and Guanabo.|$|R
40|$|Mortality from leukaemia {{under age}} 25 was studied in British New Towns {{to test the}} {{hypothesis}} that leukaemia represents a rare response to a much commoner (but unrecognised) infection, the transmission of which is facilitated when large numbers of people come together. The density of children was higher in the rural, but lower in the <b>overspill,</b> New <b>Towns</b> than in the areas from which their incomers originated. Residents of the rural New Towns had greater diversity of origin than those of the <b>overspill</b> <b>towns</b> of London and Glasgow. These two factors would encourage a greater rise in the postulated underlying infection in the rural towns, and in these a significant excess of leukaemia at ages 0 - 4 was found in 1946 - 65. In both sets of towns there was a significant deficit in other age groups consistent with immunising effects of the relevant infection. There are parallels with feline leukaemia virus infection, in which contrasting leukaemogenic and immunising effects occur in different social settings owing mainly to differences in intensity of viral exposure...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} post-war Scottish new towns; Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Irvine or Livingston, Glenrothes was not {{originally}} to be a Glasgow <b>overspill</b> new <b>town,</b> {{although it did}} later take this role. It was however populated in the early 1950s, in part, by families moving from the declining coalfield areas of Scotland.|$|R
50|$|In 1950s the Borough Council was {{approached}} by the Greater London Council to become an <b>overspill</b> <b>town,</b> to build houses and take people and industry relocated from the overcrowded capital. Some contend that had the old Borough Council still been in charge this {{would never have been}} agreed. But it was, and in 1961 the plan was drawn up to expand to a population of some 47,000 by 1982, with 9,000 new homes to be built.|$|E
50|$|It {{takes its}} name from South Ham Farm, which was once the major farm in the area but was {{demolished}} in the early 1960s. Parts of the area were developed for Council Housing in both the 1930s and 1950s when Western Way, one of the principal roads was built. The majority of development took place in the late 1960s, when Basingstoke was developed as an <b>overspill</b> <b>town</b> for London. South Ham has a number of roads named after royalty, authors and saints.|$|E
50|$|Chelmsley Wood is a {{relatively}} new area, which was built by Birmingham City Council in the late 1960s and early 70s on ancient woodland, once part of the Forest of Arden, as an <b>overspill</b> <b>town</b> for Birmingham. Permission for the construction of the overspill estate on green belt land was granted by Richard Crossman as Minister of Housing and Local Government. A shopping centre (which opened on 7 April 1970), a library (completed in 1970 at £240,000), hall and belatedly a few public houses. With the adjoining neighbourhoods of Fordbridge and Smith's Wood it became part of Metropolitan Borough of Solihull in 1974.|$|E
50|$|Grieve's {{influences}} on the plan included the framework for moving Glasgow's <b>overspill</b> into new <b>towns,</b> and ensuring that new towns were not only economic development centres but also viable communities.|$|R
50|$|Worplesdon ward borders {{the town}} {{to the north and}} north west of Guildford. It elects three councillors. It {{includes}} a substantial amount of <b>town</b> <b>overspill</b> in addition to villages like Worplesdon and Wood Street village.|$|R
50|$|Irvine was {{designated}} in the 1970s as a Glasgow <b>overspill</b> new <b>town.</b> In recent local council elections, the SNP have performed {{strongly in the}} town of Irvine. The affluent coastal towns of Prestwick and Troon join the town as part of the constituency as well as outlying rural areas located south and east of Troon and Prestwick: Prestwick, Troon and their hinterlands have sustained a considerable level of support for Conservative candidates locally and as part of the Ayr constituency in the Scottish Parliament. Heathfield in Ayr North also forms part of the constituency: this area is relatively small and has elected Labour councillors locally.|$|R
50|$|From the 1950s Thetford {{became a}} London <b>overspill</b> <b>town.</b> In 1953 the Thetford Borough Council {{approached}} the London County Council {{to become part}} of the town's expansion scheme. An agreement was signed in 1957 and work began on new housing estates to accommodate 5,000 Londoners. In 1960 another 5,000 Londoners moved to Thetford increasing the population to about 17,000 people. An additional 1,500 houses were built by 1965. Development then shifted to the Abbey Farm estate to the north of the river, construction of which started in 1967, with 1,000 houses, public open spaces and footpaths. By the late 1980s the population of Thetford had reached around 21,000 people, this enormous increase in population meant that Thetford grew faster than any other town in Norfolk, and indeed in the whole country.|$|E
5000|$|Mrs. Lyons {{is desperate}} for a baby but is unable to conceive, {{and would like to}} adopt a child but her husband, who is away on {{business}} overseas, is not keen on adoption. Mrs Johnstone finds out that she is going to have twins and explains to Mrs Lyons that she cannot afford to raise two more babies. Mrs Lyons then suggests that Mrs Johnstone gives one of the babies to her ("My Child"). Mrs Johnstone apprehensively agrees to this and is made to swear on the Bible to keep to the deal. Mrs Johnstone has the twins, and names the two children Mickey and Edward, but then regrets having agreed to give one away ("Easy Terms"). After keeping her deal with Mrs Lyons, she lies to her other children, saying that the other baby had died and gone to heaven. Mrs. Johnstone continues to work for the rich family, but Mrs Lyons soon feels that Mrs Johnstone is paying too much attention to the child that she has given up to her. She fires Mrs Johnstone, who wants to take the baby with her, but Mrs Lyons plays on Mrs Johnstone's superstitions by telling her that [...] "if twins separated at birth learn that they were once one of a pair they will both immediately die" [...] ("Shoes Upon the Table"). Mrs Johnstone refuses to take the money that Mrs Lyons offers her and leaves without the money or the child. In about 1970, Mickey, the son Mrs. Johnstone kept, meets Edward, the other twin, by chance, and after learning they share the same birthday, the two boys make a pact to become blood brothers, with Mickey calling Edward [...] "Eddie". Mrs Johnstone finds them and sends Eddie away, telling him not to come round again or else the [...] "Bogey-man" [...] will get him. Later in the day, Mickey goes to Eddie's house, but Mrs Lyons throws him out when she comes to the realization that he is Edward's separated twin. She and Eddie argue on the subject, and Eddie swears at her. Mrs Lyons slaps him and immediately regrets her reaction. She realises that he has learned to swear from Mickey. Mickey is playing with some neighbourhood children including his friend Linda. Afterwards, he takes her to see Eddie, and the three of them sneak off to play, but are caught by a police officer when about to throw stones through a window. Mrs Lyons becomes worried about Eddie's friendship with Mickey, as she has started to believe the superstition that she herself had made up. She decides to move and persuades her husband, who realizes she is becoming ill and the sees the effect the poorer children are having on his son. When Eddie says goodbye, Mrs Johnstone gives him a locket with a picture of herself and Mickey, and the boys separate. Soon afterwards, the Johnstone family are rehoused from the condemned inner city slum area of Liverpool to a new council house in the nearby <b>overspill</b> <b>town</b> of Skelmersdale ("Bright New Day").|$|E
40|$|Presented at the PALA 2016 annual conference, Cagliari, Italy. The scene: {{the streets}} and bus shelters of an <b>overspill</b> <b>town</b> {{in the north of}} England. Newspaper hoardings, {{advertising}} posters and brand pay-off lines conspire in an urban ‘poetry’ familiar to many. The cheap typefaces ‘worn’ by these words – ‘DRUGS/HORROR/LOTTO/SEX/DEATH’ contrast starkly with those urging us to buy branded products ‘because you're worth it’. We are by turns fascinated, flattered and horrified by the rich verbal and visual diet printed and posted up on our way to work, home and other places. The texts and data in this study consist of a collection of over 150 actual newspaper hoardings together with photographic records of street advertising from urban and suburban settings in Stockport, England. These texts are analysed semantically for regularity of occurrence and co-combinations of keywords. This short form of 5 - 8 word statements – constructed as punchy headlines – compares closely with the brevity of advertising and branding propositions within the same, shared, urban space. The vocabulary of news reporting – ‘true events’ happening ‘right here, right now’ – is weighed against the vocabulary of aspiration and desire seen in brand advertising within intimate urban spaces. Integral to these comparative vocabularies are the supportive visual signifiers of the typefaces used: typefaces that suggest on the one hand truth and urgency, and on the other fantasy and desire. This study will consider how particular typefaces and typographic styles are applied to these messages and, through their associated visual connotations, confer deeper semiotic readings. In conclusion, the study will attempt to frame a conjoined semantic and semiotic reading of the notions of Authenticity/Inauthenticity with reference to these texts...|$|E
50|$|Liverpool {{traditionally}} {{is known}} as having the strongest Irish heritage of any British city, {{with the possible exception}} of Glasgow. The large number of Irish here originates from the city's port being close to Ireland, which made it in easy reach for all those escaping the potato famine during the 1800s. The Irish have played a major role in Liverpool's population and social fabric for a good part of the city's eight-hundred year history. A lot of Liverpudlians have some Irish ancestry, their Irish ancestors are most likely to have come to Liverpool in the 19th century. The Irish influence is heard in the local Liverpool dialect, often called Scouse, and seen in the faces and names of the populace. At least three of Liverpool's most famous citizens, The Beatles, had some Irish ancestry. George Harrison was partly of maternal Irish-Catholic derivation. Bandmate Sir Paul McCartney had one Irish grandfather and an Irish great-grandfather. John Lennon's father's family were the descendents of Irish migrants who came to Liverpool in the 19th century. Liverpool's Irish heritage is further highlighted by it being the only English city to have a significant Orange Order membership. The Irish have also come to be as much of a staple of Merseyside in general, as of Liverpool itself. Many of the towns which surround the city in the county, such as Crosby, Widnes, Birkenhead, Newton-le-Willows, Wallasey, Bootle and Moreton, have many ethnic Irish people, and have also inherited the Scouse accent. Likewise, numerous <b>overspill</b> <b>towns</b> were built to house Liverpool's population in the years that followed, or took in a significant amount of Liverpool overspill, such as Huyton, Kirkby, Skelmersdale, Litherland, Winsford, Halewood, Runcorn and Warrington, and consequently these also have many people of Irish descent.|$|R
50|$|Yate is a {{commuter}} town and civil parish in South Gloucestershire, England, at the southwest extremity of the Cotswold Hills, 11 miles (17.7 km) northeast of Bristol city centre. Yate developed from a village into a sizable town from the 1960s onwards, partly as an <b>overspill</b> or commuter <b>town</b> {{for the city}} of Bristol. Although not a new town in the official sense, Yate took on many of the characteristics of one. At the 2011 census the population was 21,603. The town of Chipping Sodbury (population 5,045) is contiguous with Yate to the east. In addition, a large southern section of the built-up area spills over into the parish of Dodington (population 8,206), and so the total population of Yate's urban area is now approaching 35,000.|$|R
50|$|Some of the Bruce Report {{initiatives}} {{were put}} into practice; others were not. The report and its implementation significantly shaped modern day Glasgow. A {{good example of the}} scope of its impact is the M8 motorway which was built following proposals in the report. Also the mid-20th century policy or resettling much of the city's population to peripheral housing schemes arose from recommendations in the Bruce Report, reflecting Glasgow Corporation's resistance to <b>overspill</b> and new <b>towns</b> until it co-operated in the designation of Cumbernauld new town in 1956. The civic, economic, political, architectural, geographic and demographic landscape of modern Glasgow would have been radically different without the influence of these two reports. Had the Bruce Report itself been implemented unaltered in its entirety, the city today would probably have been unrecognisable.|$|R
