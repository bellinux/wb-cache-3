5|$|A notable {{incident}} that occurred was {{the assassination of}} Lord Mayo, the Viceroy of India who had visited the islands on an inspection tour.

The attack on Lord Mayo {{was carried out by}} Sher Ali, one of the convicts of the penal colony who was on a sick leave; the assassination was carried out while Mayo was returning after a pleasant trip to Mount Harriet on the evening of 8 February 1872. Another political prisoner who suffered the longest period of 47 years <b>of</b> <b>incarceration</b> was Musai Singh who was released for good behavior in July 1907 {{on the occasion of the}} 50th anniversary of India's First War of Independence in 1857.|$|E

40|$|Scholars {{have studied}} incarceration {{among women in}} the United States of America {{for more than a}} decade, but few studies have {{explored}} the influence <b>of</b> repeated <b>incarcerations</b> among African American women and their family relationships. The research question for this study examined how African American women describe the effects <b>of</b> multiple <b>incarcerations</b> on family trust relationships and their ability to reintegrate into the family system and society. This multiple case study was conducted in Chicago, Illinois, and drew a sample of 4 African American women released from prison with histories <b>of</b> multiple <b>incarcerations.</b> The study explored their perspectives through a series of semistructured, in-depth interviews. Data consisted of narrative interview transcripts and artifacts collected and analyzed using a framework of feminist theory and critical criminology. Findings from the analysis indicated these African American women experienced profound and long-term devastation to relationships with family and friends following periods <b>of</b> multiple <b>incarcerations.</b> Repeated periods <b>of</b> imprisonment negatively altered their perceptions of themselves and reduced their social engagement with others. Results <b>of</b> repeated <b>incarcerations</b> included (a) broken trust with loved ones; (b) resentment, anger, and blame; and (c) permanent damage to social and family networks. This study contributes to social change by increasing understanding of the repercussions and effects <b>of</b> multiple <b>incarcerations</b> on African American women and family continuity, and the study offers insight into guiding program development to help families rebuild and stabilize...|$|R
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. He testified in his own defense, {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, saying that he had met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he never saw them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years <b>of</b> <b>incarceration</b> until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} from the 1960-s to 1986, the abuse of {{psychiatry}} for political purposes {{was reported to have}} been systematic in the Soviet Union and episodic in other Eastern European countries such as Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. The practice <b>of</b> <b>incarceration</b> of political dissidents in mental hospitals in Eastern Europe and the former USSR damaged the credibility of psychiatric practice in these states and entailed strong condemnation from the international community. Psychiatrists have been involved in human rights abuses in states across the world when the definitions of mental disease were expanded to include political disobedience. As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions have at times classified threats to authority during periods of political disturbance and instability as a form of mental disease. In many countries political prisoners are still sometimes confined and abused in mental institutions.|$|E
5|$|The English {{judicial}} system had altered considerably {{over the previous}} century, with the royal judges playing {{a larger role in}} delivering justice across the country. John had used his royal discretion to extort large sums of money from the barons, effectively taking payment to offer justice in particular cases, {{and the role of the}} Crown in delivering justice had become politically sensitive among the barons. Clauses 39 and 40 demanded due process be applied in the royal justice system, while clause 45 required that the King appoint knowledgeable royal officials to the relevant roles. Although these clauses did not have any special significance in the original charter, this part of Magna Carta became singled out as particularly important in later centuries. In the United States, for example, the Supreme Court of California interpreted clause 45 in 1974 as establishing a requirement in common law that a defendant faced with the potential <b>of</b> <b>incarceration</b> be entitled to a trial overseen by a legally trained judge.|$|E

5|$|On 8 February 1915, the Australian {{government}} {{received a}} request from the British Government of India for aerial assistance in the campaign against the Turks in Mesopotamia. Aircrew and supporting personnel for half a flight only were available so the unit, the AFC's first to see active service, {{became known as the}} Mesopotamian Half Flight. Promoted to captain, Petre was appointed the Half Flight's commanding officer and embarked for Basra via Bombay on 14April, later to be joined by fellow pilots White, Merz and Lieutenant William Treloar, along with thirty-seven ground staff. In Mesopotamia, Petre was required to lead the AFC contingent in reconnaissance and sabotage missions, and had to deal with unreliable machines, hazardous terrain, and the threat <b>of</b> <b>incarceration</b> or death at the hands of hostile tribesmen. He took part in operations in the Amara area from 31May to 4June, for which he was mentioned in despatches. The obsolete aircraft supplied by the Indian Government, two Maurice Farman Shorthorns and a Maurice Farman Longhorn, were only capable of top speeds of 50mph (80km/h), while the desert wind (known as the shamal) could reach 80mph (129km/h), meaning that the aircraft often made no headway or were simply blown backwards. In July, the Half Flight's equipment was augmented by two Caudron G.3 aircraft, a marginal improvement on the Farmans, but still prone to mechanical failure. Later that month, one of the Caudrons was forced to land in enemy territory. Its crew, Merz and a New Zealander, were never seen again; they were later reported killed by Arabs after a running gun battle over several miles.|$|E
