However, the FETs must be spaced 180, resulting in physically large circuits.

40|$|A {{directly}} employable closed-form analytical {{solution for}} the calculation of an efficient, full-operating-range zero voltage switching (ZVS) modulation scheme for bidirectional dual active bridge (DAB) dc–dc converters is presented. Contrary to the analytical ZVS modulation schemes previously proposed in literature, the amount of charge that is required to charge the nonlinear parasitic <b>output</b> <b>capacitances</b> of the switches during commutation is incorporated, ensuring complete commutation of the bridge legs and ZVS of the switching devices. Besides quasilossless ZVS, the resulting modulation scheme leads to nearminimum high-frequency circulating currents and thus minimum conduction losses under the condition of ZVS and for given values of the inductances and transformer turns ratio. Although modifiable for other implementations, the method is demonstrated for a full-bridge full-bridge DAB as core part of a single-phase, singlestage, bidirectional, isolated AC–DC converter. The resulting modulation scheme is compared with a ZVS modulation scheme calculated using a previously published numerical approach, proving its effectiveness.

Furthermore, {{the amount of}} charge that {{is available in the}} bridge currents to charge the nonlinear parasitic <b>output</b> <b>capacitances</b> of the switches during commutation is deduced from the respective Fourier current coefficients. This yields ZVS constraints that are more accurate than the energy-based ZVS constraints proposed in literature.

Although applicable to any DAB implementation, the procedure is demonstrated for a full-bridge full-bridge DAB as core part of a single-phase, single-stage, bidirectional, isolated AC-DC converter.

40|$|Magnetic {{components}} are {{important parts of}} the phase shifted full bridge (PSFB) converter. During the dead-time of switches located in the same leg, the converter can achieve zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) by using the energies stored in magnetic components to discharge or charge the <b>output</b> <b>capacitances</b> of switches. Dead-time is usually calculated under a given set of pre-defined load condition which results in that the available energies are insufficient and ZVS capability is lost at light loads. In this paper, the PSFB converter is controlled by variable dead-time method and thus full advantage can be taken of the energies stored in magnetic components. Considering that dead-time has a great effect on ZVS, the relationship between available energies and magnetic component values is formulated by analyzing the equivalent circuits during dead-time intervals. Magnetic component values are chosen based on such relationship. The proposed choice procedure can make the available energies greater than the required energies for ZVS operation {{over a wide range}} of load conditions.
