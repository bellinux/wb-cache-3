40|$|The VAT is {{compared}} to a turnover tax (TT) given monopoly final goods and intermediate goods firms interacting strategically. Linear demands and constant costs are assumed. Via examples it is shown that for both "Cournot" and "Stackelberg" games, a revenue neutral VAT may not exist to a given turnover tax; and the TT can dominate the VAT simultaneously in welfare, revenue and output terms. In other examples it is shown that the VAT dominating the TT by all three indicators is also possible. It is also shown that outcomes are identical to the "Cournot" game when the consumer goods firm is the strategic leader.

Instead of displaying the ordered dissimilarity matrix (ODM) as a 2 D gray-level image for human interpretation as is done by VAT, we trace the changes in dissimilarities along the diagonal of the ODM. This changes the 2 D data structure (matrices) into 1 D arrays, displayed as what we call the tendency curves, which enables one to concentrate only on one variable, namely the height. One of these curves, called the d-curve, clearly shows the existence of cluster structure as patterns in peaks and valleys, which can be caught not only by human eyes but also by the computer. Our numerical experiments showed that the computer can catch cluster structures from the d-curve even in some cases where the human eyes see no structure from the visual <b>outputs</b> of <b>VAT.</b> And success on all numerical experiments was obtained us- ing the same (fixed) set of program parameter values...|$|R
40|$|A {{value added}} tax (VAT) was {{introduced}} in South Africa in 1991 to replace the general sales tax (GST). Initially, there were some questions {{on the ability of}} VAT to replace GST as a revenue source for government. However, the overall performance of VAT, as revenue generator seems satisfactory; in 2002 the government stated VAT is a dependable and broad-based revenue source. The VAT in South Africa is administered with a rebate for intermediate input use. Retail sellers pay the statutory rate times the value of <b>output</b> minus the <b>VAT</b> payments paid by the intermediate inputs used in production. In this paper, we evaluate the effect South Africa’s VAT has on welfare. We use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with detailed specification of South Africa’s tax system. First we describe the effects of removing the VAT and replacing the revenue by a proportional increase in direct taxes. Then we consider the effect alternative statutory rates have on the regressiveness of the VAT...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—VAT is {{a broad-based}} tax levied at {{multiple}} stages of production (and distribution) with – crucially taxes on inputs credited against taxes on <b>output.</b> Bangladesh introduced <b>VAT</b> in 1991 replacing the previous taxes like sales tax, excise duty and business turnover taxes. In {{last two decades}} VAT has become an all encompassing domestic tax covering the domestic manufacturing, wholesale, retail and all the service sectors in the country. This paper is a first attempt to measures the incidence of Value Added Tax (VAT) in Bangladesh. The {{results show that the}} VAT incidence varies for people in different income groups. For instance, the VAT incidence for the lowest income group is 6. 92 percent whereas for the highest income group it is only 4. 56 percent. The higher income groups are also enjoying fewer burdens than the lower income groups. Comparing the results with and without VAT exemptions, the study finds that overall the VAT in Bangladesh is regressive. The study provides some policy recommendations that could help design a better VAT system in the developing countries with a particular case i...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the operating costs of, and intentional compliance with, the value added tax (VAT) in Ethiopia. The study focuses on assessing {{the magnitude and}} nature of operating costs, identifying areas {{in the design and}} administration of the tax that contribute to the operating costs and the problems in the operation of the tax at large, and also on the link between VAT compliance costs and intentional <b>output</b> <b>VAT</b> reporting compliance decisions. The study adopts a mixed methods research approach to test a series of hypotheses and answer research questions that emerge through the review of existing literature and the experiences of the researcher in respect of the Ethiopian tax system. Specifically, the study uses surveys of taxpayers and tax practitioners, experimental design, interviews with tax officials and documentary analysis. The study statistically analyses the data elicited from the surveys and experimental design. It also analyses the results of in-depth interviews with tax officials and examination of documents held by tax authorities and other institutions. The results of this combined research methodology reveal that VAT operating costs in Ethiopia in the fiscal year 2005 / 06 appear to be relatively low. However, this low level of operating costs may not imply that the VAT system in Ethiopia is simple. In particular, in the case of administrative costs it is argued that it may indicate that the tax authorities are under-resourced which in turn may have affected their ability to accomplish the responsibilities entrusted to them. In respect of compliance costs, although the total costs seem to be low, it is contended that their regressiveness is likely to impact on the equity of the tax system as a whole. Further, the results show that VAT compliance costs and intentional VAT reporting compliance decisions are inversely correlated; but this correlation is statistically weak. The results also identify several concerns in the design and administration of the tax that have bearing on the operating costs and the operation of the tax. Specifically, the existence of the relatively high registration threshold, the high frequency of VAT reporting, the use of the invoice method of accounting (the latter two pertain mainly to small businesses) and weak administration are noted. iv The thesis suggests a series of measures which could be taken by the government and by the tax authorities in particular, to address the various problems identified in the study. These measures include strengthening the administration; allowing small businesses to adopt the cash basis of accounting and report less frequently; and reducing the registration threshold. The use of tax education is also emphasised as a strategy to improve compliance...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. VAT is a {{tax that}} is based on taxing the value added on {{successive}} transactions in the supply chain, accordingly it {{is a tax}} designed for the retail or manufacturing industries. South Africa introduced VAT that is similar to that introduced across the world and later refined it. The revisions included the introduction of VAT on banking services. The introduction of VAT to banking is a first in the VAT world but still does not find a cure for the principle dilemma of taxing a bank's value added, under VAT. The study therefore established if banks are treated fairly by investigating: • The three canons of taxation, • The eight principles on which VAT rests, • And the agreement between SARS and the Council of South African Banks. The reason of the above is to propose enhancements or an alternative design that would either increase the accuracy, equity, or simplify the calculation of VAT in the banking sector. The study found that there are several options when introducing VAT to the financial services sector, namely: • zero rate it and the fiscuss looses out on the <b>output</b> <b>VAT,</b> • tax it and increase the cost of borrowing as well as face the problems of determining the value added per transaction or; • exempt it and a practice known as cascading takes place. Neither of these solutions seemed viable although the full taxation option is conceptually the only correct method oftaxation. In most countries the exemption option was taken. The result of exempting interest is that banks have to apportion their input VAT. There are various options open to a bank when calculating the ratio of input VAT to be claimed, yet legislation has only made mention of two. To alleviate this situation the VAT authorities and the Council of South African Banks have agreed upon a methodology to calculate the ratio of input VAT to be reclaimed. This agreement is not compulsory and only applies to areas where the bank does not have an alternative apportionment technique, and in some instances is also flawed in its logic. Consequently banks have the option to apportion input VAT on what they perceive to be a fair basis. The indecision and inequities described above does not result an accurate VAT. The conclusion was that the design is urtiust and the practical calculation, when applied, does not the deliver the correct amount of tax payable. The study introduced a different form of VAT, named the Business Transfer Tax. This tax is an additive form of VAT, based on accounts that relate to interest and trading income. Interest income and trading income would be zero rated under the current VAT, and therefore entitle the bank to claim input tax incurred on expenditure. This would overcome all of the issues not resolved previously...|$|E
