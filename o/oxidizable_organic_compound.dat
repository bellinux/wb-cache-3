40|$|Microwave {{activation}} of electrochemical processes {{has recently been}} introduced as a new technique for the enhancement and control of processes at electrode|solution (electrolyte) interfaces. This methodology is extended to processes at glassy carbon and boron-doped diamond electrodes. Deposition of both Pb metal and PbO 2 from an aqueous solution of Pb 2 + (0. 1 M HNO 3) are affected by microwave radiation. The formation of PbO 2 on anodically pre-treated boron-doped diamond is demonstrated to change from kinetically sluggish and poorly defined at room temperature to nearly diffusion controlled and well defined {{in the presence of}} microwave activation. Calibration of the temperature at the electrode|solution (electrolyte) interface with the Fe 3 +/ 2 + (0. 1 M HNO 3) redox system allows the experimentally observed effects to be identified as predominantly thermal in nature and therefore consistent with a localized heating effect at the electrode|solution interface. The microwave-activated deposition of PbO 2 on boron-doped diamond remains facile in the presence of excess <b>oxidizable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> such as ethylene glycol. An increase of the current for the electrocatalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol at PbO 2 / boron-doped diamond electrodes in the presence of microwave radiation is observed. Preliminary results suggest that the electrodissolution of solid microparticles of PbO 2 abrasively attached to the surface of a glassy carbon electrode is also enhanced in the presence of microwave radiation...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the ecological state of the Ural River at the present stage. Hydrochemical regime of the reservoir is an important indicator to regulating the number of water resources. As the Ural River is the transboundary reservoir, it is prone to contamination from various areas in the upper and middle reaches. Monitoring of the ecological state of the Ural River showed the presence of anthropogenic pollution. The hydrochemical regime of the reservoir is subject to changes in seasonal variations in water composition. In spring, with flood waters, the main pollution enters the river, however in other seasons, the quality of water leaves much to be desired. In autumn, {{in comparison with the}} spring, both alkalinity and salinity increased. The reservoir is prone to contamination with nitrites in almost all seasons of the year from 0. 05 to 0. 20 mg/dm 3 (December, 2016). In the lower reaches of the Ural River, the content of readily <b>oxidizable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> ranges from 3. 2 mg/dm 3 (winter) to 7. 36 mg/dm 3 (autumn). The content of boron exceeds the maximum permissible concentration 1 - 3 times. Environmental monitoring conducted in different periods of the year showed a constant source of pollution flow into the reservoir, which was increased in the flood period. Concentrations of nitrite, boron and petroleum products in the Ural River exceed their permitted values at the point in the end of Uralsk city. The results of the research confirm that the source of the contamination of Ural River is its confluent Ilek River originating from Aktobe Oblast...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical {{hydrogen}} evolution reaction (HER) {{has been}} recognized as a viable approach to generate a clean energy fuel. However, substantial technical breakthroughs are needed to reduce the costs for electricity and chemical reagents. In this study, we explore a specific wastewater electrolysis cell (WEC) as an alternative of decentralized H_ 2 production coupled with onsite water treatment. A prototypical WEC consists of a multi-junction semiconductor anode and a stainless steel cathode paired in single compartment cell. A distinct layer of BiO_x/TiO_ 2 on anode surface had relatively low crystallinity that was shown to be beneficial for higher oxide formation and O_ 2 evolution. The over-potential and Tafel slope of the BiO_x/TiO 2 anode were determined to be 0. 32 V and 120 mV decade^(− 1). In a single compartment WEC with a NaCl electrolyte ([Cl−] ≤ 50 mM), the current density (j) ranged up to 500 A m^(− 2) at cell voltages less than 6 V, while the current efficiency (CE) for free chlorine (FC) evolution showed maximum value near 0. 3. The CE and energy efficiency (EE) for the HER were assessed using NaCl solutions (50 mM with or without 2. 5 g L^(− 1) urea) and real wastewater with variable compositions ([Cl−]: 6 – 33 mM, [chemical oxygen demand]: 60 – 790 mg L^(− 1)). The ohmic resistance of wastewater electrolyte rules out the usage of membrane separation, resulting in side reactions such as reduction of O_ 2 whose CE values monotonically decreased with an increasing j under the diffusion controlled regime. Chloride ions reduce the electron consumption during O_ 2 reduction, while elevated levels of FC significantly lower the CE for the HER. The combined presence of <b>oxidizable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>compounds</b> and Cl− enhance the CE for the HER {{as long as the}} concentration of organics is enough to quench FC to maintain a pseudo steady-state concentration. The highest CE (0. 8) and EE (0. 23) for HER were observed during electrolysis of real wastewater at j values exceeding 200 A m^(− 2). However, a dependency of value of EE on the applied cell voltage needs to be addressed further...|$|R

The sequence of the TEAPs (Terminal Electron Acceptor Processes) : aerobic respiration, denitrification, Mn(IV) -reduction, Fe(III) -reduction, sulfatereduction and methanogenesis is determined by the energy yield of each redox reaction (Chapelle et al., 1995). This study presents a kinetic model of the redox processes using the multispecies reactive transport code RT 3 D (Clement, 1997). A user-defined kinetic model (Kin_REDOX) was developed to account for the the principal biogeochemical reactions that are likely to follow the release of a generic organic contaminant (CH 2 O).

40|$|The {{oxidizability}} of soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) influences soil quality and carbon sequestration. Four fractions of <b>oxidizable</b> <b>organic</b> carbon (very labile (C 1), labile (C 2), less labile (C 3) and non-labile (C 4)) reflect {{the status and}} composition of SOC and have implications for the change and retention of SOC. Studies of the fractions of <b>oxidizable</b> <b>organic</b> carbon (OC) have been limited to shallow soil depths and agroecosystems. How these fractions respond at deep soil depths and in other types of land-use is not clear. In this study, we evaluated the vertical distributions of the fractions of <b>oxidizable</b> <b>organic</b> carbon to a soil depth of 5. 0 m in 10 land-use types in the Zhifanggou Watershed on the Loess Plateau, China. Along the soil profile, C 1 contents were highly variable in the natural grassland and shrubland I (Caragana microphylla), C 2 and C 4 contents were highly variable in the natural grassland and two terraced croplands, respectively, and C 3 contents varied little. Among the land-use types, natural grassland had the highest C 1 and C 2 contents in the 0 – 0. 4 m layers, followed by shrubland I in the 0 – 0. 1 m layer. Natural grassland had the highest C 4 contents in the 1. 0 – 4. 5 m layers. Natural grassland and shrubland I thus contributed to improve the oxidizability of SOC in shallow soil, and the deep soil of natural grassland has a large potential to sequester SOC on the Loess Plateau. <br style="orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; widows: 2;" /...|$|R

40|$|We {{collected}} and analysed soil cores from four geologic units surrounding Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) Utah, USA, including Mancos Shale, Dakota Sandstone, Morrison formation (Brushy Basin member) and Summerville formation. The area {{is an important}} geochemical and morphological analogue to terrains on Mars. Soils were analysed for mineralogy by a Terra X-ray diffractometer (XRD), a field version of the CheMin instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission (2012 landing). Soluble ion chemistry, total organic content and identity and distribution of microbial populations were also determined. The Terra data reveal that Mancos and Morrison soils are rich in phyllosilicates similar to those observed on Mars from orbital measurements (montmorillonite, nontronite and illite). Evaporite minerals observed include gypsum, thenardite, polyhalite and calcite. Soil chemical analysis shows sulfate the dominant anion in all soils and SO 4 >>CO 3, as on Mars. The cation pattern Na>Ca>Mg is seen in all soils except for the Summerville where Ca>Na. In all soils, SO 4 correlates with Na, suggesting sodium sulfates are the dominant phase. <b>Oxidizable</b> <b>organics</b> are low in all soils and range {{from a high of}} 0. 7 % in the Mancos samples to undetectable at a detection limit of 0. 1 % in the Morrison soils.
