5|$|Glastonbury {{has been}} {{described}} as a New Age community which attracts people with New Age and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.|$|E

5|$|Newton House was {{originally}} built during the medieval period at {{some distance from}} the castle. It is documented to have been later modified in 1595 and 1603. The current Newton House was completed in 1660 under the command of Edward Rice. In the late 1700s, George Rice and his wife Cecil began the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> garden, and hired eminent architect Capability Brown in 1775 to assume responsibility for the development. Turrets and battlements were added between 1760 and 1780, giving the property a more romanticised appearance. During the Rebecca Riots of 1843, Colonel George Rice was awoken one night in September and found an empty grave dug in the grounds, warning him that he would be buried in it by October 10.|$|E
5|$|Petrus Christus {{placed his}} sitter in a naturalistic setting {{rather than a}} flat and featureless background. This {{approach}} was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces. In his 1462 , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape, while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts. Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power. Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo's positioning of the Mona Lisa in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> view. Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{other large}} urban parks, Stanley Park {{is not the}} {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> architect, but rather {{the evolution of a}} forest and urban space over many years. Most of the manmade structures present in the park were built between 1911 and 1937 under the influence of then superintendent W.S. Rawlings. Additional attractions, such as a polar bear exhibit, aquarium, and miniature train, were added in the post-war period.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast burning {{alters the}} biota <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape.</b> The {{immediate}} {{effect of a}} forest fire is a decrease in diversity.

25|$|The term paysagisme abstrait (literally, {{abstract}} landscapism) {{could be}} reserved for a process where the artist senses and tries to capture the 'rhythms' <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape.</b> This concept of rhythm is explicitly mentioned {{by a number of}} painters in addition to Messagier; Jean Ren√© Bazaine, Raoul Ubac and Zao Wou Ki. The rhythm of the landscape is experienced by the artist and expressed by the gesture; something the viewer in turn would experience as sensation. The landscape in this case is a direct source of inspiration. It must be felt.|$|E

While these paintings appear to be secular still-life paintings on the surface, they also have religious meaning and may be connected to Franciscan religiosity. Taken as a whole, these paintings represent the passage of time, the inevitability of death, and the possibility of rebirth.|$|E

25|$|Reed had an {{interest}} in London's open spaces and their educational benefits, and became a subscriber to the Abney Park Cemetery, a joint stock company in whose trust lay parkland once owned by Lady Mary Abney, in which Dr Isaac Watts had written hymns. The associated members sought to maintain the site for its religious associations and for its value as open space. It was the only surviving example <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> designed by the nurseryman George Loddiges and boasted an arboretum of 2500 trees and shrubs. As the only New World cemetery design in Europe it had commissioned an entrance in an Egyptian revival style, to reflect its non-denominational character. The originality of the design and the motive force for acquiring and preserving the site had been George Collison, its first secretary, whose father had tutored Reed's father.|$|E

500|$|The Longfellow House‚ÄìWashington's Headquarters National Historic Site {{is noted}} for its garden on the {{northeast}} end of the property. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow oversaw {{the creation of the}} original garden, shaped as a lyre, shortly after his wedding. In 1845, he began refurbishing the garden in earnest and imported trees from England with help from Asa Gray. These trees included [...] "a number of evergreens, among them a cedar of Lebanon and pines from the Himalayas, Norway, Switzerland and Oregon". The lyre shape proved impractical and a new design was made with the help <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> architect named Richard Dolben in 1847. The new design was a square surrounding a circle that was cut into four tear-shaped garden beds outlined by trimmed boxwood. Mrs. Longfellow referred to the shape as a [...] "Persian rug".|$|E

500|$|Besides {{existing}} buildings and technical literature of building manuals, Song dynasty artwork portraying cityscapes and other buildings aid modern-day scholars {{in their attempts}} to reconstruct and realize the nuances of Song architecture. Song dynasty artists such as Li Cheng, Fan Kuan, Guo Xi, Zhang Zeduan, Emperor Huizong of Song, and Ma Lin painted close-up depictions of buildings as well as large expanses of cityscapes featuring arched bridges, halls and pavilions, pagoda towers, and distinct Chinese city walls. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was known for his criticism of artwork relating to architecture, saying that it was more important for an artist to capture a holistic view <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> than it was to focus on the angles and corners of buildings. For example, Shen criticized the work of the painter Li Cheng for failing to observe the principle of [...] "seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large" [...] in portraying buildings.|$|E
500|$|The {{visualisation}} and {{portrayal of}} landscape {{in an entirely}} new manner was Friedrich's key innovation. He sought not just to explore the blissful enjoyment of a beautiful view, as in the classic conception, but rather to examine an instant of sublimity, a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature. Friedrich was instrumental in transforming landscape in art from a backdrop subordinated to human drama to a self-contained emotive subject. Friedrich's paintings commonly employed the R√ºckenfigur‚Äîa person seen from behind, contemplating the view. The viewer is encouraged to place himself {{in the position of}} the R√ºckenfigur, by which means he experiences the sublime potential of nature, understanding that the scene is as perceived and idealised by a human. Friedrich created the notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>landscape</b> full of romantic feeling‚Äîdie romantische Stimmungslandschaft. His art details a wide range of geographical features, such as rock coasts, forests, and mountain scenes. [...] He often used the landscape to express religious themes. During his time, most of the best-known paintings were viewed as expressions of a religious mysticism.|$|E
