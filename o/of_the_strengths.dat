5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> of the Brown {{methodology}} {{is that it}} can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E

5|$|Strategically, as {{a result}} of the {{fighting}} around Milne Bay, Japanese operations within the region were constrained. The defeat at Milne Bay kept them from bypassing the holding action that the Australians were conducting on the Kokoda Track. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. The Japanese commanders were then forced to change their plans in the region, shifting their focus towards repelling the US forces that had landed on Guadalcanal, while maintaining a smaller effort around Buna–Gona, under Major General Tomitarō Horii. Once they had retaken Guadalcanal, they planned to reinforce Horii's forces and launch a reinvigorated attack on the Australians around Port Moresby. In the end, subsequent defeats at Buna–Gona and on Guadalcanal did not allow them to implement these plans, as the Allies gained the ascendency in the region throughout late 1942 and the Japanese were forced to fall back to the northern coast of New Guinea. In the aftermath of the battle, a large amount of intelligence was also gained by the Allies, providing their planners with a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> and weaknesses of the Japanese and their equipment. It also demonstrated that the Militia were an effective fighting force.|$|E

25|$|When Constantinople {{fell to the}} Fourth Crusade in 1204, the Byzantine {{successor}} states {{established at}} Epirus, Trebizond and especially Nicaea based their military systems on the Komnenian army. The success of the Empire of Nicaea in particular in reconquering former Byzantine territories (including Constantinople) after 1204, {{may be seen as}} evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> of the Komnenian army model. There is reason to restrict the term Komnenian army solely to the period of the rule of the Komnenian emperors; the Byzantine army after the recovery of Constantinople in 1261 was sufficiently distinct from its earlier form to deserve a separate identity as the Palaiologan army. The Byzantine Empire enjoyed an economic and cultural renaissance during the 12th century and the Komnenian army played a crucial part in providing the political and territorial stability which allowed this cultural flowering.|$|E
25|$|Figures {{for total}} {{strengths}} {{should also be}} considered in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> reported at each position. Note {{is given to the}} variation in strengths reported at each position. Based on the following strengths reported of 900 at Gona, 2,500 at Buna and 5,500 at Sanananda, the apparent total strength would be 8,900. All of these figures are inclusive of reinforcements received on 17–18 November. The strength at Sanananda appears, from context, to be in mid-December. The strength at the beachheads at this time would not include any of the 1,300 from the 21st Independent Mixed Brigade that did not reinforce the positions until the end of December. About 500 of the force gathered by Colonel Yazawa remained west of Gona. Deducting these from the total strength deployed (11,700) gives a strength deployed to the beachheads by in mid-December of 9,900. The South Seas Force reinforcement landed on 21 November totaled 800.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} the Harvard {{classification}} of a star indicated its surface or photospheric temperature (or more precisely, its effective temperature) was not fully understood until after its development, though {{by the time the}} first Hertzsprung–Russell diagram was formulated (by 1914), this was generally suspected to be true. In the 1920s, the Bengali physicist Meghnad Saha derived a theory of ionization by extending well-known ideas in physical chemistry pertaining to the dissociation of molecules to the ionization of atoms. First he applied it to the solar chromosphere, then to stellar spectra. The Harvard astronomer Cecilia Helena Payne (later to become Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin) then demonstrated that the OBAFGKM spectral sequence is actually a sequence in temperature. Because the classification sequence predates our understanding that it is a temperature sequence, the placement of a spectrum into a given subtype, such as B3 or A7, depends upon (largely subjective) estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> of absorption features in stellar spectra. As a result, these subtypes are not evenly divided into any sort of mathematically representable intervals.|$|E
