5|$|The close loss {{discouraged}} the Virginia Tech players, {{who then}} had only {{five days to}} prepare for their next opponent, lightly regarded James Madison University. At Lane Stadium, Virginia Tech's home field, James Madison upset the heavily favored Hokies, 21–16. The loss was {{only the second time}} in college football history that a team ranked nationally was defeated by a team from the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision. In the wake of the loss, Virginia Tech fell from No. 13 to out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> entirely.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{returned}} Tech to No. 23 in the polls. A recovery to No. 19 followed {{victories over}} the University of Alabama-Birmingham and the University of Miami. In {{the final two}} games of the season, however, The Hokies lost to Pittsburgh, 3023, and Virginia, 3420. The dual losses dropped Tech out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> {{for the first time}} since the opening week of the season, and the Hokies prepared for the Gator Bowl after recording a 74 regular-season record.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{results for}} the race showed MacDowall won big in most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> winning four out of five. Porter's support was concentrated in The Ridge where he won his only poll. MacDowall swept {{the south end of}} the district winning a shut out in the Métis communities of Duck Lake and St. Laurent de Grandin. Along with the shut out he held strong support in the rest of the riding, with his biggest single vote tally of votes coming form within the town of Prince Albert.|$|E
25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} <b>of</b> unpredictability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider <b>the</b> example <b>of</b> a political poll. Usually, such <b>polls</b> happen because <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> is not already known. In other words, <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> and learning <b>the</b> results gives some new information; these are just different ways <b>of</b> saying that <b>the</b> a priori entropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> results is large. Now, consider the case that <b>the</b> same <b>poll</b> is performed a second time shortly after <b>the</b> first <b>poll.</b> Since <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>poll</b> is already known, <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; {{in this case the}} a priori entropy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second <b>poll</b> result is small relative to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first.|$|R
25|$|While {{investigating}} complaints, constituency electoral committees or Central Electoral Commission may recount ballot papers, and, in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> discrepancies, draw up {{an additional}} vote counting record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> district and attach {{it to the}} vote counting record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polling</b> district.|$|R
50|$|Because no {{sampling}} frame {{is used to}} draw <b>the</b> sample <b>of</b> participants, open access polls may not have participants that represent the larger population. Indeed, they may be composed simply of individuals who happen to hear about <b>the</b> <b>poll.</b> As a consequence, <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll</b> cannot be generalized, but are only representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>poll.</b>|$|R
5|$|Entering the 2011 season, the Crimson Tide {{was ranked}} No.2 in the AP and Coaches' Preseason Polls. Alabama dropped {{no further than}} to No.3 {{in any of the}} rankings through week nine when they were ranked No.2 for their November 5 game against LSU. After their 9–6 loss against the Tigers, Alabama dropped to No.4 in all but the BCS {{standing}} where they dropped to No.3. The Crimson Tide regained their No.2 ranking in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> after Oklahoma State was upset by Iowa State, and retained the No.2 position {{through the end of the}} regular season to qualify for the BCS National Championship Game. After their victory over LSU in the BCS National Championship Game, Alabama was selected No.1 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 Trojans {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 12–1 record and shared the national title with the Louisiana State University (LSU) Tigers; USC won the Associated Press championship while LSU played for and won the BCS National Championship. The 2004 Trojans finished with a 13–0 record that included a win in the national championship game. The team became only the second team to be ranked first in the AP Poll from pre-season {{until the end of the}} season, and the tenth team to repeat as national champions. Returning fourteen starters from 2004, including Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Matt Leinart, and with a 22-game winning streak, the Trojans were ranked at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> once again in the pre-season.|$|E
5|$|The Huskies {{were unable}} to match their early success {{in the second half}} of the season, losing five of their next seven games. Everything went wrong for UConn in their game at North Carolina, as Frazer was intercepted three times and three Connecticut punts were blocked; North Carolina won in a blowout, 38–12. Against Big East rival Rutgers, UConn lost 12–10 as kicker Tony Ciaravino missed three field goals, {{including}} one with 1:09 left in the game that hit the right goalpost. The Huskies bounced back in their next game against eventual Big East champion Cincinnati, winning in a blowout 40–16. While not ranked in any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> after the win Connecticut found itself No.25 in the BCS standings. The Huskies would promptly give up that honor, losing to West Virginia 35–13 after leading 10–0 at the end of the first quarter and 13–7 at halftime. UConn would win the next week at Big East bottom-dweller Syracuse, 39–14, as Lorenzen returned from his injury. This would prove to be their last win of the regular season, as the Huskies finished with losses to South Florida (17–13) and No.23-ranked Pittsburgh (34–10). Connecticut ended the regular season with a record of 7–5, 3–4 within the Big East conference.|$|E

This phase of the election was held in 185,000 polling stations, serving an electorate of over 143.1million deciding the fate of 1,715 candidates.|$|E
25|$|Pollsters were {{puzzled by}} the failure of {{mainstream}} forecasting models to predict the 2016 election outcome. Sean Trende, writing for RealClearPolitics, wrote that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> were accurate, but that the pundits' interpretation of these polls neglected polling error. Nate Silver found that the high amount of undecided and third-party voters in the election were neglected in many of these models, and that many of these voters decided to vote for Trump.|$|E
25|$|Against the Tigers, neither team {{scored a}} {{touchdown}} and LSU {{won by a}} final score of 9–6 in overtime. With the loss, Alabama dropped into the No.3 BCS position prior to their game against Mississippi State. However, they regained the No.2 ranking in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> after Oklahoma State was upset by Iowa State, and they defeated the Bulldogs at Starkville. Alabama then closed the regular season with wins over both Georgia Southern and Auburn and finished in {{second place in the}} West division behind LSU.|$|E

25|$|At 10 pm on {{election}} day, {{coinciding with the}} closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> {{the results of an}} exit poll collected for the BBC, Sky and ITV news services were announced. Data were gathered from individuals at 130 polling stations around the country. The results of the poll initially suggested a hung parliament with the Conservative Party 19 seats from a controlling majority; this was later adjusted to 21 seats. The distribution of seats amongst the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and other parties was initially suggested to be 307, 255, 59 and 29 respectively, although the seat numbers were later changed to 303, 251, 69, and 27 respectively.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 2010 season, Pitt was {{selected}} as the preseason favorite to win the Big East and was ranked fifteenth in the preseason polls. However, Pitt stumbled out of the gate with an overtime loss at Utah and dropped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> {{for the remainder of the}} season. Although they claimed a share of the Big East championship (along with Connecticut and West Virginia), Pitt ended the regular season with a disappointing 7–5 record and an invitation to the BBVA Compass Bowl. This prompted Dave Wannstedt's resignation as head coach on December 7, 2010, with defensive coordinator Phil Bennett taking over for the bowl game.|$|E
