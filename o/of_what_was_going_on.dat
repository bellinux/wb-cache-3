5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's New York apartment with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few days}} after the death of Theodore II (the sources {{disagree}} on the exact date, although 25 August is the widely accepted date), a memorial service was held at the Monastery of Sosandra in Magnesia, founded by John III Vatatzes (r. 1221–1254) and serving as his and Theodore's burial place. The entire court attended, while the army was encamped on the plain below the monastery. As soon as George Mouzalon, his brothers and his retinue arrived, the service began. Outside the church, however, soldiers had assembled, many of them Latin mercenaries, and they began to clamour and demand to see the young emperor. John IV went outside and raised his hand to quiet them; the soldiers, however, allegedly mistook this as a signal. Joined by a large mob, they stormed the church aiming to kill the Mouzalon brothers. They were warned <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> but George only sent his secretary Theophylact to investigate. He was mistaken for Mouzalon and killed by the crowd. The mob, however, realized its error (the secretary was wearing black shoes, while the protovestiarios wore green ones) and entered the church, the soldiers with swords in hand.|$|E

25|$|During this period, Stieglitz became {{increasingly}} intrigued {{with a more}} modern visual aesthetics for photography. He became aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in avant-garde painting and sculpture and found that pictorialism no longer represented the future – it was the past. He was influenced in part by painter Charles Sheeler and by photographer Paul Strand. In 1915, Strand, who had been coming to see shows at 291 for many years, introduced Stieglitz to a new photographic vision that was embodied by the bold lines of everyday forms. Stieglitz {{was one of the}} first to see the beauty and grace of Strand's style, and he gave Strand a major exhibit at 291. He also devoted almost the entire last issue of Camera Work to his photographs.|$|E
25|$|The topical {{news program}} Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics {{was the first}} CNN program to feature a {{round-up}} of blogs in 2005. Blog coverage was expanded when Inside Politics was folded into The Situation Room (Inside Politics later returned to CNN in 2014, this time hosted by the network's chief national correspondent John King.). In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many {{still in high school}} or college.

25|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking questions when he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he looked better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on,</b> although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.|$|E
500|$|This episode marks Mark Snow's {{debut as}} a solo {{composer}} for the series. Carter stated he and the production crew were [...] "fearful" [...] of using too much music in the episode, and the first season as a whole. Anderson's voice over narration {{towards the end of}} the episode was inserted after complaints from Fox executives, who desired more closure.

[...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient. It's harder than you think and I got quite emotional." [...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, I could probably graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{alternative}} {{rock bands}} have cited My Bloody Valentine as an influence.

[...] The Smashing Pumpkins two successive studio albums, Siamese Dream (1993) and Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995), were also influenced by the band. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails praised Loveless musical diversity and production, Courtney Love cited the band as an influence on Hole's third album Celebrity Skin (1998) and the album has also been said {{to have made a}} considerable influence on Radiohead, particularly influencing the band's textured guitar sound. The Edge, guitarist of U2, cited Loveless as a major influence on the guitar sound on Achtung Baby (1991) and referred to My Bloody Valentine as [...] "head and shoulders above a lot <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> at the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in 2013, the European Food Safety Authority {{issued a}} {{declaration}} that three specific neonicotinoid pesticides pose an acute risk to honey bees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led {{one of the}} key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling, said the decision [...] "begs the question <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> when these chemicals were first approved." [...] The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was [...] "ready to work with" [...] the EC and member states. [...] In April 2013, the European Union voted for a two-year restriction on neonicotinoid insecticides. [...] The ban will restrict the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam for use on crops that are attractive to bees. Eight nations voted against the motion, including the British government, which [...] argued that the science was incomplete. The ban can be seen as an application of the [...] "precautionary principle", established at the 1992 Rio Conference on the Environment and Development, which advocates that [...] "lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." ...|$|E
500|$|Mercury booked the New York Dolls at The Record Plant in New York City, {{where they}} {{recorded}} their self-titled debut album in April 1973. Rundgren was originally {{concerned that they}} had taken [...] "the worst sounding studio in the city at that time" [...] {{because it was the}} only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: [...] "The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate." [...] New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of only $17,000. With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows.

500|$|Spock's {{death was}} shot over three days, during which no {{visitors}} were allowed on set. Spock's death {{was to be}} irrevocable, but Nimoy had such a positive experience during filming that he {{asked if he could}} add a way for Spock to return in a later film. The mind meld sequence was initially filmed without Kelley's prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on.</b> Shatner disagreed with having a clear glass separation between Spock and Kirk during the death scene; he instead wanted a translucent divider allowing viewers to see only Spock's silhouette, but his objection was overruled. During Spock's funeral sequence Meyer wanted the camera to track the torpedo that served as Spock's coffin as it was placed in a long trough and slid into the launcher. The camera crew thought the entire set would have to be rebuilt to accommodate the shot, but Sallin suggested putting a dolly into the trough and controlling it from above with an offset arm. Scott's rendition of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] on the bagpipes was James Doohan's idea. Kathleen Nicholson Graham recorded the bagpipes music at Paramount Studio with the orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the Chinese Ming dynasty {{fell to the}} {{rebellion}} of Li Zicheng (1606–1645) in 1644, yet his short-lived Shun dynasty was crushed by the Manchu invasion and the Han Chinese general Wu Sangui (1612–1678). China Daily states that when the following Qing dynasty replaced the Ming dynasty, it merely [...] "strengthened administration of Tibet." [...] However, Kolmaš states that the Dalai Lama was very observant <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> in China and accepted a Manchu invitation in 1640 to send envoys to their capital at Mukden in 1642, before the Ming collapsed. Dawa Norbu, William Rockhill, and George N. Patterson write that when the Shunzhi Emperor (r.1644–1661) of the subsequent Qing dynasty invited the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso to Beijing in 1652, Shunzhi treated the Dalai Lama as an independent sovereign of Tibet. Patterson writes {{that this was an}} effort of Shunzhi to secure an alliance with Tibet that would ultimately lead to the establishment of Manchu rule over Mongolia. In this meeting with the Qing emperor, Goldstein asserts that the Dalai Lama was not someone to be trifled with due to his alliance with Mongol tribes, some of which were declared enemies of the Qing.
