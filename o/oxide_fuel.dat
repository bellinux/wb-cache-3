40|$|The {{reference}} {{design of}} the ALh~R is a 471 MtVt modular breeder reactor. The reference fuel for this core is a metallic alloy of ~J, P~l, and Zr. In this study, the design of an alternative <b>oxide</b> <b>fueled</b> ALNIR is presented and compared with the reference design. Fuel utilization in the oxicle fuelecl core {{is not as good}} as in the reference ALMR, and a higher fissile inventory is therefore required. Also, an oxicle fueled burner is developed based on the alternative oxide fuelecl design ancl compared with a metallic fuelecl burner basecl on the reference design. This stllcly shows that when an <b>oxide</b> <b>fueled</b> burner is optimized within the same geometrical configuration and within the same limits and constraints as an optimal clesiguecl metallic fw elecl burner, the <b>oxide</b> <b>fueled</b> burner lmight perform as well as or even better than the metallic fuelecl burner...|$|R

25|$|Simply heating spent <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> in an inert {{atmosphere}} or vacuum at a temperature between 700°C and 1000°C {{as a first}} reprocessing step can remove several volatile elements, including caesium whose isotope caesium-137 emits {{about half of the}} heat produced by the spent fuel over the following 100 years of cooling (however, most of the other half is from strontium-90 which remains).|$|E

40|$|Nitride fuels {{have gained}} a new {{interest}} {{in the last few}} years as both a candidate for GEN IV reactors and as accident tolerant fuels for current light water reactors. They however are decades behind <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels</b> when it comes to qualication and development of tools to assess their performances. In this thesis, such a tool is developed. The fuel performance codeTRANSURANUS, which has very good results with <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels,</b> is extended to handle nitride fuels. The relevant thermo-mechanical properties are implemented and fuel type dependent modules are updated. Their limitations and discrepancies are discussed. A particular attention is brought to the athermal ssion gas release, and a new model based on the open fabrication porosity is developed and added to the code, as a starting point toward a mechanistic model. It works well on <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels,</b> but its eciency is harder to evaluate for nitride fuels, due to large uncertainties on many key correlations such as the thermal conductivity and the eective diusion coecient of gas atoms.

25|$|Solid <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> cells (SOFCs) use a solid material, most {{commonly}} a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), as the electrolyte. Because SOFCs are made entirely of solid materials, {{they are not}} limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes. They require high operating temperatures (800–1000°C) and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas.|$|E
25|$|RBMK reactor fuel {{was used}} in Soviet-designed and built RBMK-type reactors. This is a low-enriched uranium <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel.</b> The fuel {{elements}} in an RBMK are 3 m long each, and two of these sit back-to-back on each fuel channel, pressure tube. Reprocessed uranium from Russian VVER reactor spent fuel is used to fabricate RBMK fuel. Following the Chernobyl accident, the enrichment of fuel was changed from 2.0% to 2.4%, to compensate for control rod modifications {{and the introduction of}} additional absorbers.|$|E
25|$|The main {{by-product}} of enrichment is depleted uranium (DU), principally the U-238 isotope, with a U-235 content of ~0.3%. It is stored, either as UF6 or as U3O8. Some {{is used in}} applications where its extremely high density makes it valuable such as anti-tank shells, and {{on at least one}} occasion even a sailboat keel. It is also used with plutonium for making mixed <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> (MOX) and to dilute, or downblend, highly enriched uranium from weapons stockpiles which is now being redirected to become reactor fuel.|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, uranium {{nitrides}} {{constitute an}} alternative advanced nuclear fuel that has great prospects to replace actual <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels.</b> This interest {{is due to}} some very interesting physical properties: high thermal conductivity, very high melting point, and high density which are very appropriate for future fast breeder and high-temperature reactors (small core with high power density…).|$|R

40|$|This book {{presents}} {{the state of}} the art on thermophysical and thermochemical properties, fabrication methodologies, irradiation behaviours, fuel reprocessing procedures, and aspects of waste management for <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels</b> in general and for thoria-based fuels in particular.  The book covers all the essential features involved in the development of and working with nuclear technology. With the help of key databases, many of which were created by the authors, information is presented in the form of tables, figures, schematic diagrams and flow sheets, and photographs. This information will be useful for scientists and engineers working in the nuclear field, particularly for design and simulation, and for establishing the technology. One special feature is the inclusion of the latest information on thoria-based fuels, especially on the use of thorium in power generation, as it has less proliferation potential for nuclear weapons. Given its natural abundance, thorium offers a future alternative to uranium fuels in nuclear technology. In closing, the latest information on conventional uranium and plutonium fuels is also provided.

25|$|Reprocessing can {{potentially}} recover up to 95% {{of the remaining}} uranium and plutonium in spent nuclear fuel, putting it into new mixed <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel.</b> This produces a reduction in long term radioactivity within the remaining waste, since this is largely short-lived fission products, and reduces its volume by over 90%. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in Europe, Russia, Japan, and India. The full potential of reprocessing has not been achieved because it requires breeder reactors, which are not commercially available.|$|E
25|$|Voloxidation (for {{volumetric}} oxidation) involves heating <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> with oxygen, {{sometimes with}} alternating oxidation and reduction, or alternating oxidation by ozone to uranium trioxide with decomposition by heating back to triuranium octoxide. A major {{purpose is to}} capture tritium as tritiated water vapor before further processing {{where it would be}} difficult to retain the tritium. Other volatile elements leave the fuel and must be recovered, especially iodine, technetium, and carbon-14. Voloxidation also breaks up the fuel or increases its surface area to enhance penetration of reagents in following reprocessing steps.|$|E
25|$|Co-generation {{systems can}} reach 85% {{efficiency}} (40–60% electric + remainder as thermal). Phosphoric-acid fuel cells (PAFC) comprise the largest segment of existing CHP products worldwide and can provide combined efficiencies close to 90%.

Disadvantages of co-generation systems include slow ramping up and down rates, high cost and short lifetime. Also their need to have a hot water storage tank to smooth out the thermal heat production was a serious disadvantage in the domestic market place where space in domestic properties is at a great premium.|$|E
40|$|Electrometallurgical {{treatment}} is a compact, inexpensive method {{that is being}} developed at Argonne National Laboratory to deal with spent nuclear fuel, primarily metallic and <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels.</b> In this method, metallic nuclear fuel constituents are electrorefined in a molten salt to separate uranium {{from the rest of}} the spent <b>fuel.</b> <b>Oxide</b> and other <b>fuels</b> are subjected to appropriate head end steps to convert them to metallic form prior to electrorefining. The treatment process generates two kinds of high-level waste [...] a metallic and a ceramic waste. Isolation of these wastes has been developed as an integral part of the process. The wastes arise directly from the electrorefiner, and waste streams do not contain large quantities of solvent or other process fluids. Consequently, waste volumes are small and waste isolation processes can be compact and rapid. This paper briefly summarizes waste isolation processes then describes development and characterization of the two waste forms in more detail...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFluoride Volatility Method is {{regarded}} to be a promising advanced pyrochemical reprocessing technology, {{which can be}} used for reprocessing mainly of <b>oxide</b> spent <b>fuels</b> coming from current LWRs or future GEN IV fast reactors. The technology should be chiefly suitable for the reprocessing of advanced <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels</b> with inert matrixes of very high burn-up and short cooling time, which can be hardly reprocessed by hydrometallurgical technologies. Fluoride Volatility Method is based on direct fluorination of powdered spent fuel with fluorine gas in a flame fluorination reactor, where the volatile fluorides (mostly UF 6) are separated from the non-volatile ones (trivalent minor actinides and majority of fission products). The subsequent operations necessary for partitioning of volatile fluorides are condensation and evaporation of volatile fluorides, thermal decomposition of PuF 6 and finally distillation and sorption used for the purification of uranium product...|$|R

25|$|Since its {{inception}} as a nuclear facility, Sellafield {{has also been}} host to reprocessing operations, which separate the uranium, plutonium, and fission products from spent nuclear fuel. The uranium can then {{be used in the}} manufacture of new nuclear fuel, or in applications where its density is an asset. The plutonium can be used in the manufacture of mixed <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> (MOX) for thermal reactors, or as fuel for fast breeder reactors, such as the Prototype Fast Reactor at Dounreay. These processes, including the associated cooling ponds, require considerable amounts of water and the licence to extract water from Wast Water, formerly held by BNFL, is now held by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.|$|E
25|$|The first {{generation}} reprocessing plant {{was built to}} extract the plutonium from spent fuel to provide fissile material for the UK's atomic weapons programme, and for exchange with the United States through the US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement. It operated from 1951 until 1964, with an annual capacity of 300 tonnes (295 L/T) of fuel, or 750 tonnes (738 L/T) of low burn-up fuel. It was first used to reprocess fuel from the Windscale Piles, and was later repurposed to process fuel from UK Magnox reactors, however following the commissioning of the dedicated Magnox Reprocessing Plant, it was itself recycled to become a pre-handling plant to allow <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> to be reprocessed in the Magnox plant, and was closed in 1973.|$|E
25|$|In the {{fluoride}} volatility process, fluorine is {{reacted with}} the fuel. Fluorine {{is so much}} more reactive than even oxygen that small particles of ground <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> will burst into flame when dropped into a chamber full of fluorine. This is known as flame fluorination; the heat produced helps the reaction proceed. Most of the uranium, which makes up the bulk of the fuel, is converted to uranium hexafluoride, the form of uranium used in uranium enrichment, which has a very low boiling point. Technetium, the main long-lived fission product, is also efficiently converted to its volatile hexafluoride. A few other elements also form similarly volatile hexafluorides, pentafluorides, or heptafluorides. The volatile fluorides can be separated from excess fluorine by condensation, then separated from each other by fractional distillation or selective reduction. Uranium hexafluoride and technetium hexafluoride have very similar boiling points and vapor pressures, which makes complete separation more difficult.|$|E

There are, however, significantly less data available for these materials than conventional uranium dioxide fuel. In the present study, we employ molecular dynamics calculations to simulate the elastic properties and thermal expansivity of a range of mixed oxide compositions.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of thermal properties of actinide <b>oxide</b> <b>fuels</b> {{is a problem}} of high importance for the development of new generation reactors. In the present study, an expression obtained for n-dimensional Debye functions is used to derive a simple analytical expression for the specific heat capacity of nuclear fuels. To test the validity and reliability of this expression, the analytical expression is applied to UO 2, NpO 2, ThO 2, and PuO 2. It is seen that the formula was in agreement with the experimental and theoretical results reported in the literature...|$|R
25|$|The {{theoretical}} maximum {{efficiency of}} any type of power generation system is never reached in practice, {{and it does not}} consider other steps in power generation, such as production, transportation and storage of fuel and conversion of the electricity into mechanical power. However, this calculation allows the comparison of different types of power generation. The maximum theoretical energy efficiency of a fuel cell is 83%, operating at low power density and using pure hydrogen and oxygen as reactants (assuming no heat recapture) According to the World Energy Council, this compares with a maximum theoretical efficiency of 58% for internal combustion engines. While these efficiencies are not approached in most real world applications, high-temperature fuel cells (solid <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> cells or molten carbonate fuel cells) can theoretically be combined with gas turbines to allow stationary fuel cells to come closer to the theoretical limit. A gas turbine would capture heat from the fuel cell and turn it into mechanical energy to increase the fuel cell's operational efficiency. This solution has been predicted to increase total efficiency to as much as 80%.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} this effect {{is the use of}} nuclear fuels with thorium. Th-232 is a fertile {{material}} that can undergo a neutron capture reaction and two beta minus decays, resulting in the production of fissile U-233. The SNF of a cycle with thorium will contain U-233. Its radioactive decay will strongly influence the long-term activity curve of the SNF around a million years. A comparison of the activity associated to U-233 for three different SNF types {{can be seen in the}} figure on the top right. The burnt fuels are thorium with reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu), thorium with weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu) and Mixed <b>Oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> (MOX, no thorium). For RGPu and WGPu, the initial amount of U-233 and its decay around a million years can be seen. This has an effect in the total activity curve of the three fuel types. The initial absence of U-233 and its daughter products in the MOX fuel results in a lower activity in region 3 of the figure on the bottom right, whereas for RGPu and WGPu the curve is maintained higher due to the presence of U-233 that has not fully decayed. Nuclear reprocessing can remove the actinides from the spent fuel so they can be used or destroyed (see Long-lived fission product#Actinides).|$|E
25|$|During a meltdown, the {{temperature}} of the fuel rods increases and they can deform, in the case of Zircaloy cladding, above 700–900°C (1,292-1,652 °F). If the reactor pressure is low, the pressure inside the fuel rods ruptures the control rod cladding. High-pressure conditions push the cladding onto the fuel pellets, promoting formation of uranium dioxide–zirconium eutectic with a melting point of 1200–1400°C (2,192-2,552 °F). An exothermic reaction occurs between steam and zirconium, which may produce enough heat to be self-sustaining without the contribution of decay heat from radioactivity. Hydrogen is released in an amount of about 0.5m3 (17.65 cu. ft.) of hydrogen (at normal temperature/pressure) per kilogram of zircaloy oxidized. Hydrogen embrittlement may also occur in the reactor materials and volatile fission products can be released from damaged fuel rods. Between 1300 and 1500°C (2,372-2,732 °F), the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods melts, together with the evaporation of control rod cladding. At 1800°C (3,272 °F), the cladding oxides melt and begin to flow. At 2700–2800°C (4,892-5,072 °F) the uranium <b>oxide</b> <b>fuel</b> rods melt and the reactor core structure and geometry collapses. This can occur at lower temperatures if a eutectic uranium oxide-zirconium composition is formed. At that point, the corium is virtually free of volatile constituents that are not chemically bound, resulting in correspondingly lower heat production (by about 25%) as the volatile isotopes relocate.|$|E
