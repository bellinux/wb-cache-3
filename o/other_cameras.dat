500|$|Like Crazy {{was filmed}} over four weeks—the first three in Los Angeles {{and the last}} in London. The {{production}} budget was $250,000, which included the cost of airfares for the cast and crew. The film was shot on a Canon EOS 7D still camera with cinema lenses, mounted on a rig constructed by cinematographer John Guleserian. He chose the 7D for its portability and the ease it provided for shooting improvised scenes, where he found <b>other</b> <b>cameras</b> too cumbersome. Guleserian said {{that many of the}} film's scenes were shot [...] "really far away from our characters [...] really tight close ups" [...] due to the technological limitations of the camera, but he noted that this added to the tone of the film.|$|E
500|$|The {{television}} critic Julia Raeside {{discussed the}} unusual style of [...] "Cold Comfort", saying that [...] "You could argue [...] {{are at the}} stage in their careers where they don't need to experiment. No one else makes television like them and yet still they push themselves." [...] For Clare Murphy, writing in the Daily Mirror, the episode [...] "makes great use of CCTV split-screen footage". Dessau said that the set-up gave the episode [...] "its haunting flavour". Viewers do not just see Andy, but also streams from <b>other</b> <b>cameras,</b> which, for Dessau, [...] "makes the viewer both intrigued and anxious". Boyd, too, claimed that the episode played on the [...] "inherent creepiness" [...] of CCTV footage. She said that the split-screen set-up increased the tension, and that the [...] "gimmick is a good one"; though it could [...] "have worked well as a pleasing novelty on its own, [...] also makes this 'whodunit'/'who's doing it' a refreshingly inventive take on the genre".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{progresses}} mostly through footage streamed from a fixed {{camera in}} booth {{nine of the}} call centre setting. Streams from <b>other</b> <b>cameras</b> are displayed {{on the side of}} the screen, in the style of a CCTV feed. The idea was inspired by a clip of a serial killer's interview with the CIA which Shearsmith had seen online; this, too, had a main feed with three smaller feeds giving different views of the scene. The writers felt that the multiple screens both served a narrative function and raised the tension. For much of the episode, viewers simply watch characters taking calls. Extras are seen moving back and forth in the smaller screens, with Pemberton having initially been keen for things to be happening away from the main feed. However, he was somewhat frustrated with the result, with the same extra moving on numerous occasions throughout the episode. Shearsmith felt that a whole series filmed in the same manner [...] "would be a bit wearing on the eye", but that the style could be used for a single episode.|$|E

500|$|In November 2006, Crown Fountain {{became the}} focus of a public {{controversy}} when the city added surveillance cameras atop each tower. Purchased through a $52million Department of Homeland Security grant to the Chicago area, the cameras were part of a surveillance system augmenting eight <b>other</b> <b>cameras</b> covering all of Millennium Park. The city said the cameras, similar to those used throughout the city at high-crime areas and traffic intersections, were intended to remain on the towers for several months until permanent, less intrusive replacements were secured. City officials had consulted the architects who collaborated with Plensa on the tower designs, but Plensa himself had not been notified. Public reaction was negative, as bloggers and the artistic community decried the cameras on the towers as inappropriate and a blight. [...] The city said that the cameras were largely for security reasons, but also partly to help park officials monitor burnt-out lights. The Chicago Tribune quickly published an article concerning the cameras as well as the public reaction, and the cameras were removed the next day. Plensa supported their removal.|$|E
2500|$|The airframe, {{engine and}} crew {{compartments}} were retained from the ANT-25 almost unchanged, although the co-pilot's and navigator's positions were each given one [...] DA machine gun for defense. The DB-1 (long-range bomber model 1), {{as it was}} designated in VVS service, was given a smooth skin and a bomb bay {{was built in the}} wing center section that carried ten [...] FAB-100 bombs nose-up. An AFA-14 camera was mounted in the rear cockpit, but <b>other</b> <b>cameras</b> could be carried instead of the bombs.|$|E
2500|$|Such HDR imaging is used {{in extreme}} dynamic range {{applications}} like welding or automotive work. Some <b>other</b> <b>cameras</b> designed for use in security applications can automatically provide two or more images for each frame, with changing exposure [...] For example, a sensor for 30fps video will give out 60fps with the odd frames at a short exposure time and the even frames at a longer exposure time. Some of the sensor may even combine the two images on-chip so that a wider dynamic range without in-pixel compression is directly available to the user for display or processing.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2013, the Nexus 5 began {{receiving}} the Android 4.4.1 update, which fixed issues with auto focus, white balance, HDR+ and <b>other</b> <b>camera</b> issues, while introducing some <b>other</b> <b>camera</b> issues for low-light scenes. It also fixes low speaker volume output in certain applications. [...] Android 4.4.2 update followed {{in a few}} days, providing further bugfixes and security improvements. In early June 2014, the Nexus 5 received Android 4.4.3 update that included dozens of bug fixes,while another mid-June 2014 Android 4.4.4 update included a fix for an OpenSSL man-in-the-middle vulnerability.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{types of}} [...] "Prestwich Camera" [...] were {{manufactured}} in the late 19th century. One of the earliest designs of this type held 50 ft of film—more film than any <b>other</b> <b>camera</b> of the age.|$|R
2500|$|The Exif format has {{standard}} tags for location information. [...] many {{cameras and}} mobile phones have a built-in GPS receiver that stores the location {{information in the}} Exif header when a picture is taken. Some <b>other</b> <b>cameras</b> have a separate GPS receiver that fits into the flash connector or hot shoe. Recorded GPS data can also be added to any digital photograph on a computer, either by correlating the time stamps of the photographs with a GPS record from a hand-held GPS receiver or manually by using a map or mapping software. The process of adding geographic information to a photograph is known as geotagging. Photo-sharing communities like Panoramio, locr or Flickr equally allow their users to upload geocoded pictures or to add geolocation information online.|$|E
2500|$|Aragno {{said that}} he and Godard did not want to use 3D as a typical special effect or gimmick. Instead, they wished to use it [...] "to express new things." [...] Several cameras were used, but the {{majority}} was shot on the Canon 5D and the Canon 1DC. <b>Other</b> <b>cameras</b> included GoPros and Lumixes. Aragno used Leica lenses on the Canons [...] "because the Canon lenses are too perfect... How can {{you fall in love with}} a digitally perfect person? To err is human! The Leica lenses have some involuntary imperfections." [...] The Canon cameras allowed them to shoot most of the film using natural or available light sources. Godard intentionally framed shots for 3D images, such as when the character's shadows are in 2D but the sidewalk is in 3D. The dog in the film is Godard's own pet Roxy Miéville, whom Godard would film whenever he took him for a walk. Godard used consumer cameras from Fujifilm and Sony for these shots. Aragno also shot some footage independently before production officially began, including shots of his two children running around olive trees.|$|E

50|$|Thus, {{starting}} with the first FD lenses produced in late 1970, all FD lenses had the capability of supporting full-aperture metering and multiple Automatic Exposure (AE) modes using both shutter-preferred and aperture-preferred modes. Even Programmed AE was possible with no modifications to the lens mount, though {{at the time of}} its introduction Canon did not have an AE camera body in the FD line. This was a design triumph for Canon that no <b>other</b> <b>camera</b> or lens maker was able to equal in 1970. Every <b>other</b> <b>camera</b> manufacturer had to make one or more alterations to its lens mount to enable full aperture metering, and later AE and or Programmed AE operation.|$|R
50|$|The Konica F also {{featured}} a 1/125 flash sync, whereas <b>other</b> <b>cameras</b> {{of the time}} offered 1/30 to 1/60 sync.|$|E

50|$|The major {{35mm camera}} manufacturers, Canon, Minolta, Nikon, and Pentax {{were among the}} few {{companies}} to transition successfully to autofocus. <b>Other</b> <b>camera</b> manufacturers also introduced functionally successful autofocus SLRs but these cameras were not as successful.

50|$|Due to {{the high}} market {{penetration}} of EF-mount lenses, <b>other</b> <b>camera</b> manufacturers began to offer EF-mount cameras. Since the EF-mount was created for SLR cameras with their long focal flange distance, mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras can use EF lenses with a mechanical adaptor that bridges the distance.|$|R
50|$|This feature distinguishes SLRs from <b>other</b> <b>cameras</b> as the {{photographer}} sees the image composed {{exactly as it}} will be captured on the film or sensor (see Advantages below).|$|E
