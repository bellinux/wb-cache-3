40|$|This report {{describes}} an experimental and analytical {{investigation of the}} strength and ductility of reinforced concrete columns. Four columns of square cross-section were tested under axial compression loading and cyclic lateral loading applied at mid-height which simulated seismic loading. The main variable investigated was the quantity of <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> steel used, which ranged between 17 to 46 percent of the NZS 3101 : 1982 recommended quantity for ductile detailing. The experimental results are reported {{in the form of}} lateral load-displacement and lateral load-curvatures hysteresis loops, curvature profiles, transverse steel strain distributions and concrete compressive strains. The results are discussed and compared with the analytical predict-ions. A modified equation for the quantity of confining reinforcement in rectangular columns is recommended. Conclusions are made regarding the ductility available from columns containing substantially less <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> reinforcement than recommended by the New Zealand concrete design code. i...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} recent Floquet-realisation of the Harper-Hofstadter model in a gas of cold bosonic atoms. We study {{in detail the}} {{scattering}} processes in this system in the weakly interacting regime due to the interplay of particle interactions and the explicit time dependence of the Floquet states that lead to band transitions and heating. We focus on the experimentally used parameters and explicitly model the <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> direction. Based on transition rates computed within the Floquet-Fermi golden rule we obtain band population dynamics which are {{in agreement with the}} dynamics observed in experiment. Finally, we discuss whether and how photon-assisted collisions that may be the source heating and band population dynamics might be suppressed in the experimental setup by appropriate design of the <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> potential. The suppression of such processes will become increasingly important as the experiments progress into simulating strongly interacting systems in the presence of artificial gauge fields.

40|$|Abstract We review recent {{theoretical}} and experimental ef-forts toward developing an all-optical switch based on trans-verse <b>optical</b> patterns. <b>Transverse</b> <b>optical</b> patterns are formed when counterpropagating laser beams interact with a nonlinear medium. A perturbation, {{in the form}} of a weak switch beam injected into the nonlinear medium, controls the orientation of the generated patterns. Each state of the pattern orientation is associated with a state of the switch. That is, information is stored in the orientation state. A realization of this switch using a warm rubidium vapor shows that it can be actuated by as few as 60040 photons with a response time of 5 µs. Models of non-linear optical interactions in semiconductor quantum wells and microresonators suggest these systems are also suitable for use as fast all-optical switches using this same conceptual design, albeit at higher switching powers. A pair of counterpropagating beams induce an instability that generates <b>transverse</b> <b>optical</b> patterns. (A) Two spots form the unperturbed far-field pattern.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} analyze a quasi-two-dimensional {{system of}} fermionic polar molecules in a harmonic <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> potential. The renormalized energy bands are calculated by solving the Hartree-Fock equation numerically for various trap and dipolar interaction strengths. The inter-subband excitations {{of the system}} are studied in the conserving time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) approximation {{from the perspective of}} lattice modulation spectroscopy experiments. We find that the excitation spectrum consists of both inter-subband particle-hole excitation continuums and anti-bound excitons, arising from the anisotropic nature of dipolar interactions. The excitonic modes capture the majority of the spectral weight. We also evaluate the inter-subband transition rates in order to investigate the nature of the excitonic modes and find that they are anti-bound states formed from particle-hole excitations arising from several subbands. Our results indicate that the excitonic effects are present for interaction strengths and temperatures accessible in current experiments with polar molecules. Comment: 21 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{method for}} calculating the {{external}} mass transfer in a contactor with a <b>transverse</b> <b>confined</b> flow of a viscous incompressible liquid (gas) past hollow fibers at low Reynolds numbers is proposed.

As a simplest model system, a row of parallel fibers is considered, for which dependences of a drag force and an efficiency of a solute retention on the inter-fiber distance, membrane mass transfer coefficient, Peclet and Reynolds numbers are computed. The influence of the fluid inertia on the mass transport is studied. It is shown that a linear Stokes equations can be used for as higher Re numbers, as denser is the fiber array. In this case the flow field is independent on the Re number, and analytical solutions for the flowfield and fiber sorption efficiency (fiber Sherwood number) can be used...|$|R

40|$|The {{two-body}} {{bound and}} scattering properties in an one-dimensional harmonic waveguide close to free space magnetic Feshbach resonances are investigated {{based on the}} local frame transformation approach within a single partial wave approximation. An energy and magnetic field dependent free space phase shift is adopted in the current theoretical framework. For both s- and p-wave interaction, the least bound state in the waveguide dissociates into the continuum at the resonant magnetic field where the effective one-dimensional scattering length a_ 1 D diverges. Consequently, the association of atoms into molecules in the waveguide occurs when the magnetic field is swept adiabatically across the pole of a_ 1 D. In the vicinity of broad s-wave resonances, the resonant magnetic field is nearly independent on the <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> frequency ω_ of the waveguide.

40|$|<b>Transverse</b> <b>confining</b> {{stress in}} {{concrete}} members, commonly provided by transverse reinforcement, {{has been recognized}} to enhance strength and ductility. Nowadays, the confining method has been further developed to external confinement approach. This type of confinement {{can be used for}} retrofitting existing concrete columns. Many external confining techniques have been proven to be successful in retrofitting circular columns. However, for square or rectangular columns, providing effective confining stress by external retrofitting method is not a simple task due to high stress concentration at column’s corners. This paper proposes an analytical model to predict the peak strength of square concrete columns confined by external steel collars. Comparison with the experimental results showed that the model can predict the peak strength reasonably well. However, {{it should be noted that}} relatively larger amount of steel is needed to achieve comparable column strength enhancement when it is compared with those of conve tional internally-confined columns...|$|R
40|$|A phase-only {{hologram}} applies a modal transformation to an <b>optical</b> <b>transverse</b> spatial mode via phase encoding {{and intensity}} masking.

In this Letter, we present a method to encode the amplitude and the phase of an optical field into a phase-only hologram, which allows the exact control of spatial transverse modes. Any intensity masking method modulates the amplitude and alters the phase of the optical field. Our method consists in correcting for this unwanted phase alteration by modifying the phase encryption accordingly.

40|$|Abstract. The {{field of}} {{radiation}} emission from electron beams is reviewed with special reference to work related to free-electron lasers. Different schemes o f interaction in periodic structures, electromagnetic slow-wave structures, and in <b>transverse</b> <b>confining</b> force are distinguished. Various effects and {{devices such as}} traveling wave amplifiers, Smith-Purcell radiators, Cerenkov and bremsstrahlung-free electron lasers, cyclotron resonance masers, coherent bremsstrahlung and channeling radiation are discussed and the differences and relations among them are explained. A simple comprehensive model is developed to describe electron-beam interaction with an electromagnetic wave in periodic electromagnetic structures. The model is general enough to describe both collective and single-electron modes of iiateraction and quantum mechanical, classical and Fermi degenerate regimes. Simplified expressions are developed for the gain by stimulated emission of radiation and for gain conditions of the Smith-Purcell-Cerenkov type free-electron lasers under conditions of very thin electron beams and infinite interaction length.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates {{three different}} optical instabilities: cw conical emission, bifurcations of <b>optical</b> <b>transverse</b> solitary waves, and asymmetric gain modification in a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL). The first two instabilities occur in sodium vapor while the third {{occurs in a}} new type of semiconductor laser. For the conical emission instability, the first comparison and agreement between theory and experiment is given. The conical emission process is modeled as a series of nonlinear effects including self-trapping of the pump beam, Doppler-broadened Raman-gain amplification of Doppler-broadened resonance fluorescence, propagational four-wave mixing, and diffraction and pump-induced refraction of the new frequencies. Each step of the emission process is thoroughly examined and explained. Detailed comparisons are made between experimental observables and numerical calculations including near-field and far-field spatial profiles, frequency spectra, and cone angles. All comparisons show good agreement. In a different but related experiment, bifurcations of <b>optical</b> <b>transverse</b> solitary waves are studied for one-way propagation through a sodium vapor cell. Two types of phase encoding seed transverse bifurcations which result in transverse cell-exit profiles with the beauty rivaling that of a kaleidoscope. The cell-exit profiles are stationary in time, reproduce completely when the power or frequency is scanned, and agree well with one-way computations. Evidence is also presented for the first observation of a double-peaked Raman gain. In the third experiment, a temporal instability is examined in a GaAs VCSEL. Strong evidence is presented for an asymmetric gain modification induced when a strong optical signal is injected into the Fabry-Perot transmission peak of the VCSEL while it is lasing. This gain modification results in increased absorption on the high frequency side of the injected signal and increased gain on the low frequency side as manifested by the formation of an optical sideband. The frequency of the sideband depends on the intensity of the injected signal with frequencies (> 50 GHz) well beyond the predicted relaxation oscillation frequency being observed. Very efficient nondegenerate four-wave mixing is also observed...|$|R
