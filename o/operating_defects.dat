40|$|We study {{anticipated}} synchronization in two complex Ginzburg-Landau systems coupled in a master-slave configuration. Master and slave {{systems are}} {{ruled by the}} same autonomous function, but the slave system receives the injection from the master and is subject to a negative delayed self-feedback loop. We give evidence that {{the magnitude of the}} largest anticipation time depends on the dynamical regime where the system <b>operates</b> (<b>defect</b> turbulence, phase turbulence or bichaos) and scales with the linear autocorrelation time of the system. Moreover, we find that the largest anticipation times are obtained for complex-valued coupling constants. We provide analytical conditions for the stability of the anticipated synchronization manifold that are in qualitative agreement with those obtained numerically. Finally, we report on the existence of anticipated synchronization in coupled two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau systems. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Client access over a WAN was not recommended because of poor performance related to the network traffic overhead of file I/O redirection and because of increased risk of database corruption. Although automation was possible, maintenance of large numbers of databases, each with relatively few users, was undesirable compared to highly centralized client/server systems where client access could be reliably provided over a WAN.|$|R

In the present paper, methods used for calculating blade temperature and life are demonstrated and validated. Using these methods, a set of sensitivity analyses on the parameters affecting temperature and life of a high pressure, high temperature turbine first stage blade is carried out. Investigated uncertainties are: (1) blade coating thickness, (2) coolant inlet pressure and temperature (as a result of secondary air system), and (3) gas turbine load variation. Results show that increasing thermal barrier coating thickness by 3 times, leads to rise in the blade life by 9 times. In addition, considering inlet cooling temperature and pressure, deviation in temperature has greater effect on blade life. One of the interesting points that can be realized from the results is that 300 hours operation at 70 % load can be equal to one hour operation at base load...|$|R
40|$|Background: Large posteromedial defects {{encountered}} in severe varus knees during primary total knee arthroplasty {{can be treated}} by cementoplasty, structural bone grafts or metallic wedges. The option is selected depending upon {{the size of the}} defect. We studied the outcome of autograft (structural and impaction bone grafting) reconstruction of medial tibial bone defects encountered during primary total knee replacement in severe varus knees. Materials and Methods: Out of 675 primary varus knees <b>operated,</b> bone <b>defects</b> in proximal tibia were {{encountered in}} 54 knees. Posteromedial defects involving 25 - 40 % of the tibial condyle cut surface and measuring more than 5 mm in depth were grafted using a structural graft obtained from cut distal femur or proximal tibia in 48 knees. For larger, peripheral uncontained vertical defects in six cases, measuring > 25 mm in depth and involving > 40 % cut surface of proximal tibial condyle, impaction bone grafting with a mesh support was used. Results: Bone grafts incorporated in 54 knees in 6 months. There was no graft collapse or stress fractures, loosening or nonunion. The average followup period was 7. 8 years (range 5 - 10 years). We observed an average postoperative increase in the Knee Society Score from 40 to 90 points. There was improvement in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores in terms of pain, stiffness and physical function during activities of daily living. Conclusion: Bone grafting for defects in primary total knee is justified as it is biological, available then and is cost effective besides preserving bone stock for future revisions. Structural grafts should be used in defects > 5 mm deep and involving 25 - 40 % of the cut proximal tibial condyle surface. For larger peripheral vertical defects, impaction bone grafting contained in a mesh should be done...|$|R

In 7 of the 19 <b>operated</b> fetuses the <b>defect</b> was left uncovered. In the remaining 12 animals the defect was covered either with a collagen biomatrix (4 animals), skin (3 animals), or small intestinal submucosa biomatrix (5 animals). The lambs were sacrificed at 1 week of age and histological examination was performed. RESULTS: All lambs with an uncovered neural tube defect showed histological damage of the spinal cord. In lambs in which the neural tube defect was covered, one half showed a normal architecture of the spinal cord while minor histological damage was present in the other half. Between the three groups in which the defect was covered, the histological outcome was comparable.

In stacks with Ge directly contacted with Sc 2 O 3, without an additional O-supply processing step, ESR reveals the presence of a prominent signal of powder pattern shape, centered at g = 2. 0017 (2). It is ascribed to O-deficiency centers located in the Sc 2 O 3 -based dielectric, which from combined electrical analysis are concluded to be at the origin of substantial electron trapping (similar to 6 x 10 (12) cm(- 2)) in near-interfacial layers.

Certain of the specificities of these autoantibodies correlated with the documented pathophysiology of mev mice (antithymocyte, -erythrocyte, -skin, - kidney, and -IgG); others were specific for autoantigens not previously observed in motheaten mice but though to be involved in other autoimmune diseases (e. g., intrinsic factor, transferrin, myelin basic protein, and thyroglobulin). About 2 of 3 (11 / 17) of the self-reactive antibodies exhibited multispecific binding activity for various autoantigens. Analysis by Northern blotting of the V gene families used in mev autoantibodies showed a random usage of VH families and a biased usage of four Vk gene families.

40|$|Capacitance-voltage (C-V) and current-voltage (I-V) {{measurements}} {{were used to}} {{study the effects of}} photocathodic charging of hydrogen in boron doped (4. 5 • 1018 cm-~) crystalline silicon. The electrolyte was a 5 % hydrofluoric solution. Within the first minutes of hydrogenation, a negative charge variation occurs at the surface, due to the formation of a thin hydride-like layer. The hydrogen charging {{over an extended period of}} time ( [...] - 30 h) results in a drastic increase in the reverse dark current ID. This effect can be totally suppressed when the electrodes are stepped to rest-potential (0 bias) for about 20 min. The resulting I-V characteristics are similar to those obtained for a nonhydrogenated sample. However, the surfaces exhibit a rough aspect, and ellipsometry measurements show that an amorphized layer is present. Secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements reveal that hydrogen (deuterium) is also injected up to 100 nm depth. It is concluded that an amorphous hydrogenated layer forms during an electrolytical charging, clue to the incorporation of a high density of hydrogen atoms within the surface region. The raise of ID is ascribed to hydrogen-induced <b>defects,</b> <b>operating</b> as electron-hole generation centers.

The concept of a “critical thickness” for the introduction of misfit dislocations in a strained layer will be considered, and X-ray topography and electron microscopy results will be presented which demonstrate {{that the concept of}} a critical thickness is not as well defined as previously supposed. Theoretical considerations for the source of misfit dislocations in epilayers grown on dislocation free substrates indicate that surface sources are improbable in low mismatched systems at typical growth temperatures, however the experimental evidence is that the nucleation of misfit dislocations is relatively easy. A new regenerative source with unique properties has been identified in the GeSi/Si system and we have called this source the diamond defect because of its diamond shape (it is a four-sided planar fault on a { 111 } plane with sides so that two opposing internal angles are 60 ° and the other two are 120 °).

Test results were related to perioperative and neurodevelopmental outcome. Compared to healthy children and not significantly different between the groups, internalizing and externalizing problems were elevated, school performance and total competence were reduced, and self- and parent-reported quality of life was not reduced. Parent-reported problems and reduced physical status were correlated with longer durations of DHCA and CPB. Internalizing and externalizing problems, reduced school competence, and reduced self-esteem were associated with reduced endurance capacity. Externalizing problems were related to reduced gross motor function. Poor school competence was related to reduced intelligence and academic achievement. Children with preoperative hypoxemia in infancy due to cyanotic cardiac defects are not at significantly higher risk for behavioral problems and reduced quality of life than those with acyanotic heart defects. The risk of long-term psychosocial maladjustment after corrective surgery in infancy is increased compared to that for normal children and related to the presence of neurodevelopmental dysfunction.

Here we extend the characterization of the innate immune defect in CD by investi-gating the macrophage response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and assess potential links between genome-wide association study (GWAS) susceptibility loci, disease phenotype, and therapeutic regimens on tumor necrosis factor a (TNF) release. Methods: Peripheral blood-derived macrophages were cultured from control subjects and patients with CD, stimulated with TLR ligands, and the release of TNF measured. Genomic DNA was purified from blood and genotyped for 34 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified as being associated with CD by GWAS. Results: All stimuli resulted in a reduction (32 %– 48 %) in TNF release from macrophages derived from CD patients (n 28 – 101) compared to those from healthy control (HC) subjects. All phenotypes demonstrated impaired TNF release, with the greatest defect in patients with colonic disease. There was no detectable relationship between the level of TNF released and the presence of GWAS susceptibility loci in CD patients. Reduced TNF levels were not influenced by age, gender, or use of aminosalicylate (5 -ASA) medication. Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis of defective proinflammatory cytokine secretion and an innate immunodeficiency in CD.

In order to test this hypothesis, we assessed different quantitative and functional parameters indicative of T cell reactivity in atopic dermatitis patients and, for control purposes, in age-matched normal individuals. We found that mononuclear cells from atopic dermatitis patients proliferated in response to various concentrations of the mitogens concanavalin A (Con A) and phytohemagglutinin as well as did mononuclear cells from controls. However, atopic dermatitis patients, regardless of their clinical characteristics, have {{a significant decrease in}} the relative percentages of circulating total E rosette forming cells. The reduction in total T cell percentages may be due, in part, to a highly significant reduction in the percentages of Fc-IgG receptor bearing T cells (Tγ cells) that we found in atopic dermatitis patients at every level of clinical involvement. Fc-IgM receptor bearing T cell values (Tμ cells) were found to be within the normal range. A defect related to the severity of the eczematous eruption was revealed when we investigated the capability of Con A-activated mononuclear cells from either atopics or normals to suppress mitogenic responses of autologous and allogeneic mononuclear cells. We found that cells from atopic dermatitis patients with wide-spread clinical involvement could not be educated to express suppressor signals as effectively as could cells from clinically inactive patients or normal healthy individuals. Based on these findings, we propose that a regulatory cell <b>defect</b> <b>operating</b> at the T cell level participates in the pathogenesis of various aspects of atopic dermatitis...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 103 Competitive {{marketplace}} {{pressures for}} higher quality products with consistent material properties at lower cost {{are changing the}} face of chemical process manufacturing facilities. More frequently today, critical equipment is installed in unspared service with minimal onsite spare parts, yet demanded to <b>operate</b> reliably without <b>defects</b> for greater periods of time. An important component that helps make this possible is the emergence of increasingly more powerful and lower cost online condition monitoring systems for early failure diagnosis. These systems have moved into the relatively inhospitable chemical plant environment, capability that until recently was largely the domain of the engineering laboratory. High-frequency dynamic measurement, with automated statistical and mathematical post-processing, is now available live, remotely, via the Internet across the globe. This paper examines this technology in applications with several high-pressure process diaphragm pumping systems. Many key learnings are explored along with advances in system design that have been developed as a result of application of these techniques. Numerous real examples illustrate how to recognize improper precharge of gas-padded pulsation dampeners, and even correct while operating. Examples include diagnosis of excess internal leakage, with means to trace further to check valves or other pump internal sources. Fluid property changes, pulsation, and other problems can be diagnosed remotely. Shared in considerable experience gained {{over the past two years}} during continuous monitoring on both laboratory and real plant systems. This enables precise knowledge of trends in behavior and root causes so corrective action can be planned, parts and expertise made available, and downtime eliminated or minimized...|$|R
40|$|The {{localisation}} {{of electromagnetic}} energy at a defect in a photonic crystal {{is similar to}} a well known effect employed to construct high-Q microwave resonators: In a whispering gallery (WHG-) mode resonator the high Q-factor is achieved by localisation of the electromagnetic field energy by total reflection inside a disk made of dielectric material. The topic of this work is to demonstrate, that WHG-like modes can exist in an air defect in a photonic crystal that extends over several lattice periods; and that a high-Q microwave resonator can be made, utilizing these resonant modes. In numerical simulations, the transmission properties of a photonic crystal structure with hexagonal lattice symmetry have been investigated with a transfer-matrix-method. The eigenmodes of a defect structure in a photonic crystal have been calculated with a quasi- 3 d finite element integration technique. Experimental results confirm the simulated transmission properties and show the existence of modes inside the band gap, when a defect is introduced in the crystal. Resonator measurements show that a microwave resonator can be <b>operated</b> with those <b>defect</b> modes. It was found out that the main losses of the resonator were caused by bad microwave properties of the used dielectric material and by metal losses on the top and bottom resonator walls. Furthermore, {{it turned out that the}} detection of the photonic crystal defect mode was difficult because of a lack of simulation possibilities and high housing mode density in the resonator.

40|$|SUMMARY In {{a patient}} with {{juvenile}} nephronophthisis, sector retinitis pigmentosa was found as an extrarenal manifestation, establishing a hitherto undescribed variety of retinal degeneration occurring in this disorder. The retinal function {{in this case was}} identical with that in the classic type of sector retinitis pigmentosa, namely, subnormal ERG amplitudes but normal cone and rod implicit times. The range of the retinal findings and their autosomal recessive transmission are discussed. Paucity of information makes it difficult to elucidate the basic genetic <b>defect</b> <b>operating</b> in this condition. Juvenile nephronophthisis (Fanconi et al., 1951) and medullary cystic disease (Smith and Graham, 1945) are hereditary conditions characterised clinically by failure to thrive, anaemia, hyposthenuria, and salt craving, followed by early uraemia. The consensus of most observers is that these diseases are identical, and owing to their clinical and pathological simi-larities they have been grouped together (Mongeau and Worthen, 1967). The presence of extrarenal manifestations in juvenile nephronophthisis is obvious (Mainzer et al., 1970; Boichis et al., 1973), and the most frequent allied condition is tapeto-retinal degeneration (Senior et al., 1961). There is ample evidence of such an association in familial cases, and it appears to be due to a pleiotropic effect of the gene involved and not a coincidence of symptoms. A common genetic background for the renal and retinal disor-ders has been postulated and autosomal recessive inheritance invoked. We report here a new case ofjuvenile nephronoph-thisis which involved a type of retinal degeneration not yet reported in connection with this complex renal disorder.
