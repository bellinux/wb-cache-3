Application of glycolic acid or xanthine, serving as substrates {{for the formation of}} H 2 O 2, increased the peroxide content of the tissue and accelerated the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> as measured by increased softening and ethylene evolution. Application of ethylene also induced increased peroxide levels. Ripening processes were similarly promoted when peroxides were conserved by inhibiting the activity of catalase with hydroxylamine or potassium cyanide. By comparison, the inhibition of glycolate oxidase with alphahydroxy- 2 -pyridinemethanesulfonic acid decreased the peroxide content of the tissue and delayed the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> These results indicate that the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> correlates with the peroxide content of fruit tissues as occurring under normal conditions or as influenced by the treatments.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between hyphal growth and branching of the grape pathogen Botrytis cinerea was determined on solid media containing either glucose, fructose, sucrose, tartaric acid or malic acid. The {{concentration of the}} carbon source {{had little effect on}} specific growth rate or the specific rate of tip formation, but growth was inhibited at high concentrations of tartaric and malic acids. Hyphal growth unit length and hyphal extension rate increased with increasing sugar concentration and were always significantly greater than values on tartaric or malic acids. The data provide an explanation for colonization patterns of grape berries. Growth will be poor during the period from setting to the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> when organic acids are the main carbon source produced by the berry. Following the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> the production of sugars provides more favourable carbon sources for the fungus, enabling achievement of higher specific growth rates, greater hyphal extension rates and, hence, greater colonizing potential. Botrytis cinerea Pers. is the causal agent of an important ripe rot disease of grapes, seriously damaging the berries between the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> (the stage referred to by vignerons as veraison) and harvest (Verhoeff, 1980).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{mechanisms that}} control fruit development, {{we have begun}} experiments to identify proteins that control gene expression during tomato fruit ripening. We focused on the regulation of two different genes, E 4 and E 8, whose transcription is coordinately activated at the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening.</b> We report here that a DNA-binding protein specifically reacts with similar sequences flanking the E 4 and E 8 genes. The E 4 binding site is at position - 34 to - 18 and, therefore, overlaps the region (TATA box) that in many eukaryotic genes serves to determine the efficiency and initiation site of transcription. In contrast, the E 8 binding site is distal, located at - 936 to - 920 relative {{to the start of}} E 8 gene transcription. Gel electrophoresis mobility retardation experiments indicate that the DNA binding activity that interacts with these two sites increases at the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening.</b> Taken together, these results suggest that this DNA-binding protein may function to coordinate E 4 and E 8 gene expression during fruit ripening...|$|R

40|$|Identification of {{potential}} target genes for the tomato fruit-ripening regulator RIN by chromatin immunoprecipitation Masaki Fujisawa, Toshitsugu Nakano, Yasuhiro Ito * Background: During ripening, climacteric fruits increase their ethylene level and subsequently undergo various physiological changes, such as softening, pigmentation {{and development of}} aroma and flavor. These changes occur simultaneously and are caused by the highly synchronized expression of numerous genes at the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> In tomatoes, the MADS-box transcription factor RIN has been regarded as a key regulator responsible for the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> by acting upstream of both ethylene- and non-ethylene-mediated controls. However, except for LeACS 2, direct targets of RIN have not been clarified, and {{little is known about}} the transcriptional cascade for ripening.

40|$|The <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> {{involves}} {{changes in}} sugar metabolism, softening, and color development. Most {{understanding of this}} process arises from work in climacteric fruits where the control of ripening is predominately by ethylene. However, many fruits such as grape are nonclimacteric, where the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> results from the integration of multiple hormone signals including sugars and abscisic acid (ABA). In this study, we identified ten orthologous gene families in Vitis vinifera containing components of sugar and ABA-signaling pathways elucidated in model systems, including PP 2 C protein phosphatases, and WRKY and homeobox transcription factors. Gene expression was characterized in control- and deficit-irrigated, field-grown Cabernet Sauvignon. Sixty-seven orthologous genes were identified, and 38 of these were expressed in berries. Of the genes expressed in berries, 68 % were differentially expressed across development and/or in response to water deficit. Orthologs of several families were induced at the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> and induced earlier and to higher levels in response to water deficit; patterns of expression that correlate with sugar and ABA accumulation during ripening. Similar to field-grown berries, ripening phenomena were induced in immature berries when cultured with sucrose and ABA, as evidenced by changes in color, softening, and gene expression. Finally, exogenous sucrose and ABA regulated key orthologs in culture, similar to their regulation in the field. This study identifies novel candidates in the control of nonclimacteric fruit ripening and demonstrates that grape orthologs of key sugar and ABA-signaling components are regulated by sugar and ABA in fleshy fruit...|$|E
40|$|Fruit {{ripening}} {{is divided}} into climacteric and non-climacteric types depending on {{the presence or absence}} of a transient rise in respiration rate and the production of autocatalytic ethylene. Melon is ideal for the study <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening,</b> as both climacteric and non-climacteric varieties exist. Two introgressions of the non-climacteric accession PI 161375, encompassed in the QTLs ETHQB 3. 5 and ETHQV 6. 3, into the non-climacteric 'Piel de Sapo' background are able to induce climacteric ripening independently. We report that the gene underlying ETHQV 6. 3 is MELO 3 C 016540 (CmNAC-NOR), encoding a NAC (NAM, ATAF 1, 2, CUC 2) transcription factor that is closely related to the tomato NOR (non-ripening) gene. CmNAC-NOR was functionally validated through the identification of two TILLING lines carrying non-synonymous mutations in the conserved NAC domain region. In an otherwise highly climacteric genetic background, both mutations provoked a significant delay in the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening</b> and in the biosynthesis of ethylene. The PI 161375 allele of ETHQV 6. 3 is similar to that of climacteric lines of the cantalupensis type and, when introgressed into the non-climacteric 'Piel de Sapo', partially restores its climacteric ripening capacity. CmNAC-NOR is expressed in fruit flesh of both climacteric and non-climacteric lines, suggesting that the causal mutation may not be acting at the transcriptional level. The use of a comparative genetic approach in a species with both climacteric and non-climacteric ripening is a powerful strategy to dissect the complex mechanisms regulating the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fruit {{ripening}} is {{a unique}} plant developmental process with direct implications for our food supply, nutrition, and health. In contrast to climacteric fruit, where ethylene is pivotal, the hormonal control <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> in nonclimacteric fruit, such as grape (Vitis vinifera), is poorly understood. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroidal hormones, essential for normal plant growth and development but not previously implicated in the <b>ripening</b> <b>of</b> nonclimacteric fruit. Here we show that increases in endogenous BR levels, but not indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) or GA levels, are associated with ripening in grapes. Putative grape homologs of genes encoding BR biosynthesis enzymes (BRASSINOSTEROID- 6 -OXIDASE and DWARF 1) and the BR receptor (BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1) were isolated, and {{the function of the}} grape BRASSINOSTEROID- 6 -OXIDASE gene was confirmed by transgenic complementation of the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) extreme dwarf (dx/dx) mutant. Expression analysis of these genes during berry development revealed transcript accumulation patterns that were consistent with a dramatic increase in endogenous BR levels observed at the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening.</b> Furthermore, we show that application of BRs to grape berries significantly promoted ripening, while brassinazole, an inhibitor of BR biosynthesis, significantly delayed fruit ripening. These results provide evidence that changes in endogenous BR levels influence this key developmental process. This may provide a significant insight into the mechanism controlling ripening in grapes, which has direct implications for the logistics of grape production and down-stream processing. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|It {{remains unclear}} whether the phloem {{unloading}} pathway alters to adapt to developmental transition in fleshy fruits that accumulate high level of soluble sugars. Using a combination of electron microscopy, transport of the phloem-mobile symplasmic tracer carboxyfluorescein, movement of the companion cell-expressed and the green fluorescent protein-tagged viral movement protein, and assays of the sucrose cleavage enzymes, the pathway of phloem unloading was studied in the berries of a hybrid grape (Vitis vinifera × Vitis labrusca). Structural investigations showed that the sieve element-companion cell complex is apparently symplasmically connected through plasmodesmata with surrounding parenchyma cells throughout fruit development, though {{a small portion of}} plasmodesmata are apparently blocked in the ripening stage. Both carboxyfluorescein and the green fluorescent protein-tagged viral movement protein were released from the functional phloem strands during the early and middle stages of fruit development, whereas the two symplasmic tracers were confined to the phloem strands during the late stage. This reveals a shift of phloem unloading from symplasmic to apoplasmic pathway during fruit development. The turning point of the phloem unloading pathways was further shown to be at or just before <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> an important developmental checkpoint of grape berry. In addition, the levels of both the expression and activities of cell wall acid invertase increased around the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> and reached a high level in the late stage, providing further evidence for an operation of the apoplasmic unloading pathway after <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> These data demonstrate clearly the occurrence of an adaptive shift of phloem unloading pathway to developmental transition from growing phase to ripening in grape berry...|$|E

At the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> {{in the red}} flesh variety Alicante Bouschet, colour development began in the flesh at the stylar end of the fruit and progressed toward the pedicel end flesh and into the skin. Tissue solute potential and cell turgor also decreased first in the flesh. The decrease in flesh solute potential was due to accumulation of sugars, glucose and fructose, an accumulation that is integral to ripening. Expression of the anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes VvMybA and VvUFGT was linearly related to the decrease in solute potential. Expression of VvMybA, {{and to a lesser}} extent VvUFGT, was correspondingly low in green tissue, higher in the red, stylar end flesh of berries beginning to ripen, and greatest in red berries.

40|$|Background and Aims: Vitis vinifera L. berries exhibit dynamic {{changes in}} water {{relations}} during development, but the possible connections between water relations, particularly cell turgor pressure (P), and ripening have received little attention, {{and the water}} relations have been studied by mostly indirect methods. Methods and Results: The cell pressure probe was utilized to examine directly the in situ P of cells in the mesocarp. Mesocarp cell P demonstrated a consistent pattern of a high value early in development, followed by a decrease to less than 1. 0 bar that was maintained during ripening. Sugar accumulation did not increase significantly until P had declined to less than 1. 0 bar. Fruit ‘elasticity ’ {{was used to evaluate}} fruit firmness during development. Fruit elasticity changed dynamically and synchronously with P. When growth was prevented with plastic boxes, the decline in cell P was delayed over 14 days, and the onset of skin colour and sugar accumulation was similarly delayed. Conclusions: The results show that when the decrease in P was delayed, the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> was delayed, and, therefore, are consistent with a central role of P in the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Significance of the Study: This study showed that boxing preveraison berries similarly delayed P decrease and colour increase in Cabernet Sauvignon berries.

40|$|Fruit {{ripening}} in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a compli-cated {{development process}} affected by both endogenous hor-monal and genetic regulators and external signals. Although the role ofNOR, {{a member of}} the NAC domain family, inmediating tomato fruit ripening has been established, its underlying mo-lecular mechanisms remain unclear. To explore further the role of NAC transcription factors in fruit ripening, we characterized a new tomato NAC domain protein, named SlNAC 4, which shows high accumulation in sepal and at the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening.</b> Various stress treatments including wounding, NaCl, dehydration and low temperature significantly increased the expression of SlNAC 4. Reduced expression of SlNAC 4 by RNA interference (RNAi) in tomato resulted in delayed fruit ripen-ing, suppressed Chl breakdown and decreased ethylene synthe-sis mediated mainly through reduced expression of ethylene biosynthesis genes of system- 2, and reduced carotenoids by alteration of the carotenoid pathway flux. Transgenic tomato fruits also displayed significant down-regulation of multiple ripening-associated genes, indicating that SlNAC 4 functions as a positive regulator <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening</b> by affecting ethylene synthesis and carotenoid accumulation. Moreover, we also noted that SlNAC 4 could not be induced by ethylene and may function upstream <b>of</b> the <b>ripening</b> regulator RIN and posi-tively regulate its expression.

40|$|ABA {{has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} to regulate ethylene biosynthesis and signaling during fruit ripening, but the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between these two hormones are largely unexplored. In the present study, exogenous ABA treatment obviously promoted fruit ripening as well as ethylene emission, whereas NDGA (Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis) application showed the opposite biological effects. Combined RNA-seq with time-course RT-PCR analysis, our study not only helped to illustrate how ABA regulated itself at the transcription level, but also revealed that ABA can facilitate ethylene production and response probably by regulating some crucial genes such as LeACS 4, LeACO 1, GR and LeETR 6. In addition, investigation on the fruits treated with 1 -MCP immediately after ABA exposure revealed that ethylene might be essential for the induction of ABA biosynthesis and signaling at the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening.</b> Furthermore, some specific transcription factors (TFs) known as regulators of ethylene synthesis and sensibility (e. g.

40|$|Abstract In Vitis vinifera L. berries, the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> (known as ‘‘veraison’’) {{involves}} loss of turgor (P) in the mesocarp cells. We {{hypothesized that}} P loss {{was associated with}} an accumulation of apoplastic solutes in mesocarp tissue prior to veraison. Apoplastic sap was extracted from the mesocarp by centrifugation at the appropriate gravity to measure the apoplast solute potential (Ws A) and assay the sap composition. The Ws A was about- 0. 2 MPa early in development, decreased about 1. 0 MPa by veraison, and continued to decrease during ripening to almost- 4. 0 MPa {{by the end of}} berry development. Potassium, malate, tar-trate, proline, glucose, fructose, and sucrose were quantified in apoplastic sap. The calculated contribution of these solutes was about 50 % of the total Ws A preveraison, but increased to about 75 % as fructose and glucose accu-mulated during ripening. The contribution of the estimated matric potential to apoplast water potential decreased during development and was only 1. 5 % postveraison. We conclude that high concentrations of solutes accumulated in the mesocarp apoplast prior to veraison, and that P loss was a direct result of decreased Ws A. Because Ws A decreased before veraison, our findings suggest that apoplast solutes {{play an important role in}} the events of cellular metabolism that lead to the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening...</b>|$|E

40|$|The role <b>of</b> auxin in <b>ripening</b> {{strawberry}} (Fragaria ×ananassa) fruits {{has been}} {{restricted to the}} early stages of development where the growth of the receptacle is dependent on the delivery of auxin from the achenes. At later stages, during enlargement of the receptacle, other hormones have been demonstrated to participate to different degrees, from the general involvement of gibberellins and abscisic acid to the more specific of ethylene. Here we report the involvement of auxin at the late stages <b>of</b> receptacle <b>ripening.</b> The auxin content of the receptacle remains constant during <b>ripening.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> the transcriptome <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> strawberry fruit revealed the changing expression pattern of the genes of auxin synthesis, perception, signaling and transport along with achene and receptacle development from the green to red stage. Specific members of the corresponding gene families show active transcription in the ripe receptacle. For the synthesis of auxin, two genes encoding tryptophan aminotransferases, FaTAA 1 and FaTAR 2, were expressed in the red receptacle, with FaTAR 2 expression peaking at this stage. Transient silencing of this gene in ripening receptacle was accompanied by a diminished responsiveness to auxin. The auxin activity in the ripening receptacle is supported by the DR 5 -directed expression of a GUS reporter gene in the <b>ripening</b> receptacle <b>of</b> DR 5 -GUS transgenic strawberry plants. Clustering by co-expression of members of the FaAux/IAA and FaARF families identified five members whose transcriptional activity was increased with the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> receptacle <b>ripening.</b> Among these, FaAux/IAA 11 and FaARF 6 a appeared, by their expression level and fold-change, as the most likely candidates for their involvement in the auxin activity in the ripening receptacle.

40|$|Tomato fruit {{ripening}} {{is accompanied}} by extensive degradation of pectic cell wall components.

At the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> tomato fruit <b>ripening,</b> polygalacturonase enzyme activity, mRNA levels, and relative rate of gene transcription all increase dramatically. To elucidate the role of polygalacturonase during tomato fruit ripening, we utilized a pleiotropic genetic mutation, rin, that blocks many aspects <b>of</b> <b>ripening,</b> including the activation of polygalacturonase gene transcription. The polygalacturonase structural gene was ligated to a promoter that is inducible in mature rin fruit and inserted into the fruit genome, and plants were regenerated. This allowed expression of the polygalacturonase gene in transgenic rin fruit at a time corresponding to ripening in wild-type fruit. Expression of this gene resulted in the accumulation of active polygalacturonase enzyme and the degradation of cell wall polyuronides in transgenic rin fruit. However, no significant effect on fruit softening, ethylene evolution, or color development was detected. These results indicate that polygalacturonase is the primary determinant of cell wall polyuronide degradation, but suggest that this degradation is not sufficient for the induction of softening, elevated rates of ethylene biosynthesis, or lycopene accumulation in rin fruit...|$|R

ANR was encoded {{by a single}} gene, but we found two highly related genes encoding LAR. We measured PA content and expression of genes encoding ANR, LAR, and leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase in grape berries during development and in grapevine leaves, which accumulated PA throughout leaf expansion. Grape flowers had high levels of PA, and accumulation continued in skin and seeds from fruit set until the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> VvANR was expressed throughout early flower and berry development, with expression increasing after fertilization.

During grape ripening, PA levels decreased in both skin and seeds, and expression of genes encoding ANR and LAR were no longer detected. The results indicate that PA accumulation occurs early in grape development and is completed when ripening starts.

The addition of Se did not significantly influence the cumulative yield of tomato plants, but a delay in the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening</b> was detected, and the harvesting of control plants began earlier than in Se-treated plants. The addition of Se did not significantly affect the qualitative parameters with the exception of -carotene content, which was lower in red ripe fruit treated with selenium. Since -carotene accumulation is a ripening-related event in tomato, the lower amount of this compound may be associated with a general delay <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> This is confirmed by the reduced biosynthetic rate of ethylene, observed in Se-treated tomatoes, which also showed a reduced rate in colour change. This thus confirmed that ripening-related processes, such as the degradation of chlorophyll and the synthesis of carotenoids, are affected by selenium - with potential benefits in terms of storage and shelf-life. Our results showed that 100 g of tomato hydroponically grown with a nutrient solution supplemented with Se provided a total of 58 g Se. Thus, the daily consumption of 100 g of enriched tomato does not lead to Se toxicity, but can even provide a rational Se supplementation. This suggests that the addition of Se in a nutrient solution is useful for producing tomatoes with greater beneficial properties for human health...|$|R
40|$|PbS {{quantum dots}} (QDs) {{are some of}} the most {{attractive}} QDs used to develop novel optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, photodetectors and biological labels. However, identifying an appropriate method to access high quality QDs with a wide size range employing lower cost, less toxic and safer precursors is not trivial. Here, we demonstrate the diffusion controlled synthesis of size-tunable PbS QDs by employing reactive N,N&# 039;-diphenylthiourea (DPTU) and PbCl 2 precursors. The preparation of DPTU in 1 -octadecene (ODE) and PbCl 2 in oleylamine (OLA) provides turbid suspensions, ensuring that the reaction is in a diffusion controlled regime. The reaction of these reactive precursors provides access to smaller PbS QDs previously unattainable using an elemental sulfur precursor. Monodisperse QDs with a size range from 2. 5 to 6 nm (corresponding to band gaps of 0. 8 - 1. 6 eV) were obtained at low to moderate growth temperatures of 30 - 150 °C. An optical study of the reaction kinetics suggests that the heterogeneous growth environment sufficiently delays the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> Ostwald <b>ripening,</b> and QDs are air-stable over a range of sizes. The synthesized PbS QDs showed high photoluminescence quantum yields of 40 - 70 % (depending on the QD size) with the extended photoluminescence lifetime reaching 2. 2 mus...|$|R
40|$|Tomato fruit (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill) from green, pink, and red stages were assayed {{for changes}} in the {{activity}} of ribulose diphosphate carboxylase and oxygenase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, changes in the levels of glycolate and respiratory gas exchange. The ribulose diphosphate carboxylase activity decreased as the fruit ripened. By comparison, the ribulose diphosphate oxygenase activity increased during the transition from the green to the pink stage, and declined afterward. The changes in the endogenous glycolate levels and the respiratory gas exchange, as observed at different stages of ripening, resembled the changes in the ribulose diphosphate oxygenase activity. The utilization of glycolate in further metabolic activity may result in the formation of peroxidases required for the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening...</b>|$|E

40|$|Along {{with sugar}} {{accumulation}} and colour development, softening {{is an important}} physiological change during the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening</b> in fruits. In this work, we investigated the relationships among major events during softening in grape (Vitis vinifera L.) by quantifying elasticity in individual berries. In addition, we delayed softening and inhibited sugar accumulation using a mechanical growth-preventing treatment {{in order to identify}} processes that are sugar and/or growth dependent. Ripening processes commenced on various days after anthesis, but always at similarly low elasticity and turgor. Much of the softening occurred in the absence of other changes in berry physiology investigated here. Several genes encoding key cell wall-modifying enzymes were not up-regulated until softening was largely completed, suggesting softening may result primarily from decreases in turgor. Similarly, there was no decrease in solute potential, increase in sugar concentration, or colour development until elasticity and turgor were near minimum values, and these processes were inhibited when berry growth was prevented. Increases in abscisic acid occurred early during softening {{and in the absence of}} significant expression of the V. vinifera 9 -cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases. However, these increases were coincident with decreases in the abscisic acid catabolite diphasic acid, indicating that initial increases in abscisic acid may result from decreases in catabolism and/or exogenous import. These data suggest that softening, decreases in turgor, and increases in abscisic acid represent some of the earliest events during the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>ripening.</b> Later, physical growth, further increases in abscisic acid, and the accumulation of sugar are integral for colour development. © 2015 The Author 2015.

40|$|Correlative {{physiological}} {{evidence suggests}} that membrane transport into storage parenchyma cells is a key step in determining hexose levels accumulated in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) fruit (Ruan et al. 1997). Expression of three previously identified hexose transporter genes (LeHT 1, 2 and 3) demonstrated that LeHT 3, {{and to a lesser}} extent LeHT 1, are the predominant transporters expressed in young fruit (10 d after anthesis; DAA). Expression of both transporters dropped sharply until 24 DAA, after which only LeHT 3 expression remained at detectable levels through to fruit ripening. LeHT 2 was not expressed substantially until the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening.</b> For fruit at both 10 and 30 DAA, LeHT 3 transcripts were detected in storage parenchyma cells of the outer pericarp tissue, but not in vascular bundles or the first layer of parenchyma cells surrounding these bundles. In contrast to LeHT gene expression, hexose transporter protein levels were maximal between 20 and 30 DAA, which corresponded to the period of highest hexose accumulation. The delayed appearance of transporter protein is consistent with some form of post-transcriptional regulation. Based on these analyses, LeHT 3 appears to be responsible for the rapid hexose accumulation in developing tomato fruit. © CSIRO 2005...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the ability of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POX) enzymatic activities present in olive fruit tissues to oxidize main phenolic compounds related to the process to obtain virgin olive oil (VOO) in order to ascertain their involvement in shaping the phenolic profile of this product. In the two olive cultivars under study, Arbequina and Picual, olive PPO activity was found to be largely present in the fruit mesocarp whereas most olive POX activity is in the seed. Moreover, both enzymatic activities display relatively constant values after the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening</b> when the fruit is harvested for VOO production. Results showed that both PPO and POX activities present in olive fruit at ripening stages are able to oxidize main phenolic glycosides present in the fruit as well as those phenolic compounds arising during the industrial process to obtain the oil, especially secoiridoid compounds derived from oleuropein that mainly determine VOO nutritional and sensorial properties. Experimental data suggest a key role for endogenous olive PPO and POX enzymatic activities in determining the phenolic profile of VOO. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The hormone {{ethylene}} regulates a {{wide range}} of plant developmental processes and EBF (EIN 3 -binding F-box) proteins were shown to negatively regulate the ethylene signalling pathway via mediating the degradation of EIN 3 /EIL proteins. The present study reports on the identification of two tomato F-box genes, Sl-EBF 1 and Sl-EBF 2 from the EBF subfamily. The two genes display contrasting expression patterns in reproductive and vegetative tissues and in response to ethylene and auxin treatment. Sl-EBF 1 and Sl-EBF 2 genes are actively regulated at crucial stages {{in the development of the}} reproductive organs. Their dynamic expression in flowers during bud-to-anthesis and anthesis-to-post-anthesis transitions, and at the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening,</b> suggests their role in situations where ethylene is required for stimulating flower opening and triggering fruit <b>ripening.</b> VIGS-mediated silencing <b>of</b> a single tomato EBF gene uncovered a compensation mechanism that tends to maintain a threshold level of Sl-EBF expression via enhancing the expression of the second Sl-EBF gene. In line with this compensation, tomato plants silenced for either of the Sl-EBF genes were indistinguishable from control plants, indicating functional redundancy among Sl-EBF genes. By contrast, co-silencing of both Sl-EBFs resulted in ethylene-associated phenotypes. While reports on EBF genes to date have focused on their role in modulating ethylene responses in Arabidopsis, the present study uncovered their role in regulating crucial stages of flower and fruit development in tomato. The data support the hypothesis that protein degradation via the ubiquitin/ 26 S proteasome pathway is a control point <b>of</b> fruit <b>ripening</b> and open new leads for engineering fruit quality...|$|R
