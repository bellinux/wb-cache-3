The record $62million amount surpassed Michael Huffington, who spent nearly $28million in an unsuccessful 1994 Senate race.|$|E
5|$|As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton {{was one of}} its {{greatest}} builders. The Aberdeen Registrum noted {{that he began to}} rebuild the cathedral, and Hector Boece gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> to new service books and vestments, {{as well as to the}} reconstruction of the cathedral. He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived.|$|E

50|$|In 1854 he {{was looking}} for ways <b>of</b> {{investing}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in innovative, purpose-designed living and working accommodation for Worcester's artisans. These 'modern dwellings', as he called them, were well-designed and well-built houses of varied construction types that replaced often cramped, old, crowded, medieval buildings and later cheaply built terraces and town houses which were little more than slums by Hastings' time and places where diseases such as typhus would break out in the right conditions, an all too regular development.|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in doing so.|$|E

As a result, Lloyd Webber invested $6 million <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> The Phantom of the Opera was produced on a $55 million budget. A further $15 million was used for marketing, bringing the final budget to $70 million. Warner Bros. was given a first look deal for distribution; the studio did not sign on until June 2003, when the principal cast was chosen.|$|E
5|$|Although the Giants played well, {{the team}} {{experienced}} financial hardship {{during its first}} year. Player salaries were so low that most had to take additional jobs to support themselves. The team's brief practices, held at 4:30 p. m. each day to accommodate outside-work schedules, enabled little in-season improvement. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925 and owner Tim Mara spent $25,000 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> during the season to keep the team going. The financial struggle continued until the 11th game of the season, when the visiting Red Grange and the Chicago Bears drew more than 73,000 fans (a pro-football record) and an additional 20,000 were turned away. This gave the Giants much-needed revenue, possibly altering the team's history. In the 19–7 Bears victory, Grange intercepted a pass intended for Bomar and returned it for a touchdown.|$|E

5|$|The crisis {{point for}} the UERL was the need to redeem the five-year {{profit-sharing}} secured notes on 30 June 1908. The UERL {{did not have the}} money. Speyer unsuccessfully tried to persuade the London County Council (LCC) to inject £5million into the UERL and used some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> bank's <b>money</b> to pay-off disgruntled shareholders threatening bankruptcy proceedings. Eventually, Speyer and Gibb managed to obtain agreement from the shareholders to convert the notes into long-term debt to be repaid in 1933 and 1948.|$|R

5|$|In 1925, Kimball and Joseph W. Greenhalgh, a Latter-day Saint {{businessman}} {{who served as}} a bishop in one of the local wards, began a small securities business making and purchasing loans from local businesses and individuals. By 1927, the business became independent, and after investing $150 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in the business, Kimball began running it full-time in Safford, Arizona, as the KimballGreenhalgh Agency, dealing in local insurance, real estate, debt collection, and bonds. The business suffered greatly during the Great Depression and lost much of its capital between 1930 and 1933. Through continued work and re-investment of profits, it survived the Great Depression and became increasingly successful during the late 1930s and early 1940s. By 1943, Kimball's initial $150 investment in the agency was worth nearly $100,000.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arnold's successes, he {{was passed}} over for {{promotion}} by the Continental Congress, while other officers claimed credit for some of his accomplishments. Adversaries in military and political circles brought charges of corruption or other malfeasance, but most often he was acquitted in formal inquiries. Congress investigated his accounts and concluded that he was indebted to Congress (he also had spent much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> on the war effort). Arnold was frustrated and bitter at this, {{as well as with}} the alliance with France and the failure of Congress to accept Britain's 1778 proposal to grant full self-governance in the colonies. He decided to change sides, and opened secret negotiations with the British. In July 1780, he was awarded command of West Point. His scheme was to surrender the fort to the British, but it was exposed when American forces captured British Major John André carrying papers which revealed the plot. Upon learning of André's capture, Arnold fled down the Hudson River to the British sloop-of-war Vulture, narrowly avoiding capture by the forces of George Washington, who had been alerted to the plot.|$|E
5|$|Helm {{was first}} elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1826; between 1826 and 1843 he served eleven one-year terms in the state house. In 1844 {{he was elected to}} the state senate, where he served {{continuously}} until he was chosen as the Whig Party nominee for lieutenant governor on a ticket with John J. Crittenden, famous for the Crittenden Compromise. The Whigs won the general election and Helm was elevated to governor on July 31, 1850, when Crittenden resigned to accept an appointment as United States Attorney General in President Millard Fillmore's cabinet. After his service as governor Helm became president of the struggling Louisville and Nashville Railroad. He invested thousands of dollars <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in the project and convinced residents along the line's main route to buy stock in the company. In 1859 the line was completed, but the next year Helm resigned over of differences with the board of directors regarding a proposed branch that would extend the line to Memphis, Tennessee.|$|E
50|$|His {{early death}} left {{his family in}} severe {{financial}} difficulty, especially as his father, who outlived him by a few months, left no will and according to their legal advice West's widow and children had no claim to his estate. What had become <b>of</b> <b>his</b> widow's <b>own</b> <b>money</b> is unclear, but it should certainly {{have been enough to}} live on: her mother Mary Scott had been a great heiress, and her father the Bishop in his last will had provided generously for all his children.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, Huffington {{was elected}} to the House of Representatives from California's 22nd District (Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties).

5|$|Of all the U.S. Presidents he {{associated}} with during his career, he was closest to John F. Kennedy. Sinatra often invited Kennedy to Hollywood and Las Vegas, {{and the two}} would womanize and enjoy parties together. In January 1961 Sinatra and Peter Lawford organized the Inaugural Gala in Washington, D.C., held on the evening before President Kennedy was sworn into office. In 1962, Sinatra was snubbed by Kennedy {{during his visit to}} Palm Springs when he decided to stay with the Republican Bing Crosby, due to FBI concerns about Sinatra's alleged connections to organized crime. Sinatra had invested a lot <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in upgrading the facilities at his home in anticipation of the President's visit, fitting it with a heliport, which he later reportedly smashed up with a sledgehammer upon being rejected. Despite the snub, when he learned of Kennedy's assassination he reportedly sobbed in his bedroom for three days.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 1975, the Redevelopment Agency {{voted to}} {{demolish}} the building. Union Railroad Station Trust asked the Boston architectural firm Anderson-Notter {{to prepare a}} study of adding office and restaurant space. George M. Notter, one of the firm's principals (and later president of the American Institute of Architects), was an early advocate of adaptive reuse. Surprised that no developers were pursuing {{what he saw as}} a sure profit, Notter formed Union Station Associates as a subsidiary of Anderson-Notter and invested a substantial sum <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> into the station. Notter convinced Amtrak to agree to a 20-year lease for part of the station at $45,000 annually, thus giving the group a stronger negotiating point. After eighteen months of negotiations, Union Station Associates purchased the building on July 24, 1975, effectively saving the station. The group paid only the cost of the underlying land, $11,400 – the same figure Scheetz initially offered two years before.|$|E
5|$|On July 17, 1838, Gray {{became the}} very first {{permanent}} paid professor at the newly founded University of Michigan though he ended up not teaching classes. His position {{was also the first}} one devoted solely to botany at any educational institution in America. Appointed Professor of Botany and Zoology, Gray was dispatched to Europe by the regents of the university for the purpose of purchasing a suitable array of books to form the university's library, and equipment such as microscopes to aid research. Botanist Charles F. Jenkins states that the main purpose of this trip was to examine American flora in Europe's herbariums. Gray departed on the packet ship Philadelphia on November9, 1838, sailing through The Narrows out of New York Harbor nine days before his 28th birthday. Gray and the regents were both involved in stocking the university library. In 1839 the regents purchased a complete copy of Audubon's The Birds of America for the then-extraordinary sum of $970. Gray's first stop was in Glasgow, visiting William Hooker, who aided and financially supported many botanists, including Gray. On January16, 1839, he arrived in London and stayed until March14. He then spent time in Paris, where he collaborated with Joseph Decaisne at the Jardin des Plantes. In mid-April 1839 he left Paris for Italy by way of southern France, then visiting Genoa, Rome, Florence, Venice, Bologna, Padua, and Trieste. After Italy, Gray went to Vienna, Austria. While in Vienna, he spent twelve days studying specimen collections and gardens with Stephan Endlicher, who also introduced him to other local botanists. In 1840 Endlicher became director of the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna. Departing Austria, Gray went to Munich, Zurich, and Geneva, where he met the prominent botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle, who died in 1841. Gray continued extensive collaboration with deCandolle's son Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle. Gray returned to Germany, going to Freiburg, Tübingen, Dresden, Halle, and then Berlin, where he stayed for a month. While in Berlin, {{he spent most of his}} time in Schöneberg, where the region's Botanical Gardens were then located. Gray then returned to London by way of Hamburg. Gray admitted he just managed some of the book purchasing and that he delegated the actual buying of books to George Palmer Putnam, who was then living in London. Gray spent a year in Europe, leaving for America from Portsmouth, England, aboard the sailing ship Toronto on October1, 1839, and arriveing back in New York on November 4. Gray, together with his agents, eventually purchased about 3,700 books for the University of Michigan library. The regents at the University of Michigan were so impressed by Gray's work in Europe, including his spending about $1,500 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> on specimen collections, that they granted him another year's salary that covered him until the summer of 1841. However, finances at the university were so bad that they asked him to resign in April 1840.|$|E

50|$|Disturbed by the {{failures}} of low-income housing projects {{that came out of}} the depression, he believed in another way. He contributed $550,000 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>money,</b> combined with $300,000 from Oakland Housing, to create a managed low-income housing project called Westacres, in West Bloomfield, Michigan. The project gave the low-income factory working man a chance to own a home. The homes were located on 1 acre of land and the owners were required to farm the land to provide food for their families when seasonal layoffs took place. The neighborhood became so much more: a community of caring for one another and traditions, still going strong nearly 75 years later. Westacres likes to say that it is one of the most successful government projects.|$|R
