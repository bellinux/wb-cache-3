5|$|After {{the winter}} campaign, Schérer placed the {{divisions}} in the positions where they would start the 1796 campaign. From right to left, they were Masséna with two divisions on the coast, Augereau on the Bormida River, Sérurier on the Tanaro, Macquard at the Col de Tende and Garnier on the far left. On 27 March 1796 Bonaparte arrived to take command of the Army of Italy. At this date Sérurier was 53 years <b>old</b> <b>with</b> 40 years of military service. He applied to retire on a pension due to his age, health and wounds, but after meeting Bonaparte he decided to stay. Masséna later wrote that Bonaparte did not impress his generals at first. Then the new commander put on his hat and sharply questioned them; the generals went away believing {{that they had a}} true leader at last. Bonaparte's plan was to mass over 20,000 men under Masséna and Augereau near Carcare where the Austrian and Sardinian armies linked. Sérurier's division would join the others near Ceva as they moved west. His 9,448-strong division consisted of the 39th, 69th and 85th Line Infantry Demi-brigades.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H. Bánáthy, Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council, {{formulated}} {{the idea}} of an experimental leadership training program. He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which Bela had attended when he was 14 years <b>old.</b> <b>With</b> the active interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the National Council, observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed with what he witnessed, he recommended that the national office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program.|$|E

At {{the rear of the}} train, a group of nine wagons {{containing}} 32members of the Reed and Donner families and their employees left on May12. George Donner, born in North Carolina, had gradually moved west to Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois, with a one-year sojourn to Texas. In early 1846, he was about 60 years <b>old.</b> <b>With</b> him were his 44-year-old wife Tamsen and their three daughters Frances (6), Georgia (4), and Eliza (3), and George's daughters from a previous marriage: Elitha (14) and Leanna (12). George's younger brother Jacob (56) also joined the party with his wife Elizabeth (45), teenaged stepsons Solomon Hook (14) and William Hook (12), and five children: George (9), Mary (7), Isaac (6), Lewis (4), and Samuel (1).

5|$|Jolin was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} for the architectural and aesthetic preservation of the capital, as is written in his draft for a pamphlet called Mot strömmen (Against the Tide). According to him, Stockholm had become an ugly town, by insensitive mixing of styles, densification, and centuries of eager renovation. Jolin wanted {{to bring out the}} beautiful and the genuine in the cityscape, as well as restore, what he considered to be distorted parts of the city, to their former glory. According to Palmgren, perhaps it was that dream Jolin expressed in his depictions of Stockholm. At the end of the 19th century, and during some decades into the 20th century, artists depicted Stockholm in a variety of ways, each according to his own mind and individualism. Traditionalists worked side by side with Modernists, <b>old</b> <b>with</b> young, seasoned pursuers of the established view of the city and young enthusiastic individuals, such as Jolin. By the middle of the 20th century, his focus shifted from the cityscape to other motifs such as chinoiserie settings, but in his youth, he and his friends from his years in Paris found inspiration in Stockholm and its surroundings.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{had planned}} {{for a college}} of a Principal and sixty {{bachelor}} fellows; however, Sutton lowered this to only twelve. The Principal was required to be over thirty, a graduate and priest, and {{have the support of}} the Visitor, the Bishop of Lincoln. He was entitled to take up ecclesiastic office or duties that did not interfere overly with his job as principal; the fellows were required to be resident for ten months of each year. Entrants to the college would have been only 11 or 12 years <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> an intake both from those whose income was very low, alongside those from gentlemanly backgrounds. Fellows had a high degree of autonomy, but received only board and lodging as reward.|$|E
5|$|The {{dusky shark}} {{is one of}} the most sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked, the skin is made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 tons per year. The fishery utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three years <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> 1828% of all newborns captured in their first year. Demographic models suggest that the fishery is sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of Columbia's graduate and undergraduate studies are conducted in Morningside Heights on Seth Low's late-19th century {{vision of a}} university campus where all disciplines could be taught at one location. The campus was designed along Beaux-Arts principles by architects McKim, Mead, and White. Columbia's main campus occupies more than six city blocks, or , in Morningside Heights, New York City, a neighborhood that contains a number of academic institutions. The university owns over 7,800 apartments in Morningside Heights, housing faculty, graduate students, and staff. Almost two dozen undergraduate dormitories (purpose-built or converted) are located on campus or in Morningside Heights.

5|$|The massif {{is about}} 15million years <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> {{volcanism}} continuing up until geologically recent times. Three constructive stages {{have been identified}} at Level Mountain. The first stage commenced 14.9million {{years ago with the}} eruption of voluminous lava flows. These lavas assembled to create a large shield volcano. The second stage began 7.1million years ago to form a complex stratovolcano located centrally atop the shield. A series of lava domes were established during the third stage, which started 4.5million years ago. Renewed activity might have occurred in the last 11,000years. A wide range of rock types were produced during the long volcanic history of Level Mountain, of which alkali basalts and ankaramites are the most common. They were deposited by different types of volcanic eruptions characterized by passive lava flows and explosivity.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} in the war came when Burnham and Bonar Armstrong, a Company native commissioner, found their way through the Matopos Hills to a sacred cave not many miles from the Mangwe district, to a {{sanctuary}} then known only to the Matabele where Mlimo had been hiding. Not far from the cave was a village (now gone) of about 100 huts filled with many warriors. The two men tethered their horses to a thicket and crawled on their bellies, screening their slow, cautious movements by means of branches held before them. Once inside the cave, they waited until Mlimo entered. Mlimo was said to be about 60 years <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> very dark skin, sharp-featured; American news reports of the time described him as having a cruel, crafty look. Burnham and Armstrong waited until Mlimo entered the cave and started his dance of immunity, at which point Burnham shot Mlimo just below the heart, killing him.|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the conditions within home care services when working <b>with</b> <b>older</b> persons <b>with</b> alcohol abuse. DESIGN - A telephone survey has been carried out and middle managers for needs assessment officers and middle managers for home care staff have been interviewed. The managers in 25 municipalities in the Stockholm area took part in the study. RESULTS - It was common that care workers were in regular contact <b>with</b> <b>older</b> people <b>with</b> alcohol abuse. However, very few had any training regarding how to treat <b>older</b> people <b>with</b> alcohol abuse and there was no specialization within this field. A conflicting task was the question of buying alcohol to alcohol addicts. The self determination of older people was the guideline. The home care workers had little or no cooperation with misuse teams in the municipalities. The municipalities had no guidelines for the work <b>with</b> <b>older</b> people <b>with</b> alcohol abuse and the responsibility was pressed down to the lowest level in the organization. CONCLUSIONS - To a great extent, home care workers stand alone in the work <b>with</b> <b>older</b> people <b>with</b> alcohol problems...|$|R
5|$|Born in Arenys de Mar, Barcelona, Catalonia, to Francesc Fàbregas Sr., {{who runs}} a {{property}} company, and Núria Soler, {{the owner of a}} pastry company, Fàbregas has supported FC Barcelona since childhood and went to his first match when he was nine months <b>old</b> <b>with</b> his grandfather. He began his club football career with CE Mataró before being signed for Barcelona's La Masia youth academy aged ten in 1997. His first coach, Señor Blai, reportedly did not select Fàbregas for matches against Barcelona in an attempt to hide him from their scouts. This tactic, however, was unable to withstand Barcelona for long, and Mataró gave in and allowed Fàbregas to train with Barcelona one day per week. Eventually Fàbregas joined Barcelona's academy full-time. His initial training was as a defensive midfielder playing alongside notable names such as Gerard Piqué and Lionel Messi. Although he was a prolific scorer, sometimes scoring even more than 30 goals in a season for the club's youth teams, he did not manage to play a first team game at the Camp Nou. During his time at Barcelona's youth academy, Fàbregas idolised Barcelona's then-captain and number four Pep Guardiola, who would later give Fàbregas his shirt as consolation when Fàbregas' parents divorced.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a {{football}} tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles. Before {{the inception of the}} World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup. Originally, the event was for amateurs only. As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between 1948 and 1980, 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only Sweden (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), Denmark (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and Japan (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the 1984 Los Angeles Games, the IOC decided to admit professional players. FIFA still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and CONCACAF to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting UEFA and CONMEBOL teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since 1992 male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since 1996, players under 23 years <b>old,</b> <b>with</b> three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.|$|E
