Studies of redress have received much attention, where the focus is largely {{in the context of}} traditional litigation procedures in offline business. This paper focuses on the types of <b>redress</b> <b>procedures</b> consumers expected in response to B 2 C e-commerce complaints, by analysing the experiences and viewpoint of a select group of online consumers and merchants located in Melbourne, Australia. The research reveals that when problems occur in B 2 C e-commerce transactions, consumers require and expect an immediate accessible and responsive <b>redress</b> <b>procedure</b> from merchants.

40|$|<b>Redress</b> <b>procedures</b> are {{important}} for basic fairness. In addition, they can help address principal-agent problems {{in the implementation of}} social policies and provide information to policy makers regarding policy design. To function effectively, a system of redress requires a well-designed and inter-linked supply of <b>redress</b> <b>procedures</b> as well as, especially if rights consciousness is not well-developed in a society, a set of organizations that stimulate and aggregate demand for redress. On the supply side, this paper identifies three kinds of redress procedures: administrative venues within government agencies, independent institutions outside government departments, and courts. On the demand side, the key institutions are nongovernmental organizations/civil society organizations and the news media, both of which require a receptive political and economic climate to function effectively. Overall, <b>procedures</b> for <b>redressing</b> grievances and complaints regarding basic service delivery are under-developed in many countries, and deserve further analysis, piloting, and support.

40|$|This thesis {{reports a}} study which {{examines}} {{the influences of}} the availability of <b>redress</b> <b>procedures</b> on the decisions of consumers to purchase online. Availability of <b>redress</b> <b>procedures</b> in this concept is when consumers have access to uncomplicated complaint procedures that offer timely resolution and effective compensation and handling. Previous research has shown that many factors such as product price, availability, merchant reputation and integrity, consumer attitude, perceived convenience, enjoyment and pleasure, and service quality influence the decisions of consumers to purchase on line. This study focuses on the availability of <b>redress</b> <b>procedures</b> on the decisions of consumers to purchase online and the importance role of redress in that process. Data was collected initially in face-to-face interviews with both consumers, who buy online, and merchants who sell online. Then Focus Group discussions with consumers were conducted to further understand and confirmed the findings emerged from the interview process. The research shows that price was always the first and most significant influence in consumers’ decisions to purchase online. Likewise, consumers also make decisions about online purchasing because of product availability and the range of product choices available to them. Consumers are also sensitive to shipping fees when deciding to purchase online. It also shows that any delay or longer delivery time also influences consumers’ decisions in switching back to offline purchasing. Lastly, consumers choose to purchase online because they enjoy the fun and excitement during the process of online purchasing. A model showing the influence of these factors was created, adding the effects {{of the availability of}} redress on those decisions. This research shows that the availability of redress does not always influence consumers in making decisions to purchase online. If most transactions are fulfilled according to the consumer’s expectations, then consumers have little, if any, concern with redress. Sometimes factors such as merchant reputation, low risk transactions, guaranteed purchase fulfilment, product price and availability, enjoyable online purchasing experience, shipping cost and delivery time seem to be a more important influence on consumers in their decisions to purchase online.  This research concludes that the availability of redress can and does indirectly influence consumer confidence and trust ix in online purchasing and therefore impacts on their decision to purchase, if and only if, one of these three circumstances happens: 1. When problems occur in online purchasing process and subsequently consumers require an immediate access to a complaint handling system; 2. When risk is perceived to be present in the purchasing process then the availability of <b>redress</b> policy and/or <b>procedures</b> is required by consumers to guarantee that they are well protected from financial loss; and 3. When redress initiatives are offered that allow consumers to assess the merchant’s accountability in offering satisfactory online purchasing fulfilment...|$|R

40|$|This Working Paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} collective redress as a possible way to defend workers’ rights in the EU. Since {{the implementation of the}} internal market and the development of the Community acquis trade unions and the workers they represent in Europe are confronted with the question how to defend workers’ rights that can be derived from EU law, especially in a cross-border context. Although in theory it is often claimed that foreign workers have access to justice and can address to local courts like any other worker the practice is rather patchy. In the first exploratory contribution Jan Cremers describes the latest developments in the European Union related to the cross-border enforcement of workers’ rights. The notion of collective redress is introduced with a short explanation of the position of the trade unions. After an exploration of practical experiences the article ends with an overview of challenges and open questions that have led to further desktop research. Martin Bulla investigated whether collective redress can provide a possible way of improvement of judicial enforcement of posted workers’ rights vested in the Posting of Workers Directive (Directive 96 / 71 /EC). The contribution starts with the most significant problems posted workers are facing, followed by an overview of basic types of collective <b>redress</b> <b>procedures</b> as well as differences in approaches to legal regulation in countries. EU initiatives dealing with the issue of collective redress mainly related to consumer law are examined and existing legal instruments are addressed with a view to a possible use for enhancement of posted workers’ rights. Finally an overview of ways of applying <b>redress</b> <b>procedures</b> under the existing legislation is followed by proposals concerning a better functioning of collective redress in respect to posted workers...|$|R
40|$|Despite prior {{research}} {{on the influence of}} national regulatory and cultural factors on sexual harassment (SH) at the workplace, few studies have examined SH, its impact on victims and redress processes in Muslim majority countries (MMCs) such as Pakistan. This study uses neo-institutional theory to develop a more comprehensive framework to explore SH experienced by women at the workplace in Pakistan. Qualitative methodology is adopted to examine employees’ and managers’ perceptions of SH. Drawing on interviews with working women and human resource managers in six Pakistani organisations, the study demonstrates that even when there are formal policies designed to prevent SH, cultural factors influence policy implementation. It reveals that there is a tension between traditional culture and behaviour consistent with SH policies in the workplace. The study identifies three major factors which influence SH redressal; these are socio-cultural factors (e. g. female modesty), institutional factors (e. g. inappropriate <b>redress</b> <b>procedures),</b> and managerial expertise/ bias...|$|R
40|$|For years, {{controversy}} has plagued the EU’s attempts {{to agree on}} a legal basis for sharing the personal details of airline passengers with the US. Now, opposition in the European Parliament may see this form of counter-terrorism cooperation rejected. The arguments are about more than record-keeping: they relate to the need to assure passenger security in the post- 9 / 11 era but also the risk that these security practices can pose to the privacy and personal liberty of normal citizens. This paper analyses the development of EU-US PNR data-sharing agreements as a case study for wider transatlantic security cooperation. Reviewing the key challenges from the PNR story presents a strong argument for the US to fully engage with the EU on “internal ” security measures that can assure transatlantic security externally. To fully maximize the opportunities however, agreements like PNR need independent oversight and <b>redress</b> <b>procedures.</b> Without such elements, failure on PNR is more likely and the possibilities for a wider transatlantic area of freedom, security and justice may narrow...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} centres on surface initiated damage on back-up rolls whereby rolling contact fatigue cracks can propagate into the rolls potentially reaching the internal stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure and {{has sought to}} establish design criteria for avoiding such failures. The project objectives have been achieved by examining field evidence, determining the loading and tribological conditions at the work roll/back-up roll interface and investigating both theoretically and experimentally the mechanisms involved in rolling contact fatigue in this case. The presented rolling contact, fatigue and fracture mechanics model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards (i. e. relative safety) or downwards (i. e. potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases is related, quantitatively, to {{the properties of the}} roll material. After linking mechanics to microstructure, the influence of work roll test disc surface roughness on both the surface wear of and the interaction between wear and rolling contact fatigue at the surface of back-up roll test discs has been quantified using the results obtained from experimental simulations carried out on a rolling–sliding testing machine. Finally practical quantitative recommendations are made for the mechanical and microstructural design of bainitic back-up roll materials, back-up roll <b>redressing</b> <b>procedures</b> and the surface roughness of both work rolls and back-up rolls presented to the mill...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the private enforcement of EU competition law and forum shopping with a particular focus on cross-border collective end-consumer redress. There is no coherent framework across the EU for these types of cases. This lack of uniformity has the potential to create recourse to different national courts. Lawyers may engage in forum shopping when filing lawsuits on behalf of the victims of mass torts. Such practices can provide Member States with incentives to amend their laws to attract collective proceedings and create competition between national judicial systems. However, forum shopping is not the only concern. There appears to be a paucity of cross-border collective claims. This is coupled with an apparent lack of motivation for end-consumers to seek a remedy, particularly if the only choice is to litigate outside their own legal regime. Addressing this situation is vital given that end-consumers regularly suffer harm in the form of higher prices, lower output, reduced quality and limited innovation as a result of antitrust infringements but they are rarely compensated due to legal and practical obstacles. To each end-consumer the harm may indeed be de minimis. However, the aggregate harm can amount to a considerable sum. In the absence of effective <b>redress</b> <b>procedures,</b> infringing undertakings retain the spoils of their unlawful conduct. Against this background, this thesis {{examines the}} extent to which the conflicts-of-laws rules encourage forum shopping and considers the appropriate forum and the appropriate procedural measures that need to be adopted in order to facilitate effective and equal access to justice for end-consumer victims of EU competition law violations...|$|R
40|$|The demands {{placed on}} back-up rolls in hot strip mills have been {{investigated}} {{by a combination of}} literature and industrial studies. The tribological operating conditions have been established and the maximum local loads and pressure distributions at the work roll/back-up roll interface have been obtained by processing mill and roll schedule data using a computer program (commercial software developed by V AI Industries (UK) Ltd) and applying the theories of contact mechanics. After a study of the responses of the rolls to these demands and possible failure mechanisms, research has centred on surface initiated damage whereby cracks can propagate into the roll substrate potentially reaching the internal residual stress fields and leading to catastrophic failure. A proposed qualitative contact and fracture mechanics model, for the rolling contact fatigue and spalling failure, has been quantified theoretically using published methods for determining the stress intensity factors at the tips of pressurised and water lubricated, inclined rolling contact fatigue cracks. The predictions of the quantitative model in terms of crack directions and lengths have been validated by microscopic observation of the morphologies cracks produced in test discs used in the "SUROS" Rolling-Sliding Testing Machine and also in a sample of material spalled from a back-up roll. The quantitative failure model includes criteria for crack branching either upwards leading to micro spalling or downwards (potentially catastrophic) and the link between these two cases has been related quantitatively to the value of the mode I threshold for the roll material. After linking mechanics to microstructure and quantifying the interactions between wear and rolling contact fatigue in this case, practical quantitative recommendations have been made for the design of bainitic back-up roll materials, back-up roll <b>redressing</b> <b>procedures</b> and the surface roughness of both the work rolls and back-up rolls presented to the mill...|$|R
40|$|MM 2014 ABSTRACT The {{introduction}} of the Batho Pele (BP) White Paper in 1997 sought to provide a policy framework and practical strategy aimed at improving access to public services towards an efficient, effective and development oriented Public Service. The study aimed at exploring {{the extent to which}} the Public Service; in particular the Department of Public Service and Administration referred to in this study as “the DPSA”, has implemented the Batho Pele principle of Redress. Batho Pele (Sesotho word for People First) aspires to portray the public service as government machinery that is citizen-oriented, informed by the eight principles of Consultation, Access, Service Standards, Courtesy, Information, Openness and Transparency, Redress and Value for Money. The challenges highlighted by this study demonstrated that the mechanisms and measures put in place in support of the implementation; monitoring and feedback of the Batho Pele; in particular the principle of “Redress”; as a focus of this study; are not yet responsive to complaints handling processes and procedures in dealing with citizens’ dissatisfactions when interfacing with government during the delivery of services. Literature review and the empirical evidence in the study demonstrated the need for managers to view complaints and demands for redress by beneficiaries as valuable learning opportunities to come up with preventative and corrective measures to service delivery problems within the public service. The <b>Redress</b> <b>procedures</b> and systems which are critical for fairness, courtesy, openness and transparency and sustainability still need to be designed better; well co-ordinated and collaborated to ensure sustainable implementation of complaints handling mechanisms and system within the public service. This would include formal recognition for beneficiaries, their right to information about government decision-making and spending patterns, and rights to seek redress for poor-quality service delivery. The methodology and the findings of the study with the DPSA as a focus area, highlighted the following as critical ingredients towards sustainable implementation, monitoring and feedback of the “redress principle”, within the public service...|$|R

Article 10 of Directive 97 / 5 /EC established a series of minimum requirements and measures relating to cross-border credit transfers. Thus Member States shall ensure that there are adequate and effective complaints and <b>redress</b> <b>procedures</b> for the settlement of disputes between an originator and his institution or between a beneficiary and his institution in case of failure transfers. In Romania, the provisions of Directive 2007 / 64 /EC were transposed by the adoption of Emergency Ordinance no. 113 / 2009 which repeals the Government Ordinance no. 6 / 2004 on cross-border transfers. This document provides that each institution must have appropriate procedures for resolving customer complaints in connection with the execution of a cross border institution or commitments in connection with such transfer. In the legal doctrine prior to the adoption of Government Ordinance no. 6 / 2004, it was proposed that the National Bank of Romania, as banking supervisory authority, in some specialized structures, ensure procedures to enforce the settlement of disputes between consumers and financial service providers of banking and insurance.
