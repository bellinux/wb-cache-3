5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully <b>obscured</b> by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is <b>obscured.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient fuel to reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were <b>obscured</b> on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was <b>obscured.</b>|$|E

On websites such as Web of the <b>Obscure</b> Cities (which is no longer online but is documented on AltaPlana.be, an online encyclopaedia for <b>Obscure</b> Cities) and Office of the <b>Obscure</b> Passages, Schuiten and Peeters present alleged reports, often illustrated with photos and drawings, from people that shortly crossed over into the world of the <b>Obscure</b> Cities via <b>Obscure</b> Passages by accident, and by so-called Obscurantists who have been seeking for <b>Obscure</b> Passages for years (compare Obscurantist, a term based upon the Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum, aka [...] "Letters of <b>Obscure</b> Men"). These reports on the internet correspond to the pseudorealism of Schuiten and Peeters when enclosing [...] "authentic" [...] documentary or amateur CDs (Le Musée A.

5|$|The {{comparatively}} old {{globular cluster}} NGC 4833 near Delta Muscae was catalogued by Lacaille in 1755. It is 21,200light-years distant and somewhat <b>obscured</b> by dust clouds near the galactic plane. The globular cluster NGC 4372 near Gamma Muscae is fainter and likewise partially <b>obscured</b> by dust, but spans more arc minutes. It is 18,900light-years away from Earth and 23,000light-years {{distant from the}} centre of the Milky Way. Its extremely low metallicity indicates it is very old—one of the oldest clusters in the Milky Way. Extending south from it is the Dark Doodad Nebula, resembling a dark L-shaped river through a bright field of stars. Another dark nebula in the constellation is BHR 71.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, Urbicande.be, the {{official}} website of the <b>Obscure</b> Cities went online where Schuiten and Peeters encouraged their fans all over Europe {{to send in}} their own ideas regarding the <b>Obscure</b> Cities and accounts of their own experiences in search for <b>Obscure</b> Passages. The response was so overwhelming that Schuiten and Peeters were able to expand their online activities into a complex network of in-universe sites, mainly branching from the URL ebbs.net of their official <b>Obscure</b> magazine called Obskür, where many amateur reports, illustrated by photos and Schuiten's drawings, and various mysterious <b>Obscure</b> artifacts can be found. Along with these, a number of conspiracy theories are explored, regarding authorities of our world intending {{to prevent the spread}} of knowledge regarding the parallel world and destroy various <b>Obscure</b> Passages.

5|$|The early {{light was}} <b>obscured</b> {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud <b>obscured</b> Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives, the {{population}} began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. A rain of ash fell, causing Pliny to shake it off periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E

5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually <b>obscured</b> by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and <b>obscured</b> by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
