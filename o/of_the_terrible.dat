5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terrible</b> Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often {{sold as a}} set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Terrible</b> Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

25|$|On 10 June 1194, another fire caused {{extensive}} damage to Fulbert's cathedral.

Either way, the opportunity was taken to begin a complete rebuilding of the choir and nave in the latest style. The undamaged western towers and façade were incorporated into the new works, as was the earlier crypt, effectively limiting the designers of the new building to the same general plan as its predecessor. In fact the present building is only marginally longer than Fulbert's cathedral.|$|E
25|$|In April 1947, he met Adela ("Eta"), {{one of the}} {{youngest}} of three daughters of Russian Jewish immigrants Isaac and Esther Jusid. They were married after only a few weeks of courtship. Adela was 11 years younger than Miguel. They had two daughters Mirta (b. 1948) and Liliana (b. 1952), and a miscarried son in between. Liliana was long resentful of the fact that her father was abroad when she was born, and didn't see her until she was four months old. She describes her father as a mixture of extremes: violent temper but compassionate and loving, selfish at times but also generous to a fault, jovial and bon vivant but also sad because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrible</b> losses of the Holocaust.|$|E
25|$|Saint Lazar was venerated at <b>the</b> court <b>of</b> Ivan <b>the</b> <b>Terrible,</b> <b>the</b> first Russian tsar (1547–1584), whose {{maternal}} {{grandmother was}} born in the Serbian noble family of Jakšić. Lazar appears in a fresco in <b>the</b> Cathedral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Archangel, <b>the</b> burial place <b>of</b> Russian rulers in the Moscow Kremlin. <b>The</b> walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral were painted in 1565 with frescoes showing all Russian rulers preceding Ivan <b>the</b> <b>Terrible.</b> Only four non-Russians were depicted: Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and three Serbs—Saints Simeon, Sava, and Lazar. The prince is also represented in <b>the</b> Illustrated Chronicle <b>of</b> Ivan <b>the</b> <b>Terrible,</b> in its nine miniatures depicting <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Kosovo. It is in this Russian book that Prince Lazar was for the first time referred to as a tsar. Around 1700, Count Đorđe Branković would write his Slavo-Serbian Chronicles, in which he claimed that Lazar was crowned tsar. This would influence Serbian folk tradition, in which the prince is to this day known as Tsar Lazar. After <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> Ivan <b>the</b> <b>Terrible,</b> Lazar is rarely mentioned in Russian sources.|$|R

25|$|In {{retaliation}} for the boys' mischief, Mother Barnabas summons pirates who kidnap Peter, Nibs and several others. Nibs manages to escape but Peter does not. He is captured and taken aboard a flying pirate ship. Following an aerial battle with several Spitfires the ship takes Peter to Neverland, a magical realm beyond space and time, where he is forced to become a slave laborer and mine for Pixum (crystallized Fairy Dust) on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrible</b> pirate Blackbeard (Hugh Jackman) who uses it to prevent himself from aging. Peter befriends another miner, named James Hook (Garrett Hedlund). After insulting Blackbeard's men, Peter is forced to walk the plank over the deep mine, but survives by flying. Blackbeard then tells Peter about an old prophecy that a boy who could fly would one day kill him, but Peter refuses to believe he is that boy.|$|E
25|$|In {{his style}} of painting, Mr. Aikman seems to have aimed at imitating nature in her {{pleasing}} simplicity: his lights are soft, his shades mellow, and his colouring mild and harmonious. His touches have neither the force nor harshness of Rubens; nor does he seem, like Reynolds, ever to have aimed at adorning his portraits with the elegance of adventitious graces. His mind, tranquil and serene, delighted rather to wander with Thomson in the enchanting fields of Tempe, than to burst, with Michelangelo, into the ruder scenes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrible</b> and the sublime. His compositions are distinguished by a placid tranquility and ease rather than a striking brilliancy of effect: and his portraits may be more readily mistaken for those of Kneller than any other eminent artist; {{not only because of}} the general resemblance in the dresses, which were those of the times, they being contemporaries, but also for the manner of working, and the similarity and bland mellowness of their tints.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma means He <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terrible</b> oath, {{referring}} to his vow of lifelong celibacy. Originally named Devavratha, he became known as Bhishma after he took the bhishama pratigya ('terrible oath') — the vow of lifelong celibacy and of service to whomever sat on the throne of his father (the throne of Hastinapur). He took this oath so that his father, Shantanu could marry a fisherwoman Satyavati — Satyavati's father had refused to give his daughter's hand to Shantanu {{on the grounds that}} his daughter's children would never be rulers. This made Shantanu despondent, and upon discovering the reason for his father's despondency, Devavratha sought out the girl's father and promised him that he would never stake a claim to the throne, implying that the child born to Shantanu and Satyavati would become the ruler after Shantanu. At this, Satyavati's father retorted that even if Devavratha gave up his claim to the throne, his (Devavratha's) children would still claim the throne. Devavratha then took the vow of lifelong celibacy, thus sacrificing his 'crown-prince' title and denying himself the pleasures of conjugal love. This gave him immediate recognition among the gods. His father granted him the boon of Ichcha Mrityu (control over his own death — he could choose the time of his death, making him immortal till his chosen time of death, instead of completely immortal which would have been an even more severe curse and cause of suffering).|$|E
