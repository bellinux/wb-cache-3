5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene.

5|$|Modern whaling {{was more}} {{efficient}} than open-boat whaling, employing steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, was in high demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales {{off the coast of}} Peru alone.

40|$|The Oil Formation Volume Factor (FVF) {{parameter}} is a {{very important}} fluid property in reservoir engineering computations. Ideally, this property should be obtained from actual measurements. Quite often, this measurement is either not available, or very costly to obtain. In such cases, empirically derived correlations are used in the prediction of this property. This work centers on building an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict oil formation volume factor for the different API gravity ranges. The new models were developed using combination of 448 published data from the Middle East, Malaysia, Africa, North Sea, Mediterranean basin, Gulf of Persian fields and 1389 data set collected from the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria. The data have been divided into the following four different API gravity classes: heavy <b>oils</b> <b>for</b> API≤ 21, medium <b>oils</b> <b>for</b> 21 <b>oils</b> <b>for</b> 26 light <b>oils</b> <b>for</b> API> 35. The data set was randomly divided into three parts of which, 60 % was used for training, 20 % for validation, and 20 % for testing for each particular API grade. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the models to the existing empirical correlations. The ANN models outperformed the existing empirical correlations by the statistical parameters used with the best rank and better performance plots.

5|$|The Salem {{district}} administration in India advised farmers in 2012 not {{to invest in}} the emu business which was being heavily promoted at the time; further investigation was needed to assess the profitability of farming the birds in India. In the United States, it was reported in 2013 that many ranchers had left the emu business; it was estimated that the number of growers had dropped from over five thousand in 1998 to one or two thousand in 2013. The remaining growers increasingly rely on sales of <b>oil</b> <b>for</b> their profit, although, leather, eggs, and meat are also sold.|$|E
5|$|These {{benefits}} meant that, {{as early}} as 1901, Fisher was pressing the advantages of oil fuel. There were technical problems with oil-firing, connected with the different distribution {{of the weight of}} oil fuel compared to coal, and the problems of pumping viscous oil. The main problem with using <b>oil</b> <b>for</b> the battle fleet was that, {{with the exception of the}} United States, every major navy would have to import its oil. As a result, some navies adopted 'dual-firing' boilers which could use coal sprayed with oil; British ships so equipped, which included dreadnoughts, could even use oil alone at up to 60% power.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, the DRR was {{becoming}} overwhelmed by ever-increasing crowds; Disney {{determined that a}} third train was needed. Instead of having another locomotive built from scratch to pull the train, Disney believed that costs could be saved by purchasing and restoring an already-existing narrow-gauge steam locomotive, and the job of finding one was given to Roger Broggie. With the assistance of Gerald Best, a suitable locomotive was found in Louisiana; it had been built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894, had previously {{been used as a}} switcher at a sugar cane mill in Louisiana owned by the Godchaux Sugar Company, and was initially used by the Lafourche, Raceland & Longport Railway in Louisiana. After its purchase, the locomotive was delivered to the Walt Disney Studios' machine shop where restoration work began, which included installing a new boiler built by Dixon Boiler Works and having its firebox reconfigured to burn diesel <b>oil</b> <b>for</b> fuel to generate steam. This locomotive became the DRR's No. 3 locomotive and it went into service on March 28, 1958, at a cost after restoration of more than $37,000. Joining the No. 3 locomotive when it went into service were five new open-air Narragansett-style excursion cars with front-facing bench seating collectively referred to by Disneyland employees as the Excursion Train, which was designed by Bob Gurr and built at Walt Disney Studios.|$|E
