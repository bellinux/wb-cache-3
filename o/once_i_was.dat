This was almost my undoing because after I had garnered, statistically, a certain number of credits I became the {{property}} of Barnard College at Columbia, and <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the property of Barnard I had to take, it seemed, what Barnard wanted me to take, not what I wanted to learn. Fortunately my high-school marks had been so bad that Barnard decided I could not belong to it and I was therefore allowed to continue getting an education.|$|E

2500|$|Powell {{described}} {{joining the}} Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) during college {{as one of}} the happiest experiences of his life; discovering something he loved and could do well, he felt he had [...] "found himself." [...] According to Powell: It was only <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in college, about six months into college when I found something that I liked, and that was ROTC, Reserve Officer Training Corps in the military. And I not only liked it, but I was pretty good at it. That's what you really have to look for in life, something that you like, and something that you think you're pretty good at. And if you can put those two things together, then you're on the right track, and just drive on. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, the ROTC fraternal organization and drill team begun by General John Pershing. Even after he had become a general, Powell kept on his desk a pen set he had won for a drill team competition.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{his first}} six novels and his rapid writing {{turnover}} later in his career, DeLillo remarked, [...] "I wasn't learning {{to slow down and}} examine what I was doing more closely. I don't have regrets about that work, but I do think that if I had been a bit less hasty in starting each new book, I might have produced somewhat better work in the 1970s. My first novel took so long and was such an effort that <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> free of it I almost became carefree in a sense and moved right through the decade, stopping, in a way, only at Ratner's Star (1976), which was an enormous challenge for me, and probably a bigger challenge for the reader. But I slowed down in the 1980s and '90s." [...] DeLillo has also acknowledged some of the weaknesses of his 1970s works, reflecting in 2007: [...] "I knew I wasn’t doing utterly serious work, let me put it that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|After her uncle's death, Hepburn, Ella and Miesje left Arnhem to {{live with}} her grandfather, Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, in nearby Velp. Food was scarce during this time and during the Dutch famine of 1944 and 1945 Hepburn and her family had to use tulip bulbs to make flour for bread. Around the same time Hepburn also {{performed}} silent dance performances in order {{to raise money for the}} Dutch resistance effort. It was long believed that during this time, Hepburn participated in the Dutch resistance. In 2016, the Airborne Museum 'Hartenstein' reported that after extensive research it had not found any evidence of such activities. In addition to other traumatic events, she witnessed the transportation of Dutch Jews to concentration camps, later stating that [...] "more than <b>once</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on the train. I was a child observing a child." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004 author Naomi Wolf {{wrote an}} article for New York Magazine accusing Harold Bloom of a sexual [...] "encroachment" [...] {{more than two decades}} earlier, by {{touching}} her thigh. She said that what she alleged Bloom did was not harassment, either legally or emotionally, and she did not think herself a [...] "victim", but that she had harbored this secret for 21 years. Explaining why she had finally gone public with the charges, Wolf wrote, [...] "I began, nearly a year ago, to try—privately—to start a conversation with my alma mater that would reassure me that steps had been taken in the ensuing years to ensure that unwanted sexual advances of this sort weren't still occurring. I expected Yale to be responsive. After nine months and many calls and e-mails, I was shocked to conclude that the atmosphere of collusion that had helped to keep me quiet twenty years ago was still intact—as secretive as a Masonic lodge." [...] When asked about the allegations in 2015, Bloom stated, [...] "I refuse to even use the name of this person. I call her Dracula's daughter, because her father was a Dracula scholar. I have never in my life been indoors with Dracula's daughter. When she came to the door of my house unbidden, my youngest son turned her away. <b>Once,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> walking up to campus, and she fell in with me and said, 'May I walk with you, Professor Bloom?' I said nothing." ...|$|E
