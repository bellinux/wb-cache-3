3000|$|This {{study showed}} that both {{prescribed}} fire and mechanical treatments were successful in reducing potential fire behavior with 90 th percentile and gust windspeeds, which met the <b>overriding</b> <b>clause</b> in the National Fire Plan (USDA-USDI 2000), 10 -Year Comprehensive Strategy (WGA 2001), and Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA 2003). However, with a faster windspeed, {{four of the five}} forest-treatment combinations would benefit from more extensive or further treatment based on modeled fire type, FL, and FI. It must be stated that the fuel treatments were designed to withstand 90 th percentile fire weather conditions, not the gust windspeeds modeled in this study. The fact that the treatments generally did not perform as well under the elevated windspeed raises the question of how managers might need to design fuel treatments to withstand the more extreme fire weather conditions projected for the future climate in California (Brown et al. 2004, Fried et al. 2008, Lenihan et al. 2008). Are the 90 th percentile fire weather conditions of today going to be the 80 th or 85 th percentile of the near future? Do managers today need to start planning for tomorrow and implement treatments to withstand current 95 th or 97.5 th percentile conditions? [...]...|$|E

50|$|A {{predetermined}} {{portion of}} the district’s population will then be required to submit a survey vote via the GOOOH website regarding the Representatives request and justification to vote contrary to their originally stated position on the Candidate Questionnaire. If the predetermined percent of the district's population {{do not participate in}} the survey, the <b>Override</b> <b>Clause</b> invocation is nullified and the Representative must vote as originally stated to their constituents or they violate their Commitment Agreement and must resign. A predetermined percent of the survey respondents will be required to approve the Representatives request in order to allow the Representative to successfully invoke the <b>Override</b> <b>Clause</b> and vote contrary to their original position on the issue. If the vote change request made by the GOOOH Representative is not approved by survey participants, the Representative must vote as originally stated to their constituents on their Candidate Questionnaire. They can also abstain.|$|R
40|$|Under section 33 of the 2 ̆ 7 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 2 ̆ 7 Parliament or {{a provincial}} {{legislature}} may enact a clause exempting legislation from {{the application of}} certain Charter provisions. It is commonly assumed that an <b>override</b> <b>clause</b> complying with section 33 takes effect automatically and {{is not subject to}} judicial review under the Charter. However, respectable arguments can be made to the contrary. I will set out one such argument here and briefly review the main objections to it...|$|R
40|$|The author {{outlines}} areas {{covered by}} constitutional texts {{and in doing}} so points to various deficiencies. The first one is brought on by the <b>override</b> <b>clause</b> provided in Section 33 of the Charter which makes it possible to suspend certain rights and a second one is found {{in the fact that the}} Charter does not deal with social and economic rights, a deficiency which is most likely to be perceived by members of a minority. His observations lead him to conclude that the courts will have to assume an activist role in order to implement various rights...|$|R

If the <b>Override</b> <b>Clause</b> is invoked, a Representative must seek approval from the members of his district through an online survey submitted to his district members via the GOOOH website. The candidate will be provided a forum to post his logic for changing his answer.|$|R
30|$|The {{process of}} ejecución hipotecaria has also {{undergone}} some reforms very recently (2013) {{which we should}} summarise here but do not affect {{the results of this}} paper either. In parallel to the debate on the judgment “Aziz vs CatalunyaCaixa”, 67 the Law 1 / 2013 opens avenues to <b>override</b> <b>clauses</b> that impose “excessive” interest rates to the debtor, through a reform of the Ley Hipotecaria. 68 The reform also increases from one to three the minimum number of payments that must be missed before the foreclosure process can be started and it allows suspending for two years the evictions of debtors when they are considered to be especially vulnerable. It also reformed the auction process by amending the Civil Procedure Act. Specifically, it has lowered the security required to tenderers.|$|R
50|$|An entrenched clause or entrenchment {{clause of}} a basic law or {{constitution}} is {{a provision that}} makes certain amendments either more difficult or impossible to pass, making such amendments inadmissible. <b>Overriding</b> an entrenched <b>clause</b> may require a supermajority, a referendum, or {{the consent of the}} minority party.|$|R
5000|$|The Act takes a {{different}} attitude for the defences available to the third party in counterclaims, with the Law Commission saying that to apply the same rules would be [...] "misleading and unnecessarily complex". This is because the counterclaim may be more valuable than the original claim, which would impose an obligation on the third party to pay the promisor money, something not appropriate under the doctrine of privity which prohibits the placing of a burden or obligation on a third party. Again, {{the parties to the}} contract can insert a <b>clause</b> <b>overriding</b> this.|$|R

25|$|One of Trudeau's most {{enduring}} legacies is the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, including a domestic amending formula and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It {{is seen as}} advancing civil rights and liberties {{and has become a}} cornerstone of Canadian values for most Canadians. It also represented the final step in Trudeau's liberal vision of a fully independent and nationalist Canada based on fundamental human rights and the protection of individual freedoms {{as well as those of}} linguistic and cultural minorities. Court challenges based on the Charter of Rights have been used to advance the cause of women's equality, re-establish French school boards in provinces such as Alberta and Saskatchewan, and to mandate the adoption of same-sex marriage all across Canada. Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, has clarified issues of aboriginal and equality rights, including establishing the previously denied aboriginal rights of Métis. Section 15, dealing with equality rights, has been used to remedy societal discrimination against minority groups. The coupling of the direct and indirect influences of the charter has meant that it has grown to influence every aspect of Canadian life and the <b>override</b> (notwithstanding <b>clause)</b> of the charter has been infrequently used.|$|R
40|$|Many {{contracts}} for {{the supply of}} goods or services include a clause prohibiting assignment by the supplier of its rights under the contract. The existence of such clauses, both in particular contracts and more generally, can have {{a chilling effect on}} the use of receivables as collateral to obtain financing. Thus, in many jurisdictions, there is a legislative <b>override</b> for such <b>clauses,</b> so that they are not enforceable against third parties. There is an ongoing debate as to whether English law should follow suit and, if so, what form the override should take, which has now led to a power to make reforms being included in sections 1 and 2 of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015. This chapter examines the arguments for and against an override in English law, informed by two small-scale surveys undertaken by the author and others over the last four years.

5000|$|Federal courts may {{overrule}} a {{state court}} {{only when there}} is a federal question, which is to say, a specific issue (such as consistency with the Federal Constitution) that gives rise to federal jurisdiction. Federal appellate review of state supreme court rulings on such matters may be sought by way of a petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. As the U.S. Supreme Court recognized in Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins (1938), no part of the federal Constitution actually grants federal courts or the federal Congress the power to directly dictate the content of state law (as distinguished from creating altogether separate federal law that in a particular situation may <b>override</b> state law). <b>Clause</b> 1 of Section 2 of Article Three of the United States Constitution describes the scope of federal judicial power, but only extended it to [...] "the Laws of the United States" [...] and not the laws of the several or individual states.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the 1906 {{earthquake}} and fire in San Francisco which destroyed the city, a clause known as the “ensuing loss” clause was created to address concurrent causation situations in which a loss follows both a covered peril and an excluded peril. Ensuing loss clauses appear in the exclusions section of such policies and in essence they provide that coverage for a loss caused by an excluded peril is nonetheless covered if the loss “ensues” from a covered peril. Today, ensuing loss clauses are found in “all risk” property and homeowners policies, which cover all losses except for losses caused by perils that are expressly excluded. A century after its creation, the clause often has been overlooked in cases in which it may have been applicable, and when it has been considered, it has confused and divided the courts. The courts’ inconsistent interpretation and application of the clause creates inefficiencies in the legal system because it is harder to settle cases that have: (1) unpredictable outcomes and (2) factual disputes regarding causation that must be resolved by juries at trial instead of judges as a matter of law. Thus, the parties and courts unnecessarily spend more time and resources on such cases. This Article claims: (1) the ensuing loss <b>clause</b> <b>overrides</b> anti-concurrent causation exclusions and (2) the courts’ confusion in interpreting and applying the clause has arisen due to the courts’ misunderstanding of the origins and purpose of the clause and their mistaken incorporation of theoretical tort causation concepts such as “efficient proximate cause” into the clause instead of applying the contractual rules of policy interpretation to the clause. The Article then proposes an interpretation of the clause that should lead to more predictable, consistent outcomes and the efficient resolution of claims...|$|R
