40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} {{that only a}} handful of drugs are available against soil-transmitted helminthiasis, all of which are characterized by a low efficacy against Trichuris trichiura, when administered as single doses. The re-evaluation of old, forgotten drugs is a promising strategy to identify alternative anthelminthic drug candidates or drug combinations. METHODOLOGY: We studied the activity of the veterinary drug <b>oxantel</b> pamoate against Trichuris muris, Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Necator americanus in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the dose-effect of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate combined with albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, pyrantel pamoate and ivermectin was studied against T. muris in vitro and additive or synergistic combinations were followed up in vivo. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We calculated an ED 50 of 4. 7 mg/kg for <b>oxantel</b> pamoate against T. muris in mice. Combinations of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate with pyrantel pamoate behaved antagonistically in vitro (combination index (CI)  =  2. 53). <b>Oxantel</b> pamoate combined with levamisole, albendazole or ivermectin using ratios based on their ED 50 s revealed antagonistic effects in vivo (CI =  1. 27, 1. 90 and 1. 27, respectively). A highly synergistic effect (CI =  0. 15) was observed when <b>oxantel</b> pamoate-mebendazole was administered to T. muris-infected mice. <b>Oxantel</b> pamoate (10 mg/kg) lacked activity against Ancylostoma ceylanicum and Necator americanus in vivo. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study confirms the excellent trichuricidal properties of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate. Since the drug lacks activity against hookworms it is necessary to combine <b>oxantel</b> pamoate with a partner drug with anti-hookworm properties. Synergistic effects were observed for <b>oxantel</b> pamoate-mebendazole, hence this combination should be studied in more detail. Since, of the standard drugs, albendazole has the highest efficacy against hookworms, additional investigations on the combination effect of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate-albendazole should be launched...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Commonly {{used drugs}} for {{preventive}} chemotherapy against soil-transmitted helminths (ie, albendazole and mebendazole) show low efficacy against Trichuris trichiura. Recent studies with <b>oxantel</b> pamoate revealed good cure rates and high egg-reduction rates against T trichiura. We aimed {{to assess the}} nature of the dose-response relation to determine the optimum dose. METHODS: We did a parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled, single-blind trial with <b>oxantel</b> pamoate in school-aged children (aged 6 - 14 years) infected with T trichiura on Pemba Island, Tanzania. Children were asked to provide two stool samples and children positive for T trichiura were eligible to participate in the trial. Children were excluded if they suffered from any systematic illness. Children were randomly assigned to six different <b>oxantel</b> pamoate doses (5 - 30 mg/kg) or a placebo. Randomisation was stratified by baseline infection intensity using random block sizes of seven and 14. The primary endpoints were cure rates and egg-reduction rates against T trichiura, both analysed by available case. Drug safety was assessed 2 h and 24 h after treatment. The trial is registered at www. isrctn. com, number ISRCTN 86603231. FINDINGS: Between Oct 14, and Nov 28, 2014, we enrolled 480 participants and randomly assigned 350 children to the different <b>oxantel</b> pamoate doses or the placebo. 5 mg/kg <b>oxantel</b> pamoate was the minimum effective dose (10 of 46 children cured [cure rate 22 %, 95 % CI 11 - 36]; egg-reduction rate 85 · 0 %, 64 · 5 - 92 · 9). An increased probability of being cured and reduced egg counts with escalating doses was recorded. At 25 mg/kg <b>oxantel</b> pamoate 27 of 45 children were cured (cure rate 60 %, 95 % CI 44 - 65) with an egg-reduction rate of 97 · 5 % (94 · 4 - 98 · 9), and at 30 mg/kg 27 of 46 children were cured (59 %, 43 - 73) with an egg-reduction rate of 98 · 8 % (96 · 8 - 99 · 6). <b>Oxantel</b> pamoate was well tolerated across all treatment groups; only mild adverse events were reported by the participants 2 h (27 [10 %]) and 24 h (12 [4 %]) after treatment. INTERPRETATION: Our dose-finding study revealed an excellent tolerability profile of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate in children infected with T trichiura. An optimum therapeutic dose range of 15 - 30 mg/kg <b>oxantel</b> pamoate was defined. With a weight independent dose of 500 mg <b>oxantel</b> pamoate 95 % of children aged 7 - 14 years in sub-Saharan Africa would receive doses of 11 · 7 - 32 · 0 mg/kg. Future research should include studies with <b>oxantel</b> pamoate in younger children and on different continents with the ultimate goal to be able to add <b>oxantel</b> pamoate to soil-transmitted helminth control programmes...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial {{pathogens}} {{commonly associated}} with chronic periodontitis are the spirochete Treponema denticola and the Gram-negative, proteolytic species Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. These species rely on complex anaerobic respiration of amino acids, and the anthelmintic drug <b>oxantel</b> {{has been shown to}} inhibit fumarate reductase (Frd) activity in some pathogenic bacteria and inhibit P. gingivalis homotypic biofilm formation. Here, we demonstrate that <b>oxantel</b> inhibited P. gingivalis Frd activity with a 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 2. 2 μM and planktonic growth of T. forsythia with a MIC of 295 μM, but it had no effect on the growth of T. denticola. <b>Oxantel</b> treatment caused the downregulation of six P. gingivalis gene products and the upregulation of 22 gene products. All of these genes are part of a regulon controlled by heme availability. There was no large-scale change in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes, indicating that P. gingivalis may be unable to overcome Frd inhibition. <b>Oxantel</b> disrupted the development of polymicrobial biofilms composed of P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, and T. denticola in a concentration-dependent manner. In these biofilms, all three species were inhibited to a similar degree, demonstrating the synergistic nature of biofilm formation by these species and the dependence of T. denticola on the other two species. In a murine alveolar bone loss model of periodontitis <b>oxantel</b> addition to the drinking water of P. gingivalis-infected mice reduced bone loss to the same level as the uninfected control.

40|$|Background Preventive {{chemotherapy}} is {{the current}} strategy to control soil-transmitted helminth infections (caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura). But, to improve efficacy and avoid emerging resistance, new drugs are warranted. Tribendimidine has shown good anthelmintic efficacy and is therefore a frontrunner for monotherapy and combination chemotherapy. Methods We did a randomised, controlled, single-blinded, non-inferiority trial on Pemba Island, Tanzania, and in Côte d'Ivoire. We recruited adolescents aged 15 – 18 years from four primary schools on Pemba, and school attendees and non-schoolers from two districts in Côte d'Ivoire. Only hookworm-positive participants were randomly assigned (1 : 1 : 1 : 1) to single, oral doses of tribendimidine 400 mg plus placebo (tribendimidine monotherapy), tribendimidine 400 mg plus ivermectin 200 μg/kg, tribendimidine 400 mg plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate 25 mg/kg, or albendazole 400 mg plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate 25 mg/kg. Randomisation was done via a computer-generated list in block sizes of four or eight. Participants {{were asked to provide}} two stool samples on 2 consecutive days at baseline and again 14 – 21 days at follow-up. The primary outcome was the difference in egg-reduction rates (ERRs; ie, the geometric mean reduction) in hookworm egg counts between treatment groups, measured by the Kato-Katz technique. Differences in coadministrated treatment groups were assessed for non-inferiority with a margin of − 3 % to albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate based on the available-case population, analysed by intention to treat. Safety was assessed 3 h and 24 h after treatment. This study is registered with ISRCTN (number 14373201). Findings Between July 26, and Dec 23, 2016, we treated 636 hookworm-positive participants, and outcome data were available for 601 participants (151 assigned to tribendimidine monotherapy, 154 to tribendimidine plus ivermectin, 148 to tribendimidine plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate, and 148 to albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate). Tribendimidine plus ivermectin was non-inferior to albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate (ERRs 99 · 5 % [95 % CI 99 · 2 – 99 · 7] vs 96 · 0 % [93 · 9 – 97 · 4]; difference 3 · 52 percentage points [2 · 05 – 5 · 65]). Likewise, tribendimidine plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate was non-inferior to albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate (ERRs 96 · 5 % [95 % CI 94 · 9 to 97 · 6] vs 96 · 0 % [93 · 9 to 97 · 4]; difference 0 · 48 percentage points [– 1 · 61 to 2 · 88]). 3 h after treatment, headache (n= 50 [8 %]) and vertigo (n= 37 [6 %]) were the most widely reported symptoms; 24 h after treatment, 50 (8 %) patients reported vertigo and 41 (7 %) reported headache. Mainly mild adverse events were reported with peak numbers (n= 111 [18 %]) at 24 h after treatment. Three participants had moderate adverse events 3 h after treatment: two (< 1 %) had vertigo and one (< 1 %) had headache, and two had moderate adverse events 24 h after treatment: one (< 1 %) had vomiting and one (< 1 %) had vomiting plus diarrhoea. Interpretation Tribendimidine in combination with either ivermectin or <b>oxantel</b> pamoate had a similar, non-inferior efficacy profile as albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate, hence tribendimidine will be a useful addition to the depleted anthelmintic drug armamentarium.

40|$|Infections with soil-transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura) are {{widespread}} and often occur concomitantly. These parasitic-worm infections are typically treated with albendazole or mebendazole, but both drugs show low efficacy against T. trichiura. Albendazole is the {{drug of choice}} against hookworm.; In this double-blind trial conducted on Pemba Island, Tanzania, we randomly assigned children, 6 to 14 years of age, to receive one of four treatments: <b>oxantel</b> pamoate at a dose of 20 mg per kilogram of body weight, plus 400 mg of albendazole, administered on consecutive days; <b>oxantel</b> pamoate at a single dose of 20 mg per kilogram; albendazole at a single dose of 400 mg; or mebendazole at a single dose of 500 mg. We assessed the efficacy and safety profile of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate-albendazole when used {{in the treatment of}} T. trichiura infection (primary outcome) and concomitant soil-transmitted helminth infection (secondary outcome). Efficacy was determined by means of assessment of the cure rate and egg-reduction rate. Adverse events were assessed four times after treatment.; Complete data were available for 458 children, of whom 450 were infected with T. trichiura, 443 with hookworm, and 293 with A. lumbricoides. The cure rate of T. trichiura infection was significantly higher with <b>oxantel</b> pamoate-albendazole than with mebendazole (31. 2 % vs. 11. 8 %, P= 0. 001), as was the egg-reduction rate (96. 0 % [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 93. 5 to 97. 6] vs. 75. 0 % [95 % CI, 64. 2 to 82. 0]). The cure rate with albendazole (2. 6 %) and the egg-reduction rate with albendazole (45. 0 %; 95 % CI, 32. 0 to 56. 4) were significantly lower than the rates with mebendazole (P= 0. 02 for the comparison of cure rates). <b>Oxantel</b> pamoate had low efficacy against hookworm and A. lumbricoides. Adverse events (mainly mild) were reported by 30. 9 % of all children.; Treatment with <b>oxantel</b> pamoate-albendazole resulted in higher cure and egg-reduction rates for T. trichiura infection than the rates with standard therapy.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the anthelmintic activity of three different doses of an association of pyrantel pamoate, <b>oxantel</b> pamoate and praziquantel in a single oral dose, in naturally infected cats. Animals were obtained from the Centro de Controle de Zoonoses, from Diadema, São Paulo, and divided in four groups each of eight cats, based on pretreatment faecal examination. Group 1 : untreated control cats; Group 2 : 5 mg of pyrantel pamoate, 5 mg of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate and 2. 5 mg of praziquantel/kg body weight (BW); Group 3 : 10 mg of pyrantel pamoate, 10 mg of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate and 5 mg of praziquantel/kg BW and Group 4 : 20 mg of pyrantel pamoate, 20 mg of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate and 10 mg of praziquantel/kg BW. The percentage of reduction in egg counts and percentage of efficacy were calculated. Mean egg counts from all treated cats decreased significantly from the second day after treatment on. The number of immature Toxocara cati and Ancylostoma spp. worms also decreased, however it was not significant. The number of adult worms decreased significantly in the treated groups. The percentage of efficacy for Toxocara cati was 93. 0 %, 97. 6 % and 100. 0 % and for Ancylostoma spp. was 96. 5 %, 99. 0 % and 100. 0 %, for groups 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

40|$|Nicotinic receptors (AChRs) {{play key}} roles in {{synaptic}} transmission. We explored activation of neuronal α 7 and mammalian muscle AChRs by morantel and <b>oxantel.</b> Our results revealed a novel action of morantel {{as a high}} efficacy and more potent agonist than ACh of α 7 receptors. The EC 50 for activation by morantel of both α 7 and α 7 - 5 HT 3 A receptors is 7 -fold lower than that determined for ACh. The minimum morantel concentration required to activate α 7 - 5 HT 3 A channels is 6 -fold {{lower than that of}} ACh, and activation episodes are more prolonged than in the presence of ACh. By contrast, <b>oxantel</b> is a weak agonist of α 7 and α 7 - 5 HT 3 A, and both drugs are very low efficacy agonists of muscle AChRs. The replacement of Gln 57 in α 7 by glycine, which is found in the equivalent position of the muscle AChR, decreases the efficacy for activation and turns morantel into a partial agonist. The reverse mutation in the muscle AChR (ϵG 57 Q) increases 7 -fold the efficacy of morantel. The mutations do not affect activation by ACh or <b>oxantel,</b> indicating that this position is selective for morantel. In silico studies show that the tetrahydropyrimidinyl group, common to both drugs, is close to Trp 149 of the principal face of the binding site, whereas the other cyclic group is proximal to Gln 57 of the complementary face in morantel but not in <b>oxantel.</b> Thus, position 57 at the complementary face is a key determinant of the high selectivity of morantel for α 7. These results provide new information for further progress in drug design...|$|E
40|$|The current {{treatments}} against Trichuris trichiura, albendazole and mebendazole, {{are only}} poorly efficacious. Therefore, combination chemotherapy was recommended for treating soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Albendazole-mebendazole and albendazole-oxantel pamoate have shown promising results in clinical trials. However, in vitro and in vivo drug interaction studies {{should be performed}} before their simultaneous treatment can be recommended. Inhibition of human recombinant cytochromes P 450 (CYPs) CYP 1 A 2, CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19, CYP 2 D 6, and CYP 3 A 4 was tested by exposure to albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, mebendazole, and <b>oxantel</b> pamoate, as well as albendazole-mebendazole, albendazole sulfoxide-mebendazole, albendazole-oxantel pamoate, and albendazole sulfoxide-oxantel pamoate. A high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) -UV/visible spectroscopy method was developed and validated for simultaneous quantification of albendazole sulfoxide, albendazole sulfone, mebendazole, and <b>oxantel</b> pamoate in plasma. Albendazole, mebendazole, <b>oxantel</b> pamoate, albendazole-mebendazole, and albendazole-oxantel pamoate were orally applied to rats (100 mg/kg) and pharmacokinetic parameters calculated. CYP 1 A 2 showed a 2. 6 -fold increased inhibition by albendazole-oxantel pamoate (50 % inhibitory concentration [IC 50] = 3. 1 μM) and a 3. 9 -fold increased inhibition by albendazole sulfoxide-mebendazole (IC 50 = 3. 8 μM) compared to the single drugs. In rats, mebendazole's area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) were augmented 3. 5 - and 2. 8 -fold, respectively (P = 0. 02 for both) when coadministered with albendazole compared to mebendazole alone. Albendazole sulfone was slightly affected by albendazole-mebendazole, displaying a 1. 3 -fold-elevated AUC compared to albendazole alone. <b>Oxantel</b> pamoate could not be quantified, translating to a bioavailability below 0. 025 % in rats. Elevated plasma levels of albendazole sulfoxide, albendazole sulfone, and mebendazole in coadministrations are probably not mediated by CYP-based drug-drug interaction. Even though this study indicates that {{it is safe to}} coadminister albendazole-oxantel pamoate and albendazole-mebendazole, human pharmacokinetic studies are recommended...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{anthelmintic}} drugs (eg, albendazole and mebendazole) {{have low}} efficacy against the intestinal nematode species Trichuris trichiura {{and the drug}} pipeline is exhausted. We aimed to investigate the strategy of combination chemotherapy with existing drugs to establish whether their efficacy could be enhanced and broadened. METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, we compared three drug combinations and one standard drug alone in children aged 6 - 14 years in two schools on Pemba Island, Tanzania infected with T trichiura and concomitant intestinal nematodes. We assigned children, via a randomisation list with block sizes of either four or eight, to orally receive albendazole (400 mg) plus ivermectin (200 μg/kg); albendazole (400 mg) plus mebendazole (500 mg); albendazole (400 mg) plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate (20 mg/kg); or mebendazole (500 mg) alone. The primary endpoints were the proportion of children cured of T trichiura infection and the reduction of T trichiura eggs in stool based on geometric means, both analysed by available case. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN 80245406. FINDINGS: We randomly assigned 440 eligible children infected with T trichiura between Sept 2, and Oct 18, 2013, {{to one of the}} four treatment groups (110 children per group). Data for 431 children were included in the analysis for the primary endpoints. Albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate (74 of 108 children cured [68 · 5 %, 95 % CI 59 · 6 - 77 · 4]; egg reduction 99 · 2 %, 98 · 7 - 99 · 6) and albendazole plus ivermectin (30 of 109 cured [27 · 5 %, 19 · 0 - 36 · 0]; egg reduction 94 · 5 %, 91 · 7 - 96 · 3) were significantly more effective against T trichiura than mebendazole alone (nine of 107 cured [8 · 4 %, 3 · 1 - 13 · 8]; egg reduction 58 · 5 %, 45 · 2 - 70 · 9). Albendazole plus mebendazole had similar low efficacy (nine of 107 cured [8 · 4 %, 3 · 1 - 13 · 8; egg reduction 51 · 6 %, 35 · 0 - 65 · 3) to mebendazole alone. About a fifth of the children reported adverse events, which were mainly mild. Abdominal cramps and headache were the most common adverse events after treatment; abdominal cramps were reported by 13 (12 · 0 %) children for albendazole plus ivermectin, 10 (9 · 3 %) for albendazole plus mebendazole, 20 (18 · 2 %) for albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate, and 16 (14 · 5 %) for mebendazole; headaches were reported by 5 (4 · 6 %) children for albendazole plus ivermectin, 6 (5 · 6 %) for albendazole plus mebendazole, 12 (10 · 9 %) for albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate, and 7 (6 · 4 %) for mebendazole. INTERPRETATION: Our head-to-head comparison of three combination chemotherapies showed the highest efficacy for albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate for the treatment of infection with T trichiura.

40|$|Millions {{of people}} are treated with {{anthelmintics}} to control soil-transmitted helminth infections; yet, drug distribution in the plasma and gastrointestinal tract compartments and the pathway of drug uptake into gastrointestinal nematodes responsible for the pharmacological effect are unknown. We assessed the distribution and uptake of albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, albendazole sulfone in the hookworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus in vitro and in vivo {{as well as the}} distribution and uptake of albendazole, mebendazole, and <b>oxantel</b> pamoate in the whipworm Trichuris muris in vitro and in vivo. Oral and intraperitoneal treatments (100  mg/kg) were studied. Drug quantities in helminths and host compartments (stomach, the contents and mucosa of the small and large intestine, and the plasma) were determined using HPLC-UV/vis and anthelmintic activities were recorded using phenotypic readout. The influence of 1 -aminobenzotriazole (ABT), an irreversible and unspecific cytochrome P 450 inhibitor, on albendazole disposition in mice harboring H.  polygyrus was evaluated. In vivo, albendazole was found in quantities up to 10  nmol per ten H.  polygyrus and up to 31  nmol per ten T.  muris. ABT did not change the levels of albendazole or its metabolites in the plasma of mice harboring H.  polygyrus or in H.  polygyrus, whereas drug levels in the gastrointestinal tract of host mice doubled. Mebendazole and <b>oxantel</b> pamoate quantities per ten T.  muris were as high as 21  nmol and 34  nmol, respectively. Albendazole revealed a very dynamic distribution and high rate of metabolism, hence, H.  polygyrus and T.  muris are exposed to albendazole and both metabolites via multiple pathways. Diffusion through the cuticle seems to be the crucial pathway of <b>oxantel</b> pamoate uptake into T.  muris, and likely also for mebendazole.

Design: Retrospective case series and case-control study. Animals: 16 captive cheetahs with signs of adverse reaction to oral administration of praziquantel and pyrantel, with or without <b>oxantel</b> embonate (affected group), and 27 cheetahs without such reactions (unaffected group), all from 3 independent facilities. Procedures: Medical records and postmortem findings for affected cheetahs were reviewed and compared with those of unaffected animals. Anthelmintic doses administered, age, and sex of cheetahs were compared between groups. Results: 3 reactions in affected cheetahs were fatal, whereas the remainder ranged from mild to severe. Postmortem examination failed to reveal any disease processes or conditions to explain the deaths. No differences in anthelmintic dose were identified between affected and unaffected cheetahs for all facilities combined, and no correlation existed between dose and reaction severity. No association with sex was detected, but affected cheetahs were significantly younger than unaffected cheetahs. This difference was not significant after controlling for facility. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Cheetahs were concluded to have had an adverse reaction to the praziquantel-pyrantel combination because of temporal proximity of onset of clinical signs to dose administration, similarity of signs to those reported for toxicosis in other species for these drugs, and a lack of other disease process or environmental explanatory factors. A highly cautious approach to the use of this drug combination is recommended for cheetahs...|$|E
40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} are {{of medical}} and veterinary importance, adversely affecting human health and animal welfare. Ascaris suum is a gastrointestinal parasite of pigs; {{in addition to its}} veterinary significance it is a good model of the human parasite Ascaris lumbricoides, estimated to infect ~ 1. 4 billion people globally. Anthelmintic drugs are essential to control nematode parasites, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on nerve and muscle are the targets of cholinergic anthelmintics such as levamisole and pyrantel. Previous genetic analyses of nematode nAChRs have been confined to Caenorhabditis elegans, which is phylogenetically distinct from Ascaris spp. and many other important parasites. Here we report the cloning and expression of two nAChR subunit cDNAs from A. suum. The subunits are very similar in sequence to C. elegans UNC- 29 and UNC- 38, are expressed on muscle cells and can be expressed robustly in Xenopus oocytes to form acetylcholine-, nicotine-, levamisole- and pyrantel-sensitive channels. We also demonstrate that changing the stoichiometry of the receptor by injecting different ratios of the subunit cRNAs can reproduce two of the three pharmacological subtypes of nAChR present in A. suum muscle cells. When the ratio was 5 : 1 (Asu-unc- 38 :Asu-unc- 29), nicotine was a full agonist and levamisole was a partial agonist, and oocytes responded to <b>oxantel,</b> but not pyrantel. At the reverse ratio (1 : 5 Asu-unc- 38 :Asu-unc- 29), levamisole was a full agonist and nicotine was a partial agonist, and the oocytes responded to pyrantel, but not <b>oxantel.</b> These results represent the first in vitro expression of any parasitic nicotinic receptor and show that their properties are substantially different from those of C. elegans. The results also show that changing the expression level of a single receptor subunit dramatically altered the efficacy of some anthelmintic drugs. In vitro expression of these subunits may permit the development of parasite-specific screens for future anthelmintics...|$|E
40|$|Trichuriasis {{represents}} {{a major public}} health problem {{in the developing world}} and is regarded as a neglected disease. Albendazole and mebendazole, the two drugs of choice against trichuriasis display only moderate cure rates, hence alternative drugs are needed.

The objective {{of the present study was}} to develop a simple and cost-effective drug sensitivity assay using Trichuris muris first-stage larvae (L 1).; Several potential triggers that induce hatching of T. muris were studied, including gastrointestinal enzymes, acidic environment and intestinal microflora. Next, optimal culture conditions for T. muris L 1 were determined assessing a wide range of culture media. T. muris L 1 were incubated in the presence of mebendazole, ivermectin, nitazoxanide, levamisole or <b>oxantel</b> pamoate at 37 °C. The viability of the parasites was evaluated microscopically after 24 hours. The usefulness of fluorescent markers (resazurin, calcein AM, ethidium homodimer- 1 or fluorescein-conjugated albumin) in drug sensitivity testing was also assessed.; The established L 1 motility assay provided accurate and reproducible drug effect data in vitro. IC 50 values for <b>oxantel</b> pamoate, levamisole and nitazoxanide were 0. 05, 1. 75 and 4. 43 μg/mL, respectively. Mebendazole and ivermectin failed to show any trichuricidal effect on L 1. No correlation was found between data from the four fluorescent markers and the comparative motility assay.; The motility assay based on L 1 was found suitable for drug sensitivity screening.

40|$|More {{than one}} third of the world’s {{population}} is infected with at least one helminth, among which schistosomiasis and trichuriasis are highly prevalent. The control of schistosomiasis relies heavily on the treatment of people living in endemic areas with praziquantel. Praziquantel is currently the only available antischistosomal drug and 28 million patients are treated every year, which leads to a high drug pressure on schistosomes. The low efficacy on the juvenile stage of Schistosoma and the risk of development of drug resistance urges the development of an alternative treatment. The current chemotherapy of trichuriasis, using two benzimidazoles albendazole and mebendazole, results in unsatisfactory treatment outcomes. The co-administration of the two drugs cures more trichuriasis patients than the drugs administered separately. Also the co-administration of albendazole with the rediscovered trichuricidal drug <b>oxantel</b> pamoate is a promising treatment. In order to apply these coadministrations on the large scale, safety has to be assured. The objectives of this thesis were to advance the development of antischistosomal drugs by conducting structure-activity relationship studies and by defining new pharmacophores for lead optimization. Moreover, we aimed to determine the safety of two coadministrations (albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate, and albendazole plus mebendazole) by studying their preclinical in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interactions. Three compound sets were investigated for antischistosomal activity by testing them first against the larval and adult stage of S. mansoni, followed by a cytotoxicity determination to finally evaluate the in vivo efficacy in the chronic S. mansoni mouse model. The first set tested consisted of five different synthetic peroxide classes: bridged 1, 2, 4 -trioxolanes, bridged 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetraoxanes, tricyclic monoperoxides, silyl peroxides, and hydroxylamine derivatives. The trioxolanes, tetraoxanes, and the tricyclic monoperoxides showed high in vitro activities in the low micromolar to nanomolar range. None of the compounds revealed significantly high drug efficacy in vivo. The highest efficacy was achieved by the trioxolane class displaying a worm burden reduction (WBR) of 44...|$|E
40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} pose {{a significant}} {{threat to the}} health and economic welfare of communities worldwide, both directly through human disease and indirectly through infection of livestock and crop. At present, anthelmintic drugs such as the nicotinic agonists, which target nematode nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), offer a facile and cost-effective method of controlling both human and animal infection. Unfortunately, the continued heavy reliance on such compounds has led to the inevitable emergence of resistance in many different Nematoda species, thus making the subject of nematode nicotinic receptors of great importance. Using various levamisole-resistant, nAChR subunit mutants of the soil-dwelling nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (viz. unc- 29, unc- 38 and unc- 63) and well-established resistance-monitoring assays, the responses of the different strains to the nicotinic agonists levamisole, morantel, <b>oxantel</b> and pyrantel have begun to be characterized. Wild-type adult C. elegans are relatively unaffected by 1 mM <b>oxantel,</b> contrasting with a developmental retardation of larvae. Also, unc- 38 mutants appear to be less refractory to the anthelmintics than the unc- 29 and unc- 63 animals. In preparation for the use of C. elegans as an ectopic transformation system for parasitic receptor DNA, preliminary biolistic transformation experiments were performed using microparticle bombardment. It was found that transformation of unc- 38 animals with myo- 3 ::gfp construct has no significant effect on their ability to thrash in suspension. The mutant characterization data may possibly reflect differential expression of nAChRs at various stages of development. The transformation data suggest that microparticle bombardment has little or no effect on C. elegans, which is essential for future transgenic experiments. In summary, important baseline data on C. elegans nicotinic receptors have been generated and a fundamental transgenic control line in unc- 38;myo- 3 ::gfp has been established. This will allow for exciting rescue experiments using parasitic nematode nAChR DNA. Copyright The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.

Given {{the high cost of}} drug discovery and development, the high failure rates and the long duration to develop novel treatments, drug repurposing circumvents these obstacles by finding new uses for compounds other than those they were initially intended to treat. In the present review, we summarize in vivo and clinical trial findings testing clinical candidates and marketed drugs against schistosomes, food-borne trematodes, soil-transmitted helminths, Strongyloides stercoralis, the major human filariases lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, taeniasis, neurocysticercosis and echinococcosis.

FISH-microautoradiography and post-FISH fluorescent chemical staining confirmed acetate assimilation as polyhydroxyalkanoates in cluster 1 Defluviicoccus under anaerobic conditions. Chemical inhibition of glycolysis using iodoacetate, and of isocitrate lyase by 3 -nitropropionate and itaconate, indicated that carbon is likely to be channelled through both glycolysis and the glyoxylate cycle in cluster 1 Defluviicoccus. The effect of metabolic inhibitors of aconitase (monofluoroacetate) and succinate dehydrogenase (malonate) suggested that aconitase, but not succinate dehydrogenase, was active, providing further support for the role of the glyoxylate cycle in these GAOs. Metabolic inhibition of fumarate reductase using <b>oxantel</b> decreased polyhydroxyalkanoate production. This indicated reduction of fumarate to succinate and the operation of the reductive branch of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is possibly important in the production of the polyhydroxyvalerate component of polyhydroxyalkanoates observed in cluster 1 Defluviicoccus enrichment cultures. These findings were integrated with previous metabolic models for GAOs and enabled an anaerobic central metabolic pathway model for polyhydroxyalkanoate formation in cluster 1 Defluviicoccus to be proposed...|$|E

40|$|Control of {{nematode}} parasite infections relies {{largely on}} anthelminthic drugs, several of which act on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) {{and there are}} concerns {{about the development of}} resistance. There is an urgent need for development of new resistance-busting drugs and novel anthelmintic drug targets. We describe the functional expression and pharmacological characterization of the homomeric nAChR, ACR- 16, from a nematode parasite. [br/]Using RT-PCR, molecular cloning, and two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology, we localized acr- 16 mRNA in Ascaris suum, then cloned and expressed acr- 16 cRNA in Xenopus oocytes. Sensitivity of the receptor to cholinergic anthelmintics and a range of nicotinic agonists was then tested. [br/]Amino acid sequence comparison with vertebrate nAChR subunits revealed ACR- 16 to be most closely related to α 7 receptors, but with some striking distinctions. acr- 16 mRNA was recovered from A. suum somatic muscle, pharynx, ovijector, head and intestine. In electrophysiological experiments, we observed that existing cholinergic anthelmintic agonists (morantel, levamisole, methyridine, thenium, bephenium, tribendimidine & pyrantel) did not activate Asu-ACR- 16 (except for small currents to <b>oxantel).</b> Other nAChR agonists: nicotine, acetylcholine, cytisine, 3 -bromocytisine and epibatidine produced robust current responses which desensitized at a rate that varied with the agonists. Unlike α 7, Asu-ACR- 16 was insensitive to α-bungarotoxin, and did not respond to genistein or other α 7 positive allosteric modulators. Asu-ACR- 16 had a lower calcium permeability than α 7 receptors.

40|$|We are {{interested}} in the allosteric modulation of neuronal nic-otinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We have postulated that the anthelmintic morantel (Mor) positively modulates (po-tentiates) rat 32 receptors through a site located at the () /() interface that is homologous to the canonical agonist site (J Neurosci 29 : 8734 – 8742, 2009). On this basis, we aimed to determine the site specificity by studying differences in mod-ulation between 32 and 42 receptors. We also compared modulation by Mor with that of the related compound <b>oxantel</b> (Oxa). Whereas Mor and Oxa each potentiated 32 receptors 2 -fold at saturating acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations, Mor had no effect on 42 receptors, and Oxa inhibited ACh-evoked responses. The inhibition was noncompetitive, but not due to open channel block. Furthermore, {{the nature and extent of}} modulation did not depend on subunit stoichiometry. We studied six positions at the () interface that differ between 3 and 4. Two positions (3 Ile 57 and 3 Thr 115) help mediate the effects of the modulators but do not seem to contribute to specificity. Mutations in two others (3 Leu 107 and 3 Ile 117) yielded receptors with appreciable 4 -character; that is, Mor potentiation was reduced compared with wild-type 32 con-trol and Oxa inhibition was evident. A fifth position (3 Glu 113) was unique in that it discriminated between the two com-pounds, showing no change in Mor potentiation from control but substantial Oxa inhibition. Our work has implications for rational drug design for nicotinic receptors and sheds light on mechanisms of allosteric modulation in nAChRs, especially the subtle differences between potentiation and inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Known {{agonists}} of {{the orphan}} receptor GPR 35 are kynurenic acid, zaprinast, 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylproplyamino) benzoic acid, and lysophosphatidic acids. Their relatively low affinities for GPR 35 and prominent off-target effects at other pathways, however, diminish their utility for understanding GPR 35 signaling and for identifying potential therapeutic uses of GPR 35. In a screen of the Prestwick Library {{of drugs and}} drug-like compounds, {{we have found that}} pamoic acid is a potent GPR 35 agonist. Pamoic acid is considered by the Food and Drug Administration as an inactive compound that enables long-acting formulations of numerous drugs, such as the antihelminthics <b>oxantel</b> pamoate and pyrantel pamoate; the psychoactive compounds hydroxyzine pamoate (Vistaril) and imipramine pamoate (Tofranil-PM); and the peptide hormones triptorelin pamoate (Trelstar) and octreotide pamoate (OncoLar). We have found that pamoic acid induces a Gi/o-linked, GPR 35 -mediated increase in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2, recruitment of β-arrestin 2 to GPR 35, and internalization of GPR 35. In mice, it attenuates visceral pain perception, indicating an antinociceptive effect, possibly through GPR 35 receptors. We have also identified in collaboration with the Sanford-Burnham Institute Molecular Libraries Probe Production Center new classes of GPR 35 antagonist compounds, including the nanomolar potency antagonist methyl- 5 -[(tert-butylcarbamothioylhydrazinylidene) methyl]- 1 -(2, 4 -difluorophenyl) pyrazole- 4 -carboxylate (CID 2745687). Pamoic acid and potent antagonists such as CID 2745687 present novel opportunities for expanding the chemical space of GPR 35, elucidating GPR 35 pharmacology, and stimulating GPR 35 -associated drug development.

40|$|A major {{hindrance}} to evaluating nematode populations for anthelmintic resistance, {{as well as}} {{for screening}} existing drugs, new compounds, or bioactive plant extracts for anthelmintic properties, is the lack of an efficient, objective, and reproducible in vitro assay that is adaptable to multiple life stages and parasite genera. To address this need we have developed the “Worminator” system, which objectively and quantitatively measures the motility of microscopic stages of parasitic nematodes. The system is built around the computer application “WormAssay”, developed at the Center for Discovery and Innovation in Parasitic Diseases at the University of California, San Francisco. WormAssay was designed to assess motility of macroscopic parasites for the purpose of high throughput screening of potential anthelmintic compounds, utilizing high definition video as an input to assess motion of adult stage (macroscopic) parasites (e. g. Brugia malayi). We adapted this assay for use with microscopic parasites by modifying the software to support a full frame analysis mode that applies the motion algorithm to the entire video frame. Thus, the motility of all parasites in a given well are recorded and measured simultaneously. Assays performed on third-stage larvae (L 3) of the bovine intestinal nematode Cooperia spp., as well as microfilariae (mf) of the filarioid nematodes B. malayi and Dirofilaria immitis, yielded reproducible dose responses using the macrocyclic lactones ivermectin, doramectin, and moxidectin, as well as the nicotinic agonists, pyrantel, <b>oxantel,</b> morantel, and tribendimidine. This new computer based-assay is simple to use, requires minimal new investment in equipment, is robust across nematode genera and developmental stage, and does not require subjective scoring of motility by an observer. Thus, the “Worminator” provides a relatively low-cost platform for developing genera- and stage-specific assays with high efficiency and reproducibility, low labor input, and yields objective motility data that is not subject to scorer bias...|$|E

However, their low efficacy against T. trichiura, made an accurate assessment of reinfection patterns impossible.; In 2013 a randomised controlled trial was conducted on Pemba Island, Tanzania. School-aged children diagnosed positive for T. trichiura, were randomly allocated to (i) albendazole-ivermectin; (ii) albendazole-mebendazole; (iii) albendazole-oxantel pamoate; or (iv) mebendazole. Here we report the efficacy [cure rates (CR) and egg-reduction rates (ERR) ], reinfection rates and new infections determined 18  weeks post-treatment.; For a total of 405 children complete baseline and follow-up data were available. Similar to the efficacy determined after 3 weeks, 18  weeks after treatment albendazole-oxantel pamoate showed a significantly higher efficacy against T. trichiura (CR: 54. 0 %, 95 % CI: 43. 7 - 64. 0; ERR: 98. 6 %, 95 % CI: 97. 8 - 99. 2) {{compared to the other}} treatment arms. Children treated with albendazole-oxantel pamoate or albendazole-ivermectin had fewer moderate infections compared to children treated with albendazole.

Combination chemotherapy might achieve decreased morbidity in children since in the albendazole plus <b>oxantel</b> pamoate and albendazole plus ivermectin treatment arms only few moderate T. trichiura infections remained.

40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} a leading vector-borne disease in the United States. Although the {{majority}} of Lyme patients can be cured with standard 2 – 4 week antibiotic treatment, 10 %– 20 % of patients continue to suffer from prolonged post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). While the cause for this is unclear, persisting organisms not killed by current Lyme antibiotics may be involved. In our previous study, we screened an FDA drug library and reported 27 top hits that showed high activity against Borrelia persisters. In this study, we present {{the results of an}} additional 113 active hits that have higher activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi than the currently used Lyme antibiotics. Many antimicrobial agents (antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, anthelmintics or antiparasitics) used for treating other infections were found to have better activity than the current Lyme antibiotics. These include antibacterials such as rifamycins (3 -formal-rifamycin, rifaximin, rifamycin SV), thiostrepton, quinolone drugs (sarafloxacin, clinafloxacin, tosufloxacin), and cell wall inhibitors carbenicillin, tazobactam, aztreonam; antifungal agents such as fluconazole, mepartricin, bifonazole, climbazole, oxiconazole, nystatin; antiviral agents zanamivir, nevirapine, tilorone; antimalarial agents artemisinin, methylene blue, and quidaldine blue; antihelmintic and antiparasitic agents toltrazuril, tartar emetic, potassium antimonyl tartrate trihydrate, <b>oxantel,</b> closantel, hycanthone, pyrimethamine, and tetramisole.

Among the active hits, agents that affect cell membranes, energy production, and reactive oxygen species production are more active against the B. burgdorferi persisters than the commonly used antibiotics that inhibit macromolecule biosynthesis.

40|$|More {{than half}} of the world’s {{population}} is at risk of soil-transmitted helminthiasis, parasitic worm infections most commonly caused by the roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), the whipworm (Trichuris trichiura) and the hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus). Together these soil-transmitted helminths cause an estimated burden of 5 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), mostly affecting school-aged children living in the least developed settings, lacking clean water and sanitation facilities. To control soil-transmitted helminthiasis annual preventive chemotherapy is given to people at risk of infection. In 2012 a total of 212 million anthelmintic tablets were administered to school age-children. The most commonly used anthelmintics are albendazole and mebendazole. Both are highly effective in treating A. lumbricoides, while only albendazole has satisfactory efficacy against hookworm. Both drugs have only low efficacy against T. trichiura. Therefore an alternative treatment for T. trichiura infections is urgently required. However, even with an effective treatment, re-infection is common in endemic settings. Therefore other interventions besides preventive chemotherapy should be considered. The primary goal of this PhD thesis was to find an alternative, effective treatment against T. trichiura and concomitant soil-transmitted helminth infections. Two compounds with potentially high trichuricidal activity are nitazoxanide and <b>oxantel</b> pamoate. Both of these compounds were tested on their efficacy and safety within two separate clinical trials conducted on Pemba Island, Tanzania in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Both drugs were evaluated alone as well as in combination with albendazole to broaden their spectrum of activity against concomitant soil-transmitted helminths. In a third clinical trial conducted in 2013, the drug combination albendazole-oxantel pamoate was compared to two other promising drug combinations (i. e. albendazole-ivermectin and albendazole-mebendazole) which were identified in recently conducted randomised controlled trials. Additional objectives were attached to these three randomised controlled trials which included the assessment of the prevalence of intestinal protozoa and the comparison of the performance of different diagnostic approaches. Further we conducted two systematic reviews and meta-analyses to generate evidence on the protective effect of sanitation facilities against soil transmitted helminths and intestinal protozoa infections. In the first clinical trial conducted in 2011 we found no effect for single nitazoxanide (1, 000 mg) against T. trichiura infections. Furthermore, children receiving nitazoxanide reported significantly more mild adverse events than children receiving a placebo. Hence we cannot recommend nitazoxanide for the treatment of T. trichiura and concomitant soil-transmitted helminths. The prevalence of intestinal protozoa assessed within this clinical trial was relatively high. In detail, 70...|$|E

More than 1 billion people are infected globally. Most at risk are the 3 billion poorest {{people of the}} world, particularly children. Heavy infections cause iron-deficiency anemia to growth stunting and intellectual retardation. STHs occur often concomitantly with other infections such as malaria. Currently, STHs morbidity control relies on only five drugs (albendazole, mebendazole, levamisole, pyrantel pamoate and ivermectin). These present limited efficacies, especially when administered in single dose against T. trichiura and hookworm infections. Although anthelmintic drug resistance has not yet appeared as a major public health problem, emergence of drug resistance may be inevitable. The situation is precarious and new drugs are urgently needed. In addition, existing tools for in vitro drug sensitivity testing {{are based on a}} viability assessment assay which lacks convenience and hinders high-throughput screening rates. Also, the lack of accurate diagnostic tools to detect STHs and malaria infections hampers an optimal management of these diseases. This work aimed first to set up nematode-rodent models at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH), improve drug screening assays and evaluate potential new treatments for human STHs. Prior to this thesis, monepantel (AAD 1566), tribendimidine, nitazoxanide and <b>oxantel</b> pamoate had been identified as potential drug candidates for STHs. Secondly, we aimed to strengthen our understanding of the impact of a murine malaria and hookworm co-infection on the host’s metabolism and explore the potential of metabolic profiling as multiplexing diagnostic tool. Once the animal models corresponding to human helminthiases have been established, (Ancylostoma ceylanicum, N. americanus and Trichuris muris), the Alamar Blue, the MTT and the acid phosphatase assays, as well as the xCELLigence System, isothermal microcalorimetry, and the feeding-inhibition assay (A. ceylanicum only) were tested and compared to the current assay of choice, the motility assay. For T. muris, the Alamar Blue assay compared most favorably to the motility assay since it is precise and cost-effective. For A. ceylanicum, no alternative assay was found better than the motility assay for testing on L 3, whereas the xCELLigence System was found accurate and convenient for adult worms. The potential of monepantel was assessed against A. ceylanicum, N. americanus, T. muris, Ascaris suum and Strongyloides ratti.

40|$|Anthelmintic drugs {{apart from}} a regular {{treatment}} of worm infections, find their common use in prophylaxis. The prophylactic usage in farm animals and mass drug administrations (MDA) in humans are common due to an unavailability of effective vaccines. The anthelmintic resistance occurs when an anthelmintic drug is repeatedly used resulting in selection of resistant parasites. Reports of anthelmintics resistance are extensive in farm animals. Emerging reports of resistance in human parasites raises a serious concern. Under the present scenario, research {{as a part of}} my graduate program is aimed at countering anthelmintic resistance. I have addressed this aim by working on three different approaches / goals that are arranged into individual chapters in my dissertation. In my first goal (chapter 3), I have proposed a mechanism to potentiate cholinomimetic anthelmintics like levamisole. Levamisole acts on the nicotinic receptors of the somatic (body) muscle of the parasite to produce paralysis. Presently, levamisole resistance is reported in major livestock producing areas across the world. Using Ascaris suum a round worm of pigs as a model parasite, I have studied a mechanism to potentiate the levamisole and thus counter levamisole resistance in parasitic worms. I have used electrophysiological methods on the somatic muscle of A. suum to study the levamisole response. I have observed that, a brief application of AF 2 caused potentiation of levamisole responses. AF 2 neuropeptide has been isolated in abundant quantities across nematode species and shown to be excitatory on neuromuscular system of nematodes. I have proposed that AF 2 receptors are attractive targets in order to potentiate other cholinomimetic anthelmintics like levamisole, pyrantel and <b>oxantel.</b> The second goal (chapter 4) explores the study of anthelmintic combination Startect®. Combination of anthelmintic drugs is generally employed to slow the onset of resistance in parasites and to achieve synergism in therapy. Startect® consists of derquantel, a new anthelmintic drug that is combined with abamectin to treat resistant parasitic worms in sheep. Derquantel and abamectin have been hypothesized to interact synergistically to control worm infections. I have tested this hypothesis in isolated tissues (somatic muscle and pharynx) of parasitic nematode A. suum. In this study, I have concluded that these two drugs produced a greater than additive effect on the somatic muscle nicotinic receptors but, did not interact on the pharyngeal muscle glutamate receptors. In the third goal (chapter 5) I have identified nicotinic receptor population in the pharynx of the parasitic worm A. suum and proposed them as novel drug targets. In my study, current cholinomimetic drugs did not act on the nicotinic receptors of pharynx. This demonstrated that they are novel targets. As current literature on pharyngeal nicotinic receptors is limited, I have explored their pharmacological properties. I have observed that the nicotinic receptors of pharynx are distinct from the nicotinic receptors of vertebrate host. Hence, these receptors are attractive targets for selective drug targeting of parasites and to minimize the side effects in vertebrate hosts...|$|E
