This study outlines the current regulations, existing technologies, and innovative technologies being considered as <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> treatment alternatives. From this foundation, the study proceeds to identify the superiority of the plasma waste destruction technology. Specific areas of discussion include: temperature capabilities, waste residence time requirements, destruction removal efficiencies, operational efficiencies, economic issues, safety, and maintenance. This study finds the plasma destruction technology to be fully effective and superior to conventional facilities. The technology completely destroys hydrocarbons and can reduce the volume of many <b>other</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> on the order of one part per million. The required residence time of waste in a plasma facility for effective destruction is a fraction of a second, while the rotary kiln incinerator maintains an average residence time of approximately 5 seconds. Also mass and heat balance calculations are performed to quantify the effectiveness and efficiency of this technology. It is found that one day`s average amount of <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> generated in the state of North Carolina can be destroyed in approximately thirty seconds using a standard one megawatt power source. Yet, before this technology is adopted as North Carolina`s primary <b>hazardous</b> <b>waste</b> destruction technology, further study is needed so that all issues considered in this research can be conducted in great detail...|$|R

30|$|Environmental {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the major challenges of today’s civilization (Kaushik et al. 2012; Spina et al. 2012). In India, it is found that one-third of total water pollution comes in the form of industrial effluent discharge, solid <b>wastes</b> and <b>other</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes.</b> Industrial wastewater presents a potential hazard to the natural water system (Deepali 2012; Kansal et al. 2011; Lokhande et al. 2011; Modak et al. 1990). This wastewater contains many inorganic and organic matters, which are toxic to the various life forms of the ecosystem (Spina et al. 2012). Several research investigations have shown the widespread occurrence of these pollutants in wastewater, surface water and ground water (Debska et al. 2004; Heberer 2002). The increasing pollution load of pollutants from industrial water streams has also caused great harm to the rivers, posing major health risks on either direct bathing or drinking in the river water (Seth et al. 2013). Environmental pollution caused by industrial effluents results in adverse effects on the general health of the workers, as well as the habitants, who live near the chemical synthesis industries and farmers along with field workers (Asamudo et al. 2005).|$|R

DOE is currently funding demonstrations of gold amalgamation that may also control mercury to the desired levels.

Mercury emissions control for mixed waste incineration may need to be more efficient than for incineration of <b>other</b> <b>hazardous</b> <b>wastes</b> because of higher mercury concentrations in some mixed waste streams. However, mercury control performance data for wet scrubbing and carbon adsorption is highly variable. More information is needed to demonstrate control efficiencies that are achievable under various design and operating conditions for wet scrubbing, carbon adsorption, and gold amalgamation technologies. Given certain assumptions made in this study, capital costs, operating costs, and lifecycle costs for carbon injection, carbon beds, and gold amalgamation generally vary for different assumed mercury feedrates and for different offgas flowrates. Assuming that these technologies can in fact provide the necessary mercury control performance, each of these technologies may be less costly than the others for certain mercury feedrates and the offgas flowrates...|$|R
