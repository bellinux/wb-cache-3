For a large {{class of}} semiclassical {{operators}} P (h) z which includes Schrodinger operators on manifolds with boundary, we construct the Quantum Monodromy operator M(z) associated to a periodic orbit {{of the classical}} ow. Using estimates relating M(z) and P (h) z, we prove semiclassical estimates for small complex perturbations of P (h) z in the case is semi-hyperbolic. As our main application, we give logarithmic lower bounds on the mass of eigenfunctions away from semi-hyperbolic orbits of the associated classical <b>ow.</b> <b>As</b> a second application of the Monodromy Operator construction, we prove if is an elliptic orbit, then P (h) admits quasimodes which are well-localized near. 1...|$|R
40|$|The lattice-Boltzmann {{method is}} used to model ow in {{electrokinetic}} systems. A modelling approach based on the coupling of Navier-Stokes, Nernst-Planck and Poisson's equation of electrostatics is utilised. Three lattice-Boltzmann methods are formulated for the three equations respectively. The method is implemented in C++ {{with the aim of}} being high performing. Topics as locality, instruction pipelines and parallel computing are considered. The implementation is tested for a number of classic examples with known solutions, e. g. Taylor-Green vortex <b>ow,</b> <b>an</b> Helmholtz equation and an advection-diffusion situation. The computed solutions agree well with the analytic solutions. The physical systems modelled consists mainly of various charged channel ows of ionic solutions. Electrokinetic effects, such as electroosmosis and the electrovicous effect are studied. This is done in thin channels where the thickness of the electrical double layers is comparable to the channel dimension. The electroviscous effect is shown to slow the <b>ow</b> down and <b>a</b> local minimum is found in the velocity profile for thick enough double layers. Other more complicated systems are also studied; electroosmotic <b>ow</b> in <b>a</b> channel with heterogeneously charged walls and <b>ow</b> in <b>a</b> an array of charged squares...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Formulating the {{governing}} equations of uid motion in streamline coordinates {{allows one to}} avoid di culties associated with grid generation and to solve problems of inverse design or problems with free boundaries. The governing equations for steady inviscid two-dimensional gas motion are written in an orthogonal system of independent coordinates consisting of the streamfunction and its orthogonal complimentary function. The result is a system of di erential conservation laws, expressing conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The conservative nite volume approximation of these equations {{can be used to}} calculate ows with strong shocks. For the case of potential velocity vector eld, two di erent simpli ed formulations of {{the governing}} equations are derived. In order to compute purely supersonic <b>ows,</b> <b>a</b> conservative hybrid grid-characteristic scheme has been developed. To calculate transonic potential ows, two iterative algorithms have been implemented. The calculated examples include supersonic ow overawedge, supersonic <b>ow</b> in <b>an</b> axisymmetric channel and in a jet emerging from this channel, and transonic <b>ows</b> in <b>a</b> nozzle and an axisymmetric bumpy channel. 1 Introduction...|$|R
