5|$|As {{kerosene}} {{and gasoline}} grew in importance, Rockefeller's wealth soared {{and he became}} the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak. Oil was used throughout {{the country as a}} light source until the introduction <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> as a fuel after the invention of the automobile. Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry, which transported his oil around the country. Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry, and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, defined the structure of modern philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> thus a decrease in the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E
40|$|Clear {{insights}} about the dynamic nature <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> demand <b>and</b> consumption {{is essential for}} capacity additions, investments and effective optimal energy policies. This paper provides background analysis <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> demand <b>and</b> consumption trends in Nigeria, with the key determinants <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> demand <b>and</b> the investment requirements clearly highlighted. Further, the paper utilizes the bounds testing approach to empirically investigate the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> demand <b>and</b> consumption in Nigeria between 1970 and 2008. The results show that real GDP per capita, population and industrial output significantly drives electricity consumption in the long-run <b>and</b> short-run while <b>electricity</b> price is not a significant determinant. In the shortrun, industrial output has a crowding out effect on the demand for electricity. The results are robust because the parameter estimates are stable over the estimation period. These results imply that income per capita is the major determinant <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> demand, <b>and</b> therefore, deregulated pricing <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> products, will ensure efficient product and resource allocation in Nigeria to reflect the observed income inelasticity for electricity products JEL Classification: C 22; C 32; Q 41; Q 42; Q 43...|$|R

Sites in Gansu Province near the Gobi desert in northwestern China are under investigation, with a final site expected to be selected by 2020, and actual disposal by about 2050.|$|E
5|$|Like solid bromine and iodine, solid {{chlorine}} crystallises in the orthorhombic crystal system, in a layered lattice of Cl2 molecules. The Cl–Cl {{distance is}} 198pm (close to the gaseous Cl–Cl distance of 199pm) and the Cl···Cl distance between molecules is 332pm within a layer and 382pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of chlorine, 180pm).

40|$|AbstractPrice <b>of</b> coal, <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> oil are {{key factors}} {{affecting}} economy. Taking the yearly data of 1980 - 2007 as a sample, {{we tested the}} fluctuation characteristics <b>and</b> causality <b>of</b> coal, <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> oil price, and indicated that there is dual-causality between the coal <b>and</b> <b>electricity</b> price. Through Cointegration test and State Space Model, effect <b>of</b> coal, <b>electricity,</b> oil price on output and price level is tested in this paper. It indicates that there is {{both positive and negative}} effect <b>of</b> coal, <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> oil price on output, and then it can not be taken as tools of regulating output in practice. Besides, as important production material, price shocks <b>of</b> coal, <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> oil has steady and strong effect on price level. Through comparison with the effect of interest rate to entity economy, it finds that the regulating effect <b>of</b> adjusting coal, <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> oil price to price level is superior to the effect of interest rate. However, marketization reform of mechanism energy price should be deepened so as to effectively and reasonably guiding price level by the marketization price...|$|R

5|$|Although no {{speech or}} text is used {{anywhere}} in the game aside from credits and interaction hints in the main menu, the six flower dreams follow a narrative arc. The player's starting location in each stage appears to be near the ending location of the previous one, and {{through the course of}} the game the player approaches a distant city. The first levels focus on restoring life and color to the landscape. After activating a series of windmills, the player flies through a nighttime field, illuminating darkened strings of lights until they reach the city. The city is full of menacing metal structures, small arcs <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> <b>and</b> washed-out buildings; the player enlivens the city in the final two levels and transforms it into a bright and cheerful place.|$|E
5|$|In Saint Lucia, downpours {{triggered}} torrential flooding {{along the}} island's easternmost coast from October5 through October6. In Dennery Quarter, flash floods affected about 500 households; among them, 400 had their houses flooded or severely damaged. Several residences {{had to be}} evacuated, and some people were trapped in their homes. Residents also suffered from the absence of drinking water, lack <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> <b>and</b> the inability to prepare meals due {{to the loss of}} kitchen equipment and other utensils. In response, the area was declared a disaster zone; a total of EC$500,000 ($185,185USD) was approved to assist flood victims, as well as an additional US$44,194 allocated from the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power was}} {{considered}} an environmentally clean alternative for the commercial generation <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> {{was part of a}} popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent. In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing nuclear power.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister of Bangladesh Khaleda Zia urged senior {{officials}} in Dhaka and coastal districts {{to prepare for}} the storm. Officials in Chittagong asked that all 24ships be moved out of the harbor and river channel. In coastal areas, thousands of Red Crescent volunteers reported for duty in order to assist vulnerable villages in preparation of the storm. Winds destroyed bamboo huts, uprooted trees, and disrupted road transport between towns and villages on the shore of the Bay of Bengal. Torrential rainfall in the area flooded dozens of villages, forcing thousands to evacuate. Heavy precipitation also lashed the capital city of Dhaka, inundating streets, which caused a shutdown <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> interrupting public transportation. One death was reported after a man drowned while attempting to cross a river in southern Bhola Island. Ten wooden trawlers carrying 150men sank near Cox's Bazar; only 11 of them were known to have survived. An additional eight fishing boats transporting 60people was reported missing off of Barisal Division. By November15, 47fishing vessels were still unaccounted for. A navy motor boat also sunk near Kutubdia, though its six crew members swam ashore. In the aftermath of the storm, the number of deaths in Bangladesh rose to 49.|$|E
5|$|Sodium at {{standard}} temperature and pressure is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in air and forms grayish white sodium oxide unless immersed in oil or inert gas, {{which are the}} conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak metallic bonding and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals {{and is one of}} only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium. The melting (98°C) and boiling (883°C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure allotropes are insulators and electrides.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E

5|$|There was {{a lull in}} {{building}} after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural estate houses. Isolated examples included the houses designed by Basil Spence and built at Broughton Place (1936) and Gribloch (1937–39), which combined modern and traditional elements. The Second World War disrupted the occupation of estate houses, as they were used as wartime schools, barracks, evacuee housing and hospitals. After the war many were outdated, with a lack <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>and</b> modern plumbing. There was a shortage of live-in servants and the heavily taxed aristocracy were also unable to find the money to modernise and maintain large houses. The shortage of building materials in the post-war period also made estate houses valuable resources of stone. As a result, 200 of the 378 architecturally important estate houses have been demolished, were destroyed in the period after 1945, {{a higher proportion of}} the total than in England. Included in the destruction were works by Robert Adam, including Balbardie House and Hamilton Palace. One firm, Charles Brand of Dundee, demolished at least 56 country houses in Scotland in the 20 years between 1945 and 1965. The shortage of building materials further reduced the number of new large luxury houses. Isolated examples included Logan House, designed by David Style in the 1950s. In the 1960s there was Basil Hughes's design at Snaigow for the earl of Cadogan and the remodelling of Gask House by Claude Phillimore. This period also saw considerable restoration of existing houses.|$|E
