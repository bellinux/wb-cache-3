Sale has a broad range <b>of</b> <b>options</b> such as after-school care, breakfast clubs, childminders, day nurseries, holiday schemes, independent school nurseries, pre-school playgroups, school nurseries. In all the areas within Trafford, Sale provides most variety and has maximum number <b>of</b> <b>options</b> in every area. In areas of After School Care, Breakfast Club, Childminder, Holiday Schemes all the providers rated by Ofsted/CQC are either Good or Outstanding. In areas of Day Nurseries (where one is rated Inadequate), Pre-School Groups (where two are rated requires improvement), School Nurseries (where one is rated Requires Improvement) most of the providers who are rated by Ofsted/CQC are again Good/Outstanding. Apart from these Sale also provides one of three Independent School Nursery in Trafford.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range <b>of</b> <b>options</b> that determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or nighttime, altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E

40|$|As options models {{move from}} {{financial}} markets to corporate decision making, {{it is fitting}} to question the simple domain extension <b>of</b> <b>option</b> pricing theory by consider-ing behavioral decision-making biases.

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} <b>of</b> <b>options</b> such as Attack, Magic, and Item.

5|$|During {{these early}} {{performances}} Verdi made substantial {{changes to the}} score. For some of these he altered his manuscript, but for others musicologists have {{had to rely on}} the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted {{to keep up with the}} changes, issuing new edition after new edition, but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety <b>of</b> <b>options.</b> In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is structured}} as three essays on various aspects <b>of</b> equity <b>option</b> introduction. Topics addressed include the relative predictability of introduction, {{the relationship between}} predictability of introduction and the price effect associated with introduction, and {{a comparison of the}} price response <b>of</b> <b>optioned</b> versus nonoptioned stocks to changes in dividends. Essay 1 involves use of firm-specific variables in a LOGIT model to allow assignment of a probability <b>of</b> equity <b>option</b> introduction. Two samples were developed: one of firms that were <b>optioned,</b> the other <b>of</b> firms which met the objective standards but were not optioned. A LOGIT model is used to assign a probability <b>of</b> <b>optioning</b> to each firm. A holdout sample is used to test the out-of-sample predictive power of the model. Firms were correctly classified as optioned or nonoptioned in about 85 percent of cases. Various researchers have detected abnormal positive returns associated with stock option introduction. In an efficient market context, this would indicate that option introduction is "good" news to financial markets. If optioning is predictable, stocks with a higher probability <b>of</b> <b>optioning</b> would be expected to show less price response when options are introduced. In Essay 2, the relationship between the probability <b>of</b> <b>optioning</b> and abnormal returns is tested using a standard event methodology. Utilizing nonparametric statistics, no significant differences were detected among abnormal returns of portfolios formed on the basis <b>of</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>option</b> introduction. Essay 3 compares abnormal returns <b>of</b> <b>optioned</b> and nonoptioned stocks around announced dividend changes. Two samples were obtained. Firms in the first (second) sample had significant dividend changes while options were (were not) available on their stocks. Standard event methodology is used to compare price responses of the two samples. If the price response <b>of</b> <b>optioned</b> stocks is less pronounced than the price response of nonoptioned stocks, this may indicate that optioned stocks are more efficiently priced. Reasons for this increased efficiency are examined in the study. Abnormal returns for the optioned sample were not significantly different from zero. Those for the nonoptioned sample were significantly different from zero for all event windows tested...|$|R
