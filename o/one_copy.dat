5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single cell that has two sets of genes, with <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> of each gene from the mother and one from the father.|$|E
5|$|A few {{copies of}} the {{original}} pressing of the LP with the four deleted tracks have turned up over the years, despite Columbia's supposed destruction of all copies during the pre-release phase (all copies found were in the standard album sleeve with the revised track selection). Other permutations of the Freewheelin album include versions with a different running order of the tracks on the album, and a Canadian version of the album that listed the tracks in the wrong order. The original pressing of The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is considered the most valuable and rarest record in America, with <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> having sold for $35,000.|$|E
5|$|He {{contends that}} the {{presentation}} of the Quran and its suras was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of Abu Bakr was to collect the Quran between its two covers and transcribe it into <b>one</b> <b>copy,</b> while Uthman's task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's {{disease has}} {{autosomal}} dominant inheritance, meaning that an affected individual typically inherits <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> {{of the gene}} with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele) from an affected parent. Since penetrance of the mutation is very high, {{those who have a}} mutated copy of the gene will have the disease. In this type of inheritance pattern, each offspring of an affected individual has a 50% risk of inheriting the mutant allele and therefore being affected with the disorder (see figure). This probability is sex-independent.|$|E
5|$|In 893 Asser wrote a {{biography}} of Alfred, called the Life of King Alfred. The manuscript survived to modern times in only <b>one</b> <b>copy,</b> {{which was part of}} the Cotton library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been made earlier, together with material from Asser's work which was included by other early writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and possibly with other works.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of Azotobacter vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (<b>one</b> <b>copy)</b> is restored when replanting the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, Azotobacter can contain plasmids.|$|E

5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of the X chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> of the X chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested {{permission to}} produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt {{that the risk of}} damage to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. <b>One</b> <b>copy</b> is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, {{on the site of the}} original monastery.|$|E
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E

5000|$|Individuals {{that carry}} {{two copies of}} the sickle cell gene suffer immensely and die at a young age. Those with two copies of the [...] "normal" [...] gene, rather than the mutated form that confers sickle cell anemia, are {{at a much higher}} risk for malaria. However, {{individuals}} that are heterozygous at this locus (<b>one</b> normal <b>copy,</b> <b>one</b> mutated <b>copy)</b> are protected from both malaria and sickle cell disease. Despite the negative effects of the sickle cell gene, it persists in populations in areas where malaria persists.|$|R
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors and}} Barry Cunningham {{also decided to}} retitle the book Tunnels, to reflect {{that it had been}} changed by some limited editing. With the {{announcement}} of the publication date, and press coverage in the UK, the price of the original self-published books jumped dramatically, with <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> selling for £950. Tunnels was released in the UK as a softcover on 2 July 2007, and in the United States as a hardcover on 10 December 2007, and as a paperback on 1 February 2009. In Canada, the book was released as a paperback on 7 July 2007, as a hardcover on 1 January 2008, and a mass market paperback on 1 February 2009. In the United States, Tunnels had an initial printing of 100,000 copies. In February and March 2008 it appeared on The New York Times Children's Chapter Books Best Seller List.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Schaefer, {{many members}} of RKO's board of {{governors}} did not like Welles or the control that his contract gave him. However such board members as Nelson Rockefeller and NBC chief David Sarnoff were sympathetic to Welles. Throughout production Welles had problems with these executives not respecting his contract's stipulation of non-interference and several spies arrived on set to report what they saw to the executives. When the executives would sometimes arrive on set unannounced the entire cast and crew would suddenly start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began the executives intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.|$|E

5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of heterozygosity is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys. Furthermore, the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice.|$|E
5|$|The Report was {{received}} warmly by Virginia Democratic-Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and {{distributed in the}} state, but {{there was not much}} public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Democratic-Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Democratic-Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid. Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states' rights in general, particularly in its advancement of the Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.|$|E
