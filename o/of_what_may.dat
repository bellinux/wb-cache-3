5|$|A more {{substantial}} Bronze Age settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form of wooden piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and nearby Barway. A Bronze Age ring and a late Bronze Age sherd were excavated nearby. There {{have been a number of}} Bronze Age finds in the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at nearby Fordey farm, Barway, and at Little Thetford, a middle Bronze Age (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late Bronze Age flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E
5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> have been a tremble trigger were also found later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E

5|$|The panel {{facing the}} Mount Kailash panel towards the {{northeast}} corner (see 1 on plan) depicts demon king Ravana trying to lift Kailash and bother Shiva, a legend called Ravananugraha. The upper scene is Mount Kailash, where Shiva and Parvati are seated. Shiva is recognizable with a crown, and other characters are badly damaged. A portion of ascetic skeletal devotee Bhringi relief survives and he is seated near Shiva's feet. Near Shiva an outline <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> have been Ganesha and Kartikeya are visible. Below the mountain surface is shown the demon-king Ravana is seen with a few arms, trying to unsuccessfully shake Shiva and Parvati in Mount Kailash. The rest of the details are blurry and speculative. According to Charles Collins, the discernible elements of this panel are generally consistent with those in medieval era Puranas, {{though there is a}} lack in literal correspondence with any single text.|$|E
5|$|The {{posterior}} thoracic {{group is}} made up of six somites, each possessing a pair of long multi-jointed appendages. The segments of these appendages are longer near the body and taper towards the flexible distal segments, extending past the carapace. They bear a fringe of long, slender filaments, all of which are directed towards the middle of the body, a characteristic shared by extant crustaceans. Though usually squashed into blade-like shapes from the fossilisation process, the filaments were slender cylindrical tubes when the animal was alive. The filaments at the tipmost segment are often bunched together. These appendages are believed to be the exopodites and may have functioned as gills and as swimming limbs. They are possibly biramous, with some specimens showing traces <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> be small endopodites at their bases.|$|E

25|$|Arshile Gorky's {{portrait}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> be {{his friend}} Willem de Kooning (left) {{is an example}} of the evolution of Abstract Expressionism from the context of figure painting, cubism and surrealism. Along with his friends de Kooning and John D. Graham Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.|$|E

25|$|The former Magoki Attori mosque was {{constructed}} in the 9th century on the remains <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> have been an older Zoroastrian temple. The mosque was destroyed and rebuilt more than once, and the oldest part now remaining is the south façade, which dates from the 12th century - {{making it one of}} the oldest surviving structures in Bukhara, and one of few which survived the onslaught of Genghis Khan. Lower than the surrounding ground level, the mosque was excavated in 1935. It no longer functions as a mosque, but rather houses a carpet museum.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the town's {{economic}} foundation was {{the cloth}} trade. This {{is reflected in}} the person of the 16th century cloth magnate, Jack of Newbury, the proprietor <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> well have been the first factory in England, and the later tale of the Newbury Coat. The latter was the outcome of a bet as to whether a gentleman's suit could be produced {{by the end of the}} day from wool taken from a sheep's back at the beginning. The local legend was later immortalized in a humorous novel by Elizabethan writer Thomas Deloney.|$|E
25|$|The {{major shift}} in medical {{thinking}} was the gradual rejection, especially during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> be called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine.

Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{earliest}} {{and most important}} references to Mahāyāna are those {{that occur in the}} Lotus Sūtra (Skt. Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra) dating between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE. Seishi Karashima has suggested that the term first used in an earlier Gandhāri Prakrit version of the Lotus Sūtra was not the term mahāyāna but the Prakrit word mahājāna in the sense of mahājñāna (great knowing). At a later stage when the early Prakrit word was converted into Sanskrit, this mahājāna, being phonetically ambivalent, was mistakenly converted into mahāyāna, possibly because <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> have been a double meaning in the famous Parable of the Burning House, which talks of three vehicles or carts (Skt: yāna).|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{a fossil}} of Platecarpus tympaniticus {{has been found}} that {{preserved}} not only skin impressions, but also internal organs. Several reddish areas in the fossil may represent the heart, lungs, and kidneys. The trachea is also preserved, along with part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> be the retina in the eye. The placement of the kidneys is farther forward in the abdomen than it is in monitor lizards, and is more similar to those of cetaceans. As in cetaceans, the bronchi leading to the lungs run parallel to each other instead of splitting apart from one another as in monitors and other terrestrial reptiles. In mosasaurs, these features may be internal adaptations to fully marine lifestyles.|$|E
25|$|David Bevington {{argues that}} the play {{represents}} {{the dark side of}} love. He writes that the fairies make light of love by mistaking the lovers and by applying a love potion to Titania's eyes, forcing her {{to fall in love with}} an ass. In the forest, both couples are beset by problems. Hermia and Lysander are both met by Puck, who provides some comic relief in the play by confounding the four lovers in the forest. However, the play also alludes to serious themes. At the end of the play, Hippolyta and Theseus, happily married, watch the play about the unfortunate lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe, and are able to enjoy and laugh at it. Helena and Demetrius are both oblivious to the dark side of their love, totally unaware <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>may</b> have come of the events in the forest.|$|E
