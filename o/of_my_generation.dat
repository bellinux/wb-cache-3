[...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, against the backdrop of many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show.

Brown was later investigated as a Communist. She went to Dominican College, an all-girls Catholic institution in San Rafael, California for a year before transferring to the University of Arizona in 1948.

500|$|Because of his {{enormous}} commitment to Steven Spielberg's Hook, which opened {{the same month}} as JFK, composer John Williams {{did not have time}} to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for JFK before he saw the film in its entirety. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and dailies. Williams remembers, [...] "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film – the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans." [...] Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the six he had done prior to seeing the film. For the motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as [...] "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines." [...] The composer remembered the moment he learned of Kennedy's assassination and it stuck with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, [...] "This is a very resonant subject for people <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>generation,</b> and that's why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film." ...|$|E

[...] On hearing of Mickiewicz's death, his fellow bard Krasiński wrote: [...] "For men <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>generation,</b> he was milk and honey, gall and life's blood: we all descend from him. He carried us off on the surging billow of his inspiration and cast us into the world." [...] Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin described Mickiewicz's works as Promethean, as [...] "reaching more Polish hearts" [...] than the other Polish Bards, and affirmed Danish critic Georg Brandes' assessment of Mickiewicz's works as [...] "healthier" [...] than those of Byron, Shakespeare, Homer, and Goethe. Koropeckyi writes that Mickiewicz has [...] "informed the foundations of [...] parties and ideologies" [...] in Poland from the 19th century to this day, [...] "down to the rappers in Poland's post-socialist blocks, who can somehow still declare that 'if Mickiewicz was alive today, he'd be a good rapper.'" [...] While Mickiewicz's popularity has endured two centuries in Poland, he is less well known abroad though, particularly in the 19th century, he won substantial international fame among [...] "people that dared resist the brutal might of reactionary empires." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2007, the Prime Minister's {{annual salary}} {{increased}} to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), {{about five times}} that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary. The pay increases were justified by the Government {{on the grounds that the}} salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: [...] "We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [...] But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us." [...] The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: [...] "It would be a sad indictment <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>generation</b> if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed." [...] On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: [...] "To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes." [...] The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.|$|E
