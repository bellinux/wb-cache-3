5|$|Still {{photographer}} Bhaskar takes {{pictures of}} his lover with a motorbike in the background. Chandru, who had come on that motorbike, had parked it there and murdered a prostitute who enticed him near the same location, then rode away. Reading about the murder in a newspaper, Bhaskar shows Raghunath the pictures with the murderer's motorbike in the background. Raghunath investigates and learns that the <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> lent it to his friend.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes then follow whose exact {{sequence}} is unclear. Odd goes {{to visit his}} mother at the retirement home, which only makes him more unhappy: his mother is senile and spends her days staring emptily out the window, and the visit reminds him of his own impending old age. While Odd is at a restaurant, police come in and arrest the cook. At the shop where he normally buys his pipe tobacco, he learns that the <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> died. He decides to sell his boat, leading to misadventures when the buyer, who works at an airport, asks Odd to meet him there inside the secure zone. Odd goes to the local swimming pool, but his shoes were removed when the facility closed; as he is leaving, he finds a pair of red high-heeled boots and walks away in them.|$|E
5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the daunting task of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E

5|$|Though {{during the}} 1970s most of Sierra Highway was {{bypassed}} by freeways and expressways, the old two-lane road remained a famous roadway. In 1971, Steven Spielberg {{made his first}} feature-length film, Duel, along Sierra Highway, near Acton. The film is about an unseen truck driver who stalks and attempts to kill an innocent motorist trapped in the truck's game. It prominently shows the desert portions of Sierra Highway. With Duels status, one of the trucks used in the film {{is still on the}} road and {{in the process of being}} restored. The current <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> driven the truck along Sierra Highway for nostalgia, enjoying the terrified looks he receives from passing motorists who recognize it. Other movies have since been filmed in the vicinity, including scenes in The Terminator.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer has access to the disc, the <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive. An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|E

25|$|Expired vehicle {{registrations}} may {{attract the}} attention of law enforcement, because indicators of an expired plate, such as an old or invalid sticker, give officers probable cause to lawfully initiate a traffic stop. A delinquent registration tag is often an indicator that the vehicle may be stolen, that the vehicle's <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> failed to comply with the applicable law regarding emission inspection or insurance, or that the vehicle's <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> unpaid traffic or parking tickets. Most states historically required all license plates to be replaced every few years; that practice is being abandoned by many states because of the expense of continually producing large numbers of plates. Washington stopped the practice of mandatory replacement in 2015. Maryland previously mandated that all license plates be replaced every five years (except for apportioned trailers, which were registered on an eight-year schedule), but has not done so since 1986.|$|E

25|$|The injury, {{which is}} caused by a {{building}} or other work on privately owned land, shall be compensated by the owner of such building or work, unless there is no defective construction or insufficient maintenance in such building or work, or the injury was not caused by the defectiveness or insufficiency, or the <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> exercised reasonable care to prevent such injury. In the case of the preceding sentence, if there is another person who shall be responsible for the injury, the owner making compensation may make a claim for reimbursement against such person.|$|E
25|$|The National Flag {{must always}} be flown in a {{position}} superior to {{that of any other}} flag or ensign when flown in Australia or on Australian territory, and it should always be flown aloft and free. The flag must be flown in all government buildings and displayed in polling stations when there is a national election or referendum. Private pleasure craft can fly either the Red Ensign or the Australian National Flag. The British Blue Ensign can be flown on an Australian owned ship instead of the Australian Flag if the <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> a warrant valid under British law.|$|E
25|$|The knife also {{features}} a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip {{is part of the}} blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a lanyard pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a need to cut and retie if the <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.|$|E

25|$|In The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom {{is only a}} minor {{character}} and {{is used as a}} foil for Huck, particularly in the later chapters of the novel after Huck makes his way to Uncle Phelps's plantation. Tom's immaturity, imagination, and obsession with stories put Huck's planned rescue of the runaway slave Jim in great jeopardy — and ultimately make it unnecessary, since he knows Jim's <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> died and freed him in her will. Throughout the novel, Huck's intellectual and emotional development is a central theme, and by re-introducing a character from the beginning (Tom), Twain is able to highlight this evolution in Huck's character.|$|E

Peter Acworth, the company's <b>owner,</b> <b>has</b> stated that the structure suits {{the needs of the}} company very well without need for significant structural modifications to the building, and that the company would begin repairs to the decaying structure.

25|$|Seals {{are still}} used for {{official}} purposes {{in a number}} of contexts. When collecting parcels or registered post, the name seal serves as an identification, akin to a signature. In banks, traditionally the method of identification was also by a seal. Seals remain the customary form of identification on cheques in mainland China and Taiwan but not in Hong Kong where signatures are required. Today, personal identification is often by a hand signature accompanied by a seal imprint. Seals can serve as identification with signatures because they are difficult to forge (when compared to forging a signature) and only the <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> access to his own seal.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, {{the co-op}} follows Rochdale Principles where each {{shareholder}} {{has only one}} vote. Most cooperatives are incorporated as limited stock companies where the number of votes an <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> {{is tied to the}} number of shares owned by the person. Whichever form of voting is employed it is necessary to conduct an election among shareholders to determine who will represent them {{on the board of directors}} (if one exists), the governing body of the co-operative. The board of directors is generally responsible for the business decisions including the financial requirements and sustainability of the co-operative. Although politics vary from co-op to co-op and depend largely on the wishes of its members, it is a general rule that a majority vote of the board is necessary to make business decisions.|$|E
25|$|The {{site has}} been {{featured}} on many programs including 20/20 and E! True Hollywood Story. In March 2006, the site made local news when it posted a profile for Adrian Peeler {{who was convicted}} {{in the killing of}} an eight-year-old boy and his mother. The site immediately removed Peeler’s profile when the story was featured in the Connecticut Post. The site had also featured a profile for Peeler's brother, Russell Peeler, who was involved in the murder. His profile was also removed by the site. Several states have placed a ban on inmate penpal sites in response to these issues, which the site <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> stated is a violation of the First Amendment. On October 28, 2014, Lifetime (TV network) aired the Prison Wives Club reality show, which features some couples from WriteAPrisoner.com in the series.|$|E
25|$|Credit card {{security}} {{relies on}} the physical security of the plastic card {{as well as the}} privacy of the credit card number. Therefore, whenever a person other than the card <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> access to the card or its number, security is potentially compromised. Once, merchants would often accept credit card numbers without additional verification for mail order purchases. It's now common practice to only ship to confirmed addresses as a security measure to minimise fraudulent purchases. Some merchants will accept a credit card number for in-store purchases, whereupon access to the number allows easy fraud, but many require the card itself to be present, and require a signature. A lost or stolen card can be cancelled, and if this is done quickly, will greatly limit the fraud that can take place in this way. European banks can require a cardholder's security PIN be entered for in-person purchases with the card.|$|E
