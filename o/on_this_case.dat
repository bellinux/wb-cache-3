5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>case</b> as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E

The charges specified that Bell had performed Internet background checks on federal agents he asserted were harassing him, and Bell defended his actions by saying he was using public records to defend against what he saw as harassment by government officials. Journalist Declan McCullagh wrote, [...] " [...] says, and a good number of observers agree, that the Feds are prosecuting him for doing what an investigative reporter does: Compiling information from publicly available databases, documenting what's happening, and so <b>on.</b> <b>This</b> <b>case</b> could set a precedent that affects the First Amendment privilege of journalists." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, David Zinc starts {{taking his}} own legal initiatives. He stumbles upon a lead {{poisoning}} brain damage case involving {{the child of}} Burmese immigrants.

Zinc also succeeds in representing immigrants in a labor law case, giving him an increasing confidence in his ability to go to court and effectively represent clients. During the labor case, the employer attempts to have Finley & Figg's offices burned down and the would-be arsonist stumbles upon Oscar at the office. Oscar shoots him and adds an unnecessary debilitating shot that shatteres his leg. He is sued for using excessive force.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009,The Guardian {{released}} video evidence {{recorded by}} a FIT at the 2008 Climate Camp of alleged police brutality against two female members of Fitwatch. The women had asked {{police officers to}} reveal their shoulder numbers, as at least four officers had not displayed them. The women attempted to photograph the police officers for evidence, but were forced to the ground, restrained with handcuffs, and had their legs bound with straps. They were then placed in restraint positions, arrested, charged and held in custody for four days, including three days in HMP Bronzefield, before they were released on bail. The police later retracted all the charges against the women. The women lodged {{a complaint with the}} IPCC over the incident. The journalist George Monbiot commented <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> saying that [...] "the police are turning activism into a crime" [...] and that [...] "the FITs' methods appear to have been lifted from a Stasi training manual". He claimed that [...] "anybody who is politically active is filmed, identified, monitored, logged, and cross-checked". A police debrief into the operation at Kingsnorth praised the deployment of FITs saying that they were [...] "highly effective and gained good intelligence and disruption".|$|E

500|$|Under Georgia law, appeals {{of death}} penalty cases had {{to be based on}} errors of law, not a reevaluation of the {{evidence}} presented at trial. The appeals process began with a reconsideration by the original trial judge. The defense presented a written appeal alleging 115 procedural problems. These included claims of jury prejudice, intimidation of the jury by the crowds outside the courthouse, the admission of Conley's testimony concerning Frank's alleged sexual perversions and activities, and the return of a verdict based on an improper weighing of the evidence. Both sides called forth witnesses involving the charges of prejudice and intimidation; while the defense relied on non-involved witness testimony, the prosecution found support from the testimony of the jurors themselves. On October 31, 1913, Judge Roan denied the motion, adding, [...] "I have thought about this case more than any other I have ever tried. With all the thought I have put <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> I am not thoroughly convinced that Frank is guilty or innocent. But I {{do not have to be}} convinced. The jury was convinced.
