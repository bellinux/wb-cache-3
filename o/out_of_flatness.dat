An analytical model was developed for predicting the thermal joint resistance of nonconforming rough surfaces {{in contact with the}} presence of air under atmospheric pressure as a TIM. Accordingly four models were developed in the present work. The thermal macrocontact resistance was modeled for the transition case, with the existence of surface roughness and surface <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>flatness.</b> The microcontact radius was modeled correlating the microcontact radius to the relative applied pressure, which was used with the !henna! constriction parameter to develop an accurate nondimensional contact conductance and thermal microcontact resistance. The thermal microgap resistance model is derived assuming the TIM is air under atmospheric pressure and taking into account the effect of surface curvature. The microgap resistance has the largest values among the other components, since the TIM which was air has very low !henna! conductivity and a small microgap area. The !henna! macrogap resistance builds up in the region surrounding the macrocontact area which was also IDled with air under atmospheric pressure as TIM. Throughout the above analytical work it was assumed that the surface asperities deform plastically while the bulk material deform elastically as been assumed by almost the majority of the researchers in this field. On the other hand and in order to support the present theoretical models, an experimental investigation was carried out to measure the !henna! joint resistance for the contact of nonconforming rough surfaces with air under atmospheric pressure as a TIM. A laboratory experimental setup was designed and implemented. The examined contacting surfaces were aluminium and brass. Many surface processes were done comprising cutting, chemical cleaning, and ultrasonic cleaning. Also many geometrical and mechanical parameters were measured for the contacting samples that include, surface roughness, surface asperity slope, surface out-<lf-flatness, and material bulk hardness. Collected data are tabulated and the related equations were used to calculate the heat flux, temperature drop, and the thermal joint resistance, as well as their estimated error. The measured results were compared with the theoretical model mentioned above and a good agreement is observed. The differential error estimated for the thermal joint resistance is ranged from (0. 00248) to (0. 00557) °C/w. ksb 201...|$|E

40|$|Semiconductor {{manufacturing}} processes start on bare silicon substrates having excellent surface flatness. In the subsequent process chain of manufacturing of integrated circuits, {{it is crucial}} to maintain this initial surface flatness. New lithography technologies, as for example immersion lithography and Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV), require high <b>flatness</b> <b>of</b> the exposure surfaces as e. g. the depth of focus is impacted. Integrated device manufacturers use different technologies involving materials such as metals, semiconductors, and isolators to build three-dimensional structures on the wafer. The miscellaneousness of materials on the surface of wafers with highly integrated circuits limits the use of metrology developed for <b>flatness</b> analysis <b>of</b> bare silicon wafers. Nevertheless, it is essential for semiconductor manufacturing to measure and control the topography of wafer surfaces at nanometer scale. Wave front sensing was developed to characterize topography on bare and patterned wafer surfaces. Post processing of the acquired data applied 2 D Gaussian high pass filters to obtain the flatness data. The standard deviation <b>of</b> the <b>flatness</b> data after filtering was almost independent with respect to the lateral resolution. On bare wafer surfaces, the standard deviation was found to be below 1 nm, on patterned surfaces to be below 10 nm. Both, changes in reflectivity and filtering were found to impact and limit the accuracy of the determination <b>of</b> <b>flatness.</b> The accuracy <b>of</b> <b>flatness</b> measurement was found to be better than 20 nm. The results were validated by using a wavefront sensor according to the method of Makyoh. The technique has a high potential to provide high speed, contactless, and local inspection <b>of</b> <b>flatness</b> on bare and patterned wafer surfaces...|$|R

In {{the first}} part of this paper we prove that the Lojasiewicz ex-ponent of a non-constant {{holomorphic}} germ f: (Cm, 0) → (C, 0) is a good exponent for f coinciding with the order of vanishing of f at zero and the degree at zero of its cycle of zeroes Zf. As an application of this result we show that for any holomorphic curve germ γ: (C, 0) → (Cm, 0) one has ord 0 (f ◦ γ) = ord 0 f · ord 0 γ if and only if γ is transversal to f− 1 (0) at zero. In a recent paper we have introduced an order <b>of</b> <b>flatness</b> for c-holomorphic functions which allowed us to give some bounds on the Lojasiewicz ex-ponent of c-holomorphic mappings. Answering a question of A.
