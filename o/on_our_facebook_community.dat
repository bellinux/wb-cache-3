5000|$|Facebook {{has been}} {{suspected}} of having a double-standard {{when it came to}} pages and posts regarding the Arab-Israeli conflict. When it comes to so-called incitement, Facebook has been accused of being unfair, removing only posts and pages that attack Palestinians, while turning a blind eye to similar posts that are violently anti-Semitic. The NGO Shurat Hadin-Israel Law Center conducted an experiment over the incitement issue, which sought to expose what it viewed as double standards regarding anti-Israel sentiment vis-a-vis the simultaneous launch of two Facebook pages: [...] "Stop Palestinians" [...] and [...] "Stop Israel". Following the launch of the two nearly-identical pages, the NGO posted hateful content simultaneously on both pages. Next, Shurat Hadin's reported both faux-incitement pages to Facebook to see which, if either, would be removed. According to them, despite featuring nearly identical content, only one was removed from the online platform. They said the page inciting against Palestinians was closed by Facebook (on the same day that it was reported) for [...] "containing credible threat of violence" [...] which [...] "violated <b>our</b> <b>Facebook's</b> <b>community</b> standards", but not the page inciting against Israelis. Shurat Hadin said that Facebook claimed that this page was [...] "not in violation of Facebook's rules". Shurat Hadin's staged anti-Israel group [...] "Stop Israel" [...] still remains active on Facebook.|$|R

With more responsibility for care being given to families and lay carers, {{it is important that we}} increase public awareness of the condition. The new dementia facebook app is focused upon the memory loss and memory disruption aspects of the condition. We build up a personal history with its mix of emotions <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>facebook</b> sites, as we also do in our minds. Our sense of who we are is linked to our autobiographical memory. The message behind this dementia app is that if we lose this mental history and recollection ability, then we lose something of ourselves. We cannot function so well if our memories are lost, unclear or scrambled and this will hopefully be felt to some degree, by those trying out the new app...|$|R

He described how he and Holman chose the name while trying to think of [...] "an abrasive sounding word, like Clash." [...] The aim was to sound aggressive, but not to offend. Further stating [...] "We just liked the word. We weren't trying to provoke." [...] In Vincent's opinion, criticisms of Slaves amount to attempts at censorship of linguistic and artistic expression. [...] "Someone once wrote <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>Facebook</b> wall, 'Nobody but African Americans have a right to use the word slaves,'" [...] he recalls. [...] "Obviously, lots of words have two meanings—if you said 'I feel like a slave at work' or 'I'm a slave to the routine,' that's not being disrespectful to the slave trade. You have to use words, or you're just going to be scared of everything. We live in a society already where people are terrified of the way they act being interpreted, and it's just getting harder." [...] He goes on to say that band names that have a specific political allusion, such as Joy Division or New Order, are more harmful than a general noun like [...] "Slaves." ...|$|R
40|$|Bringing therapy dogs into {{libraries}} to {{help alleviate}} student stress {{during the final}} exam period is a growing trend in academic libraries across the country. There is a known therapeutic connection between humans and animals and students stressed out over finals have flocked to visit therapy dogs in their library. Many miss their own pets back home or say cuddling with these dogs provides comfort and calm during the chaos of exams. Research shows that time spent petting an animal can lower feelings of stress, decrease blood pressure and improve mood and sense of well being. And, bringing dogs into the library {{is a great way}} to reach students directly, have fun and market the library at the same time. This poster will describe what it took to start a stress-reduction program at the UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) libraries despite a very strict “no dogs allowed on campus” policy. The pilot, started in March 2013, has grown from a single therapy dog to 13 dog/handler teams in less than a year. Hundreds of students drop by to visit the therapy dogs each time this event is held. Benefits have included an article in our local city newspaper, a campus news item, and off-the-chart “likes” each time we post information about the therapy dog events <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>Facebook</b> page. We’ve also had requests from other campus departments (e. g. Counseling and Psychological Services, Campus Police) to co-sponsor events with the us.

5000|$|The mission {{statement}} of USGA at BYU reads as follows: [...] Understanding Same-Gender Attraction (USGA) is an unofficial group of Brigham YoungUniversity students, faculty and guests {{who wish to}} strengthen families and the BYU community by providing a place for open, respectful discussions {{on the topic of}} same-gender attraction and LGBTQ issues.Empathy and community are the goals of USGA. Hurt, fear, anger, and shame are real and familiar emotions in our community. This is, however, not an appropriate forum for angry, vulgar, or profane remarks, nor for expressions of antagonism against any person or organization. In order to build a community of respect and understanding, we ask all participants to be mindful of USGA’s political neutrality and to be respectful of BYU, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and the beliefs and experiences of others. Above all, we support BYU students and guests in upholding the Honor Code - queer or straight, do not use UGSA as a place to hit on, ask out, or hook up. USGA is a neutral space - don’t assume, or ask, someone’s sexual orientation or gender. Likewise, don’t assume to know someone’s behavioral choices or activity in the Church based off of their orientation or gender. Our motto: Don’t ask, do tell! (If you want).While USGA is a supportive community, we are not a support group nor are we run by professional therapists. If you think you might be experiencing depression, anxiety, suicide ideation, or any other mental health issues we highly encourage you to check out the BYU Counseling center which is bound by law to be confidential. Other resources are listed <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>Facebook</b> page and website.If you have come to understand, to be understood, to find empathy and compassion, and to build community, you’ve found the right place. USGA welcomes you.|$|R
