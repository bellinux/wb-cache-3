40|$|The {{experiment}} was conducted <b>on</b> three <b>farms</b> of dairy goats. The experimental groups of animals were {{during the four}} months period supplemented with 5 g Mepron ®, (Degussa, Germany), daily. Milk yield, milk protein and milk fat content were recorded throughout the experiment. The milk production was statistically higher {{in the experimental group}} of animals <b>on</b> two <b>farms,</b> farm 1 and farm 3 in the first control period, a month after the application, whereas <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> 2, the higher milk production was present in the third and forth control period, two and three months after the application. During the experiment there was no statistically differences in milk protein and milk fat content between experimental and control groups <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> 1 and <b>farm</b> 2, whereas <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> 3 the milk fat content was statistically lower during the Mepron ® supplementation. In conclusion, the higher milk production in the first control period <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> 1 and 3 with great probability referred to the influence of Mepron ®. The higher milk production <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> 2 in the third and fourth control period coincided with introduction of alfalfa hay in daily ration, that may have enriched the amino acid supply...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two different milking procedures on teat length and diameter, milk yield and milking time. During the first milking procedure the milker decides when to remove the milking cluster from the udder, while in the second an automatic cluster removal, when milk flow was lower than 200 g/min, was performed. Measurements were made <b>on</b> two commercial <b>farms</b> B and A on 15 randomly chosen cows without any clinical sign of mastitis. There were no significant differencesbetween those farms in teat length and diameter differences before and after the milking. Average milking time <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> A was 6 min and 58 s, while <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> B was 5 min and 3 s. Average milk yield was 12. 9 kg <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> B and 13. 4 kg <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> A.

5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Europeans in the area, {{wildebeest}} used to roam widely, probably in relation to {{the arrival of}} the rains and the availability of good forage. They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time, they used to cross the Drakensberg Range, moving eastwards in autumn, searching for good pastures. Then they returned to the highvelds in the spring and moved towards the west, where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant. They also moved from north to south as the sourgrass found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable, the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of sourgrass. Nowadays, almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or <b>on</b> <b>farms</b> and the extent of their movements is limited.|$|E
5|$|Bormann's {{studies at}} an {{agricultural}} trade high school were interrupted {{when he joined}} the 55th Field Artillery Regiment as a gunner in June 1918, in the last days of World War I. He never saw action, but served garrison duty until February 1919. After working a short time in a cattle feed mill, Bormann became estate manager of a large farm in Mecklenburg. Shortly after starting work at the estate, Bormann joined an antisemitic landowners association. While hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic meant that money was worthless, foodstuffs stored <b>on</b> <b>farms</b> and estates became ever more valuable. Many estates, including Bormann's, had Freikorps units stationed on site to guard the crops from pillaging. Bormann joined the Freikorps organisation headed by Gerhard Roßbach in 1922, acting as section leader and treasurer.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have been}} {{captured}} live for fur farming, zoo specimens, and scientific research. From 1920–1946, pelt prices averaged about $137 CAN. Since pelts were relatively valuable, {{attempts were made}} to raise fishers <b>on</b> <b>farms.</b> Fur farming was popular with other species such as mink and ermine, so it was thought that the same techniques could be applied to fishers. However, farmers found it difficult to raise fishers due to their unusual reproductive cycle. In general, knowledge of delayed implantation in fishers was unknown at the time. Farmers noted that females mated in the spring but did not give birth. Due to declining pelt prices, most fisher farms closed operations by the late 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{grouping}} {{of several of}} the highland terriers (including the Scottie) under the generic name Skye Terriers caused some confusion in the breed’s lineage. There is disagreement over whether the Skye Terriers mentioned in early 16th century records actually descended from forerunners of the Scottie or vice versa. It is certain, however, that Scotties and West Highland White Terriers are closely related—both their forefathers originated from the Blackmount region of Perthshire and the Moor of Rannoch. Scotties were originally bred to hunt and kill vermin <b>on</b> <b>farms</b> and to hunt badgers and foxes in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDuring a {{previous}} longitudinal study, performed <b>on</b> four farrow-to-finish <b>farms</b> (A to D), samples {{were taken from}} twelve sows, their offspring, and the environment on various occasions over six months to study the MRSA presence. During the present study, a selection of the obtained MRSA isolates were typed by multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA), Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), spa typing, and SCCmec typing to study the genetic diversity of LA-MRSA isolates and to determine possible MRSA sources for pig(let) s. PFGE, spa typing, and SCCmec typing revealed the presence of one or few dominant genotype(s) per farm. In contrast, 212 MLVA types were detected <b>on</b> the four <b>farms,</b> forming one cluster <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> A, three <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> B, four <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> C and two <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> D. The genotype, found <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> A was unique for this farm. Farms B, C and D shared one cluster. In general, MLVA types from these clusters were isolated from piglets, sows, and the environment on various sampling events. Piglets carried MLVA types both related and unrelated to their mother sows' MLVA types at farrowing and onwards. In conclusion, molecular typing revealed that within a farm {{one or a few}} dominant strain(s) are widespread. Potential MRSA sources for piglets were mother sows, the environment and other piglets...|$|R

The maximum PCS nucleic acid load <b>on</b> <b>Farm</b> A was 8. 3 log 10 genome copies/mL BALF, whereas <b>on</b> <b>Farm</b> B the PCS burden was significantly lower, with 4. 0 log 10 genome copies/mL BALF. Anti-PCS antibodies were detected in sows, as maternal antibodies in suckling piglets and as an immunological reaction to infection. <b>On</b> both <b>farms,</b> PCS infection was accompanied by several co-infections. <b>On</b> <b>Farm</b> A, there were concurrent infections with PRRSV, a virulent strain of Haemophilus parasuis, and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. <b>On</b> <b>Farm</b> B, PCS was accompanied by infections with swine influenza virus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, and a non-virulent strain of Haemophilus parasuis.
