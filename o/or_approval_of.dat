25|$|Superboy first {{appeared}} in More Fun Comics #101 (January/February 1945, published in late 1944). Though Joe Shuster supplied the art, the Superboy feature was published without the input <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> Jerry Siegel, who was serving in World War II. This fact increased an already-growing rift between the publisher and Siegel and Shuster.|$|E

25|$|After {{withdrawing}} {{the annexation}} treaty, Cleveland sent an emissary (Blount) {{to investigate the}} circumstances surrounding the revolution and the situation in Hawaii. The report stated that the provisional government was not established with the consent <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the Hawaiian people. It also claimed that Liliuokalani only surrendered after being convinced that the provisional government was supported by the United States and fearing a bloody military conflict. According to Blount, she was told by the revolutionaries that the U.S. president would consider her case after surrendering. After reviewing the report, Cleveland decided not to send back the treaty he had withdrawn. Blount's findings were disputed by the provisional government.|$|E

25|$|Ministerials were serfs, {{and as such}} {{could not}} move without {{expressed}} permission of their lord or lady, though in certain clergy lands they could take holy orders without permission. Ministerials were in many places forbidden to marry without permission, but other places upheld Galatians 3:28 that says no one may be denied a sacrament because of one's legal status. If a liege disliked any marriage, though, the liege could easily withdraw any lands or income held by his subject. Any marriage was subject to review <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> the liege, as in Salzburg:In July 1213 Archbishop Eberhard II of Salzburg (1200–1246) and Bishop Manegold of Passau (1206–1215) asked King Frederick II at the imperial court held at Eger (today Cheb in the Czech Republic) to confirm the marriage contract that Gerhoch II of Bergheim-Radeck, an archiepiscopal ministerial, had made with Bertha of Lonsdorf, a Passau ministerial. The couple had agreed, presumably with their lords' consent, that their first two children were to belong to Salzburg and the third to Passau, and that any remaining children would be divided equally between the two churches. Gerhoch and Bertha could confer their allod on each other, and their children would share their paternal and maternal inheritances equally.|$|E

2500|$|The Hand of God, or Manus Dei in Latin, {{also known}} as Dextera domini/dei, the [...] "right hand of God", is a motif in Jewish and Christian art, {{especially}} of the Late Antique and Early Medieval periods, when depiction of Jehovah or God the Father as a full human figure was considered unacceptable. The hand, sometimes including a portion of an arm, or ending about the wrist, is used to indicate the intervention in <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> affairs on Earth by God, and sometimes as a subject in itself. It is an artistic metaphor that is generally not intended to indicate that a hand was physically present or seen at any subject depicted. The Hand is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a blessing gesture (in Christian examples), but sometimes performing an action. In later Christian works {{it tends to be}} replaced by a fully realized figure of God the Father, whose depiction had become acceptable in Western Christianity, although not in Eastern Orthodox or Jewish art. Though the hand of God has traditionally been understood as a symbol for God's intervention <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> human affairs, it is also possible that the hand of God reflects the anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity that may have persisted in late antiquity.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1914, Harold Barnwell, chief {{test pilot}} with Vickers Limited, {{designed}} a single-seat [...] "scout" [...] or fast reconnaissance aircraft, {{and had it}} built without the knowledge <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> his employers, [...] "borrowing" [...] a Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine from Vickers' stores to power the aircraft. Barnwell attempted a first flight of his design, named the [...] "Barnwell Bullet" [...] in early 1915, but the aircraft crashed and was wrecked, possibly due to a miscalculated centre of gravity. Now aware of Barnwell's design, Vickers instructed their junior designer Rex Pierson to redesign the Bullet.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{later on}} the Hand of God symbol is found {{several times in the}} only ancient synagogue with a large {{surviving}} decorative scheme, the Dura Europos Synagogue of the mid-3rd century, and was probably adopted into Early Christian art from Jewish art. It was common in Late Antique art in both East and West, and remained the main way of symbolizing the actions <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> God the Father in the West until {{about the end of the}} Romanesque period. It also represents the bath Kol (literally [...] "daughter of a voice") or voice of God, just like in Jewish Art.|$|E

[...] This incident, which {{was not part of the}} coronation ceremony and took place without the knowledge <b>or</b> <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> Pope Pius XII is sometimes used to portray Pius XII as a crypto-fascist.|$|E
2500|$|When the Court grants a cert petition, {{the case}} is set for oral argument.

The Court holds two-week oral argument sessions each month from October through April. Each side has thirty minutes to present its argument (the Court may choose to give more time, though this is rare), and during that time, the Justices may interrupt the advocate and ask questions. The petitioner gives the first presentation, and may reserve some time to rebut the respondent's arguments after the respondent has concluded. Amici curiae may also present oral argument on behalf of one party if that party agrees. The Court advises counsel to assume that the Justices are familiar with and have read the briefs filed in a case.|$|E
