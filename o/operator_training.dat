25|$|UV water {{treatment}} devices {{can be used}} for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favorably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labor, and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. Water chlorination treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special <b>operator</b> <b>training</b> and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labor, and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.|$|E

The brick facility was opened in 1966 and was operated by Jamaica Buses; the company's original depot was located across the street (114-02 Guy R.

25|$|On January 25, 2014, UTA {{announced}} it {{had won a}} federal grant {{with the intention of}} establishing a new TRAX line that would directly connect the Salt Lake International Airport with the University of Utah. The former University Line originally ran along much of this route, but was replaced by the Red and Green Lines when the Mid-Jordan and West Valley extensions were completed in 2011. The west and east sides of Salt Lake City thus have no access to each other via TRAX without a transfer. The new line would use existing rail and trains, but more funding is required for software development, minor signal adjustments, and <b>operator</b> <b>training.</b> UTA is seeking these funds, but has no estimate for when the new line could begin operation. The new line would not only provide a direct east-west connection, it would also increase the frequency of TRAX service to downtown stations. UTA has yet to announce the new line's name (color). However, it has indicated the new line will probably not connect {{all the way to the}} University Medical Center station, but may stop at the Stadium station instead.|$|E

500|$|The Paddington to West Drayton {{telegraph}} originally used six wires {{rather than}} five, {{although it was}} a five-needle system. [...] The sixth wire was to provide a common return so that the needles could be operated independently, thus giving the possibility of more available codes. [...] Using these codes, however, would have required more extensive <b>operator</b> <b>training</b> since the display could not be read on sight from the grid as the simple alphabetic codes were. [...] Telegraph systems were later to use earth return to avoid the need for a return wire, but this [...] principle was not established at the time of Cooke and Wheatstone's telegraph. [...] The economic need {{to reduce the number of}} wires in the end proved a stronger incentive than simplicity of use and led Cooke and Wheatstone to develop the two-needle telegraph.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} metal arc welding (SMAW), which is also known as manual metal arc welding (MMAW) or stick welding. [...] An electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and a consumable electrode rod or stick. [...] The electrode rod is made of a material that is compatible with the base material being welded and is covered with a flux that gives off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and provide a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination. [...] The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary. [...] The process is very versatile, requiring little <b>operator</b> <b>training</b> and inexpensive equipment. [...] However, weld times are rather slow, since the consumable electrodes must be frequently replaced and because slag, the residue from the flux, must be chipped away after welding. [...] Furthermore, the process is generally limited to welding ferrous materials, though specialty electrodes have made possible the welding of cast iron, nickel, aluminium, copper and other metals. The versatility of the method makes it popular in a number of applications including repair work and construction.|$|E
