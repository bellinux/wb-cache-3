The episode begins with a quotation translated from classical Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero's treatise De finibus bonorum et malorum—"I remember the very things I do not wish to; I cannot forget the things I wish to forget". The phrase is found at the beginning of Book II of the work.|$|E

Hardin-Simmons University, champions of the Border Conference, declined a Sun Bowl bid, as did the second-place team, Texas Tech. With no other option, a member of the Sun Bowl Committee—who happened to be an alumnus of Virginia Tech—suggested inviting the Hokies to play against Cincinnati, which had already accepted an invitation.|$|E

On September 23, 2008, the show went further with intimacy between the two and had them almost engage in sex. Todd eventually backs away from the contact, presumably due to his conscience.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} <b>of</b> <b>character</b> <b>for</b> Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out.

In the television episode, Tintin is all for rescuing his friends and goes with Haddock and Calculus early in the adventure.

Thompson assessed that Asher {{is not necessarily the}} best role model for Sol, but is willing to {{go to great lengths to}} protect him and ensure his success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch to secure Sol a place in the dance group. Thompson said that looking after Sol has [...] "taken a toll on [...] ". Although he initially feels optimistic about moving to Walford, he loses perspective and makes a mistake by sleeping with Naz. Thompson deemed this out <b>of</b> <b>character</b> <b>for</b> Asher, as he loves his brother so much, but opined that despite his mistakes, Asher is still a good brother: [...] "At heart, he's like anyone trying to do well.

The preprocessing <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> comprises bounding <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> <b>for</b> translation invariance and normalization <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> <b>for</b> size invariance. Now, the rapidly growing computational power enables the implementation of the present CR methodologies and also creates an increasing demand on many emerging application domains, which require more advanced methodologies.

The preprocessing <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> comprises bounding <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> <b>for</b> translation invariance and normalization <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> <b>for</b> size invariance. First, an overview of CR systems and their evolution over time is presented. Then, the available CR techniques with their superiorities and weaknesses are reviewed. Finally, the current status of CR is discussed and directions for future research are suggested. The variability in a character introduced by the rotation and deformation is the main concern of this paper. This variability has been taken into account by devising a neural logic based approach using normalized angle features. Now, the rapidly growing computational power enables the implementation of the present CR methodologies and also creates an increasing demand on many emerging application domains, which require more advanced methodologies. This material serves as a guide and update for the readers, working in the Character Recognition area, remove noises and feature extraction. Special attention is given to the off-line handwriting recognition, since this area requires more research to reach the ultimate goal of machine simulation of human reading.

500|$|When {{reviewing}} the anime, Martin thought the first Shakugan no Shana always manages to slightly exceed expectations, and while its story elements may be typical, its execution is not. Martin noted that Shana's Flame Haze transformation is a visual {{highlight of the}} series, and other details are shown equal care. Reviewer Chris Beveridge of Mania.com felt uncomfortable about the morbid nature of the series. While Beveridge did not think the series is [...] "groundbreaking", it proves to be a [...] "solid title" [...] that continuously gets better. The pacing {{in the middle of}} the first season was criticized for quickly ending an arc before [...] "going into a storyline that feels out <b>of</b> <b>character</b> <b>for</b> the show." [...] Martin's review of Shakugan no Shana Final was less positive; he described Yuji as having been made into a different character (though his complexity was praised), criticized the addition of a large number of prominent characters without sufficient development, and described some things as not making sense, although he praised Shana's development over the course of the third series.|$|E

Esposito said {{he did not want to}} [...] "take any of [...] home with me" [...] and had [...] "some deep concern about being able to do it and coming out of it unscathed, without really hurting my spirit and my soul". He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting everyone else who works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set.

[...] Jay Black of AOLTV also enjoyed the episode.
