5|$|Buddhism {{arrived in}} Japan in the mid–6th century Asuka period, and was officially {{adopted in the}} wake of the Battle of Shigisan in 587, after which Buddhist temples began to be constructed. The new {{religion}} and customs fundamentally transformed Japanese society and the arts. Funerary traditions such as cremation and the practice of placing epitaphs in graves were imported from China and Korea. Following the treatment of Buddhist relics, the cremated remains in a glass container were wrapped in a cloth and placed in an <b>outer</b> <b>container.</b> Epitaphs, which recorded the lives of the deceased on silver or bronze rectangular strips, were particularly popular from the latter half of the 7th to the end of the 8th century (late Asuka and Nara period). Four epitaphs and a number of cinerary urns and reliquaries containing bones have been designated as National Treasures. Other archaeological National Treasures from the Buddhist era include ritual items buried in the temple foundations of the Golden Halls of Tōdai-ji and Kōfuku-ji in Nara. According to an ancient Buddhist prophecy, the world would enter a dark period in 1051; consequently in the late Heian period the belief in the saving powers of Maitreya or Miroku, the Buddha to be, became widespread. Believers buried scriptures and images to gain merit and to prepare for the coming Buddha. This practice, which continued into the Kamakura period, required the transcription of sutras according to strict ritual protocols, their placement in protective reliquary containers and burial in the earth of sacred mountains, shrines or temples to await the future Buddha. The oldest known sutra mound is that of Fujiwara no Michinaga from 1007 on Mount Kinpu, who buried one lotus sutra and five other sutras that he had written in 998. Its sutra container has been designated as National Treasure.|$|E

40|$|A {{key element}} in the Department of Energy (DOE) {{strategy}} for the stabilization, packaging and storage of plutonium-bearing materials involves closure welding of DOE-STD- 3013 <b>Outer</b> <b>Containers</b> (3013 container). The 3013 container provides the primary barrier and pressure boundary preventing release of plutonium-bearing materials to the environment. The final closure (closure weld) of the 3013 container must be leaktight, structurally sound and meet DOE STD 3013 specified criteria. This paper focuses on the development, qualification and demonstration of the welding process for the closure welding of Hanford PFP 3013 <b>outer</b> <b>containers...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{liquefied}} {{natural gas}} storage tank or LNG storage tank is a specialized type of storage tank used for the storage of Liquefied Natural Gas.

50|$|This {{is rarely}} used however, because the lanyard {{attached}} to the handle runs through the girt to the valve, which is several inches too short when the girt is extended fully. When the slide is in the armed position and the door is opened, the slide pack falls free of the door bustle (a semi-rigid <b>outer</b> <b>container)</b> and the weight and momentum of the slide pulls the lanyard from the valve, initiating the flow of gas. At about the same time, a metal pin that holds {{the center of the}} Valise closed is also pulled, releasing a daisy chain and the two halves of the cover. When the cover is released and the inflation system activated, the two aspirators come shooting out of the pack, gulping vast quantities of air and restrained only by the fabric tubes to which they are securely fastened.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} NWS rain gauge, {{developed at}} the start of the 20th century, consists of a funnel emptying into a graduated cylinder, 2 cm in radius, which fits inside a larger container which is 20 cm in diameter and 50 cm tall. If the rainwater overflows the graduated inner cylinder, the larger <b>outer</b> <b>container</b> will catch it. When measurements are taken, the height of the water in the small graduated cylinder is measured, and the excess overflow in the large container is carefully poured into another graduated cylinder and measured to give the total rainfall. Sometimes a cone meter is used to prevent leakage that can result in alteration of the data. In locations using the metric system, the cylinder is usually marked in mm and will measure up to 250 mm of rainfall. Each horizontal line on the cylinder is 0.5 mm. In areas using Imperial units each horizontal line represents 0.01 inch.|$|E

40|$|The {{sanitation}} agent container, {{which was}} selected {{in a trade}} off study, employs two chambers, a rigid <b>outer</b> <b>container</b> and an inner flexible bladder. The bladder contains the sanitation agent formulation and its release is controlled by a manually operated valve. The <b>outer</b> <b>container</b> holds a high pressure vapor. There is no void in the bladder which makes the package operation independent of orientation and therefore usable in zero gravity. Foam is developed by a low boiling point fluid or dissolved in the product. When the product is dispensed at atmospheric presure, the evolved gas or vapor whips up a goam in the valve. The sanitation agents were initially formulated with freons which produces an excellent foam. However freon is incompatible with the life support system and was replaced with carbon dioxide dissolved at high pressure.

40|$|Currently, {{the storage}} {{container}} for the pit from a dismantled warhead is a sealed <b>outer</b> <b>container,</b> or drum, {{within which the}} pit is suspended. Since the pit itself is a sealed, stainless steel container for the plutonium, the inner plus the outer containers constitute the {open_quotes}double-walled{close_quotes} configuration for plutonium storage. If either inner or outer wall of the container fails, the fill-gas between the pit and drum walls will contain species that will modify the physical properties of that gas. The work summarized here reports the initial feasibility study for an innovative approach for monitoring for leakages both for radioactive materials from the pit and for the intrusion of outside into the drum by monitoring the electrical conductivity of the fill-gas. For the gas present in a drum containing a pit, alphas from decays of plutonium are stopped by the primary container wall of the pit itself unless pit leakage occurs. If plutonium leaks from the pit and enters the fill-gas (either noble gas or air) of the <b>outer</b> <b>container,</b> each of the alpha particles due to the decay of plutonium will create about 10 {sup 5 } electron-ion pairs along its track. If the fill gas is a noble gas, these electrons will diffuse in the gas as free electrons...|$|E
