40|$|AbstractRecent {{years in}} science education, {{especially}} in teaching science subjects that are generally {{thought to be}} difficult, the importance of <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environments</b> that bring formal education and informal education together {{under the same roof}} in order for the students to achieve their own learning, started to increase. This situation requires teachers to be aware of those environments, how and when those environments can be used, in which aims and objectives of teaching and learning process those environments can be used, and the effect of activities conducted in those environments to students affective, cognitive and kinesthetic features. Therefore, in this study the aim was to investigate science and technology teachers’ perceptions regarding the effect of usage of <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environments</b> in science and technology courses to students’ academic achievement and their anxiety towards science. In this study descriptive qualitative research was used. The data of the study were obtained in 2011 - 2012 academic year, through semi-structured interviews conducted with 36 science and technology teachers who work in Gölcük town which is a district of Kocaeli Province. Almost all teachers highlighted positive effects of using <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environments</b> during the teaching and learning process’ on the students’ academic success and anxiety levels towards science by presenting a variety of reasons. On the other hand, the remaining teachers indicated that <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environments</b> affect the students’ skills and qualities apart from academic achievement and anxiety towards science...|$|R

In the 2008 – 09 school year, California public schools served 1. 5 million children (24 percent of the student population) whose primary language was not English (California Department of Education, 2010). This percentage represents a substantial increase from 25 years earlier, when just 8 percent of California’s public school students were English learners (Williams et al., 2007). Research has shown that many factors affect how English learner (EL) students acquire English language skills, including their preparation before entering U.

40|$|To study {{effects of}} out-of-school {{learning}} we use data on boarding home pupils who attended elementary {{public schools in}} the 1940 ’s. The <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment</b> at the boarding homes could be considered being more learner friendly than the home environment on average: the pupils at the boarding homes had daily scheduled time for doing their homework under assistance of a junior school teacher and, in addition, they had access to a small library. The placement at boarding homes was based on the distance to the nearest school and had, thus, no direct connection to pupils’ skills which simplifies the empirical analysis based on register data. We find that the more learning friendly environment equalize skills at school leaving age. The effect is larger for kids with low initial ability.

40|$|Are there {{socioeconomic}} {{differences in}} the seasonality of children’s learning over the school year and summer months? The achievement gap across social lines increases during the primary grades, as much research indicates, but descriptive analyses and HLM within-person growth models for a rep-resentative panel of Baltimore school children demonstrate that the increase can be traced mainly to the <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment</b> (i. e., influences situated in home and community). School-year verbal and quantitative achievement gains are comparable for upper socioeconomic status (SES) and lower SES children, but summer gains, when children are out of school, evidence large disparities. During the summer, upper SES children’s skills continue to advance (albeit at a slower rate than during the school year), but lower SES children’s gains, on average, are flat. This seasonal pattern of achieve-ment gains implies that schooling plays an important compensatory role, one that is obscured when achievement is compared on an annual basis, as is typical. Policy implications of the seasonality of learn-ing are discussed, including support for preventive measures over the preschool years and for programs, possibly including calendar reforms and summer school, to support disadvantaged children’s learning year-round...|$|E

Learning from informal sources and in- an <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment</b> can be effective and motivating. In this study, 12 -year-old pupils (N[*]=[*] 366) visited a dinosaur science centre exhibition in Finland. Pupils were tested with standardised tests of motivation as defined by self-determination theory, cognitive skills, and interest via pre-, post-, and delayed post-tests during a six-month period. Findings show that pupils learned from the science centre visit and enjoyed the experience. The factors explaining their post-test knowledge in addition to their previous knowledge were (1) general cognitive competence, (2) liking studying biology at the science centre, (3) participation in a dinosaur demonstration, and (4) gender. As {{there was no difference between}} boys and girls in general cognitive competences, the knowledge results of boys and girls equally related to their cognitive competence. Autonomy also influenced situational motivation both directly and indirectly, which in turn had a strong effect on liking studying in the exhibition. It also influenced the post-test knowledge indirectly. In the lowest school achievement group, participation in the dinosaur demonstration increased knowledge in the post-test...|$|E

30|$|In science education, {{learning}} {{outside of}} formal institutions {{is certain to}} be of growing importance {{in relation to the}} formal school curriculum (Gokpinar and Reiss 2016; Wellington 1990). Morag and Tal (2012) believed that regardless of how they were defined, all <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environments</b> had a variety of cognitive, affective, social, and behavioral effects that could make a significant contribution to learning. Hofstein and Rosenfeld (1996) contended that “it would be useful if science educators would consciously utilize a wide range of <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environments</b> which foster science learning.” They preferred to adopt the “hybrid” view (rather than the dichotomy view) that informal learning experiences can occur in formal learning environments (e.g., schools) as well as in informal learning environments (e.g., museums, zoos). They suggested that future research in science education should focus on how to effectively blend informal and formal learning experiences in order to significantly enhance the learning of science. Bell and others (2009) shared the same viewpoint that informal learning contexts should be seen as complementary to formal schooling rather than as in competition with it. Their report responded to the need for greater coherence and integration of informal environments and K- 12 functions and classrooms, and the report urged a careful analysis of the goals and objectives of science learning in informal environments. Mortensen and Smart (2007) pointed out that although there was a growing effort to create partnerships between schools and informal learning settings, documentation of such projects is limited and generally reported as examples of “best practices” with little discussion of challenges before or during implementation.|$|R

40|$|In North-East Italy (the Veneto region) several {{public school}} {{nutrition}} {{policies have been}} developed to reduce the consumption of high caloric snacks and beverages. However, little is known about whether the policies actually influence students’ dietary behaviours. In order to address this point, a multi-centre cross-sectional survey of 691 Italian students was conducted. Students completed the Beverage and Snack Questionnaire (BSQ), which assesses the consumption of beverages and snacks at school and out-of-school. Three levels Poisson Models with random intercept with students (level 1 units) nested into classroom (level 2 units), and nested into schools (level 3 units), were used to examine the influence of the school setting versus the <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment</b> (independent variable) on students’ consumption of sweet beverages, snacks, milk based beverages, low carbohydrate drinks, fruit and vegetables (dependent variable) (p≤ 0. 05). The results showed a significantly higher consumption of sweet beverages, snacks, milk-based beverages, low-carbohydrate drinks, fruit and vegetables out-of-the school, suggesting a school-protective association Thus, the policies aimed to limit or deny access to unhealthy foods in the school environment may {{play an important role in}} promoting more healthful dietary patterns for school children.

In this setting the students are supported to create their own digital media resources such as movies, web pages and animations. The project is an iteration of "The Fifth Dimension" - a world-wide network of similar sites in USA, Brazil, Mexico, Scandinavia and also in Barcelona, Spain. The Fifth Dimension (5 D) sites operate as diverse educational settings where researchers, teachers, students/pre-service tea-chers and children collaborate to create and sustain their community and activities. The concept of the Fifth Dimension evolved from research [1] dedicated to developing inclusive learning contexts where children who may not be successful in traditional classrooms could experience success in learning. This model of learning differs significantly to traditional schooling as it emphasises children’s potential as learners, teachers and active participants in their learning community. The use of technologies in informal learning settings is of considerable interest to educational research. It is commonly identified that children naturally access and use new technologies as part of their everyday lives [2] and therefore it is important to educators to find out how and what children learn through the informal use of digital technologies. Further, it is likely that we can learn from observing these interactions and use these ideas to help design new approaches to formal educatio...|$|E

The current study measured the pedometer steps of 7 – 11 -year-old British children during school-and leisure-time on weekdays and weekend days. Participants (n = 104, 58 % girls) wore sealed pedometers on 4 weekdays and 2 weekend days; pedometer counts were recorded {{at the beginning and}} end of the school day on weekdays, and at the child’s bedtime each day. Differences in step counts across context by gender and activity tertile (high-, mid- or low-active) were examined. In both boys and girls, steps accumu-lated in weekday leisure time were greater in the high-active groups than in the mid- and low-active groups (p < 0. 001), with relatively smaller differences between activity tertiles for steps accumulated at school. In girls, the high- and mid-active groups, but not the low-active group, accumulated more steps during leisure-time than during school-time (p = 0. 001) on weekdays; in boys, all groups accumulated more steps during leisure-time relative to school-time (p < 0. 001). Girls took fewer steps on weekend days than weekdays, whereas boys ’ steps did not differ by type of day. As fewer steps are accumulated at the weekend, the <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment</b> should be a focus for activity interventions.

30|$|In {{classrooms}} and <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environments</b> that engage learners in conducting experiments and investigations, there exist some general distinctions for PCOI. One important distinction brought {{out in the}} ‘Designing Experiments’ section that reviews the literature on children designing experiments is the differences between knowledge lean and knowledge rich activities. Domain-general experiments and demonstrations typically stress the learning of a strategy (e.g., control of variables) in simplified stripped down conceptual knowledge contexts. The experiments and investigations are typically completed {{in one or two}} lesson periods and minimize the need to consider relevant domain-specific prior knowledge. Thus, the design of domain-general investigations is viewed as having knowledge lean requirements. An example is doing a control of variable (COV) experiment to find the law of the pendulum. The experimenter isolates three variables (length of string, size of weight, height from which weight is released) to determine which variable(s) influences the period/time of swing. In this case, only the length of the string changes the period of the pendulum.|$|R

40|$|Envisioning {{a larger}} {{workforce}} of engineers, with broad participation from a diverse set of workers, {{is one of}} the central concerns of engineering education research. While many current K- 12 programs focus on engineering thinking and design, there is still a need to promote aspiration and understanding of engineering as an occupation, especially in <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environments</b> where children spend a majority of their time. Career aspirations and expectations of children have already started to develop prior to entering formal schooling. Several studies has shown that parents {{play a significant role in}} the development of occupational awareness in their children, but the process by which this occurs is not well understood. In engineering and other fields it is common for children to follow in the career footsteps of their parents in a phenomenon called occupational inheritance. It is hypothesized that parents socialize their children through the social norms, personal knowledge, attitudes and beliefs that they share through everyday activity. This study investigated the strategies that engineering parents conduct when reading a story about engineering to their children. Conversation analysis was used to distinguish the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs that were shared during the interaction. Twenty-four participants that self-identified as engineers (through a degree conferred or job association or other) video-recorded themselves in their own home, reading a provided story book to their young children, aged 3 to 5 years. The storybook centered on two kids on a mission to deliver an odd shaped package to an engineer. Along the way they ponder who an engineer is, what they do, and where they work before eventually meeting up with a team of engineers. The storybook also contained imagery of potential misconceptions (e. g. only work on trains, similarity to mechanics) as well as messages from “Changing the Conversation” (e. g. engineers make the world a better place). Several of the results told an interesting tale: while engineering parents are expected to have a high degree of understanding about their field, they had difficulty in expressing occupational knowledge, and in some cases even had difficulty correcting misconceptions that the child held. Also, several parents expressed astonishment when their child did not recognize that they too were engineers. Engineering parents also provided additional engineering knowledge during the storybook reading. The results of this study will be used to develop materials to inform parents (as well as the general public) of strategies with which to engage conversations about engineering,and can be extended to other non-familiar occupations as well...|$|R
40|$|A Model United Nations School Conference {{is a brief}} role-play simulation, {{during which}} senior high school {{students}} take on the roles of delegates in various UN Committees. This thesis presents the findings from a qualitative longitudinal research study which followed 26 MUN senior high school delegates, in Athens, Greece, during their preparation and actual participation in three consecutive MUN conferences, from December 20 I 1 to March 2013. The research explored and exposed the MUN participants' perspectives on global citizenship in terms of knowledge, values, attitudes and skills the students saw themselves as developing, {{in light of their}} prolonged engagement in MUN. A range of data collection techniques were used, including participant observation and semi-structured interviews where the photo-elicitation technique was employed. The research in this thesis suggests that the senior high school students who participated in MUN were able to identify global citizenship as a potential citizen status, which entailed the acquisition of global knowledge, development of a sense of moral concern about and responsibility for addressing global issues, and a commitment to take collective action for a sustainable future. It also demonstrated that students had varying conceptions of global citizenship, mostly depending on the length of their engagement in MUN. The students who participated in all three MUN conferences related their experience to their development as global citizens, in terms of preparation for active citizenship in the future and a stimulus' for changing their own attitudes and perspectives in this regard. Preparation for and participation in this role play simulation seemed to have provided an ideal opportunity for the students to develop independent research and critical thinking skills, as well as public speaking, team working and problem-solving in an engaging, active learning, <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of a study designed to examine ways to engage and scaffold primary school students who experience literacy learning difficulties. Utilising a pedagogy of multiliteracies, proposed by the New London Group (1996, 2000), and a framework for inclusive pedagogy (Florian, 2014), this thesis sought to investigate ways to facilitate meaningful literacy learning for students who experience challenges when participating in print-based classroom activities. A qualitative case study approach was adopted to support the broader sociocultural and multiliteracies perspective that underlies the theoretical direction of this research. Three student case studies were constructed illustrating the students’ in-school and out-of-school literacy practices. Research data indicated that while these students exhibited strong engagement with multiple literacies in their <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment,</b> their experiences in a classroom context were, at times, challenging and marginalising. During the fieldwork period, which took place in a Western Australian Year 6 primary classroom, a multimodal literacy activity was implemented over one school term. This activity required students to: 1. Audioread the novel The Bad Beginning 2. Create a storyboard utilising the iPad app Kid’s Book Report and 3. Create an iMovie review about the novel. Data analysis revealed that engagement with the multimodal literacy activity emerged in similar ways for the case study students. These students appeared to be engaged with the literacy activity when they were: • Activating prior knowledge and immersed in meaningful practices via situated learning. • Experiencing opportunities to create meaning in multiple ways. • Fostering shared meanings - scaffolded within a community of practice. Results indicate that engagement with multiple literacies, beyond the printed word, allowed the students to navigate literacy within various contexts. Exploring multimodal ways to present their thoughts further enhanced the students’ engagement with the multimodal literacy activity. This study provides insight into key areas in the field of literacy research and contributes to understandings of: multiliteracies; inclusive pedagogy; sociocultural approaches to literacy; and open-ended and flexible approaches to literacy learning. The study may be of interest to pre and in service primary school educators and education researchers and policy makers...|$|E
40|$|Die Einführung einer Ausbildung bis 18 ist bei einer in Österreich seit Jahrzehnten bestehenden Schulpflicht von neun Schuljahren ein großer Einschnitt, sodass damit ein {{nationale}}s Programm von bedeutender Dimension in Angriff genommen wird. Es wird das Ziel verfolgt, den Anteil der Bildungsabschlüsse auf der oberen Sekundarstufe zu erhöhen. Insofern handelt es sich um eine bedeutende nationale Initiative gegen frühen Schulabbruch. Der Bericht stellt die Ergebnisse der wissenschaftlichen Grundlagenanalysen dar, die im Auftrag von BMASK, BMBF und BMWFW durchgeführt wurden. Er umspannt quantitative Analysen zu Ausmaß und Ursprung von frühem Bildungsabbruch, qualitative Analysen zu Hintergründen, Problemlagen und Ressourcen von betroffenen Jugendlichen sowie Analysen der bereits existierenden Angebote im Bereich der Prävention gegen frühen Ausbildungsabbruch sowie entsprechender kompensatorischer Angebote. Zielgruppe der Ausbildung bis 18 sind rund 16. 000 Jugendliche zwischen 15 und 17 Jahren. Dabei unterscheiden sich die Lebenssituation, der Grad der Systemferne und der Unterstützungsbedarf der Jugendlichen. Trotz einer großen Bandbreite von Ursachen für frühen Ausbildungsabbruch zeichnet sich als Gemeinsamkeit ab, dass schulischer Erfolg bzw. Misserfolg in hohem Maße von Problematiken und der Verfügbarkeit von Unterstützung im außerschulischen Umfeld der Jugendlichen abhängt. Dies wird in einem System, das auf Selektion der Besseren basiert, zusätzlich verstärkt. Österreichweit werden bereits beträchtliche Aktivitäten im Bereich der Kompensation eines fehlenden Abschlusses und der Systemintegration gesetzt. Um die Ausbildung bis 18 zu realisieren, ist es jedoch notwendig, den Bereich der Prävention auszubauen. Dies reicht von einer generellen Reduktion der Selektivität des Bildungssystems über einen Ausbau des Unterstützungssystems an Schulen bis hin zu einer gezielten Verteilung von Ressourcen an Schulstandorte, wo sich Problematiken häufen. To introduce an obliging {{education and}} training up {{to the age of}} 18 (‚E&T up to 18 ‘) is a fundamental innovation, as in Austria compulsory education has for several decades been completed after the ninth school year. In that context, with ‘E&T up to 18 ’ a large scale national program of high significance is pushed. The goal is to increase the share of qualifications at upper secondary level. Concurrently it is the main national initiative to combat Early School Leaving (ESL). In the report, the findings of the baseline study that has been conducted on behalf of the Ministries of Social Affairs, of Education and of Economic Affairs are presented. The study encompasses quantitative analyses of the extent and origins of ESL, qualitative analyses of the backgrounds, problems and resources of early leavers as well as an analysis of preventive and remedial measures to tackle ESL. About 16. 000 young persons between 15 and 17 constitute the target group of ‘E&T up to 18 ’. Their situations in life, {{the degree to which they}} are excluded from the education system – and therefore their needs for support – differ widely. Given a range of causes for ESL, one common link can be found anyway: Educational success and failure are connected with the absence of problems and the existence of support in the youth’s <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment.</b> One driver in this context is an {{education and training}} system that is fundamentally based on selection. As far as remedial activities to compensate for a missing qualification and measures to help youths to re-integrate into the education system are concerned, efforts are being made all over Austria. Still, to implement the large-scale ‘E&T up to 18 ’ it will be necessary to put more effort into preventive measures: Prevention in this sense means a general reduction of the selectivity of the E&T system, the extension of in-school support systems as well as to channel resources to those schools that have to face problems above the average...|$|E

40|$|By {{using data}} on Norwegian 4 th and 8 th graders {{who participated in}} TIMSS 2007, this report starts out by {{investigating}} whether time spent on homework varies across pupils from different socio-economic backgrounds. The findings show that pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds, in both 4 th and 8 th grade, {{are more likely to}} spend no time on homework than pupils from higher socio-economic backgrounds (although homework is given). At the same time it is also found that if pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds spend time on homework, they actually spend more time on it than pupils from higher socio-economic backgrounds. One reason why pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to spend zero time on homework could be lack of interest or necessary skills. Another explanation may be poor <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environments.</b> I. e., these pupils may have parents who do not or cannot help with homework or make sure that they complete their homework. There are also many possible explanations why pupils from lower socio-economic background spend more time on homework than pupils from higher socio-economic backgrounds. First of all, they may need more time in to complete their homework if they find the homework more difficult than pupils from higher socio-economic backgrounds. Also more time spend on homework can reflect problems related to motivation, frustration and concentration. On the other hand, more time spent on homework may also reflect high educational ambitions, regardless of socioeconomic background. The second aim of the report is to analyze the effect of homework on pupil achievement. There seem to be a positive effect of homework (in mathematics) on average. However, not all pupils seem to benefit from homework. In fact, pupils from lower socio-economic backgrounds (measured as no or very few books at home) actually perform better if less homework is assigned. One explanation why homework has a negative effect for some pupils, may be that homework leads to declining motivation (also during school hours), and hence indirectly affect the achievement negatively. Another explanation may be poor out of school learning environments in combination with that homework serves as a substitute for learning in school.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the potential individual and social benefit associated with children being physically active, many large scale physical activity campaigns have been developed and implemented with the purpose of increasing children’s physical activity. By nature of the wording of the key messages in many of these campaigns, an underlying notion of personal responsibility is implied in changing physical activity behaviour. However, despite responsibility being the predominent message also in wider health campaigns, there is little research on what constitutes responsible behaviour in relation to children’s physical activity. Furthermore, research suggests that a lack of clarity exists as to who exactly is responsible for children’s physical activity, in both in- and out-of-school environments. The overall aim of this thesis was therefore to explore the perception and attributions of responsibility for children’s physical activity in key influencers over children’s physical activity behaviour. Three studies were conducted to achieve this aim: a prelimary quantitative study investigating in- and out-of-school pedometer steps in primary school-aged-children, followed by a descriptive qualitative study investigating children’s, parents’, and teachers’ perceptions and attributions of responsibility for children’s physical activity, and lastly a further descriptive qualitative study with leaders of National Football Associations (NFAs) exploring the position of their organisations in relation to responsibility for children’s physical activity. The preliminary study provided the first pedometer-based measures of primary school-aged children in New Zealand. Yamax Digiwalker SW- 200 pedometers were worn over a three-day period by a sample of 91 Auckland-based children aged between 5 - 11 years to record school-based and out-of-school steps. Mean daily steps for the overall sample were 14, 333. Mean daily steps for boys (15, 606) and girls (13, 031) were similar to other studies in New Zealand (Duncan, Schofield, & Duncan, 2006), with the former group’s steps being signficantly higher than the latter. With the exception of Year 5 boys, mean steps were higher with increasing school year for both boys and girls. Most notably however, steps taken out-of-school made up the highest proportion of daily steps (52. 4 %), with the most active third of the sample completing significantly more steps out-of-school (57. 1 %) than their least active counterparts (46. 8 %). There {{was no significant difference between}} the most and least active groups in their steps taken during school hours, suggesting that physical activity undertaken in after-school hours is a key contributor to children’s overall physical activity levels. With the finding in the first study highlighting the importance of key influences over children’s physical activity behaviour in the <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment,</b> parents along with teachers and children were included in the first main study of the thesis examining their perspectives on the meaning of responsibility in children’s physical activity. Eight focus groups, comprising children aged 11 - 12 years (four groups; n= 32), their parents (two groups; n= 13), and teachers (two groups; n= 15) from two upper primary (intermediate) schools in Auckland, New Zealand were conducted, with ensuing transcripts being analysed thereafter using thematic induction methodology. The first reported analysis of this data revealed a number of commonly identified behaviours indicative of personal, parental, and third party responsibility for children’s physical activity. These behaviours formed natural groups with common themes that were mostly not affected by socio-economic status or gender, and often linked to established correlates of children’s physical activity such as healthy diet, access to facilities/programmes/equipment, fewer perceived barriers, intention to be active, support from others including parents, and use of active transport. One key area where there was disagreement between the socio-economic groups was in the importance placed on parents being good role models – an area where research is also indeterminate. Low decile children were less likely to refer to importance of their parents being physically active, which combined with low decile parents frequently mentioning the sacrifices they must make to ensure their children are physically active and their reluctance to encourage children into activities they could not provide logistic and financial support for, it may mean that children recognise this parental dilemma and instead place more importance on parents prioritising their children’s physical activity needs. After determining that responsibility is indeed a concept that can be related to children’s physical activity, the second interpretation of the first main study of the thesis explored the attribution of responsibility by the parental, child, and teacher groups. The results highlighted that children and their parents attribute primary responsibility internally for the physical activity behaviour of children, while teachers see this more as a shared responsibility with parents. All groups readily accepted that they play a part in ensuring children are physically active, with the Government being seen as a key determinant in whether their respective responsibilities could be fulfilled. Given their potential to help impact on children’s physical activity levels in the after-school period, National Sports Organisations (NSOs) were surprisingly rarely attributed responsibility for children’s physical activity. This finding in particular was significant in light of the New Zealand Government’s recent policy leaning towards more direct support of schools and organisations within the community (such as NSOs) which provide children with access to opportunities for physical activity and sport. Given the proposal of the Government to work more closely with NSOs in order to get children more physically active, the second major study of the thesis was also timely in that it explored the position of National Football Associations (NFAs), as organisations which could significantly impact on the after-school activity levels of children due to their reach and low barriers to accessibility, in taking responsibility for children’s physical activity. Using the framework provided by institutional theory, this study aimed to develop greater insight into the current norms, beliefs, values and underlying sources of resistance that impact on football organisations increasing their involvement in the physical activity agenda. Thematic induction methodology was used to analyse transcripts from semi-structured interviews with key decision makers in eight NFAs from around the world. The findings suggested that while the awareness of the importance of engaging in initiatives related to children’s physical activity is growing, there are significant institutional barriers preventing strong NFA involvement in this area – the main one being the focus on elite versus grassroots football as a result of the perception of a legitimate NFA being one that is highly successful through the internationally credible performance of its national teams. Such findings will be helpful in the design of strategies for ensuring maximal uptake and benefit of support provided to NSOs by government entities for increasing children’s physical activity levels. Taking into account the main limitation of this study relating to the sample size and representation in each of the three constituent studies, the results presented in this thesis highlighted the important concept of shared responsibility, that is, all agents who have a role in ensuring children are physically active accepting and meeting their respective responsibilities, particularly in the <b>out-of-school</b> <b>environment</b> which was identified in this study as critical for the overall physical activity levels of children. This study identified the individuals and organisations deemed responsible for ensuring children are physically active and the types of behaviour that are considered responsible for each of the key stakeholders accordingly. The findings also highlighted that while all of these groups are willing to accept responsibility for the physical activity behaviour of children under their care, the Government was seen as having a critical enabling role for schools and parents, in turn reinforcing the importance of providing more direct support to schools, sporting and community organisations that offer opportunities for children to engage in physical activity behaviour. This thesis also offered an explanation of the potential barriers that may exist for sporting organisations (NFAs in this case) potentially working alongside government agencies and community organisations to raise the physical activity levels of children. For football organisations, a strong institutional norm that equates legitimacy with successful national teams helps to preserve the focus on elite football and hinders a wider and increased uptake of programmes and intiatives that could potentially assist in the achievement of organisational goals and also in substantially increasing the physical activity levels of children. In closing, the scope of this thesis was therefore vast, utilising both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, different conceptual frameworks, and participant groups ranging from New Zealand children aged 5 - 13 years to key decision makers in the biggest NFAs in the world. As well as its practical application to the new sport and physical activity policy environment in New Zealand, this research offers a new contribution to the body of literature in both physical activity and sport. The application of institutional theory to physical activity and general health behaviours is new, and based on the clear findings in this study, very appropriate for use in the future. Additionally, although corporate social responsibility has been a widely investigated topic in football and sport in general, the specific exploration of NFA responsibility for children’s physical activity is also a new application and provides more understanding for both NFA and those agencies such as government entities looking to partner with them to increase children’s physical activity levels on potential issues that they may face in doing so...|$|E
40|$|My {{research}} centers upon designing transformative learning environments and supporting technologies. Kitchen Science Investigators (KSI) is an <b>out-of-school</b> transformative learning <b>environment</b> we {{designed to help}} young people learn science through cooking. My dissertation considers the question, 'How can we design a learning environment in which children discover the utility of science {{in their lives and}} their own scientific capabilities?' I have explored this question in the context of designing and enacting KSI. We designed the environment (i. e., activities, facilitation, and technology support) so that in the midst of cooking, participants generate personal goals that they need science to achieve. Our design integrates software to promote scientific practices in a real world context. In my thesis research I analyze how learners are developing identity as scientific reasoners in this environment. I also make recommendations about the design of learning environments and technologies to help with scientific development. My dissertation study is a longitudinal study of individuals in our most recent implementation of KSI. My current analysis of KSI shows significant development of disposition and identity development among focal learners, as well as a set of causal factors. I found that as learners connected cooking and science, and as they participated in science socially with their friends, they began to increase their scientific participation in and outside of KSI. My findings suggest guidelines for software support, facilitation, and activities for getting learners engaged in scientific inquiry in ways that promote the development of scientific identities. Ph.

40|$|<b>Out-of-school</b> {{learning}} <b>environments</b> {{are a part}} {{of chemistry}} education and they follow the Finnish National Core Curriculum. Non-formal learning is also a current topic of research internationally. By using <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environments</b> such as the ChemistryLab Gadolin in teaching, it is possible to encourage adolescents towards learning about chemistry. These learning environments offer contents, activities and resources, which might not be available in schools. With the help of context-based and relevant contents in chemistry as well as with inquiry-based work instructions and methods it is possible to support meaningful chemical education. By developing teaching in cooperation with specialists in the industry, we are able to add relevance to chemistry education. The aim of design-based research was to develop a meaningful non-formal learning environment in chemistry that would support the execution of study visit. The research was divided into three parts: (1) problem analyses, (2) the design process and (3) the design product. There were four main research questions in this research: (i) What kinds of needs are there in chemistry education regarding context-based contents and relevance? (problem analyses), (ii) Which factors and actions support active study visit in non-formal learning environments in chemistry? (problem analyses), (iii) How to develop the non-formal learning environment in chemistry communally with specialists in the industry? (design process), and (iv) What kind of is a relevant non-formal learning environment in chemistry with its contents and methods for study visit? (design product). The design-based research consisted of two theoretical problem analyses, where one was connected to meaningful learning of chemistry and the other to learning environments in chemistry and study visits. In total there were four empirical problem analyses. These were carried out as case studies. The first one was about looking at the context-based worksheets (N= 160) in upper secondary school chemistry books. The second problem analysis focused on chemistry teachers (N= 13) and students (N= 33) experiences in exploiting skills in chemistry in everyday life, as to say their experiences in relevance and contexts. In the third one, teachers (N= 161) and students (N= 300) aims for study visits in the ChemistryLab Gadolin were studied. In the fourth empirical problem analysis, chemistry teachers (N= 87) activities before and after the study visit and and ways of assessment were researched. Data was collected with the help of interviews, survey forms and literary outputs. Research data was analyzed with deductive and inductive content analysis. Reliability of research was increased by data -, method -, theory - and researcher triangulation. The results of the problem analyses were taken into consideration in the layout of the aims of the design process. The aim of the design process was to develop the didactic viewpoint of a non-formal learning environment in chemistry that would support meaningful study visit. The design process included the following two parts: (i) the development of laboratory work sheets and (ii) the development of activities that support the study visit. The development of laboratory work sheets was carried out collaboratively in the ChemistryLab Gadolin with industry specialists (N= 9) and with students studying to be chemistry teachers (N= 10). There were characteristics connected to collaboration and novice operations in the collaborative design process concerning work instructions. During the development process, specialist and instructor s support was observed as important. A suitable instrument of evaluation for non-formal learning environments in chemistry was developed on the basis of teachers (N= 161) and students (N= 300) case study. A model, for developing activities that support study visit, was created from teachers (N= 87) operational models during study visit. The research provided four kinds of research information: (i) information on relevant contents that support chemical education, hands-on laboratory working methods and learning environments, (ii) on the collaborative design process, (iii) on context-based learning and relevance, which can be promoted in cooperation with specialists in the industry, and (iv) on meaningful execution of non-formal study visits in chemistry and on the evaluation of the aims of a visit. According to the empirical problem analysis (the so called needs analysis) in this research, context-based and relevant contents in upper secondary school inquiry should be developed in a more versatile way. A third of laboratory work sheets in upper secondary level textbooks included relevant, context-based contents, where home economics was emphasized. Teachers and students were observed to emphasize topics in home economics on the individual level in a case study concerning everyday chemistry. According to research, chemistry teachers activities and methods concerning study visit are focused more on the time after the field trip. Before the visit, in the preparatory part, theory and working methods are revised, laboratory work sheets are given and rules and instructions concerning the visit are discussed together. In the part after the visit, more versatile methods, including revising, were used such as blog entries and exercises having to do with visual arts. Assessment was based on summative assessment, attitudes and skills. In a non-formal learning environment, formative evaluation that supports learning was used only a little. According to research, when planning a study visit in a non-formal learning environment it is important to take the following eight factors into consideration (the so called instrument of evaluation for a non-formal learning environment) : (i) participation, (ii) relevance, (iii) material environment, (iv) using ICT, (v) inquiry, (vi) supporting teachers work, (vii) differentiation and (viii) clarity of instructions. In addition, it is important for a teacher to take into consideration the before and after activities with different methods and evaluation in a study visit. As design products, there were also nine new and relevant context-based laboratory work sheets, which especially supported Industry, technology and production category. Three work sheets were chosen to be developed further. The final products were observed to support the level of individual relevance as well as the societal and vocational levels. The relevance levels of the further developed work sheets were studied to the visiting groups of teachers (N= 25) and students (N= 88) in the ChemistryLab Gadolin. The results of the design-based research can be applied in developing meaningful context-based hands-on working in natural science education. Cooperation with the industry brings added value to increasing the relevance of teaching. Meaningful and outcome-based study visits to non-formal learning environments can be developed by exploiting research information. The non-formal learning environment evaluation instrument developed in this qualitative research can be applied when designing learning environments. Koulujen ulkopuoliset oppimisympäristöt ovat osa kemian opetusta kansallisten opetussuunnitelman perusteiden mukaisesti. Non-formaali oppiminen on myös ajankohtainen tutkimusaihe kansainvälisesti. Käyttämällä opetuksessa koulun ulkopuolisia oppimisympäristöjä, kuten Kemianluokka Gadolinia, nuoria voidaan innostaa kemian opiskeluun. Ne tarjoavat sisältöjä, toimintoja ja resursseja, joita ei koulussa välttämättä ole käytössä. Kontekstilähtöisten ja merkityksellisten kemian sisältöjen sekä kokeellisten työohjeiden ja työtapojen avulla voidaan tukea mielekästä kemian opetusta. Kehittämällä opetusta yhteistyössä työelämän asiantuntijoiden kanssa voidaan lisätä merkityksellisyyttä kemian opetukseen. Kehittämistutkimuksen (engl. design-based research) tavoitteena oli tutkimuspohjaisesti kehittää mielekästä kemian non-formaalia oppimisympäristöä toiminnallisten opintokäyntien toteuttamisen tueksi. Tutkimus jakautui kolmeen osa-alueeseen: (1) ongelma-analyyseihin, (2) kehittämisprosessiin ja (3) kehittämistuotokseen. Tutkimuksessa päätutkimuskysymyksiä oli neljä: (i) minkälaisia tarpeita on kemian opetuksessa sen kontekstilähtöisyyden ja merkityksellisyyden suhteen? (ongelma-analyysit), (ii) mitkä tekijät ja toiminnot tukevat toiminnallista opintokäyntiä kemian non-formaaliin oppimisympäristöön? (ongelma-analyysit), (iii) miten kemian non-formaalia oppimisympäristöä voidaan kehittää yhteisöllisesti työelämän asiantuntijoiden kanssa? (kehittämisprosessi), ja (iv) minkälainen on mielekäs kemian non-formaali oppimisympäristö sisältöineen ja toiminnallisen opintokäynnin työtapoineen? (kehittämistuotos). Kehittämistutkimukseen sisältyi kaksi teoreettista ongelma-analyysiä, joista toinen liittyi kemian mielekkääseen oppimiseen ja toinen kemian oppimisympäristöihin sekä toiminnalliseen opintokäyntiin. Empiirisiä ongelma-analyysejä oli yhteensä neljä. Ne toteutettiin tapaustutkimuksina. Ensimmäisessä tutkittiin lukion kemian oppikirjojen kokeellisten töiden (N= 160) kontekstilähtöisyyttä. Toisessa ongelma-analyysissä tutkittiin kemian opettajien (N= 13) ja opiskelijoiden (N= 33) kokemuksia kemian taitojen hyödyntämisestä omassa arjessa, eli merkityksellisyyden ja kontekstuaalisuuden kokemuksia. Kolmannessa kartoitettiin opettajien (N= 161) ja opiskelijoiden (N= 300) tavoitteita toiminnalliselle opintokäynnille Kemianluokka Gadoliniin. Neljännessä empiirisessä ongelma-analyysissä tutkittiin kemian opettajien (N= 87) etu- ja jälkikäteistoimintoja ja työtapoja sekä arviointitapoja opintokäynnin yhteydessä. Aineistoa kerättiin haastattelemalla, kyselylomakkeella ja kirjallisista tuotoksista. Tutkimusaineistoa analysoitiin teoria- ja aineistolähtöisellä sisällönanalyyseillä. Tutkimuksen luotettavuutta parannettiin aineisto-, menetelmä-,  teoria- ja tutkijatriangulaatiolla. Ongelma-analyysien tulokset huomioitiin kehittämisprosessin tavoitteiden asettelussa. Kehittämisprosessi, jonka päätavoitteena oli kehittää kemian non-formaalin oppimisympäristön didaktista näkökulmaa mielekkääksi toiminnallisten opintokäyntien toteuttamisen tueksi, sisälsi kaksi osaa: (i) kokeellisten työohjeiden kehittämisen ja (ii) toiminnallisia opintokäyntejä tukevien toimintojen ja työtapojen kehittämisen. Työohjeiden kehittäminen toteutettiin yhteisöllisesti Kemianluokka Gadolinissa yritysasiantuntijoiden (N= 9) ja kemian opettajaksi opiskelevien (N= 10) kanssa. Työohjeiden yhteisölliseen kehittämisprosessiin liittyi yhteistyöhön ja noviisitoimijuuteen liittyviä piirteitä. Kehittämisprosessissa asiantuntijahenkilön ja ohjaajan tuki havaittiin tärkeäksi. Kemian non-formaalille oppimisympäristölle sopiva arviointityökalu kehitettiin opettajien (N= 161) ja oppilaiden (N= 300) tapaustutkimuksen pohjalta. Toiminnallisten opintokäyntiä tukevien toimintojen kehittämiseen malli syntyi opettajien (N= 87) toimintamalleista opintokäynnin yhteydessä. Tutkimuksessa saatiin neljänlaista tutkimustietoa: (i) mielekkäistä kemian opiskelua tukevista sisällöistä, kokeellisista työskentelymenetelmistä ja oppimisympäristöistä, (ii) yhteisöllisestä kehittämisprosessista, (iii) kontekstilähtöisyydestä ja merkityksellisyydestä, jota voidaan edistää yhteistyössä työelämän asiantuntijoiden kanssa, sekä (iv) kemian non-formaalien  toiminnallisten opintokäyntien mielekkäästä toteuttamisesta ja vierailujen  tavoitteiden arvioimisesta. Tutkimuksen empiirisen ongelma-analyysin (nk. tarveanalyysin) mukaan lukion kokeellisuuden kontekstilähtöisiä ja merkityksellisiä sisältöjä tulisi kehittää monipuolisemmaksi. Kolmannes lukion oppikirjojen kokeellisista työohjeista sisälsi mielekästä kontekstilähtöistä sisältöä, jossa pääpainona oli kotitalous. Kotitalouden aihealueeseen painottuminen henkilökohtaisella tasolla havaittiin myös kemian opettajilla ja opiskelijoilla arkipäivän kemiaan liittyvässä tapaustutkimuksessa. Tutkimuksen mukaan kemian opettajien toiminnallisiin opintokäynteihin liittyvät toiminnot ja työtavat painottuivat kouluopetuksessa enemmän vierailun jälkeiseen aikaan. Ennen vierailua valmistavassa osassa kerrattiin teoriaa ja kokeellisuutta, jaettiin työohjeet ja keskusteltiin vierailuun liittyvistä käytännön asioista. Vierailun jälkeisessä osassa käytettiin monipuolisempia työtapoja kertaamisen lisäksi, kuten blogikirjoituksia ja kuvataidetehtäviä. Arviointi painottui summatiiviseen arviointiin, asenteisiin ja taitoihin. Non-formaalissa oppimisympäristössä oppimista tukevaa formatiivista arviointia käytettiin vähän. Tutkimuksen mukaan non-formaaliin oppimisympäristöön tehtävän toiminnallisen opintokäynnin suunnittelussa on tärkeä ottaa huomioon seuraavat kahdeksan asiaa (nk. non-formaalin oppimisympäristön arviointityökalu) : (i) osallistuneisuus, (ii) merkityksellisyys, (iii) materiaaliympäristö, (iv) tietotekniikan käyttö,  (v) tutkiminen, (vi) opettajan työn tukeminen, (vii) eriyttäminen  ja (viii)  ohjeiden selkeys. Lisäksi opettajan on tärkeää huomioida tavoitteellisessa toiminnallisessa opintokäynnissä etu- ja jälkikäteistoiminnot työtapoineen sekä arviointi. Kehittämistuotoksena syntyi myös yhdeksän mielekästä uutta kontekstilähtöistä kokeellista työohjetta, jotka tukivat erityisesti Teollisuus, tekniikka ja tuotanto -kontekstuaalisuuden aihealuetta. Näistä kolme työohjetta valittiin jatkokehitettäviksi, joiden lopullisen tuotoksen havaittiin tukevan henkilökohtaisen merkityksellisyyden tason lisäksi yhteiskunnallista ja ammatillista tasoa. Jatkokehitettyjen työohjeiden merkityksellisyyden tasoja arvioitiin Kemianluokka Gadolinissa vierailevilla opettajaryhmillä (N= 25 opettajaa) ja oppilasryhmillä (N= 88 oppilasta). Kehittämistutkimuksen tuloksia voidaan soveltaa mielekkään kontekstilähtöisen kokeellisuuden kehittämiseen luonnontieteiden opetuksessa. Yhteistyö työelämän kanssa tuo lisäarvoa opetuksen merkityksellisyyden lisäämiseen. Mielekkäitä toiminnallisia opintokäyntejä non-formaaleihin oppimisympäristöihin ja siihen liittyvää tavoitteellisuutta voidaan kehittää tutkimustietoa hyödyntäen. Tässä kvalitatiivisessa tutkimuksessa kehitettyä kemian non-formaalin oppimisympäristön arviointityökalua voidaan soveltaa oppimisympäristöjen suunnitteluun...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to develop {{educational}} resources concerning bioenergy and sustainability. The initial purpose was to produce two sets of material: one suitable for children in their first years of Swedish compulsory school, and one designed for upper secondary students. In the report, however, the possibilities are discussed for this material {{to be used with}} even wider audiences. In {{the first phase of the}} process, literature (books, reports etc.) with relevance to bioenergy, sustainability and theories of learning were studied. This insight, along with the appropriate course curriculums, was used in the development stage to produce learning material for the targeted audiences. The development was followed by tests and evaluations carried out with high school students, upon which an analytical discussion is held regarding the consequences and possibilities that the results of this project pose. The content of the learning material is based on the curriculum and course requirements provided by Skolverket (The Swedish National Agency for Education) for lower elementary and high school students. The requirements that were aimed to be addressed concerned making use of the students’ natural curiosity for their environment, their ability to investigate and critically deduce conclusions from the results and, ultimately, their ability to make qualified decisions when faced with issues regarding the environment, climate change, energy and life style. The didactic theory on how this content was to be presented is based on research concerning learning based on discussion and previous experiences, case methodology, education in environments outside of school etc. References are presented supporting the view that learning is most substantial if discussed with peers and if relations are made to previous knowledge. Working problem-based and with case methodology can fulfill these aims, along with playing an <b>out-of-school</b> learning <b>environment</b> to its best advantages. As a result, a number of activities and sketches for exhibits, along with a 90 minute long school program (which can sometimes be given to students visiting a science center etc.) have been developed on the topic of bioenergy and sustainable development. Parts of the educational resources were evaluated through a series of tests with high school students during their visit at Kreativum, a science center in Karlshamn, Sweden. This evaluation consisted of a quantitative analysis of the students’ experiences and a qualitative interview with the educators which observed the tests. As an introduction, the students were asked to construct a mind map around the title "Bioenergy" with concepts and terms they associated with this subject. After taking part of the program the students were given back their mind maps, with the possibility of adding things they now knew in another color. This enabled a simplified analysis of what visitors have learned and also takes previous knowledge into consideration. The test runs resulted in some minor readjustments of the program, which mostly had to do with the execution rather than the material itself. These alterations were meant to result in further interaction with the exhibition and students feeling a higher sense of responsibility and capability to take action. The evaluation gave indications that the Wordcatcher game with its new theme "Sustainable energy" was a 2 prominent source of new vocabulary for the students and their mind maps. This theme will be kept in use by the science center, even outside the school program. The educators also showed interest in the mind map activity and saw it useful as an exercise in itself; therefore it is kept in the program even though it will not be used for evaluation purposes. In the concluding part of this report the result of the project is related to the difficulties, limitations, possibilities and the potential for education in the area of bioenergy. It has been revealed that course requirements concerning bioenergy are scarce in the Swedish curriculum, even though education in this field is considered invaluable in the progress towards sustainable living. The analysis also shows that the focus on methods (rather than facts) in the course requirements causes trouble in terms of what specific content should be covered, and what students of a certain age group can be expected to know. Bioenergy and sustainable development are therefore difficult, yet important, subjects for educators to handle today. II. KEYWORDS Bioenergy, sustainable development, education, out-of-school learning, science centers. Detta projekt genomfördes med syftet att utveckla ett pedagogiskt material rörande bioenergi och hållbar utveckling, ämnat att användas i extramurala lärandemiljöer mot två olika målgrupper. Utbildningsmaterialet är indelat i moment anpassade till grundskolans första år respektive gymnasiet, men materialets flexibilitet och möjligheterna att använda detta även med andra åldersgrupper diskuteras. Arbetet inleddes av litteraturstudier inom relevanta ämnesområden och lärandeteorier, som sedan tillämpades praktiskt i utvecklingsfasen. Delar av det utvecklade pedagogiska materialet testades och utvärderades med gymnasieklasser för att sedan analysera resultatet och diskutera eventuella konsekvenser och möjligheter som uppkommit i och med arbetet. Utbildningsresursens innehåll baseras på Skolverkets kurs- och ämnesplaner för grundskolan årskurs 1 - 3 respektive för gymnasieskolan, medan utformningen har fått genomsyras av idéer om bl. a. diskussions- och erfarenhetsbaserat lärande, casemetodik och undervisning i extramurala lärandemiljöer (lärandemiljöer utanför skolbyggnaden). Detta har resulterat i ett antal aktiviteter och skisser till stationer, samt ett temapaket (ett 90 minuter långt skolprogram som kan beställas vid vissa besök på t. ex. science center) som behandlar bioenergi och hållbar utveckling. Delar av materialet utvärderades genom tester med gymnasieklasser som besökte science centret Kreativum i Karlshamn. Mindre ändringar gjordes i och med dessa som syftade till att vidare utnyttja centrets utställningsobjekt samt att mana eleverna till ansvarstagande och handlingskraft. I diskussionen analyseras projektets resultat med hänsyn till de svårigheter och begränsningar, respektive de möjligheter och den utvecklingspotential som finns för utbildning inom bioenergiområdet. Undervisning inom ämnet uppfattas vara avgörande för vägen mot hållbar utveckling, men tycks underprioriteras i Skolverkets kurs- och ämnesplaners centrala innehåll. Området är därmed problematiskt, men inte desto mindre viktigt, att arbeta med som pedagog idag. IV. NYCKELORD Bioenergi, hållbar utveckling, utbildning, extramuralt lärande, science center...|$|R
