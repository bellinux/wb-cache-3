40|$|It {{is found}} that {{commodity}} price shocks largely affect the mining, construction and <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industries</b> in Australia.

Construction output is also found to increase significantly, especially in response to a bulk commodities shock, as a result of increased demand for resource related construction. Increased demand for construction has a positive spillover effect to parts of the <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industry</b> that supply the construction sector with intermediate inputs, such as the non-metallic mineral sub <b>industry.</b> In contrast, <b>other</b> <b>manufacturing</b> sub <b>industries</b> with only tenuous links to the resources sector such as textiles, clothing and <b>other</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> are relatively unresponsive to commodity price shocks. ...|$|R

40|$|Concrete's natural {{color is}} gray. Its favored uses are utilitarian. Its very ubiquity causes it to {{blend into the}} background. But ready-mix {{concrete}} does have one remarkable characteristic: other than manufactured ice, perhaps no <b>other</b> <b>manufacturing</b> <b>industry</b> faces greater transport barriers. The transportation problem arises because ready-mix concrete both has a low value-to-weight ratio and is highly perishable [...] it absolutely must be discharged from the truck before it hardens. These transportation barriers mean ready-mixed concrete must be produced near its customers. For the same reason, foreign trade in ready-mixed concrete is essentially nonexistent. This article is {{an introduction to the}} basics of the market for ready-mix concrete, focusing mainly on its consumers and its producers in the United States, but with occasional comparisons to other countries when contrasts are useful. ...|$|R
