5|$|Homosexuality {{addressed}} by television started much later than films. Local talk {{shows in the}} late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed <b>on</b> <b>network</b> <b>television</b> was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and in distress, calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, {{she is able to}} pursue healthy heterosexual relationships.|$|E

The shark is successfully captured and Kay and her staff nurse it to health. Calvin, desperate to start the money rolling in immediately, orders it moved to an exhibit, but the shark dies.|$|E

NBC and later ABC also aired Midwestern Hayride. The shows, however, were generally short-lived summer replacements and had few if any well-known performers.|$|E

25|$|Newman {{recalls that}} Fox had no {{faith in the}} film and {{released}} it in neighborhood theaters only to disappear {{in less than two}} weeks. However, it was a critical and commercial success in the UK and Europe which prompted the studio to re-release it in the United States on a double bill with The French Connection. After completing its run at the cinema box office, the film gained extended life as it became a second feature favorite in drive-in theaters across the US. A cult following began to develop, {{due in large part to}} a broadcast <b>on</b> <b>network</b> <b>television</b> in 1976.|$|E
25|$|This move, and the {{addition}} of then-White House correspondent Dan Rather to the reporting team, made the program into a strong ratings hit and, eventually, a general cultural phenomenon. This was no less than a stunning reversal of the historically poor ratings performances of documentary programs <b>on</b> <b>network</b> <b>television.</b> By 1976, 60 Minutes became the top-rated program on Sunday nights in the U.S. By 1979, it had achieved the #1 spot among all television programs in the Nielsen ratings, unheard of before for a news broadcast in prime time. This success translated into great profits for CBS; advertising rates went from $17,000 per 30-second spot in 1975 to $175,000 in 1982.|$|E

25|$|For the 2013 season, the league's new {{national}} broadcast partner was the CBS Sports Network. CBSSN would air 19 regular season games and two playoff games. CBS would also air the ArenaBowl, marking {{the first time}} since 2008 that the league's finale aired <b>on</b> <b>network</b> <b>television.</b> Regular season CBSSN broadcast games are usually on Saturday nights. As the games were being shown live, the start times are not uniform as with most football broadcast packages, but vary with the time zone in which the home team is located. This meant that the AFL may have appeared either prior to or following the CBSSN's featured Major League Lacrosse game.|$|E
25|$|Until 1965 (when Major League Baseball {{made its}} first ever, league-wide regular-season network {{television}} deal with ABC), there was no league-wide national television package for regular season Major League Baseball games. As a result, teams, if they so desired, could sell {{the rights to the}} networks. Also prior to 1965, regular season Major League Baseball telecasts broadcast by networks had to be blacked-out in cities with league franchises. More to the point, by around the year prior, thanks to expansion (in 1960 and 1961), regular season MLB games shown <b>on</b> <b>network</b> <b>television</b> were blacked out in most major markets. However, the network Games of the Week, up until the late 1980s, still could not be seen in the two cities whose local teams were playing in each respective game.|$|E
25|$|On 12 February 1997, {{two weeks}} before the album released, the band {{announced}} details for the PopMart Tour in the lingerie section of a K-Mart department store in New York City. On 26 April 1997, American television network ABC aired a one-hour prime time special about Pop and the PopMart Tour, titled U2: A Year in Pop. Narrated by actor Dennis Hopper, the documentary featured footage from the Pop recording sessions, as well as live footage from the opening PopMart show in Las Vegas, which took place the night before. The program received poor reception, ranking at 101 out of 107 programs aired that week, according to Nielsen ratings, and became the lowest rated non-political documentary {{in the history of the}} ABC network. Despite the low ratings, U2 manager Paul McGuinness appreciated the opportunity for the band to appear <b>on</b> <b>network</b> <b>television</b> in the first place, stating that the small audience for the television special was still a large audience for the band, as it was much larger than any audience that could be obtained by MTV.|$|E
