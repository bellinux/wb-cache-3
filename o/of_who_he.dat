25|$|In Either/Or, A and Judge William {{each has}} one epistolary novel in two volumes. The A is an aesthete {{well aware that}} he can {{use the power of}} {{interpretation}} to define who he is and what he takes to be valuable. He knows he can shape and reshape his own self-identity. Nothing binds him to his relationships. Nothing binds him to his past actions. In the end though, he also knows he lacks a consistent understanding <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> is. He lacks a self that resists his own power of reinterpretation. His older friend Judge William, argues that a deeper concept of selfhood is discovered as one commits to one's actions, and takes ownership of the past and present. A concept of oneself, as this particular human being, begins to take form in one's own consciousness.|$|E

He suggested instead a series based on the Doctor's former companion Sarah Jane Smith.|$|E

[...] The 10-day celebration, held in September 1996, included other notable musicians such as Bruce Springsteen, Billy Bragg, The Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco.

Due to similarities which stem from their shared sexuality, Blaine [...] "sees a lot of himself in Kurt, in terms of experiences and the way they feel about the world around them. He feels the need to impart his knowledge, be a source of strength for him, and really help him through what he's going through." [...] Initially, Criss felt that the most important element of his character was to give Kurt [...] "someone he can relate to", and demonstrate that Kurt could have [...] "a young out male friend, a support system".|$|E

500|$|In 2012, McAdams starred {{opposite}} Channing Tatum in {{the romantic}} drama The Vow, {{based on a}} true story. McAdams and Tatum played a newlywed couple who try to rebuild their relationship after a car crash leaves the wife with no recollections <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> is or their marriage. McAdams was drawn to the [...] "roller coaster" [...] faced by her character and found it interesting that the story was told [...] "through the guy's eyes". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that [...] "the dimply and adorable Rachel McAdams" [...] brings [...] "enough physical charm and emotional warmth to distract from the threadbare setting and the paper-thin plot". Joseph Amodio of Newsday felt that McAdams, [...] "exuding her usual uncanny warmth on-screen", [...] "is the real draw". However, Betsy Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times felt she was [...] "wasted" [...] in the role: [...] "She is such an appealing actress that it's hard not to wish someone could make better use" [...] of her. Mary Pols of Time found the film an example of McAdams [...] "coasting" [...] in [...] "unabashedly romantic" [...] movies and asserted that [...] "she's a much more versatile and clever actress" [...] than such projects would suggest. The film, financed for $30 million, was a major commercial success and became her biggest box-office hit in a leading role. It topped the U.S. box office and has grossed over $196 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his life, Iwata {{was known}} for {{unconventional}} ideas and changing the medium of gaming. He {{was seen as the}} embodiment of Nintendo: playful, quirky, humorous, and fun. Iwata's proficiency in programming led many to refer to him as a [...] "genius" [...] in the subject, with some likening him to a Japanese Bill Gates. His hands-on approach to business earned him admiration and respect from both developers and gamers. The opening to Iwata's [...] "Heart of a Gamer" [...] speech at GDC 2005 is regarded as the [...] "essence" [...] <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> was: a humble businessman dedicated to video games. He, alongside others at Nintendo such as Miyamoto, are credited with vastly expanding the gaming market and creating a new genre. By targeting a new audience instead of competing against Microsoft and Sony, Iwata avoided a [...] "straight fight" [...] with Nintendo's competitors and successfully achieved his goals. Accordingly, Iwata was referred to as a [...] "gentle revolutionary." [...] The simplistic appeal of the Nintendo DS and Wii served to expand the market. Chris Kohler of Wired magazine stated that [...] "thanks to Nintendo's Satoru Iwata, we're all gamers now," [...] referring to the surge in video game popularity following the releases of the Nintendo DS and Wii. Although widely respected, he received criticism over his stubbornness in moving Nintendo to the mobile market. Following Iwata's death, Reggie Fils-Aimé remarked, [...] "...it will be years before his impact on both Nintendo and the full video game industry will be fully appreciated." ...|$|E
500|$|Chloe's first romantic {{relationship}} {{is with the}} man {{believed to be the}} millionaire son of Jill Abbott, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because <b>of</b> <b>who</b> <b>he</b> is. She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane because I was afraid he would think I was going after him for his money. There was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of being a father.|$|E
