5|$|Without medical intervention, {{the male}} {{fertility}} rate after SCI is 5–14%, but the rate increases with treatments. Even with all available medical interventions, {{fewer than half}} <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> SCI can father children. Assisted insemination is usually required. As with erection, therapies used to treat infertility in uninjured men are used for those with SCI.|$|E
5|$|Most {{men have}} a normal sperm count, but a high {{proportion}} of sperm are abnormal; they are less motile and do not survive as well. The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm. Cytokines, immune proteins which promote an inflammatory response, are present at higher concentrations in semen <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> SCI, as is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of white blood cells in the semen.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} has been done into erection. By two years post-injury, 80% of men recover at least partial erectile function, though many experience problems with the reliability and duration of their erections if they do not use interventions to enhance them. Studies have found that half or up to 65% <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> SCI have orgasms, although the experience may feel different than it did before the injury. Most men say it feels weaker, and takes longer and more stimulation to achieve.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate Navy {{originally}} had devised a plan where the James River Squadron would swarm Monitor {{with a party}} <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> the intention of capturing the vessel by boarding and disabling her by using heavy hammers to drive iron wedges under and disabling the turret and by covering the pilot house with a wet sail effectively blinding the pilot. Others would throw combustibles down the ventilation openings and smoke holes. At one point Jones made such an attempt to board the vessel but she managed to slip away around the stern of Virginia in time.|$|E
5|$|The Special Engineer Detachment (SED) was {{activated}} in October 1943 {{as part of}} the 9812th Technical Service Unit. It {{was made}} up <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> technical skills or advanced education, and was mostly drawn from the defunct Army Specialized Training Program. War Department policy forbade giving deferments from the draft to men under 22, so they were assigned to the SED. It reached a peak strength of 1,823 men in August 1945. SED personnel worked in all areas of the Los Alamos Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The road charged 25 cents ($ {{in modern}} dollars) for saddle horses and twice that for two-axle stagecoaches. The tolls, {{collected}} at three separate gates, primarily reflected {{the cost of}} retaining a large crew <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> snow shovels to keep the road open in wintertime; {{they were able to}} keep the road open through its first five winters. When the snow was too deep, sleighs were used instead. During the summer the stages were able to take the switchbacks at full speed, with dogs running in advance to warn other traffic. A typical voyage over the pass required 10–25 hours and five changes of horses.|$|E

He controlled ten thousands <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> arrow and bow, establishing his power over the western region. He occupied the land of Wusun and moved his tent to Qianquan north of Tashkent. All of the princes of western region assumed the Turk office of Jielifa.

5|$|After {{years in}} {{opposition}} in the parliament, in September 1848, the Party of Order was called upon by PedroII {{to form a new}} cabinet. The saquarema cabinet was composed <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> whom Caxias had close relationships, among them Eusébio de Queirós, who had helped him bring order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the late 1830s. Caxias was now a wealthy planter who owned slaves and was {{very much a part of}} the landed aristocracy that formed the backbone of the Party of Order. With the help of his wealthy mother-in-law, he purchased his first property—a coffee farm—in 1838. He acquired more lands in 1849, further expanding his plantation. Due to growing international demand, coffee had become the most valuable export commodity for Brazil.|$|E
5|$|At NSGL, {{the enlisted}} African Americans who {{tested in the}} top 30 to 40 percent were {{selected}} for non-labor battalion assignments. Port Chicago was manned by workers drawn from those remaining. The Navy determined {{that the quality of}} African American petty officers at Port Chicago suffered because of the absence of high-scoring black men, and that overall levels of competence were further reduced by the occasional requirement for Port Chicago to supply drafts <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> clear records for transfer to other stations. The Navy's General Classification Test (GCT) results for the enlisted men at Port Chicago averaged 31, putting them in the lowest twelfth of the Navy. Officers at Port Chicago considered the enlisted men unreliable, emotional, and lacking the capacity to understand or remember orders or instructions.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1850, Honório Hermeto {{was back}} in Rio de Janeiro. He had found the months in Pernambuco excruciating. Being named provincial {{president}} {{would have been considered}} a great achievement for a young politician, but it added no luster to the reputation of a seasoned politician and a founding member of his party. Instead of being at the center of power, he was put in the humiliating position of having to submit to a cabinet composed <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> less political experience, such as Joaquim Rodrigues Torres, Paulino Soares de Sousa (Honório Hermeto's colleague along with Rodrigues Torres in Coimbra) and Eusébio de Queirós. It was particularly grating being subordinated to Paulino Soares and Eusébio de Queirós, protégés whom Honório Hermeto had advanced during the 1830s. While in Pernambuco, Honório Hermeto's actions were frequently reviewed and overturned by the cabinet, often with Eusébio de Queirós leading the criticism.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{also took}} place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls {{rather than on}} {{literary}} pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed {{the backbone of the}} military forces. Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation. Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers <b>of</b> <b>men,</b> <b>with</b> the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does it appear that women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.|$|E
5|$|Crusaders' {{arrival at}} Jerusalem {{revealed}} an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here {{there was no}} prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault. They might have been left with little choice, as {{by the time the}} Crusader army reached Jerusalem, {{it has been estimated that}} only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained. These contingents, composed <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Provençal contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.|$|E

5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As with other types of sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E
5|$|Peter Frankopan {{has argued}} that the First Crusade has been {{fundamentally}} distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also {{as a result of a}} state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. The appeal to Pope Urban II was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan goes further, showing that the Crusade's primary military targets in Asia Minor - Nicaea and Antioch - required large numbers <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> experience of siege warfare; precisely the sort recruited by Urban during his preaching in France in 1095-6.|$|E
5|$|Sharks figure {{prominently}} in Hawaiian mythology. Stories tell <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> shark jaws {{on their back}} who could change between shark and human form. A common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. The beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. Among a fishing people, {{the most popular of}} all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. Kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the shark's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved's body had been wrapped. Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.|$|E

5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows {{there had to be}} a considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> a condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E

25|$|A recent {{analysis}} of Y-DNA <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> Scottish surnames {{has revealed that}} a large genetic lineage <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> the surname Macaulay, {{many of whom are}} from Lewis and Harris, have their genetic origins in the south-west of Ireland. The specific Y-DNA marker borne by these men appears to be extremely rare in Scotland, where it is only found in the Western Isles, and the Northern Isles. One hypothesis, suggested by population geneticist Jim Wilson and author Alistair Moffat, is that this marker may represent Irish slaves brought to Scotland by the Vikings. According to Wilson, this may explain why such a distinctive Irish marker is found areas where Vikings were once active, and why it is borne by Scots with surnames of Norse origin. Scottish radio presenter Fred MacAulay is {{one of the men who}} has been found to bear this marker. According to Moffat, there is a larger and unrelated genetic lineage <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>with</b> the same surname. The genetic marker of these men suggests that they descend from Vikings.|$|E
