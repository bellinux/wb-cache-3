500|$|Brand New's second studio {{album was}} written in [...] "the year and-a-half or two years" [...] that they were touring the {{material}} off Your Favorite Weapon. According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different things than 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that {{has a lot to do}} with it." [...] Unlike their first album, it was said that a lot of time and concentration went into making the album.|$|E
500|$|On January 26, 2000, an altercation during {{filming of}} the video for [...] "Sleep Now in the Fire", {{directed}} by Michael Moore, caused {{the doors of the}} New York Stock Exchange to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security after band members attempted to gain entry into the exchange. The video shoot had attracted several hundred people, according to a representative for the city's Deputy Commissioner for Public Information. New York City's film office does not allow weekday film shoots on Wall Street. Moore had permission to use the steps of Federal Hall National Memorial but did not have a permit to shoot on the sidewalk or the street, nor did he have a loud-noise permit or the proper parking permits. [...] "Michael basically gave us one directorial instruction, [...] "No matter what happens, don't stop playing", Tom Morello recalls. When the band left the steps, police officers apprehended Moore and led him away. Moore yelled to the band, [...] "Take the New York Stock Exchange!" [...] In an interview with the Socialist Worker, Morello said he and scores of others ran into the Stock Exchange. [...] "About two hundred <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> through the first set of doors, but our charge was stopped when the Stock Exchange's titanium riot doors came crashing down." [...] "For a few minutes, Rage Against the Machine was able to shut down American capitalism", Moore said. [...] "An act that I am sure tens of thousands of downsized citizens would cheer".|$|E
2500|$|Bampton and {{her husband}} both {{decided to leave the}} Met when Rudolf Bing was {{appointed}} the company's new general manager in 1950. Bampton stated in a 1989 interview that, [...] "Both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> the feeling that we wouldn't be happy with the new regime." [...] She continued to appear in operas into the early 1960s, although her opera schedule after 1950 was sparse in comparison to the schedule she kept in the 1930s and 1940s. Bampton's last opera performance was in Dialogues of the Carmelites as [...] Mme. de Croissy at Mount Saint Mary College in Newburgh, New York in 1963. She continued to perform sporadically in recitals and concerts into the early 1970s. Her husband died in 1982 and she never remarried.|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{he wants}} to be one <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> he's <b>got</b> to be {{initiated}} all over again!" [...] said Phil, in a disguised voice. [...] "What say, boys, shall we do it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{in point}} of fortune we are pretty even, since neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have <b>got</b> any," [...] {{continued}} Hector. [...] "There may be an error, but I cannot plead guilty to presumption." ...|$|R
2500|$|Figgis {{encouraged}} the lead actors to experience their characters' ordeals first-hand by extensive research. He told Film Critic: [...] "It {{was just a}} week and a half of rehearsal. A lot of conversations. A lot of communication in the year before we made the film. Reading the book. I {{encouraged the}}m [...] to do their own research, which they wanted to do anyway, and then ultimately the three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> together and just started talking...talking about anything, not necessarily about the film or the script, about anything that came up". Cage researched by binge drinking in Dublin for two weeks and had a friend videotape him so he could study his speech. He also visited hospitalized career alcoholics. He said [...] "it was one of the most enjoyable pieces of research I've ever had to do for a part." [...] Shue spent time interviewing several Las Vegas prostitutes.|$|E
2500|$|Trudi is Jody's {{friend who}} does little but smoke {{out of a}} bong during the scene where Vincent has to put a needle in Mia. According to author Jason Bailey, [...] "Quentin {{thought it would be}} funny to have this casual {{observer}} who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke. It was the only time I didn't feel like the odd one out over there." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know I got off the plane and found out I was the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We have drilled one hole, Maria, {{and none}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have <b>got</b> our fingers smashed, so I {{think we have}} every reason to be {{satisfied}} with our first experience at the work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} must get up early," [...] cried Athelny, [...] "and he must work {{like the rest}} <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> He's <b>got</b> to earn his board. No work, no dinner, my lad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true," [...] Mowbray assented. [...] "You're {{fortunate}} {{if this is}} {{the first}} time you have been troubled by the feeling. Many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have <b>got</b> used to it; but one must go on." ...|$|R
60|$|MOORE. We ain't none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> a stiver, that's wot's {{the matter}} with us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Levison unwillingly. [...] "That {{may be true}} as well. You have no doubt, {{like most}} <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>got</b> a complex nature which--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two {{or three}} of us have got bruised a little, captain; and I think we have all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> a severe fright. We thought she was over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Weâ€™re not all alike," [...] growled the Chief; [...] "some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have <b>got</b> finer {{feelings}} {{than others}} have. I saw the chap next door {{looking at her}} as we passed him this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pudd'nhead {{was right}} at the start--we ought to have hired the {{official}} half of that human phillipene to resign; but it's too late now; some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> haven't <b>got</b> anything left to hire him with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{we are all}} alive {{ten years}} hence, let's meet, and see how many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have <b>got</b> our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than now," [...] said Jo, always ready with a plan.|$|R
60|$|We played; and Idaho won. He {{picked up}} his book; and I took mine. Then each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> on {{his side of the}} house and went to reading.|$|E
60|$|Look here, I {{think all}} this is rather nonsense. We've most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> {{something}} in our past history that we don't want raked up, and we'd all better let bygones be bygones.|$|E
6000|$|He {{went out}} with a dignity that thrilled Annie. Lyra leaned toward her and said, choking with laughter, [...] "He's left Idella asleep upstairs. We haven't any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> perfect memories, have we?" ...|$|E
5|$|They {{hold that}} we are guilty of murder, and with their {{aldermanic}} jury's verdict to back them, they would hold a court of Judge Lynch and hang the unfortunate one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>got</b> into their clutches without an hour's delay, providing they didn't first tear him to pieces...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{afraid he}} didn't inherit it {{directly}} from me," [...] said Bromfield Corey; [...] "but it's in the blood, on both sides." [...] "Well, sir, we can't help those things," [...] said Lapham compassionately. [...] "Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have <b>got</b> it, and some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> haven't. The {{idea is to}} make the most of what we HAVE got." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They're from everywhere. And some of 'em {{are pretty}} streaked, I can tell you; {{and then the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> has <b>got</b> to suffer; throws {{suspicion}} on all <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> One fellow gets to stealin' fares, and then everybody's got to wear a bell-punch. I never hear mine go without thinkin' it says, 'Stop thief!' Makes me sick, I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So please you, Sir,' grumbled Kitson, 'there's Mistress Agnes of Mineshull; she's been {{in doubt}} {{between the two}} of us these five years, and she'd promised to wed {{whichever}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> the better.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{after that}} Cecily had cups of cream where the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> only milk; and Aunt Janet was very {{particular}} {{to see that}} she had her rubbers on whenever she went out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thirty days {{more for}} quitting your job," [...] said his Honor, {{and the court}} was closed. That was the outcome. The {{teamster}} got sixty days all together, while the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> thirty days.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed he did,' said Felix. 'I {{doubt if}} any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would have <b>got</b> at him but for Lance, {{who did not}} mean {{anything}} but good-nature all the time.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When Courtney was state's {{attorney}} and all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> guys <b>got</b> indicted and Nitti was hollerin' like hell, we broke through {{and we got}} the assistant state's {{attorney and}} we got the witness {{and let me tell}} you I had the jury, too, just in case. That's the way we got to revert to these days." ...|$|R
6000|$|He went on eagerly. [...] "That is {{precisely}} how I see it. You and I are just {{particles in the}} tarnish, as you call it, who are becoming dimly awake to what we are, {{to what we have}} in common. Only a very few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have <b>got</b> as far even as this. These others here, for example...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{one in five}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> out safe," [...] said Lapham, {{breaking}} his cigar-ash off {{on the edge of}} a plate. James Bellingham reached him a bottle of Apollinaris. He drank a glass, and then went on smoking.|$|E
60|$|I've been {{worrying}} about poor Tad Warren's wife, bunch <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> together {{and made up}} a purse for her. Nothing more pathetic than these poor little women that poke down the cocktails to keep excited {{and then go to}} pieces.|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon me 'n' Sally thinks putty {{much alike}} about the Little Flock," [...] Abel said {{with as much}} hauteur as {{a man in his}} bare feet could command. [...] "We hain't either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>got</b> any use for Little Flocks, any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> has <b>got</b> it,' {{said the}} fishes, shaking their heads; 'but {{in the bay}} yonder there is a tunny who, {{although}} he is so old, always goes everywhere. He {{will be able to}} tell you about it, if anyone can.' So the little fish swam off to the tunny, and again related his story.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{manage to}} creep {{around on the}} other side, and get hold of the gun first. Then I'll cover him with my revolver, and you must {{do the same with}} the other weapon.

6000|$|The {{people they}} left the land, the land, [...] But they went on working hard; [...] And the village green that had got mislaid [...] Turned up in the squireâ€™s back-yard: [...] But twenty men <b>of</b> <b>us</b> all <b>got</b> work [...] On a bit of his motor car; [...] And we all became, with the worldâ€™s acclaim, [...] The marvellous mugs we are: ...|$|R
