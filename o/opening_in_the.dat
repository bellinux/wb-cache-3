5|$|Permanent body piercings are {{performed}} {{by creating an}} <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body using a sharp object through the area to be pierced. This can either be done by puncturing an opening using a needle (usually a hollow medical needle) or scalpel or by removing tissue, either with a dermal punch or through scalpelling.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve arises {{as a number}} of small rootlets {{from the front of the}} medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the preolivary sulcus, which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the dura mater near the hypoglossal canal, an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> occipital bone of the skull.|$|E

5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> palate) is about {{at the same level}} as the front of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the fetal heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in {{the surface of the}} right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E

With pace {{spearhead}} Ray Lindwall injured and Keith Miller rested following a marathon effort in the opening Test, Loxton opened the bowling and took 2/22 from 15 overs the hosts were dismissed for 119. He made only 17 with the bat and took 0/7, again <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second innings as Australia cruised to victory by an innings. Loxton was rested for the second match before the Second Test, against Yorkshire; Brown scored a century in a drawn match.|$|E
5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document that it has been practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Bronze {{vessels are}} made and placed one above the other at {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water. Each has at the bottom a small <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of a 'jade dragon's neck'. The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E

Warlock were starting to have an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US market, when they went through many line-up changes and Pesch was left the only original member of the band. She started a solo career under the name Doro, {{in order to avoid}} legal battles between her record label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, James Baker {{died at the}} age of 41, {{leaving an}} <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> GCC. On this {{occasion}} Watts Morgan was permitted to advance as a Labour candidate and was returned unopposed. By 1903 he was being talked of as a possible candidate for a south Wales parliamentary constituency. He joined the South Wales Miners' Federation at its inception and by 1902 he was pushing for a greater political role for the organisation. By 1908 the Federation was making great headway in the Rhondda and was substantially improving conditions for the miners. At this time Watts Morgan was Agent and District Secretary at No.1 Rhondda District under William Abraham.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Cameron {{directed}} {{an attraction}} at Universal Studios Theme Parks, titled T2 3-D: Battle Across Time, which saw {{the return of}} Schwarzenegger, Hamilton, Patrick, and Furlong to their respective roles.

The attraction opened in the Universal Studios Florida in mid-1996, with additional venues <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Universal Studios Hollywood in May 1999, and the Universal Studios Japan in March 2001.|$|E

Through its first Sunday, the film earned an opening-weekend total of $64.1 million, making China's opening the largest for the film, followed by a $23.1 million opening in Russia and the CIS, and a $21.2 million <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK, Ireland and Malta. With total earnings reaching $124 million, it was the highest-grossing American film in China in 2013, {{and the country is}} the film's highest-grossing market after North America, followed by South Korea ($64.2 million) and the UK, Ireland and Malta ($57.1 million).|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bone) is located relatively high {{and before the}} p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the jaw and anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. The surfaces of the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel {{along the length of}} the tooth.|$|E
5|$|In the {{mandible}}, {{the mental}} foramen, an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mandible {{just before the}} first molar, opens to the outside, not upwards as in a few other oryzomyines.

They bring him to a hotel where Scully notices an additional wound on Kevin's side. Scully becomes upset at Mulder for his unwillingness to accept {{the possibility of a}} miracle. As they talk, Gates breaks into the bathroom, kidnapping Kevin by prying an <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barred window. Scully returns to see Kevin's father but finds him heavily drugged.|$|E
5|$|Moonraker premiered on 26 June 1979, in the Odeon Leicester Square, United Kingdom, {{grossing}} $70,308,099 in the UK. Three {{days after}} the UK release, it went on general release in the US, opening in 788 cinemas. On the mainland of Europe, the most common month of release was in August 1979, <b>opening</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway, Iceland and Sweden between 13 and 18 August. Given that the film was produced largely in France, and it involved some notable French actors, the French premiere for the film was relatively late, released in that country on 10 October 1979. Moonraker grossed a worldwide total of $210,300,000.|$|E
