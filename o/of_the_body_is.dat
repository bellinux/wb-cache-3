5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{from the}} Linga Purana {{says that the}} {{embracing}} of love-struck Shiva and Mohini led to be their merging into one body. At this moment, Mohini became Vishnu again, resulting the composite deity Harihara, whose right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> Shiva and left side is Vishnu in his male form. In the temple in Sankarnayinarkovil near Kalugumalai {{is one of the}} rarest exceptions to iconography of Harihara (Sankara-Narayana). The deity is depicted similar to the Ardhanari, the composite form of Shiva-Parvati, where right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> the male Shiva and left side is female. This image's female side represents Mohini and it, as a whole, symbolizes the union of Shiva and Mohini. The influence of Shakta traditions on Shaiva ones may have {{led to the development of}} composite images like Harihara, where Vishnu is identified with Shiva's consort, or Mohini. Like the Kanda Puranam narrative, the Shaiva saint Appar identifies Vishnu as Parvati (Uma), the female counterpart of Shiva.|$|E
50|$|Different {{religions}} and cultures have various funeral rites that accompany <b>the</b> disposal <b>of</b> a <b>body.</b> Some require that all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>are</b> buried together.

5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short bodice (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The lower half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E
5|$|In the female, the pilus dentilis, a sensory organ on the {{chelicera}} (mouthpart), is serrate, not {{smooth as}} in A.gymnuromys. The idiosoma (main part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body)</b> <b>is</b> 630 to 670μm long and 370 to 435μm wide and the dorsal shield (covering the upper side) is 620 to 655μm long and 360 to 370μm wide. The dorsal setae (bristles) are long relative to A.gymnuromys. The sternal shield (on the lower side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body)</b> <b>is</b> 115 to 125μm long and 184 to 200μm wide {{and is more}} ornamented than in A.gymnuromys. Unlike A.eliurus, A.voalavo lacks distinct sternal glands (secretory organs) between the lyrifissures (sensory organs) iv1 and iv2 on the lower {{side of the body}}. The other shields on the lower side of the body are the genitoventral shield (232 to 253 by 170 to 182μm), the peritrematic shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm), and the anal shield (140 to 147 by 117 to 127μm). On the soft part of the cuticle, there are nine pairs of setae. The first segments of the legs, the coxae, lack hooks. On the coxae of the third pair of legs, the setae at the back are spur-like.|$|E
5|$|The Prana (breath, vital air) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> {{dispersed}} {{within and}} outside the body. The first aim of yoga is to become aware and control this vital air, to be equal to or lower than the inner fire within one's body. This inner fire resides in the middle part of the body, and he calls it the Nabhi (center) and a Chakra. This is the residence of the Jiva, and the vital air nourishes it from below while one is alive. Just above this Nabhi is the kundalini which normally is dormant. Yoga awakens her, by bringing vital air and heat to her.|$|E

5|$|The {{skin of a}} larva is mottled with black, brown, {{and yellow}} pigmentation. Skin color changes as the larvae develop and pigment cells migrate and {{concentrate}} in {{different regions of the}} body. The pigment cells, called chromatophores, are derived from the neural crest. The three types of pigment chromatophores in salamanders include yellow xanthophores, black melanophores, and silvery iridiophores (or guanophores). As the larvae mature, the melanophores concentrate along the body and provide the darker background. The yellow xanthophores arrange along the spine and on top of the limbs. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> flecked with reflective iridiophores along the sides and underneath.|$|E

5|$|As an {{adaptation}} for navigating its complex reef environment, the epaulette shark moves by seemingly walking, bending its body from side-to-side and pushing {{off of the}} substrate with its paddle-shaped pectoral and pelvic fins. Its gait {{is similar to that}} of salamanders, an example of convergent evolution. The shark is capable of swimming, but often prefers to walk along the sandy or coral bottom even when the water is deep enough to allow it to swim freely. The cartilaginous supports of the epaulette shark's paired fins are reduced and separated when compared to other sharks, allowing them to be rotated for use as limbs. This mode of locomotion even enables the shark to crawl out of the water to access isolated tidal pools. The gait of the epaulette shark is convergently similar to those of tetrapods such as salamanders, suggesting that the movements needed for walking on land may predate, and facilitated the evolution of, the first terrestrial vertebrates. Epaulette sharks are largely nocturnal and are most active in low water. They often hide inside or below coral heads, though it is enough for the head to be covered even if the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> exposed. Sometimes they perch in the open on sandy flats or atop reefs facing into the current, a form of orientation known as rheotaxis that may improve respiration or predator awareness.|$|E

5|$|Counter-illumination through {{bioluminescence}} on {{the underside}} (ventral region) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> found in many species {{that live in the}} open ocean down to about 1000 metres. The generated light increases an animal's brightness when seen from below to match the brightness of the ocean surface; it is an effective form of active camouflage. It is notably used by some species of squid, such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. These have light-producing organs (photophores) scattered all over their undersides, creating a sparkling glow that prevents the animal from appearing as a dark shape when seen from below. Counter-illumination camouflage is the likely function of the bioluminescence of many marine organisms, though light is also produced to attract or to detect prey and for signalling.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} (Podiceps nigricollis), known in North America as the eared grebe, {{is a member}} of the grebe family of water birds. It was {{described}} in 1831 by Christian Ludwig Brehm. There are currently three accepted subspecies, including the nominate subspecies. Its breeding plumage features a distinctive ochre-coloured plumage that extends behind its eye and over its ear coverts. The rest of the upper parts, including the head, neck, and breast, are coloured black to blackish brown. The flanks are tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut, and the abdomen is white. When in its non-breeding plumage, this bird has greyish-black upper parts, including the top of the head and a vertical stripe on the back of the neck. The flanks are also greyish-black. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> a white or whitish colour. The juvenile has more brown in its darker areas. The subspecies californicus can be distinguished from the nominate by the former's usually longer bill. The other subspecies, P. n. gurneyi, can be differentiated by its greyer head and upper parts and by its smaller size. P. n. gurneyi can also be told apart by its lack of a non-breeding plumage. This species is present in parts of Africa, Eurasia, and the Americas.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottom end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the {{animal in the}} tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of}} the body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside and slightly to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside and slightly below the lophophore.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> yin {{and yang}} is also {{applicable}} to the human body; for example, <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and <b>the</b> back <b>are</b> assigned to yang, while <b>the</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>are</b> believed to have the yin character. Yin and yang characterization also extends to <b>the</b> various <b>body</b> functions, and – more importantly – to disease symptoms (e.g., cold and heat sensations {{are assumed to be}} {{yin and yang}} symptoms, respectively). Thus, yin and yang <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>are</b> seen as phenomena whose lack (or over-abundance) comes with characteristic symptom combinations: ...|$|R

5|$|The Eastern small footed bat {{is between}} 65 and 95millimeters in length, has a {{wingspan}} of 210 to 250millimeters, and weighs between 4 and 8grams. The bat {{got its name}} from its abnormally small hind feet, which are only 7 to 8 millimeters long. The fur on the dorsal side of their body is dark at the roots, and fades to a light brown at the tips, which gives the bats a signature shiny, yellow-brown appearance. The fur on the dorsal side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> a dull gray color, which is believed to help camouflage themselves in their hibernacula. The defining characteristic of this bat is its face-mask, which is completely black. They also have black ears, wings and interfemoral membrane, (the membrane between the legs and tail). Like all bats, the Eastern small-footed bat has a patagium that connects the body to the forelimbs and tail, allowing the animal to fly. Their head is very flat and short, with a forehead that slopes gradually away from the rostrum, a feature that is unique to other individuals in the Myotis species. They have erect ears, which are very broad at the base and a short flat nose. They have a keeled calcar (protruding cartridge on the hind legs to support the interfemoral membrane) {{as well as a}} pointed tragus Their tail is between 25-45 millimeters in length and protrudes past their interfemoral membrane, and they have a dental formula of 2/3, 1/1, 3/3, 3/3.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A black spot, {{the location of the}} supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> sense <b>of</b> {{embodiment}} {{is vital}} for self recognition. An examination of anosognosia for hemiplegia—the inability to recognise that one is paralysed down one side <b>of</b> one’s body—suggests <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> ‘online’ and ‘offline’ representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Online representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>are</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> as it <b>is</b> currently, are newly constructed moment by moment and are directly “plugged into” current perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> In contrast, offline representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>are</b> representations <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> usually like, are relatively stable and are constructed from online representations. This distinction is supported by an analysis of phantom limb—the feeling that an amputated limb is still present—phenomena. Initially it seems that <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> embodiment may arise from either {{of these types of}} representation; however, an integrated representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> seems to <b>be</b> required. It is suggested information from vision and emotions is involved in generating these representations. A lack of access to online representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> does not necessarily lead to a loss in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> embodiment.
