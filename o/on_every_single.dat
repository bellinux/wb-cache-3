5|$|In December 2013, Burger King {{returned}} to Finland after {{three decades of}} absence. The first restaurant, located on Mannerheimintie in central Helsinki, instantly proved so popular that for every day since its opening, people have had to queue {{in front of the}} restaurant to get in, sometimes for over half an hour. The only exception so far has been Christmas time, when the restaurant was closed. According to Mikko Molberg, the leader of the Finnish Burger King franchise, the restaurant has attracted over 2000 customers <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> day, which has surprised the restaurant employees and the franchise owners. The long queues have been extensively covered and ridiculed in social media, comparing them to people queuing in front of a McDonald's restaurant in Moscow, Russia in the early 1990s, and contrasting them with the nearly nonexistent queues to Burger King restaurants in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans.

2500|$|Inspiration and {{influences}} {{for the creation}} process was largely influenced by three main factors. The first was a 2 month cross-country road trip Patrick took prior to recording. Patrick found himself disgusted with the commercialization and homogenization of American culture, stating that he found himself [...] "...sick and tired of seeing McDonald's, Burger King, Subway, <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> street." [...] The reaction even led to the naming of the album; with The Amalgamut being a neologism of a portmanteau of [...] "amalgam" [...] and [...] "mutt", with Patrick feeling that ultimately there should be [...] "more focus on abstract thought and individualism, as opposed to everybody {{trying to be the}} same." [...] Conversely, Patrick stated the album title had more positive connotations as well, with Patrick stating that he saw, through interacting with actual people, that America was, in fact, a melting pot of different races and origins, and that the term Amalgamut was also [...] "a celebration of freedom".|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} strike was limited in other ways as well. In Auto Parts Co., the {{employer}} had multiple work sites. The union struck one work site, and a union member from another work site refused to cross the picket line. Section 8(b)(4)(A) of the act appeared to protect an employee's right to refuse to cross a picket line. But the Farmer board said that Section 8(b)(4)(A) only meant that refusal to cross the picket line was not a union ULP. Section 8(b)(4)(A) did not bar an employer from lawfully terminating the worker. Then, in two cases, the Farmer board limited when a union could strike during its collective bargaining agreement. In several decisions by the NLRB in the late 1940s, the board had held that unions generally could not strike during {{the life of the}} collective bargaining agreement. However, as the contract came close to expiring, the union could strike after presenting its bargaining demands—so long as it observed a 60-day [...] "cooling off" [...] period between making the demand and striking. The Farmer board overturned these decisions in Wilson & Co., and Lion Oil Company. The majority said that, {{in the absence of a}} clause allowing the sides to re-open the contract during the life of the agreement, no strikes were permitted. [...] Although neither collective bargaining agreement contained a no-strike clause, the majority effectively imposed one <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> collective bargaining agreement in the United States. The board's ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court in National Labor Relations Board v. Lion Oil Company.|$|E
60|$|In the few {{following}} pages I propose {{to point out}} {{as rapidly as possible}} that <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>single</b> one of the matters most strongly insisted on by liberalisers of theology their effect upon social practice would be definitely illiberal. Almost every contemporary proposal to bring freedom into the church is simply a proposal to bring tyranny into the world. For freeing the church now does not even mean freeing it in all directions. It means freeing that peculiar set of dogmas loosely called scientific, dogmas of monism, of pantheism, or of Arianism, or of necessity. And every one of these (and we will take them one by one) can be shown to be the natural ally of oppression. In fact, it is a remarkable circumstance (indeed not so very remarkable when one comes to think of it) that most things are the allies of oppression. There is only one thing that can never go past a certain point in its alliance with oppression--and that is orthodoxy. I may, it is true, twist orthodoxy so as partly to justify a tyrant. But I can easily make up a German philosophy to justify him entirely.|$|E
