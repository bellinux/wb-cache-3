5000|$|Logic level {{independent}} of loss - In optical communication, the signal intensity decreases over distance due to absorption {{of light in}} the fiber optic cable. Therefore, a simple intensity threshold cannot distinguish between on and <b>off</b> <b>signals</b> for arbitrary length interconnects. The system must encode zeros and ones at different frequencies, use differential signaling where the ratio or difference in two different powers carries the logic signal to avoid errors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic process}} is {{described}} in [...] As {{shown in figure 1}} from the patent, a digital AC monitor is attached to the single-phase power going into a residence. Changes in the voltage and current are measured (i.e. admittance measurement unit), normalized (scaler) and recorded (net change detector unit). A cluster analysis is then performed to identify when different appliances are turned on and off. If a 60-watt bulb is turned on, for example, followed by a 100-watt bulb being turned on, followed by the 60-watt bulb being turned off followed by the 100-watt bulb being turned off, the NALM unit will match the on and <b>off</b> <b>signals</b> from the 60-watt bulb and the on and <b>off</b> <b>signals</b> from the 100-watt bulb to determine how much power was used by each bulb and when. The system is sufficiently sensitive that individual 60-watt bulbs can be discriminated due to the normal variations in actual power draw of bulbs with the same nominal rating (e.g. one bulb might draw 61 watts, another 62 watts).|$|R

50|$|Discrete signals {{behave as}} binary switches, {{yielding}} simply an On or <b>Off</b> <b>signal</b> (1 or 0, True or False, respectively). Push buttons, limit switches, and photoelectric sensors {{are examples of}} devices providing a discrete signal. Discrete signals are sent using either voltage or current, where a specific range is designated as On and another as Off. For example, a PLC might use 24 V DC I/O, with values above 22 V DC representing On, values below 2VDC representing Off, and intermediate values undefined. Initially, PLCs had only discrete I/O.|$|E
50|$|Green's Lodge Battery is in Gibraltar, the British Overseas Territory at the {{southern}} end of the Iberian Peninsula. The artillery battery is located more than 1,000 feet up the North Face of the Rock of Gibraltar, at the northern end of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, above Farringdon's Battery and adjacent to Ministry of Defence property. Also referred to as the Superior Battery, the emplacement is positioned at the end of the Green's Lodge Nature Trail, <b>off</b> <b>Signal</b> Station Road. Green's Lodge Nature Trail is more formally referred to as Green's Lodge Road, although it bears little resemblance to a road in its current state.|$|E
5000|$|Using unorthodox {{tactics and}} a major storm to offset their huge {{technological}} disadvantage, Dodge and his crew achieve their first objective by sneaking in to Charleston Harbor and setting <b>off</b> <b>signal</b> flares. Now desperate to defeat Dodge, Graham cuts the war game containment area in half without Winslow's authorization. Failing in their first attempt at Norfolk Harbor, Dodge leaves the reduced containment area and heads out to sea. Irate at this lapse in protocol, the always strident and by-the-book Pascal (for whom the crew has no respect) attempts to take command of the Stingray; the crew does not supports his action.

40|$|Endocytic {{downregulation}} is {{a pivotal}} mechanism turning <b>off</b> <b>signalling</b> from the EGF receptor (EGFR). It {{is well established}} that whereas EGF binding leads to lysosomal degradation of EGFR, transforming growth factor (TGF) -α causes receptor recycling. TGF-α therefore leads to continuous signalling and is a more potent mitogen than EGF. In addition to EGF and TGF-α, five EGFR ligands have been identified. Although many of these ligands are upregulated in cancers, very {{little is known about}} their effect on EGFR trafficking...|$|R

50|$|Governor's Lookout Battery {{is located}} <b>off</b> <b>Signal</b> Station Road within the Upper Rock Nature Reserve on the Rock of Gibraltar {{which is the}} likely site of former Governor of Gibraltar General George Augustus Eliott's {{observation}} post during the Great Siege of Gibraltar (1779-83). The battery had a commanding view of the Bay of Gibraltar {{to the west and}} Spain to the north and was originally built to take one 9.2 inch breechloading gun Mk VI to bear on both the land batteries in Spain and out over the Bay at a range of 10,000 yd. In 1886 it mounted one 9 inch rifled muzzle-loading gun (RML). By July 1904 the battery was intended to carry four 9.2 inch breechloading guns Mk IV but one Mk X on a Mk V mounting was installed instead. The last gun was removed in 1940, during World War II.|$|E
50|$|The {{multi-mode}} switch {{consists of}} three settings: <b>Off,</b> <b>Signal,</b> and On. When the switch is set to Signal, the user is able to press and hold a button located just above the switch to turn the light on, and it will switch off again when the button is released. This allows users to signal using Morse code. When the switch is moved up to the On position, the flashlight remains on without any further user interaction. The modern MX-991/U also features a switch guard which was not present in previous variants as issued in the Vietnam War. The switch guard was suggested as an improvement from soldiers during the war, and later added to prevent unintentional operation of the flashlight. This helped to prevent soldiers from accidentally giving their position away in the dark should equipment, clothing etc press the signal button or move the switch.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{interesting}} to note that there have been some findings suggesting the possibility of crosstalk between GAPs. A recent study showed that the p120Ras GAP could bind the DLC1 Rho GAP at its catalytic domain. The binding of the Ras GAP to the Rho GAP inhibits the activity of the Rho GAP, thereby activating the Rho G protein. [...] One GAP serves as a negative regulator of another GAP. The reasons for such cross-regulation across GAPs are yet unclear, but one possible hypothesis is that this cross-talk across GAPs attenuates the [...] "off" [...] signal of all the GAPs. Although the p120Ras GAP is active, therefore inhibiting that particular pathway, other cellular processes can still continue because it inhibits other GAPs. This may ensure that the whole system does not shut down from a single <b>off</b> <b>signal.</b> GAP activity is highly dynamic, interacting with many other components of signaling pathways.|$|E
50|$|Davanloo noted, {{in concert}} with Malan's Triangle of Conflict, that {{patients}} would unconsciously resist the therapist's efforts {{to get to the}} root of their difficulties. He also observed, from his videotaped sessions, that patients would simultaneously send <b>off</b> <b>signals</b> of their unconscious anxiety. Davanloo carefully monitored these signals of anxiety and saw that they represented the rise of complex mixed feelings with the therapist. The mix represented that part of the patient seeking relief from painful symptoms but also an active desire to avoid painful, repressed feelings.|$|R
5000|$|The Toll/interleukin-1 {{receptor}} (TIR) homology domain is an intracellular signaling domain {{found in}} MyD88, interleukin-1 receptor, Toll receptor and many plant R proteins. It contains three highly conserved regions, and mediates protein-protein {{interactions between the}} Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and signal-transduction components. TIR-like motifs are also found in plant proteins thought {{to be involved in}} resistance to disease. When activated, TIR domains recruit cytoplasmic adaptor proteins MyD88 (UniProt [...] ) and TOLLIP (Toll interacting protein, UniProt [...] ). In turn, these associate with various kinases to set <b>off</b> <b>signaling</b> cascades.|$|R
50|$|A notable {{difference}} in medical practice {{is a result}} of the lack of squeamishness displayed by the Barast. Rather than using anesthesia for surgery, this technology uses direct neural blocks to cut <b>off</b> <b>signals</b> from any body part being operated on while the operation is performed in full view of the doctor and the patient being operated on. The Barast do not find this disturbing in the least, which one Gliksin theorizes is because, as they are still a civilization completely composed of active hunters, they have been exposed to such scenes since childhood.|$|R

40|$|Today's energy {{production}} is changing from scheduled to intermittent generation {{due to the}} increasing energy injection from renewable sources. This alteration requires flexibility in energy generation and demand. Electric heat pumps and thermal storages {{were found to have}} a large potential to provide demand flexibility which is analysed in this work. A three-fold method is set up to generate thermal load profiles, to simulate heat pump pools and to assess heat pump flexibility. The thermal profile generation based on a combination of physical and behavioural models is successfully validated against measurement data. A randomised system sizing procedure was implemented for the simulation of heat pump pools. The parameter randomisation yields correct seasonal performance factors, full load hours and average operation cycles per day compared to 87 monitored systems. The flexibility assessment analysis the electric load deviation of representative heat pump pool in response to 5 different on / <b>off</b> <b>signals.</b> The flexibility is induced by the capacity of thermal storages and analysed by four parameters. Generally, on signals are more powerful than <b>off</b> <b>signals.</b> A generic assessment by the ambient temperature yield that the flexibility is highest for heating days and the activated additional space heating storage: Superheating of the storage to the maximal temperature provides a flexible energy of more than 400 kWh per 100 heat pumps in a temperature range between - 10 and + 13 °C...|$|R
25|$|MOSFET analog {{switches}} use the MOSFET to pass {{analog signals}} when on, {{and as a}} high impedance when <b>off.</b> <b>Signals</b> flow in both directions across a MOSFET switch. In this application, the drain and source of a MOSFET exchange places depending on the relative voltages of the source/drain electrodes. The source is the more negative side for an N-MOS or the more positive side for a P-MOS. All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate–source, gate–drain and source–drain voltages; exceeding the voltage, current, or power limits will potentially damage the switch.|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Several {{approaches}} to three-dimensional integration of {{conventional electronic circuits}} have been pursued recently. To determine whether the advantages of optical interconnections are negated by these advances, we compare the limitations of fully three-dimensional systems interconnected with optical, normally conducting, repeatered normally conducting, and superconducting interconnections by showing how system-level parameters such as signal delay, bandwidth, and number of computing elements are related. In particular, we show that the duty ratio of pulses transmitted on terminated transmission lines is an important optimization parameter {{that can be used}} to trade <b>off</b> <b>signal</b> delay and bandwidth so as to optimize applicable measures of performance or cost, such as minimum message delay in parallel computation. © 1999 Optical Society of Americ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{scheme for}} sliding-mode control (SMC) of DC-DC {{converters}} with a constant switching frequency is proposed.

In order to improve the dynamic characteristics of the reaching phase and to alleviate chattering, the second approach called reaching law SMC is also presented.

40|$|An {{important}} feature of many chronic parasitic infections {{is the ability of}} the invading pathogen and host to establish a compromise, which ensures successful parasitism without killing the infected host. For many helminth infections, down-modulating the immune response is critical because persistent inflammation can become more damaging to the host than the invading pathogen itself. Such is the case with schistosomiasis mansoni, where chronic granulomatous inflammation in the liver causes portal hypertension, porto-pulmonary shunting, bleeding from collateral bypass vessels, and eventual death if not suppressed effectively. CD 4 + T helper type 2 cells (Th 2) (secreting IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13) characterize the host response after Schistosoma mansoni infection, and recent studies have identified IL- 13 as the principal mediator of hepatic fibrosis. Here, we show that the IL- 13 receptor α 2 (IL- 13 Rα 2) is a critical mediator of immune down-modulation, identifying the receptor as a life-sustaining <b>off</b> <b>signal</b> for chronic and pernicious inflammation in schistosomiasis...|$|E
