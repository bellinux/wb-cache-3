50|$|Much {{suspense}} {{was built}} around the devastation that Hurricane Ivan had caused {{as the leader of}} Government business Mr. Mckeeva Bush decided to close the Islands to any and all reporters, aid and denied permissions to land any aircraft except for Cayman Airways. The line of people wishing to leave but unable to do so because of his actions extended from the airport to the post office each day as thousands stranded with no shelter, food, or fresh water hoped for a chance to evacuate. As a result, most evacuations and the mass exodus which ensued in the aftermath was done so by private charter through personal & Corporate expense, with or without official permission. It was also a collective decision within the government at that time to turn away two British warships that had arrived the day after the storm with supplies. This decision was met by outrage from the Islanders who thought that it should have been their decision to make. Power and water was cut off due to damaged pipes and destroyed utility poles, with all utilities restored to various areas {{over the course of the}} next three months. Fortis Inc., a Canadian-owned utility company, sent a team down to Grand Cayman to assist the local power company, CUC, with restoration. The official report, extent of damage, duration and recovery efforts in the words <b>of</b> <b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush</b> himself are first recorded a month following to the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs Written Evidence, Letter from the Cayman Islands Government Office in the United Kingdom, 8 October 2004.|$|E

40|$|David Bowman on John Pilger and the Daily Mirror’s American {{shareholder}} IT WAS {{a headline}} in the Age last April Fool’s Day that caught the eye at the time: "Foreign ownership of media not important, says Alston. " 	 What a wizard sense of humour, I thought. But in fact Senator Alston seemed to be serious. The Communications Minister was saying, according to the Age, that Australians would not notice any change if, under proposed new ownership rules, foreigners bought our television stations and newspapers. And indeed there’s {{a good deal of}} truth in that, which makes it a very good reason not, repeat not, to open up the mass media to foreign ownership. Open up, and, true, people might not notice much or even any change. But difference of a kind nevertheless would exist. It might best be described as a latent difference. An influential mass-circulation newspaper under foreign ownership is vulnerable to decisions involving policy, made at critical times from a foreign perspective, by people who at root may have not only a business interest but a wider political or social agenda of their own. Should more of them be allowed to put their oar into our political boat? Something happened last month that throws more light on this business of foreign ownership. It should be seen, I think, as a warning that the Communications Minister was either a fool or a propagandist last April, if that Age report was accurate. It may be best to tell the story chronologically; it is the tale of a British newspaper offending a shareholder in America. THE London Daily Mirror is a tabloid, partly owned by American capital, with a circulation over two million, which in its 99 years has seen both greatness and wretched times. John Pilger came to fame there, in days when it was a serious popular tabloid. A few months ago, 15 years after his time, the Mirror revived the serious high days, turning again to John Pilger to contribute campaigning journalism of quality. Now the story begins. On 4 July, the Daily Mirror published an enormously powerful front page. George W. Bush stood centre, exhibiting a kind of pride and reverence, and flanked by huge American flags. The sledgehammer headline said MOURN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. In large type above Mr Bush, these words appeared: George W. Bush’s policy of bomb first and find out later has killed double the number of civilians who died on 11 September. The USA is now the world’s leading rogue state. These sentiments came from the related Pilger article, in which casualty figures were based on a study carried out at the University of New Hampshire. The article was a full-blooded assault on the actions and policies of "the Bush gang" in Afghanistan and beyond; "gang", according to the Pilger dictionary, being "a group of people working together for criminal, disreputable ends". That, said Mr Pilger, described accurately Mr Bush and those who wrote his speeches and made his decisions and who, since their rise to power, had undermined the very basis of international law. He wrote of "the systematic, murderous way" the US military has operated in Afghanistan, and the apparent failure to round up Al Qaeda leaders; of the Bush strategy to "stabilise" Afghanistan for American oil and other strategic interests; of US military bases established to fight the war against terrorism, {{and at the same time}} reportedly following the route of a projected pipeline carrying Asian oil to the Indian Ocean; of the seeming Bush objective of ordering the world around the requirements of US monopoly capital, and the strategy for that. He concluded with an Orwellian view of such a world. The only way to resist "such rogue power", he said, was by speaking out now. WOULD any of our mainstream press have published the Pilger article? Not utterly unthinkable. On July 3, the Sydney Morning Herald carried an edited extract from the new Pilger book, The New Rulers of the World, describing the "war on terrorism" as "the great charade", in reality the return journey of imperialism to respectability. This too was a trenchant piece. The Advertiser, to its credit, carried a 200 -word news report from London of the Daily Mirror article of July 4, but nothing of the American reaction. That sequel is the point of the following account, which draws on an article by Roy Greenslade of the London Guardian. In Greenslade’s view, the material in Pilger’s article could not come close to being published in a mainstream American paper. He recalled the immortal words of Corporal Jones of Dad’s Army (who, I seem to remember, was discussing the finer points of bayoneting) : "They don’t like it up ‘em, sir, they don’t like it one bit". The editor-in-chief of the very conservative Washington Times, which is owned by the Unification Church (the Moonies), described the Mirror as "a shrill tabloid read by London’s lip-readers, soccer hooligans and other mutants". John Pilger was a "distinguished war correspondent" who "speaks for a lot of the bad-breath left in Old Blighty". Rupert Murdoch’s New York Post called the Mirror "a terrorist-loving London tabloid", and paraded a two-year-old share-dealing embarrassment involving the editor, Piers Morgan. According to the New York Press, an on-line publication, the July 4 issue was "a filthy document", and the article "bilge". The extreme sensitivity accords with John Pilger’s reading as a visitor of the American mood, with the mainstream media mostly too busy saluting the flag to question where the flag might be leading them. It should surprise no one, though perhaps it will, that in this atmosphere there should have been a reaction from an American shareholder in the Mirror company. WHEN Tom Shrager, fund manager with an American investment company, rang Philip Graf, chief executive of Trinity-Mirror, which owns the Mirror, it was to complain forthrightly that his company was very unhappy that the Mirror should have published John Pilger’s piece. Later, questioned by Roy Greenslade, Mr Shrager said he had simply wanted to register his disappointment about the Daily Mirror’s coverage to its owners. He had begun by telling Mr Graf that he was strongly committed to freedom of the press, but that this freedom depended on its being used responsibly and fairly. He said (Mr Greenslade reported), "The Mirror wasn’t fair and wasn’t accurate". Mr Graf is not merely an investor watching the business performance of the company. He holds political views, or acts for someone who does. Clearly, the purpose of his call must have been not merely to complain, but to achieve at the least a less critical coverage in future of Bush policies as they affect the rest of the world. 		 What did Trinity-Mirror think of this? Mr Graf would not discuss the Shrager call. A senior executive said, "This is a very delicate matter". Indeed. The owner of a major British newspaper is being asked by an American investor to tone down what the paper publishes in a matter of enormous importance to the British. Perhaps Mr Shrager expected or hoped that Mr Graf would have a word with the editor. Mr Shrager did not threaten to sell any stock. His company holds a 4 per cent stake in Trinity-MIrror. It is one of three New York investment companies that together hold 31 per cent. If they felt inclined to act in concert, serious things might happen. 	 The Mirror editor has promised to go on publishing Pilger articles critical <b>of</b> <b>Mr</b> <b>Bush.</b> He said they shouldn’t be construed as anti-American. THERE is no reason to suppose that Mr Shrager is the first foreign investor to try to affect the editorial direction of a newspaper in the interests of a foreign government, or for some other significant purpose. Human nature being as it is, interference of this kind is inevitable. It is a form of corruption, it carries peculiar dangers, and newspapers are too influential in public life for it to be tolerated in any democracy with a shred of national pride. The public knows this - opinion polls are heavily against foreign ownership of the media - but it is the politicians, anxious to placate the businessmen controlling the major media, who in this country want to throw our media wide open to foreign investment. Senator Alston, like most members of the Howard cabinet, is besotted with the idea, and Labor is soft in that direction. A huge slab of our major press is already foreign-owned, through the Murdochs. If you were President Bush, and uncertain of Australian support in some adventure ahead, would you not consider a lunch with Rupert Murdoch to suggest that his Australian papers might help? Oh, it would be in Australia’s interests, of course it would be in Australia’s interests. Mr Murdoch might already have decided as much; but then he might not. He might just have been awaiting a timely prompt. Advocates of foreign ownership try to meet this argument, if they address it at all, by saying foreign owners know that should they misuse their papers they would lose circulation and fail as a business. Such nonsense that is; these things are done in a very careful way. The chance that Senator Alston will succeed in opening up foreign ownership seems, along with his other plans for change, quite dim for the moment. But only public vigilance can stop the politicians and the media businessmen from eventually demolishing, climbing over or marching around whatever barriers impede their purposes and their ambitions. Their self-interest never sleeps; public interest wakes from time to time. • David Bowman is a former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald.
