5|$|Almost every {{episode of}} Dexter's Laboratory {{is divided into}} three {{different}} stories/segments, each one being approximately 8 minutes in length. Occasionally, the middle segment centered on characters from the Dexter's Laboratory universe other than Dexter and his family. Two of these segments were shown primarily during the first season: Dial M for Monkey and The Justice Friends. Dial M for Monkey was the middle segment for the first six episodes of season <b>one,</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Justice Friends took its place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E

The anamorphic state of S.occidentalis is Molliardiomyces occidentalis, described by John W. Paden. This form produces smooth, colorless conidiophores (specialized stalks that bear conidia) measuring 20–230 by 2–3.2µm. The conidia are roughly spherical to , smooth, translucent (hyaline), and 4.6–7.0 by 3.0–3.8µm.|$|E
5|$|Bitter {{for having}} nothing left but a pot, the son {{closes the door}} on every person who asks for his help. Each time he does so, the pot takes on the {{symptoms}} of the ones who ask for help, it starts disturbing the son and prevents him from having any peace of mind. This continues until the son finally gives up and provides aid to the town. Upon doing this, the pot's ailments are removed one by <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> son's ordeal finally ends one day when the slipper he received from his father falls out of the pot; he puts the slipper on the pot's foot and the two walk off into the sunset.|$|E

The game received backslash from users on Steam, {{due to the}} excessive amount of DLC sold on day <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> game for being overpriced.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the original, Thompson {{returned}} to Nanny McPhee with 2010's Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang. Her screenplay transported the story to Britain during the Second World War, and incorporated a new cast including Maggie Gyllenhaal. Building on the first film's success, it was another UK box office number <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sequel was widely seen as an improvement. The same year, Thompson reunited with Alan Rickman for the BBC television film The Song of Lunch, which focused on two unnamed characters meeting at a restaurant 15 years after ending their relationship. Thompson's performance earned her a fourth Emmy Award nomination.|$|E

5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by setting in train {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and {{medicine}} were <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E
5|$|Imelda's Blue Ladies—specifically Maria Luisa, a {{daughter}} of the rich Madrigal family and the wife of Dr. Vasquez—contributed to the fashion spending of Imelda. In 1968, Maria Luisa accompanied Imelda on an overseas trip, during which Imelda and daughter Imee spent $3.3 million. It was also {{at this time that}} Dr. Daniel Vasquez and Maria Luisa opened a Citibank account. On November of the same year, the couple added Fernanda Vazquez as a joint holder of the bank account. An allegation that Imelda and Fernanda Vasquez are <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same is validated {{by the fact that the}} notations for the bank account had Imelda Marcos's handwriting.|$|E

5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{wrote that}} some Han thinkers {{believed}} that rain {{fell from the}} Heavens (i.e. where the stars were located). Wang argued that, although rain fell from above, this common theory was false. He agreed with another theory that stated clouds were formed by the evaporation of water on earth, and that since clouds disperse rain, clouds and rain are in fact <b>one</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same; in essence, he accurately described the water cycle.|$|E
5|$|Labor {{remained}} the largest party in Parliament, but lost the two-party preferred vote at 49.2% and saw its numbers decrease from 26 to 23. The LCL held 20 seats, the Liberal Movement two, the Country Party <b>one,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last remaining with an independent, the nominally Labor Mayor of Port Pirie, Ted Connelly. Dunstan appealed to Connelly and offered him {{the role of}} Speaker. However, the reforms to the Legislative Council's election bore fruit. Of the 11 seats up for election, Labor won six with 47.3% of the vote, and the LM two, allowing Labor a total of 10 seats. This meant they could now, {{with the help of}} the LM, push through reforms opposed by the Liberals.|$|E

5|$|Marble Madness is an {{isometric}} platform game {{in which}} the player manipulates an onscreen marble from a third-person perspective. The player controls the marble's movements with a trackball, though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads. The aim {{of the game is}} for the player to complete six maze-like, isometric race courses before a set amount of time expires. With the exception of the first race, any time left on the clock {{at the end of a}} race is carried over to the next <b>one,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player is granted a set amount of additional time as well. The game allows two players to compete against each other, awarding bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race; both players have separate clocks.|$|E

On March 4, 1984, the Sheepherders defeated the Fabulous Ones for the SWCW gold ending Keirn and Lane’s brief stay in Texas.|$|R
