5000|$|The {{right to}} use a {{copyright}} protected work may cover individual or all types <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> § 31 I 1 UrhG. The concept of “type of use” isn't defined by law. And there is no list featuring possibilities <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> From the wording of § 31 I 1 UrhG (“…einzelne oder alle…“, which means: “several or all”) it can be inferred that each type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> shows distinctive characteristics.A type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> must, thus, be clearly distinguishable from any other type <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> [...] For each type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> there is consequently a corresponding right <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> If there are several types <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in connection with their work, there will be, in proportion, various rights <b>of</b> <b>use</b> the author can grant. The types <b>of</b> <b>use</b> have changed and evolved {{in the course of}} technical development and they still continue to do so.The term “kind of use” refers to [...] "all technically and economically concretised utilisation of an author's work, meaning that the parties to a contract have specified the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the work as required for achieving the contractual purpose.The kinds <b>of</b> <b>use</b> listed in § 15 UrhG can be subdivided into several rights <b>of</b> <b>use</b> which again can be matched, each, with a corresponding type <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> so it is always possible to restrict a right <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in many different ways as long as the specification <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> work makes clear the individuality of the type <b>of</b> <b>use</b> with respect to its economic and technical content. So there is a possibility to control the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> one's work by specifying the types <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> thereby limiting the rights <b>of</b> <b>use.</b>|$|R

Ratings for frequency <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> fashion magazines, non-fashion magazines, catalogues, internet, television ads, celebrities, observed street-wear, and store displays were likewise summed and divided by eight to calculate a mean score for frequency <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> impersonal external information sources. Because <b>use</b> <b>of</b> oneself as an information source was measured with a single item on a 4 -point scale, no further calculations were necessary to achieve an overall score for frequency <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> internal information source.|$|R

5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters.

The idea <b>of</b> <b>using</b> boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here that the idea <b>of</b> <b>using</b> split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCivic mindedness and the {{perceptions}} of trustworthiness, usefulness, and ease <b>of</b> <b>use</b> seem to explain much <b>of</b> the effective <b>use</b> <b>of</b> websites. This article discusses {{the extent to which}} such factors influence the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> government websites based on a study with 210 citizens who were doing their biometric electoral registration in João Pessoa – a major city in Brazil. With the help of ordinary least squares and quantile regression models, we found that there is mixed influence of those factors on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> government websites. On average, perceived usefulness and perceived ease <b>of</b> <b>use</b> had a significant influence; but for low levels <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> only perceived usefulness had an influence, whereas perceived ease <b>of</b> <b>use</b> had an influence for moderate and high levels <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> In terms <b>of</b> trustworthiness, only the dimension about trust in government had an influence for all levels <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> In terms <b>of</b> civic mindedness, only the dimension about civic engagement had an influence, except for moderate levels <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> Our results reinforce that the development of government websites should focus on the citizens’ individual profiles and levels <b>of</b> <b>use,</b> that is, focus should be directed to the demand side (users) besides merely addressing the legal requirements and the provision of services by the supplier (government) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} software plasticity, i. e. {{the ability}} of interactive systems to adapt to context <b>of</b> <b>use</b> while preserving user-centered properties. In plasticity, a classical approach consists in concentrating design efforts {{on a set of}} pre-defined contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> that deserve high quality User Interfaces (UIs), and switching from one to another according to variations <b>of</b> context <b>of</b> <b>use</b> at runtime. However, key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> cannot be finely envisioned at design time, especially when dealing with the specific field of mobility. Thus, we propose a designer’s partner tool running on the end-user’s mobile device to probe key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> in the wild. The underlying principles are data gathering, bayesian learning, and clustering techniques. Probing key contexts <b>of</b> <b>use</b> can save design efforts...|$|R
40|$|A value's degree <b>of</b> <b>use</b> [...] -the number <b>of</b> dynamic <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> {{that value}} [...] -provides the most {{essential}} information needed to optimize its communication. We present simulation results demonstrating the properties <b>of</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> values, including their predictability: most static instructions generate values with few degrees <b>of</b> <b>use</b> and these exhibit temporal locality. We use these results to guide {{the design of a}} degree <b>of</b> <b>use</b> predictor. The development and detailed characterization of this predictor is the focus of this paper. Our predictor leverages future control flow information (e. g., branch predictions) to select among different possible degrees <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> We study the effects of several optimizations and variations in the predictor's algorithms to tune the predictor for maximum performance. The resulting predictor generates correct degree <b>of</b> <b>use</b> predictions for over 92 % of all dynamic values and has a misprediction rate below 2. 5 %. Such a predictor has a wide range of potential applications in optimizing value communication...|$|R
