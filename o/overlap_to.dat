5|$|As one road, NY14 and NY414 travel down Franklin Street, {{the main}} {{thoroughfare}} of Watkins Glen. The routes pass by several blocks of homes as {{they follow the}} western base of the ravine and meet {{the east end of}} NY329, which ascends the side of the valley to serve Watkins Glen State Park. NY414 continues to follow NY14 to Watkins Glen's central business district, where NY414 splits from the <b>overlap</b> <b>to</b> travel east at an intersection that also acts as the eastern terminus of NY409. From this point north, NY14 and NY414 follow opposite sides of Seneca Lake, with NY414 running along the east lake shore.|$|E
5|$|NY28N is {{classified}} as a rural major collector road, {{with the exception of}} the section that is overlapped with Route30, which {{is classified}} as a rural minor arterial road. As of 2006, the Route30 overlap had an annual average daily traffic of 1,781 vehicles. Traffic volumes are reduced to 1,231 vehicles per day from the end of the Route30 <b>overlap</b> <b>to</b> the intersection with Blue Ridge Road (CR84). South of this intersection, traffic is reduced further to 350 until the hamlet of Minerva, rising to 751 south of Minerva until near the Warren county line. Traffic increases back up to 1,248 vehicles per day from there to Route28 in North Creek.|$|E

The two routes <b>overlap</b> <b>to</b> Harrietstown, where NY30 splits from NY3 and heads north along a series of lakes, including Upper Saranac Lake and Meacham Lake. North of Duane, NY30 exits Adirondack Park and heads north towards Malone. Within the village, NY30 briefly overlaps US11. The Adirondack Trail ends at {{the east end of}} the overlap. The route continues north out of the village to the Canada–US border in Constable, where it becomes Route138 upon entering Quebec at the Trout River Border Crossing.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough <b>overlap</b> <b>to</b> forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
5|$|From 1930 to , the River Road {{section of}} NY251 {{overlapped}} with NY35, which initially entered Monroe County {{on the former}} routing of legislative Route15 and continued north to Rochester on current NY383. The southwestern end of NY35 was moved to Mumford , shifting {{the location of the}} <b>overlap</b> <b>to</b> Main Street in Scottsville. The concurrency was replaced with one with NY383 when it supplanted most of NY35 in the early 1940s. On July 1, 1977, NY251 was truncated to begin at the eastern end of its overlap with NY383 in Scottsville. The former routing of NY251 from the west end of the concurrency in Scottsville to Gates became an extension of NY386, which was a simple connector in northern Gates and southern Greece prior to the change.|$|E

By exposing an azeotrope to a vacuum or positive pressure, it's possible to bias {{the boiling point}} of one component {{away from the other}} by exploiting the differing vapour pressure curves of each; the curves may overlap at the azeotropic point, but are unlikely to be remain identical further along the pressure axis either side of the azeotropic point. When the bias is great enough, the two boiling points no longer overlap and so the azeotropic band disappears.|$|E

NY120 remains on a northwesterly alignment, however, and it crosses the Delaware Aqueduct prior to meeting NY22 (Mount Kisco Road) on the edge of another Kensico Reservoir inlet.

500|$|Three {{hundred and}} two {{aircraft}} from eight different airfields in the Moresby and Dobodura areas, made a rendezvous over Tsili Tsili at 10:07, flying through clouds, {{passes in the}} mountains, and over the top. [...] "Not a single squadron," [...] wrote General Kenney, [...] "did any circling or stalling around but all slid into place like clockwork and proceeded on the final flight down the Watut Valley, turned to the right down the Markham, and {{went directly to the}} target." [...] Leading the formation were 48 B-25s from the 38th and 345th Bombardment Groups whose job was to [...] "sanitise" [...] the drop zones by dropping their loads of sixty [...] fragmentation bombs and strafing with the eight [...]50-calibre machine guns mounted in their noses.

2500|$|Even {{though the}} lists <b>overlap</b> <b>to</b> {{a certain extent}} (five epithets are common to Macrobius's and Lydus's list), the {{explanations}} of the epithets differ remarkably. Macrobius's list and explanation are probably based directly on Cornelius Labeo's work, as he cites this author often in his Saturnalia, as when he gives a list of Maia's cult epithets [...] and mentions one of his works, Fasti. In relating Janus' epithets Macrobius states: [...] "We invoke in the sacred rites". Labeo himself, as it is stated in the passage on Maia, read them in the lists of indigitamenta of the libri pontificum. On the other hand, Lydus's authority cannot have consulted these documents precisely because he offers different (and sometimes bizarre) explanations for the common epithets: it seems likely he received a list with no interpretations appended and his interpretations are only his own.|$|E
