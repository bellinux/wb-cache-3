5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample {{were significantly more likely}} to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD <b>or</b> <b>DAD.</b> The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
500|$|The {{details of}} Angelou's life {{described}} in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles {{tended to be}} inconsistent. [...] Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and [...] "with no time chart in front of her". [...] For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified {{the number of times}} she had been married, [...] "for fear of sounding frivolous"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. [...] Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madame for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. [...] In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, [...] "I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I never did anything wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a pretty bad guy. My mom <b>or</b> <b>dad</b> never did anything wrong.' They can’t forgive themselves and go on with their lives".|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that lethal ventricular arrhythmias occur when a triggering event {{is able to}} propagate into elec-trophysiologically susceptible tissue. 1 Premature ventricular contractions are prototypical triggers in the myocardium and are thought to emerge from arrhythmogenic cellular events known as early and delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs <b>or</b> <b>DADs).</b> 2 DADs occur in the diastolic interval and result from Na+/Ca 2 + exchange (NCX) secondary to spontaneous sarco-plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca 2 + release (SCR). 3 In contrast, EADs initiate during action potential (AP) repolarization and involve complex dynamical interaction among the currents that remain available (or regain availability) late in the AP. 4 Humans and other large mammals exhibit ventricular APs with a prolonged plateau phase (≈ 100 – 200 ms) at slightly positive membrane potentials (E m). This imposes 2 key constraints on the inward currents capable of driving EADs in these species: (1) the fast sodium current (INa) is largely excluded as it remains entirely inactivated at plateau...|$|R
40|$|Drug-induced {{triggered}} arrhythmias {{in heart}} muscle involve oscillations of membrane potential known as delayed <b>or</b> early afterdepolarizations (<b>DADs</b> <b>or</b> EADs). We examined {{the mechanism of}} DADs and EADs in ferret ventricular muscle. Membrane potential, tension and aequorin luminescence were measured during exposure to elevated [Ca 2 +] 0, strophanthidin and/or isoproterenol (to induce <b>DADs),</b> <b>or</b> cesium chloride (to induce EADs). Ryanodine (10 (- 9) - 10 (- 6) M), an inhibitor of Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, rapidly suppressed DADs and triggered arrhythmias. When cytoplasmic Ca 2 +-buffering capacity was enhanced by loading cells with the Ca 2 + chelators BAPTA <b>or</b> quin 2, <b>DADs</b> were similarly inhibited, as were contractile force and aequorin luminescence. In contrast to DADs, EADs induced by Cs were not suppressed by ryanodine or by loading with intracellular Ca 2 + chelators. The possibility that transsarcolemmal Ca 2 + entry might produce EADs was evaluated with highly specific dihydropyridine Ca channel agonists and antagonists. Bay K 8644 (100 - 300 nM) potentiated EADs, whereas nitrendipine (3 - 20 microM) abolished EADs. We conclude that DADs and DAD-related triggered arrhythmias are activated {{by an increase in}} intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration, whereas EADs do not require elevated [Ca 2 +]i but rather arise as a direct consequence of Ca 2 + entry through sarcolemmal slow Ca channels...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHow early (EADs) {{and delayed}} afterdepolarizations (DADs) {{overcome}} electrotonic source-sink mismatches in tissue to trigger premature ventricular complexes remains incompletely understood. To study this question, {{we used a}} rabbit ventricular action potential model to simulate tissues in which a central area of contiguous myocytes susceptible to EADs <b>or</b> <b>DADs</b> was surrounded by unsusceptible tissue. In 1 D tissue with normal longitudinal conduction velocity (0. 55 m/s), the numbers of contiguous susceptible myocytes required for an EAD and a barely suprathreshold DAD to trigger a propagating action potential were 70 and 80, respectively. In 2 D tissue, these numbers increased to 6940 and 7854, and in 3 D tissue to 696, 910 and 817, 280. These numbers were significantly decreased by reduced gap junction conductance, simulated fibrosis, reduced repolarization reserve and heart failure electrical remodeling. In conclusion, the source-sink mismatch in well-coupled cardiac tissue powerfully protects the heart from arrhythmias due to sporadic afterdepolarizations. Structural and electrophysiological remodeling decrease these numbers significantly but still require synchronization mechanisms for EADs and DADs to overcome the robust protective effects of source-sink mismatch...|$|R

40|$|Women and {{men tend}} to work in {{different}} occupations. Although {{a great deal of}} research has been devoted to the measurement of trends in occupation segregation by gender, very little work has focused on the underlying job choice process that generates this segregation. What makes men and women choose the jobs they do? Using employment data from the 1995 - 1998 Current Population Surveys and data on occupational injuries and deaths from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we estimate conditional logit models of occupation choice {{as a function of the}} risk of work-related death and other job characteristics. Our results suggest that women choose safer jobs than men. Within gender, we find that single moms <b>or</b> <b>dads</b> are most averse to fatal risk, presumably because they have the most to lose. The effect of parenthood on married women is larger than its effect on married men, which is consistent with the idea that men's contributions to raising children are more fully insured than women's. Overall, men and women's different preferences for risk can explain about one-quarter of the fact that men and women choose different occupations. ...|$|R
