25|$|Eddy and Boyd, who {{question}} {{the value of}} several of the Talmudic references state that the significance of the Talmud to historical Jesus research is that it never denies the existence of Jesus, but accuses him of sorcery, thus indirectly confirming his existence. R. T. France and separately Edgar V. McKnight state that the divergence of the Talmud statements from the Christian accounts and their negative nature indicate that they are about a person who existed. Craig Blomberg states that the denial of the existence of Jesus was never part of the Jewish tradition, which instead accused him of being a sorcerer and magician, as also reflected in other sources such as Celsus. Andreas Kostenberger states that the <b>overall</b> <b>conclusion</b> that can be drawn from the references in the Talmud is that Jesus was a historical person whose existence was never denied by the Jewish tradition, which instead focused on discrediting him.|$|E
500|$|As on his {{previous}} trip, Hubbard recorded his impressions in his diary. He remained unimpressed with China. After seeing Qingdao he wrote: [...] "A Chinaman {{can not live}} up to a thing, he always drags it down." [...] He characterized the sights of Beijing as [...] "rubberneck stations" [...] for tourists and described the palaces of the Forbidden City as [...] "very trashy-looking" [...] and [...] "not worth mentioning". He visited a section of the Great Wall of China near Beijing, which did impress him, but his <b>overall</b> <b>conclusion</b> of the Chinese was very negative: [...] "They smell of all the baths they didn't take. The trouble with China is, there are too many chinks here." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 9, 2006, an {{explosion}} {{on a beach}} in the Gaza Strip killed seven Palestinians, including three children. Palestinian sources claimed that the explosion resulted from Israeli shelling. [...] After a three-day investigation, Israel concluded that the blast could not have resulted from an IDF artillery shell. This IDF investigation was criticized by both Human Rights Watch and The Guardian for ignoring evidence. The IDF agreed that the report should have mentioned two gunboat shells fired at about the time of the deaths but stated that these shells had landed too far away from the area to be the cause of the explosion and this omission did not impact the report's <b>overall</b> <b>conclusion</b> that Israel had not been responsible for the blast. According to Human Rights Watch, the IDF acknowledged that the cause of the blast may have been an unexploded 155mm artillery shell from an earlier shelling, or another location, but suggested it might have been placed there as an IED by Palestinians.|$|E

50|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{was that}} the best {{approach}} was to place the bomb somewhere that would redirect the explosion, then move away from where the blast was going to go.

40|$|This {{document}} concisely states my <b>overall</b> <b>conclusions</b> about paranormal phenomena {{based on}} over {{four decades of}} scientific research and study and my personal paranormal experiences. The individual conclusions have been discussed in various scientific papers, but the <b>overall</b> <b>conclusions</b> have not been presented in one place or in such a direct, simple manner. The conclusions are: 1. Paranormal phenomena beyond current scientific understanding sometimes actually occur. This conclusion is based almost entirely on my personal paranormal experiences around age 20. (Kennedy, 2000) 2. Most parapsychological experiments do not manifest actual paranormal phenomena. The experiments are dominated by methodological noise, various types of experimenter misconduct, and wishful thinking. These obstacles severely hinder scientific understanding and could be avoided with established methodological practices. (Kennedy, 2004 a; 2005; 2013 a, 2013 b) 3.
