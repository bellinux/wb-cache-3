Or, if this was not the case, to learn by what <b>other</b> <b>error</b> or fault they had displeased the celestial powers, and brought upon themselves such terrible judgments. Æneas determined to adopt this advice, but he was prevented from carrying his intentions into effect by the following occurrence.|$|E
6000|$|It {{will appear}} also, on {{consideration}} of the matter, that this fallacy is of two principal kinds. Either, as in this case of the crocus, it is the fallacy of wilful fancy, which involves no real expectation {{that it will be}} believed; or else it is a fallacy caused by an excited state of the feelings, making us, for the time, more or less irrational. Of the cheating of the fancy we shall have to speak presently; but, in this chapter, I want to examine the nature of the <b>other</b> <b>error,</b> that which the mind admits when affected strongly by emotion.
