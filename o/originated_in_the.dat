5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have <b>originated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have <b>originated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Comparing the {{epidemiology}} of fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical and apical regions {{may help}} to understand the causes and risk of a vertical root fracture. We aimed to determine the frequency of vertical root fractures in different fracture sites and how the fracture site relates to fracture direction and post length. Methods: Teeth diagnosed with a vertical root fracture were retrospectively surveyed for age and sex of the patient, type of tooth, a fracture region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal axial direction, site of the fracture, and presence of a post <b>The</b> fracture region <b>in</b> <b>the</b> longitudinal axial direction was classified as an incomplete fracture, complete fracture, and uncertain. Incomplete fractures were further classified into a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical region, a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midregion, and a fracture <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apical region. Posts were evaluated by loss of post and length of post. Results: Fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical and apical region occurred around the same frequency, whereas fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midregion were extremely scarce. Of <b>the</b> fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical region, 36. 2 % were in a mesial and/or distal site and 57. 4 % in a buccal and/or lingual site. Of <b>the</b> fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apical region, 90. 8 % were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> buccal and/ or lingual site. The {{number of cases of}} fractures <b>Originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apical region decreased with increased post length. Conclusions: Sites of fracture and post length differed greatly between fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical region and the apical region, suggesting that risk factors for fractures <b>originating</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cervical and apical regions are different...|$|R
