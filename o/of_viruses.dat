40|$|In {{the present}} article an attempt is made to {{understand}} the Infected-Susceptible phase plane trajectories, describing the growth <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in the model of Susceptible, Infected, and Removed (SIR) extended to immigration studies. The growth <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> is described by second order differential equation, in terms of small deviations from the steady state solution of infection. Further the situation for discriminator = 0, obtained in solving the second order differential equation, is described. In this analysis the free parameter, {{defined in terms of}} immigrant rate, birth and death rates <b>of</b> <b>virus,</b> is shown {{to play an important role}} in the shape of the trajectories in I_S Phase plane. For same values of immigration rate, birth and death rates <b>of</b> <b>virus,</b> all the trajectories approach asymptotically the stable equilibrium point (ratio of death to birth rate <b>of</b> <b>virus,</b> ratio <b>of</b> constant immigration rate to death rate <b>of</b> <b>virus),</b> which is termed as a nodal sink.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{development}} <b>of</b> meningopneumonitis <b>virus</b> in the allantois of the chick embryo {{was described in}} a recently published report from this laboratory (1). The growth cycle <b>of</b> this <b>virus</b> was determined by titrating allantoic fluids and membrane suspensions, obtained at various intervals after the inoculation <b>of</b> <b>virus,</b> for infectivity in mice and chick embryos. The development <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in allantoic membranes was characterized by the following pattern: (a) an increase in infectivity {{during the first few}} hours following inoculation; (b) a decrease in infectivity which was rather marked during the next 6 hours, and which then continued at a reduced rate until about the 22 nd hour of incubation; (c) an increase in infectivity due to the new generation <b>of</b> <b>virus.</b> A typical growth curve in membranes is included in Fig. 4 of this report (lower curve). The present report concerns the first two phases <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> development and the data presented suggest that: (a) the initial increment <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> infectivity was due to the adsorption <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> from the allantoic fluid to the allantoi...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{coxsackievirus}} B- 1 {{to pass the}} barriers of the circulatory system into whole saliva has been shown previously. In this investigation, the major salivary glands and the oral mucosa were studied, and their role as participants in the excretion of coxsackievirus B- 1 during viremia was evaluated. The effect of the salivary-gland stimulant pilocarpine nitrate on both the salivary flow rate and the recovery <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> during viremia was determined. A comparison was made between the amount <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> recovered from whole saliva during viremia in animals deficient in {{one or both of}} the major salivary-gland pairs and animals with a complete complement of salivary glands. The salivary glands in other animals were cannulated, and pure glandular secretions were collected during viremia and assayed for the presence <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> The amount <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> passing from the capillaries of the oral mucosa to the surface was also determined to evaluate this route as a possible site for the excretion <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> into saliva during viremia. The major salivary glands did not excrete appreciable quantities <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> during viremia. The submaxillary-gland secretions did not contain virus, and the parotid-gland secretions showed virus only at extremely high blood virus levels. Either removal of the major salivary glands or decreased salivary flow rates increased the concentration <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> in whole saliva. This observation suggested that the production of saliva by the major salivary glands tends to dilute the virus in the oral cavity. A 0. 88 -cm 2 sample of the oral mucosa excreted significantly large amounts <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> during viremia and suggested that the passage <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> through the oral mucosa was the major route for the excretion <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> into saliva during viremia...|$|R

Epidemics caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the Neolithic period, around 12,000 years ago, when humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities.

Viruses {{of plants and}} livestock also increased, and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming, diseases such as potyviruses of potatoes and rinderpest of cattle had devastating consequences.|$|E

5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity <b>of</b> <b>viruses</b> by naming and grouping them {{on the basis of}} similarities. In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier were the first to develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system.

Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>Viruses</b> was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order.

40|$|Sindbis {{virus was}} adsorbed to chicken cells or to BHK cells, and the {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> {{over the surface of}} the cell was examined by electron microscopy of surface replicas. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> particles on the cell was used to indicate the position <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> receptors at the cell surface. When purified Sindbis virus was adsorbed at 37 C to cells prefixed with glutaraldehyde, the virus particles were evenly distributed over the surface of most cells. There was a large variability from cell to cell, however, in the number <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> particles adsorbed, and regions with different concentrations <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> particles were sometimes observed on the same cell. The concentration <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> receptors observed varied from 20 to 160 /µm 2 of cell surface, and, thus, the total number <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> receptors per chicken cell is on the order <b>of</b> 105. When <b>virus</b> was adsorbed to unfixed cells at 4 C, the virus particles were clustered into aggregates varying from a few particles to large crystalline arrays (the latter seen only in chicken cells).

40|$|It has {{recently}} been reported (1) {{that the rate of}} multiplication in the mouse lung of an adapted line <b>of</b> influenza <b>virus</b> is greater than that of an unadapted line of the same strain.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of the growth curves of adapted and unadapted lines of the same strain of Type A or Type B influenza virus in mice has demonstrated that the unadapted lines <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> exhibit a lag phase of growth lasting approximately 12 hours during which little or no multiplication <b>of</b> <b>virus</b> can be demonstrated. Multiplication by the adapted line begins earlier and may be evident as soon as 6 hours after inoculation.
