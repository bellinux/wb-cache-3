50|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>Syntheses</b> is a peer-reviewed {{scientific}} {{journal that}} {{was established in}} 1921.

The journal is published by <b>Organic</b> <b>Syntheses,</b> Inc., a non-profit corporation.

5|$|The {{success of}} the Nazarov {{cyclization}} as a tool in <b>organic</b> <b>synthesis</b> stems from the utility and ubiquity of cyclopentenones as both motifs in natural products (including jasmone, the aflatoxins, and a subclass of prostaglandins) and as useful synthetic intermediates for total synthesis.

5|$|A mercury–thallium alloy, {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% thallium, {{is reported to}} freeze at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This alloy is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In <b>organic</b> <b>synthesis,</b> thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the alloy in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries.

5|$|Mercury dissolves {{many other}} metals such as {{gold and silver}} to form amalgams. Iron is an exception, and iron flasks have {{traditionally}} been used to trade mercury.

5|$|Some {{ytterbium}} halides {{are used}} as reagents in <b>organic</b> <b>synthesis.</b> For example, ytterbium(III) chloride (YbCl3) is a Lewis acid {{and can be used}} as a catalyst in the Aldol and Diels–Alder reactions. Ytterbium(II) iodide (YbI2) may be used, like samarium(II) iodide, as a reducing agent for coupling reactions. Ytterbium(III) fluoride (YbF3) is used as an inert and non-toxic tooth filling as it continuously releases fluoride ions, which are good for dental health, and is also a good X-ray contrast agent.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{application of}} samarium {{and its compounds}} is as catalyst and chemical reagent. Samarium catalysts assist decomposition of plastics, dechlorination of pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), {{as well as the}} dehydration and dehydrogenation of ethanol. Samarium(III) triflate (Sm(OTf)3, that is Sm(CF3SO3)3), {{is one of the most}} efficient Lewis acid catalysts for a halogen-promoted Friedel–Crafts reaction with alkenes. Samarium(II) iodide is a very common reducing and coupling agent in <b>organic</b> <b>synthesis,</b> for example in the desulfonylation reactions; annulation; Danishefsky, Kuwajima, Mukaiyama and Holton Taxol total syntheses; strychnine total synthesis; Barbier reaction and other reductions with samarium(II) iodide.|$|E
5|$|Chronologically, it is {{difficult}} to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaudí's style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach to immerse himself completely in the modernista movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. Among the best descriptions of Gaudí's work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Bergós, according to plastic and structural criteria. Bergós establishes five periods in Gaudí's productions: preliminary period, mudéjar-morisco (Moorish/mudéjar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, and <b>organic</b> <b>synthesis.</b>|$|E
