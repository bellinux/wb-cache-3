50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that tracks run through the {{district}} there is no station. Former mayor, Jerramiah Healy had requested that Marion be given {{a stop on the}} PATH train at Broadway and West Side Avenue, supplanting the nearest station at Journal Square. There are a growing number of condos and <b>other</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> being built in the Marion neighborhood and city officials feel a stop on the PATH system will be necessary to unclog the city streets and lessen the commute for residents. Officials feel a station would help to bolster development in the neighborhood, which has fewer cultural attractions than many Jersey City neighborhoods and is without a school.

40|$|Housing {{development}} and total road mileage expansion, which {{result from the}} growing population and economic activity in the region, increased the total impervious surface area (ISA) within the Delaware River Basin (DRB) from either 3. 19 % or 3. 69 % of the total basin area in 1950 to either 5. 41 % or 6. 44 % of the total basin area in 2000, depending on which of two plausible scenarios are used for interpreting the available housing and road mileage data. Assuming an average area of 0. 3 acre and 35 % ISA for a single-unit detached house and 0. 1 acre and 60 % ISA for all <b>other</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units,</b> the projected ISA for the DRB is 5. 66 % in 2006. This result is comparable with the existing GIS data from the LandSat Thematic Mapper Imager {{for part of the}} DRB. Associated with the increasing ISA in the DRB, there also is an increase in flood events for recent years. Increased peak flows in July and August, which are the two months with the highest precipitation, also are noticeable. Concentrations of sodium and chloride in the Delaware River water increased between 2 - 4. 6 times over the last 50 years at both upstream and downstream locations. Increased application of sodium chloride, in the form of deicing salt that is tied to the expansion of total road mileage in the basin, {{may be one of the}} main reasons for the increase of these ions in the waters of the Delaware River...|$|E
40|$|The author {{tries to}} {{articulate}} a rational demand {{for the expansion of}} free time and transformation of wage labor. Firstly, the author demontrates that the internalization of fetishized capitalist relations {{is an integral part of}} capitalism. He demonstrates that both the capitalist and worker construct the meaning of the world through arbitrary forms of perception, and that in this process the work itself is a vital factor that generates, modifies and reproduces these forms themselves. Bourdieu’s concept of habitus and Foucault’s investigations about body and norm complement Marx’s theorization of abstract labor. This complement is then a focal point of phenomenological critique of the abstract labor practice. In the second part of the article, the author presents a strategic proposal of the French economist Michel Husson, whose arguments defend a specific transgression of capitalism: shorter working week through the socialization of products and services. Husson’s strategic proposition is also complemented. The author complements it with the ideas of how class struggle can be expanded beyond the borders of professional solidarity to the terrain of universal suffrage. He rethinks living space in a universal and unconditional manner, which can substantially reduce the subordination to economic necessity. His argument postulates that apartments as well as <b>other</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> must be rethought outside of value form. In the last part of the article, the author tries to crystalize his line of arguments by addressing some of Husson’s implicit as well as explicit assumptions. Through critique of capitalism as a systemic totality, the author tries to fully articulate his demand for historical and material conditions of autonomy, which is structured and conditioned by limitations of capitalist system...|$|E

50|$|Segregation {{in public}} housing has roots in the early {{developments}} and activities of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), created by the Housing Act of 1934 (Gotham 2000). The FHA institutionalized a practice by which it would seek to maintain racially homogenous neighborhoods, although this practice was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1948 and outlawed by legislation in 1960 (Gotham 2000). However, according to Gotham (2000), Section 235 of the Housing Act of 1968 encouraged white flight from the inner city, selling suburban properties to whites and inner-city properties to blacks, creating neighborhoods that were racially isolated from <b>others.</b> Public <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> were often built in predominantly poor and black areas, reinforcing racial and economic differences between neighborhoods (Massey and Kanaiaupuni 1993).|$|R

5000|$|Neighbourhoods in Puerto Rico {{are often}} {{divided into three}} types: barrio, urbanización (urbanisation) and residencial público (public housing). An urbanización {{is a type of}} housing where land is {{developed}} into lots, often by a private developer, and where single-family homes are built. More recently, non single-family units, such as condominiums and townhouses are being built which also fall into this category. (In Puerto Rico, a condominiun is a <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> located in a high-rise building.
