5000|$|USCGC Active (WMEC-618) is a United States Coast Guard medium {{endurance}} cutter. Active {{was launched}} at Christy Corporation, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin on July 31, 1965. Commissioned as a Coast Guard Cutter on September 1, 1966, she is 210 ft long, has a 34 ft beam, displaces 1000 tons, and draws 10 ft of water. She {{is powered by}} two diesel engines, combined {{for a total of}} [...] Quarters are provided for up to 12 officers and 70 enlisted members. Actives cruising range is 5000 nmi km at 15 kn, designed with an <b>operating</b> <b>endurance</b> of about 30 days. At top speed of 18 kn, Active has an approximate range of 2200 nmi km. Actives armament consists of a single 25 mm gun on the forecastle. 50 caliber machine guns can also be mounted on the forecastle. bridge or fantail. The Active has a flight deck which allows for the deployment of a Coast Guard HH-65 Dolphin or MH-68A Stingray Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron (HITRON). USCGC Active has received several awards in recent years for its outstanding service to the maritime community, including oil spill clean ups in Prince William Sound, Alaska during the Exxon Valdez oil spill.http://www.uscg.mil/pacarea/active/history.htm ...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{program was}} conducted continuing the development {{effort to improve}} the weight, life, and performance characteristics of hydrogen-oxygen alkaline fuel cells for advanced power systems. These advanced technology cells operate with passive water removal which contributes to a lower system weight and extended <b>operating</b> life. <b>Endurance</b> evaluation of two single cells and two, two-cell plaques was continued. Three new test articles were fabricated and tested. A single cell completed 7038 hours of endurance testing. This cell incorporated a Fybex matrix, hybrid-frame, PPF anode, and a 90 Au/ 10 Pt cathode. This configuration was developed to extend cell life. Two cell plaques with dedicated flow fields and manifolds for all fluids did not exhibit the cell-to-cell electrolyte transfer that limited the operating life of earlier multicell plaques...|$|R
40|$|Operating micro-UAVs {{autonomously}} {{in complex}} urban areas {{requires that the}} guidance algorithms on-board are robust {{to changes in the}} <b>operating</b> environment. Limited <b>endurance</b> capability demands an optimal guidance algorithm, which will change as the environment does. All optimal path-planning routines are computationally intensive, with processor load a function of the environmental complexity. This paper presents a new algorithm, the reactive route selection algorithm, for storing a bank of optimal trajectories computed off-line and blending between these optimal trajectories as the operating environment changes. An example is presented using a mixed-integer linear program to generate the optimal trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Transition {{metal oxide}} memristors, or {{resistive}} random-access memory (RRAM) switches, are under intense development for storage-class memory {{because of their}} favorable <b>operating</b> power, <b>endurance,</b> speed, and density. Their commercial deployment critically depends on predictive compact models based on understanding nanoscale physico-chemical forces, which remains elusive and controversial owing to the difficulties in directly observing atomic motions during resistive switching, Here, using scanning transmission synchrotron x-ray spectromicroscopy to study in-situ switching of hafnium oxide memristors, we directly observed {{the formation of a}} localized oxygen-deficiency-derived conductive channel surrounded by a low-conductivity ring of excess oxygen. Subsequent thermal annealing homogenized the segregated oxygen, resetting the cells towards their as-grown resistance state. We show that the formation and dissolution of the conduction channel are successfully modeled by radial thermophoresis and Fick diffusion of oxygen atoms driven by Joule heating. This confirmation and quantification of two opposing nanoscale radial forces that affect bipolar memristor switching are important components for any future physics-based compact model for the electronic switching of these devices.

30|$|Recently, the self-assembled silicon nanocrystals (Si-ncs) {{that are}} formed within ultrathin SiO 2 layer are {{considered}} to be a promising replacement of this conventional floating gate [1, 2]. These isolated Si-ncs embedded in between a tunnel and a top dielectric layer serve as the charge storage nodes and exhibit many physical properties even at room temperature such as Coulomb blockade [3], single-electron transfer [4] and quantization charges effect [5] which differ from bulk crystals. It can reduce the problem of charge loss encountered in conventional memories, cause thinner injection oxides and hence smaller <b>operating</b> voltages, better <b>endurance</b> and faster write/erase speeds. So, the characterisation and understanding of its charging mechanism in such nanostructure is of prime importance.|$|R
50|$|On October 15, 2004, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery {{was again}} called to duty, {{this time to}} {{participate}} in Operation Iraqi Freedom III. As {{a part of the}} Army's newest Stryker BCT, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery relieved the 1st Battalion, 37th FA assuming all security and support duties of the area surrounding Quaryyah in the Multi-National Division North's Area of Operation. The battalion officially unfurled its colors at Forward <b>Operating</b> Base <b>Endurance,</b> in northern Iraq on November 2, 2004. During their year in Iraq, the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery partnered with the 3rd Battalion, Iraqi Army, and successfully began an Iraqi Army training Program. After a year of stability and security operations, the battalion cased its colors once more and returned to Fort Lewis, Washington. Almost immediately upon the 1st Brigade's return from combat, it was given orders to re-flag and subsequently did so from the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, to the 2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment on 6 June 2006. The 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery colors were then cased and shipped to the nation's last frontier.|$|R

The mission of LTC Curry and his staff were to provide command & control of the base, establish the Base Defense Operations Center, provide life support functions, establish base defense security, combat patrols and build the FOB {{from the ground up}} into the largest logistical hub operating in northern Iraq by the end of 2005, a mission that was accomplished prior to their departure.|$|R
500|$|On 21 February 2013, the 1st Battalion (Attack), 229th Aviation Regiment at Joint Base Lewis-McChord {{became the}} first U.S. Army unit to field the AH-64E Apache Guardian; a total of 24 AH-64E were {{received}} by mid-2013. On 27 November 2013, the AH-64E achieved initial operating capability (IOC). In March 2014, the 1st-229th Attack Reconnaissance Battalion deployed 24 AH-64Es to Afghanistan in the type's first combat deployment. From April through September 2014, AH-64Es in combat maintained an 88 percent readiness rate.

60|$|During 1862 and '3, John H. Morgan, a {{partisan}} officer, of no military education, but possessed {{of courage and}} <b>endurance,</b> <b>operated</b> {{in the rear of}} the Army of the Ohio in Kentucky and Tennessee. He had no base of supplies to protect, but was at home wherever he went. The army operating against the South, on the contrary, had to protect its lines of communication with the North, from which all supplies had to come to the front. Every foot of road had to be guarded by troops stationed at convenient distances apart. These guards could not render assistance beyond the points where stationed. Morgan Was foot-loose and could operate where, his information--always correct--led him to believe he could do the greatest damage. During the time he was operating in this way he killed, wounded and captured several times the number he ever had under his command at any one time. He destroyed many millions of property in addition. Places he did not attack had to be guarded as if threatened by him. Forrest, an abler soldier, operated farther west, and held from the National front quite as many men as could be spared for offensive operations. It is safe to say that more than half the National army was engaged in guarding lines of supplies, or were on leave, sick in hospital or on detail which prevented their bearing arms. Then, again, large forces were employed where no Confederate army confronted them. I deem it safe to say that there were no large engagements where the National numbers compensated for the advantage of position and intrenchment occupied by the enemy.|$|R
5000|$|The phased {{withdrawal}} of the Gannet AEW, {{as part of the}} draw-down of fixed wing aviation in the Fleet Air Arm, led to a need for the Royal Air Force to take over the provision of Airborne Early Warning for the UK Air Defence Region. As an interim solution until a purpose built system could be procured, the radar and electronic systems from redundant Gannets were fitted to similarly redundant Avro Shackletons; the Shackleton was a maritime patrol aircraft then {{in the process of being}} replaced. However, this still meant that the Royal Navy, then in the process of introducing a new type of small aircraft carrier incapable of operating conventional fixed-wing aircraft, lacked an embedded AEW platform that could be used as part of the carrier task group. This lack of organic AEW capability following the {{withdrawal of}} the Gannet was seen as misguided, particularly following the experience of the Falklands War, in which the Royal Navy lost four ships due to the Task Force being reliant on shipborne air search. As a consequence, the Westland Sea King helicopter was modified to incorporate the Searchwater radar system for use in the AEW role from the Invincible class.The size of the Invincible class, combined with it being capable of operating only helicopters and V/STOL fixed-wing aircraft, limited the types of aircraft it could potentially carry in the AEW mission.
