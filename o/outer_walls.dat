5|$|Lincoln Castle is {{bounded by}} a stone curtain wall, with ditches {{on all sides}} except the south. From an early stage, the <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> which enclose the site were built in stone and they date from before 1115. On the south side the walls are {{interrupted}} by two earthen mounds called mottes. One is in the south-east corner, and was probably an original feature of William's the Conqueror's castle, while the other occupies the south-west corner. A square tower, the Observatory Tower, stands {{on top of the}} first mound, standing above the <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> to dominate the city of Lincoln. The second mound is crowned by the 'Lucy Tower', which was probably built in the 12th century and was named after Lucy of Bolingbroke, the Countess of Chester until 1138.|$|E

50|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the {{vestibule}} shares the same decoration as the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the shrine, but is inconspicuous because {{it forms a}} short continuation between {{the wall of the}} shrine and that of closed mantapa. The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the shrine is , but the star points are not identical, rather they form three different kinds of star points, making the design complicated and unusual. The lower half of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the shrine and the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the closed mantapa share the same architectural articulation. The open hall, with its 16-pointed star plan is most unusual design built by Hoysala architects. The central ceiling in the closed mantapa and {{the vestibule}} are decorated elaborately.|$|R

5|$|Salabhanjika, {{a common}} form of Hoysala sculpture, is an old Indian {{tradition}} going back to Buddhist sculpture. Sala is the sala tree and bhanjika is the chaste maiden. In the Hoysala idiom, madanika figures are decorative objects put at an angle on the <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> of the temple near the roof so that worshipers circumambulating the temple can view them.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> of {{the church}} are {{constructed}} of red sandstone with grey ashlar dressings; the roofs are slate. The church plan consists of a nave, with a square tower {{to the west and}} a chancel and apsidal sanctuary to the east. There is a clergy vestry at the south-east corner of the building.|$|E
5|$|Two temples {{dating to}} Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled {{superstructures}} {{that may have}} been corbel-vaulted, although this has not been proven. One of these had elaborate paintings on the <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> showing human figures against a scrollwork background, painted in yellow, black, pink and red.|$|E
50|$|On the landward {{side of the}} broch {{there was}} an <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> or rampart with a ditch, which curved across the broad neck of the promontory. Between the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> and the broch {{there may have been}} some out-buildings.|$|R
5|$|The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> was 2m thick at its base, and {{featured}} arched chambers on {{the level}} of the peribolos, crowned with a battlemented walkway, reaching a height of 8.5–9m. Access to the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small posterns on the base of the inner <b>wall's</b> towers. The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> likewise had towers, situated approximately midway between the inner wall's towers, and acting in supporting role to them. They are spaced at 48–78m, with an average distance of 50–66m. Only 62 of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall's</b> towers survive. With few exceptions, they are square or crescent-shaped, 12–14m tall and 4m wide. They featured a room with windows {{on the level}} of the peribolos, crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the outer terrace. The <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold both lines of wall, concentrated on the defence of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} twenty-nine monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que) from the Han dynasty have survived {{and can be}} found in the {{aboveground}} areas around Han tomb and shrine sites. They often formed part of <b>outer</b> <b>walls,</b> usually flanking an entry but sometimes at the corners of walled enclosures. Although they lack wooden and ceramic components, they feature imitation roof tiles, eaves, porches, and balustrades.|$|E
5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current <b>outer</b> <b>walls,</b> no trace of it has been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being divided by the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>walls,</b> which created an urban core occupied by the site's foremost buildings and areas of occupation between {{and outside of the}} outer wall, Gedi has a well-established infrastructure. Gedi's structures appear to be formally arranged in accordance with streets laid out in a grid pattern. Additionally the site contained sumps to collect storm water and lavatories in many of its primary buildings.|$|E
50|$|The South <b>Outer</b> <b>Wall</b> {{contains}} the great ledge which holds the Bright Carvings which are judged on the Day of the Bright Carvers on June 1. The ledge is apparently at the South Wall's far Western corner as it adjoins the Carver's Battlement on the West <b>Outer</b> <b>Wall.</b> The South Wall also encloses grounds which contain the South Spinneys. Titus {{is allowed to}} ride his horse for an hour once a week through the grounds along by the South <b>Outer</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|R
50|$|Apollo is a double-ringed walled plain (or basin) whose {{inner ring}} is {{roughly half the}} {{diameter}} of the <b>outer</b> <b>wall.</b> Both the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> and the interior have been heavily worn and eroded by subsequent impacts, so that significant parts of the <b>outer</b> and inner <b>walls</b> now consist of irregular and incised sections of mountainous arcs.|$|R
50|$|Further {{north of}} the <b>Outer</b> <b>Wall</b> again are woods and Gormenghast lake. An archway in the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> leads into the castle grounds onto an avenue of acacia trees, which head down to {{what may be the}} main {{entrance}} to the castle. Nannie Slagg has to pass down this avenue of acacia trees to reach the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> of the castle when she goes in search of a wet nurse for Titus. Presumably there are lawns or landscaping {{on either side of the}} avenue.|$|R
5|$|The Castello de Zanna {{is a small}} fortress, {{situated}} in the frazione of Majon. It consists of low white <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> and two white corner towers, with a small chapel dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The construction of the castle began in 1694, but on August 19, 1696 the works were interrupted; the building remained unfinished in 1809 when it was burned by French revolutionary troops who had invaded Ampezzo. Since then the castle has undergone restoration.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was built}} {{to the east of}} the fourteenth-century town on a {{slightly}} raised location. The area enclosed within the castle's <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> was about 2.8ha (7acres), but with outbuildings, other ancillary constructions and orchards, the total area has been estimated to be at least 8ha (20acres). The walls were constructed with rubble faced with ashlar, and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3m (10ft) thick.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the inner}} wall {{there are two}} mosques, a palace or Sheikh's house, four large houses, several {{clustered}} houses, and four large pillar tombs comprising the urban core. The inner wall also encloses four other houses and three other mosques. Between the inner and <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> few stone structures have been identified {{with the exception of}} two mosques. Immediately beyond the outer wall there is one mosque and several other unidentified structures.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Estimation of the {{stability}} of fusiform aneurysms of the basilar artery requires precise monitoring of the luminal and <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> volumes. In this report we describe the use of MR imaging and 3 D postprocessing methods to study the evolution of those aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients with fusiform basilar artery aneurysms underwent MR imaging studies covering at least 2 different time points (mean delay between studies, 7. 1 4. 6 months). Imaging included multisection 2 D T 1 -weighted fast spin-echo and/or 3 D steady-state imaging to assess the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> and contrast-enhanced MR angiography to study the lumen. The <b>outer</b> and inner <b>walls</b> were extracted using, respectively, a manual delineation (made by 2 observers) and a thresholding technique. The 2 studies were subsequently coregistered at each time point, {{as well as between}} differing time points. Volumes of each vessel component were calculated. RESULTS: Mean volume was 6760 6620 mm 3 for the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> and 2060 1200 mm 3 for the lumen. Evolution of the lumen and <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> was highly variable from 1 patient to another, with a trend toward increase of the vessel wall for the largest aneurysms. Interobserver reproducibility for <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> delineation was on the order of 90 %. CONCLUSION: Combining MR imaging methods to study both the <b>outer</b> <b>wall</b> and lumen with 3...|$|R

5|$|A {{distinct}} feature {{noted in}} the entire temple complex is the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry and finished with plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> of the temple have since been demolished.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding overdecoration, {{these artists}} left uncarved spaces where required, {{although}} their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic. Here, on the <b>outer</b> <b>walls,</b> the sculptures are not overdone, {{yet they are}} articulate and discreetly aesthetic. The Hoysala builders used soapstone almost universally as building material, a trend that started {{in the middle of}} the 11th century with Chalukyan temples. Other common artistic features between the two Kanarese dynasties are the ornate Salabhanjika (pillar bracket figures), the lathe-turned pillars and the makara torana (lintel with mythical beastly figure). The tower over the shrine in a Hoysala temple is a closely moulded form of the Chalukya style tower.|$|E
5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the <b>outer</b> <b>walls,</b> pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.|$|E

5|$|Final {{approval}} for the project was granted in August 2015 by the Seattle City Council, who also approved the substation's unconventional design incorporating public benefits {{in exchange for a}} street vacation. Walsh Construction was awarded the construction contract for the substation project, working alongside subcontractors Valley Electric, W.A. Chester and Transcon. Construction of the substation began in May 2016, {{and by the end of}} the year, the first <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> were erected. When completed and energized in 2018, the Denny Substation will be the first new substation built by Seattle City Light in 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII {{gave the}} ruins to the Carey family, who {{retained}} {{it until it}} passed by marriage into first the Heviningham and then the Coke families. The castle {{was not involved in}} the events of the English Civil War in the 17th century, and escaped the slighting that affected many similar properties, probably because the collapse of the <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> had already made it indefensible and of little military value. In 1737, after the death of Edward Coke, the castle and the surrounding manor were bought by Thomas Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, for £22,500.|$|E
5|$|One of the castle's most {{important}} defensive elements is the confusing maze of paths {{leading to the}} castle's keep. The gates, baileys, and <b>outer</b> <b>walls</b> of the complex are organized so as to confuse an approaching force, causing it to travel in a spiral pattern around the complex {{on its way to}} the keep. The castle complex originally contained 84 gates, 15 of which were named according to the Japanese syllabary (I, Ro, Ha, Ni, Ho, He, To, etc.). At present, 21 gates from the castle complex remain intact, 13 of which are named according to the Japanese syllabary.|$|E
