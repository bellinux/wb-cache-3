5|$|Taft {{maintained}} a cordial relationship with Wilson. The former president privately criticized his successor {{on a number}} of issues, but made his views known publicly only on Philippine policy. Taft was appalled when, after Justice Lamar's death in January 1916, Wilson nominated Brandeis, whom the former president had never forgiven {{for his role in the}} Ballinger–Pinchot affair. When hearings led to nothing discreditable about Brandeis, Taft intervened with a letter signed by himself and other former ABA presidents, stating that Brandeis was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court. Nevertheless, the Democratic-controlled Senate confirmed Brandeis. Taft and Roosevelt remained embittered; they met only once in the first three years of the Wilson presidency, at a funeral at Yale. They spoke <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> politely but formally.|$|E
25|$|The supreme {{fiction is}} that {{conceptualization}} of reality {{that seems to}} resonate in its rightness, {{so much so that}} it seems to have captured, if <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> something actual and real.|$|E
25|$|Like many of Butler’s strong female African-American characters, Anyanwu {{is put in}} {{conflict}} with a male character, Doro, who is just as powerful as her. Butler uses this type of mis-match to display how differently males and females demonstrate their power and values. Since Anyanwu’s way, J. Andrew Deman notes, “is {{the way of the}} healer” rather than of the killer, she does not need violence to demonstrate her true strength or power. As Gant-Britton states, Anyanwu’s true power is shown many times during the story but it is definitely displayed when she threatens to commit suicide if Doro does not stop using her to create new species, making Doro submissive “to her will in the name of love,” if <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... [61] Sinful sloth deprives the Christian of his comforts. What he {{intended}} <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> nap, like <b>a</b> man asleep during sermon-time in church, became a deep sleep, and his roll {{fell out of}} his hand; and yet he ran well while there was nothing special to alarm him. Religious privileges should refresh and not puff up-(Cheever).|$|R

60|$|Donatello stirred uneasily, {{with the}} {{irritable}} impatience {{that is often}} combined With a mood of leaden despondency. A brown lizard with two tails--a monster often engendered by the Roman sunshine--ran across his foot, and made him start. Then he sat silent awhile, and so did Miriam, trying to dissolve her whole heart into sympathy, and lavish it all upon him, were it <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> cordial.|$|R
25|$|The city at {{this time}} was in a terrible confusion. Crowds of the people, on horse and foot, rushed in {{disorder}} on the streets, vainly searching for already deceased Khan. Bewildered residents hid {{in their homes and}} barns, women filled the air with frantic cries. Meanwhile, Russian soldiers with bayonets cleared the street, entirely covered with dead bodies, and seized the booty, finding on a horseback some precious gold jewelry. By noon the battle began to subside, and broke again <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> when, according to Tstsianov, the soldiers came upon five hundred men, who have entrenched themselves in the Juma mosque. At first they offered to surrender, but when one Armenian said that among them are some Lezgins, it was the signal for the death of all defenders, because the hatred of Lezghins was so strong among the Russian troops.|$|E
25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> that whatever happiness the lovers feel is to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E
500|$|As the British {{prepared}} {{to attack the}} American defenses, cannon and musket fire was exchanged between the opposing sides. The British moved across the bridge, advancing in solid columns, and the Americans all fired together. The British fell back, but <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> The British charged the bridge again, but were driven back by cannon fire. The British charged one final time, but the Americans fired canister shot this time, and the British lines were raked with fire. One soldier said, [...] "The bridge looked red as blood, with their killed and wounded and their red coats." ...|$|E

500|$|... {{utterance}} of 'you're my James Dean / {{you make}} me feel like I'm seventeen' on 'Rather Die Young' is made tolerable by her honeyed vocal slides. Certainly, the 'bad boy' Beyoncé is in love with is more a physical representation of countless painfully banal fantasies about guys who 'drive too fast' and 'smoke too much' than an actual person, but at least it feels tangible. For once, the pop song trying to make a connection with its listener doesn't feel like a total fraud. Forget Lady Gaga's song about her relationship with her father or Britney Spears' lullaby to her babies – here, I'm convinced, if <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> that Beyoncé really would rather die young than to live her life without her lover, that she cares, even if you don't. This doesn't fully explain why 4 is as enjoyable as it is, but it does convey just how convincing Beyoncé can be when given the right tools – {{and it turns out that}} those tools consist of not much more than Beyoncé's voice itself.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955 Jack Philby {{returned}} {{to live in}} Riyadh. In 1960, {{on a visit to}} Kim in Beirut, he suddenly became ill and was rushed to hospital. [...] "The man whose life had been so eventful and panoramic, so daring and theatrical, now lay unconcious. He awoke <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> and murmured to his son, [...] "I am so bored." [...] And then he expired."". [...] He is buried in the Muslim cemetery in the Basta district of Beirut. His tombstone reads, [...] "Greatest of Arabian Explorers".|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{there were}} {{divisions}} within the Japanese government between one faction that {{wanted to use the}} crisis to start a war with Britain and another that argued that since the war with China was already compounded the border war with the Soviet Union, starting a third war at this time was unwise. Even more astonishing to the Japanese Army who expected an easy triumph, the Red Army defeated them at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which came as a great shock and caused many Japanese generals to lose their bellicosity, if <b>only</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> The Japanese Foreign Minister Hachirō Arita regularly met with Cragie and by 22 July 1939 felt that he was winning in his talks. On 26 July 1939, the United States gave the six-month notification that it would not renew the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which increased the amount of economic pressure the British could bring against Japan. The Roosevelt administration had carried its version of appeasement in the Far East, but actions such as the Tientsin incident had persuaded the Americans that Japan was out of control, and the United States needed to start applying economic pressure via such moves like cancelling the 1911 treaty to pressure the Japanese to stop challenging the existing international order in Asia. The Showa Emperor was furious, telling his aide-de-camp Hata Shunroku: [...] "It could be a great blow to scrap metal and oil. Even if we can purchase [...] for the next six months, we will immediately have difficulties thereafter. Unless we reduce the size of our army and navy by one-third, we won't make it...They [...] should have prepared for something like this a long time ago. It's unacceptable for them to be making a commotion about it now." [...] The American historian Herbert Bix wrote it was typical of the Emperor to criticize his generals and admirals for not anticipating the American move and preparing for it, instead of considering ending the war with China that had brought about the cancellation of the 1911 treaty.|$|E

60|$|The master {{pointed out}} a mass of dark herbage on a distant height, which resembled a copse of wood that had been studiously clipped into square forms at its {{different}} angles.
