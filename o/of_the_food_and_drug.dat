5|$|Colonel Lilly was an {{advocate}} of federal regulation of the pharmaceutical industry, {{and many of his}} suggested reforms were enacted into law in 1906, resulting in the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration. He was also among the pioneers of the concept of prescriptions, and helped form what became the common practice of giving addictive or dangerous medicines only to people who had first seen a physician. The company he founded has since grown into {{one of the largest and}} most influential pharmaceutical corporations in the world, and the largest corporation in Indiana. Using the wealth generated by the company, his son, J. K., and grandsons, Eli Jr. and Josiah Jr. (Joe), established the Lilly Endowment in 1937; it remains as one of the largest charitable benefactors in the world and continues the Lilly legacy of philanthropy.|$|E

25|$|In October 2015, it was {{reported}} that Burton registered as a lobbyist on behalf of the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), an organization established by the Church of Scientology.

25|$|White House Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs {{said the}} effort to get a team in place {{to respond to the}} health scare has not been {{hindered}} by the lack of a secretary of Health and Human Services or appointees in any of the department’s 19 key posts. The president's nominee, Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, was still awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Senate until passing on April 28. The President has not yet made appointments to either the Commissioner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration, the Surgeon General, or the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

25|$|In 2007, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) {{effectively}} {{lifted the}} long-standing absinthe ban, {{and it has}} since approved many brands {{for sale in the}} US market. This was made possible partly through the TTB's clarification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration's (FDA) thujone content regulations, which specify that finished food and beverages that contain Artemisia species must be thujone-free. In this context, the TTB considers a product thujone-free if the thujone content is less than 10 ppm (equal to 10mg/kg). This is verified through the use of Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The brands Kubler and Lucid and their lawyers did most of the work to get absinthe legalized in the U.S., over the 2004-2007 time period.|$|E
25|$|In his {{leadership}} position, Watts opposed government regulations and President Clinton's attempt {{to restore the}} ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration to regulate tobacco products. He voted to impeach Bill Clinton, was appointed by Speaker Dennis Hastert to lead a group of House Republicans to investigate cybersecurity issues, and {{became a member of}} a presidential exploratory committee for George W. Bush. Watts argued for using tax reduction to improve education, job training and housing in poor urban and rural settings, and advocated letting religious institutions carry out the work. Watts worked to make his party more inclusive, promoted African trade, supported historically black colleges and universities, and was opposed to federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.|$|E

There, he was arrested with three others protesting the airing of a television drama by NBC affiliate KGW-TV that depicted violence against a character with AIDS, helped block traffic on Burnside Bridge to protest passage of Ballot Measure 8, quarreled with state health officials who demanded the return of five thousand state-supplied condoms after they discovered ACT UP meant to distribute the condoms outside a high school, criticized a state-sponsored series of AIDS awareness advertisements for not using the word [...] "gay", and was arrested with ten others outside the Portland office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration (FDA) protesting the agency's failure to release four promising new drugs.|$|E
2500|$|China's food {{regulations}} are complex, its monitoring {{system can be}} unresponsive, and the government departments that oversee and enforce policies have overlapping and often ambiguous duties. There are around ten national government departments that share the responsibility to ensure food safety. There are also numerous provincial and local agencies that monitor local food production and sales. The food and drug laws themselves have been created [...] "in an ad hoc way {{without the benefit of}} a basic food law," [...] as Henk Bekedam of the World Health Organization told the Wall Street Journal (9 April 2007, B1). The last major revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> laws was made in 1995 when the Food Hygiene Law of the People's Republic of China established general food safety principles. Both the State Council and the departments under the State Council can issue regulations and directives concerning food.|$|E
2500|$|When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Taft {{attempted}} {{to join the}} army but was rejected due to his poor eyesight. Instead, he joined the legal staff <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>Drug</b> Administration where he met Herbert Hoover, who became his idol. In 1918 and 1919, he was in Paris as legal adviser for the American Relief Administration, Hoover's agency to distribute food to wartorn Europe. He came to distrust governmental bureaucracy as inefficient and detrimental {{to the rights of}} the individual, a principle he promoted throughout his career. He urged membership in the League of Nations but generally distrusted European politicians. He endorsed the idea of a powerful world court to enforce international law, but no such idealized court ever existed during his lifetime. He returned to Cincinnati in late 1919, promoted Hoover for president in 1920, and opened a law firm with his brother, Charles Taft. In 1920 {{he was elected to the}} Ohio House of Representatives, where he served as Speaker of the House in 1926. In 1930, he was elected to the Ohio Senate, but was defeated for re-election in 1932; it would be the only general election defeat of his career. He was an outspoken opponent of the Ku Klux Klan, and he did not support prohibition. In 1925 he voted against a bill, sponsored by Ohio state representatives who were members of the Ku Klux Klan, to outlaw dancing on Sundays, and he led the fight against a Klan-sponsored bill requiring all Ohio public school teachers to read at least ten verses of the Bible each day in class. In his speech opposing the bill, Taft stated that religion should be taught in churches, not public schools, and while the Bible was great literature, [...] "in it religion overshadows all else." [...] The bill passed the legislature over the opposition of Taft and his allies, but it was later vetoed by Ohio's governor.|$|E
