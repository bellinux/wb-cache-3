The study used {{the sample of}} about 136 respondents, where 68 respondents came from each institution. The sample was composed of various subgroups of clients such as men and women, current clients and dropouts, old and young clients. The sample was selected using the stratified purposeful sampling procedure. Data were collected using one main method (semistructured interview) which was supplemented by document analysis. The study has grouped dropout factors under six categories: organization, business, personal, family, group and competitive factors. These factors were also grouped into two main categories, which are, adverse push factors and promising pull factors using the ideas from the theoretical framework and the Lee’s push and pull theory adopted in this study. The {{results of the study}} shows that major factors which had prompted clients’ dropout at SEDA and PTF are organization factors followed by other lesser factors under business, personal, family, group and competitive factors as presented in descending order in Chapter Four. Some of the major organizational factors which had prompted the dropout of clients at SEDA and PTF are: delay in loan disbursement, inaccessible savings, high interest rates, lack of clients care, short repayment period, deducting clients loans, dislike of repayment pressures, problems with group loans, savings do not get interest, weekly repayments, wastage of time in repayment meetings, short repayment period, lack of insurance services, factors related to credit officers, small starting loans, lack of flexibility in loan repayment and lack of training to new replacement clients. The lesser factors under business category which have affected clients’ businesses are: cholera outbreak, rift valley fever, relocation of people from Saba Saba market, seasonality factor, flood, power rationing, fire, theft and selling on credit. Factors under personal category are: multiple loans, misallocation of loan fund, resting, transfer/migration, sickness, pregnancy/giving birth, found job/employment: default, journey/travelling and death. Those under family category are: Sickness: husbands stopped their wives, husbands interdicted, giving money to family members, death and marriage failure. Those under group category are: poor repayment record, unfaith fullness of group leaders, lack of cooperation and lack of trust.

The gain to a donor that is able to make the World Bank or <b>other</b> <b>MFIs</b> adapt to this donor’s view on an issue can be substantial.

As a result, influencing MFIs may give much more leverage to a donor’s foreign assistance in the foreign policy arena than pursuing the same goals bilaterally with the same amo unt of aid. We present a model where a donor tries to influence a MFI to put pressure on a recipient to comply with the foreign policy interests of the donor. This game-theoretic multi-agent model with one donor, two MFIs and one recipient illustrates the virtue of using the multilateral as an instrument in foreign policy as seen from the powerful donor’s point of view. Similarly, we show how this strategic behavior is damaging for the recipient in particular and for development in general...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the legal forms adopted by microfinance institutions (MFIs) and their performance within three scopes: financial performance, social performance, and efficiency in resource allocation. The MFIs studied are classified into four groups: banks, non-governmental organizations, cooperatives, and a fourth group formed of for-profit institutions not characterized as banks, made up of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) and rural banks. The data used are annual and cover the six years from 2007 to 2012. The quantitative regression model with panel data was used together with dummy variables to compare between the four groups of legal forms, except for the group made up of NBFIs and rural banks, which was not represented by any dummy variable. 304 MFIs from 59 countries made up the sample. In the study it was observed that larger MFIs have higher profits, higher returns, and higher operational self-sufficiency rates than smaller MFIs, indicating that MFI growth could enable consolidation in the microfinance market. The results also indicate that for smaller MFIs the way to consolidate and improve the indicators could be through assimilating or merging with <b>other</b> <b>MFIs.</b> It was also noted that non-bank financial institutions and rural banks are able to serve more customers and that cooperatives provide smaller loans, causing a bigger social impact, and that they obtain higher returns and profits. The results indicate that these legal forms may be the most appropriate for the microfinance market...|$|R

Micro finance is the newly emerging financial industry. It has the target market of more than 1. 8 billion people in the whole world. The emphasis of this study is to analyze the prospects of micro finance industry in Pakistan. Our research stresses the need of the diverse micro financial services in order to make the micro finance banks sustainable and profitable while serving the diverse needs of the poor. MFI’s should be distinguished from the NGOs as they are not just charity organizations. The diverse products will mitigate the risk and at the same time gives a variety of services and choices to the clients. Today the reason of the loss of the most of the micro finance institutions is that they offer very few products dominantly micro credit. The study has reviewed the success factors of Kashf, a successful MFI in Pakistan and has developed its recommendations on the basis of this analysis that can be implemented on the <b>other</b> <b>MFI’s.</b> There is a demand for diverse micro financial services in Pakistan and just by meeting a very small group, Kashf has become profitable. So, if there are more innovations in the product development, this sector can become sustainable. Future of micro finance is bright in Pakistan...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the general}} {{consensus}} that the very poor have not been adequately reached by existing microfinance institutions, very little focussed research exists on the financial market participation of the very poor in general and their microfinance institutions (MFI) participation, in particular. In this paper, we {{shed some light on}} these issues by comparing the very poor who manage to participate in microfinance institutions and those who never did, by making use of a unique dataset that emerged out of the baseline study of a new BRAC programme targeted at the very poor. We find that the poorest who participate in MFIs are relatively better off than those who never participated, the causal relationship is not clear. In that sense, the targeting exclusion condition used by BRAC to exclude the poorest who were members of MFIs seems to be appropriate. However, we also find that the poorest who participate in MFIs also borrow more from informal sources suggesting that a complementary, rather than a substitution relationship exists between the two sources of finance. Moreover, the intensity of microcredit taking is lower and tendency to drop out from one and not rejoin <b>other</b> <b>MFIs</b> is higher among the very poor who participate in MFIs compared to MFI participants coming from other poverty grou ps. Given that reaching the very poor remains to be an important challenge that the global microfinance industry intends to address, {{a better understanding of the}} overall financial market participation of the very poor and exploring the differences between the very poor who manage to participate in microfinance programmes and those who do not can be important for guiding policy and practice...|$|R

Regulators do try in some countries to control this, but the ceiling varies over time. For example, in the particular case of countries of the West African Monetary Zone (Couchoro 2011), laws on usury for all financial institutions operating in the area impose ‘an usury ceiling’ not exceeding twice the discount rate of the central bank (i.e., 17 % per year). The MFIs have since obtained a waiver; the central bank has revised the law on usury. Today there are two ceilings: one for commercial banks (18 %) and the <b>other</b> for <b>MFIs</b> (27 %).

40|$|Will {{bundling}} {{savings accounts}} with loans increase {{the effectiveness of}} microfinance {{as a tool for}} alleviating poverty? Microfinance is the practice of offering small loans to poor people in developing countries. The development of this practice into a poverty dimishining, self-sustaining business won Muhammad Yunus a Nobel Prize in 2006. Today, there are thousands of microfinance institutions (MFIs) serving millions of people in developing countries. However, there is recent evidence that these loans do not help reduce poverty, and may do as much ahrm as good. In truth providing credit to the poor {{may not be enough to}} eliminate poverty. However, the micrfinance pioneered by Yunus and utilized by thousands of <b>other</b> <b>MFIs</b> is not limited to simply providing affordable credit. Other services such as business training, insurance, savings accounts, etc. are bundled with the loans. These services are offered because microfinance is not just about making profits, but helping pull people out of poverty. This paper looks at one of the non-credit services offered with most microloans: savings accounts. Through a study done with microenterprise owners in Kenya, this paper looks at the benefits of savings accounts to women who are ideal candidates for microfinance insitutions but who are not borrowers. By looking at women who are not yet borrowers, we can see if savings accounts provide enought gain to be bundled with microloans. The goal of the paper is to examine if providing participants with a safe place to keep their money will help them increase their overall financial resources and thus be able to invest more in their business. The results of the study present positive and significant increases in savings account balances for the treatment group as well as improvements in the labor supply, business investment, and consumption. These results indicate that there is a demand amongst the poor for formal savings accounts and that these accounts can improve business outcomes for microenterprise owners...|$|R

After experiencing delivery of micro-credit service {{for more than}} a decade, the organization commenced delivery of saving service to the public since the year 2012. Much is not well understood about saving behavior of clients of the organization which is the basis of delivery of the services. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to assess saving behavior of clients of BG MFI from different perspectives; including demographic, socio-economic, and institutional. A multi staged stratified random sampling technique has been used to select a total of 385 respondents from four branches operating in different geographic locations. Both secondary and primary data sources were used to gather relevant information. A structured questionnaire was designed by the researcher. An in-depth interview of all sample clients was administered through trained credit officers. Each respondent’s saving balance has been collected from secondary data source of BG MFI. The data has been analyzed through SPSS software. The findings of this study indicate that average saving balance of urban clients is higher than rural clients. Single (unmarried) client’s average saving balance is also larger than married once and educated clients save more than uneducated clients. Saver only (nonborrower) client’s average saving balance is larger than their counterpart borrower clients. It has been noticed that clients with higher income had quite higher saving balances than those with little income groups. BG needs to create more access privilege to the many un-served low income households through physical expansion of branch offices or other innovative mechanisms such as mobile banking and agent banking models.

To achieve this objective, a sample of one hundred (100) respondents was chosen randomly, which consists of highly qualified employees working in financial organizations, such as the top management of these organizations. Four types of variables were examined in the data collection process. The first type was dependent variables that included transformation of the Microfinance institutions and the Islamic financial institutions. Holistic time frame, coordination among groups and resources were acting as Moderating variables. The third set of variables examined was the intervening variables. Intervening variables included growth model of microfinance and Islamic banking practices. The last set of variables, which included the accounting practices used by these organizations, conventional banking, microfinance institutions and the awareness level in the community, are considered as independent variables. The results show that, time span of organization in Islamic banking, organizational success, offerings of microfinance services and the reasons for not exploring their potential in microfinance are all significant in their effects. Similarly the necessity of awareness programs, technological change, assistance from <b>other</b> <b>MFIs,</b> designing new accounting procedures are all statistically significant in its effect. Moreover, the impact of microfinance under the Islamic banking on improving the poor’s standard of living, equitable distribution of wealth and increasing employment opportunities are statistically significant. Similarly, integrating IMF within Islamic banking operations is also found to be statistically significant in its effect, because both have the same guiding rules. Similarly training and capacity building program were found significant, for the success of Islamic banking. Further results of the study show that less number of the people is trained in this respect. It is recommended to train the existing and future employees for success of IMF and integrate IB & MF, which will also help in equitable distribution of wealth in the society.

40|$|Purpose: Our {{main purpose}} is {{to carry out a}} {{research}} on combining microfinance with entrepreneurship for poverty alleviation, empowerment of poor and sustainable development. Target group: Students, researchers in Microfinance field, MFI’s, NGO’s and Governmental structures. Research Question: How do micro entrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship and microfinance serve as a combined tool to reduce poverty, empower people, and contribute to sustainable development in Pakistan? Approach: We used qualitative approach for research. The data have been collected through interviews which held as structured and unstructured, and as secondary sources web page of the organization, statistics of Pakistan and Book of organization have also been consulted. Delimitations: Due to distance problem between Pakistan and Sweden and, it was difficult to organize interviews at large scale from borrowers and this can reflect limited information about micro entrepreneurship. It is worthy to say here that Islamic microfinance is quite new practice and very limited data was available. With this, we mainly emphasized on microfinance and entrepreneurship as a combined tool, therefore, there is not enough discussion on Islamic microfinance. But we try to elaborate a complete picture of Islamic microfinance. Originality/value: This paper emphasizes on both Microfinance and Entrepreneurship, as case study we choose Akhuwat organization which started to give loans to poor people without interest. Also we focused on Social Entrepreneurship side of organization which challenges to <b>other</b> <b>MFI’s</b> with innovative type of loaning. Research will give a vision to Akhuwat and other micro financing organization that how they can develop activities more successfully. Future implications: During our research we investigate that there is need to carry out more research on lending methods other than solidarity group. The other area is micro entrepreneurship that needs to be more investigated by researcher because in developing countries micro business with only traditional ways will not be so successful. There will be need of more innovation in production system or in business processes. Islamic microfinance is quite new way for lending loan. It is needed that researcher of western world also do research on this method. So that clear result should come and method becomes more mature. Social Entrepreneurship also need to be discovered from many points, especially relation with profit and non for profit, public, private and nongovernmental models.

40|$|Donor {{grants and}} soft loans have been {{utilized}} by many microfinance institutions (MFIs) {{to support their}} operations. However, such grants and loans, already of limited size and availability, are becoming harder to access as the pool of global MFIs grows. Another option for MFIs is tapping international capital markets, international loan and security markets, {{but there are many}} barriers to this practice. This paper studies how MFIs and the poor who are seeking capital to foster their entrepreneurial spirits can overcome these barriers to access international capital markets and meet the growing micro finance demand. First, this paper establishes the degree of linkage between MFIs and international financial markets by reviewing the present funding condition of MFIs. It concludes that purely commercially based funding from capital markets is minimal except for some of the best managed MFIs. A huge gap exists between most <b>other</b> <b>MFIs</b> and international capital markets. Second, this palper studies the microfinance investment potential by analyzing the returns of one microfinance investment fund. It concludes that the profile of microfinance investment matches the needs of investors in capital markets. (cont.) Investors in developed countries are always looking for investment products that mitigate their portfolio volatility. This paper verifies that microfinance has an attractive profile matching these needs, and offering stable return, as well as low correlation with stocks, bonds and macroeconomic factors. Capital market investors and microfinance have the potential to build win-win relationships. One of the remaining challenges of MFIs is generating required return commensurate with risks. Third, this paper proposes securitization in a microfinance global pool as a means to overcome the barriers to connecting MFIs and the poor to capital markets. In this securitization scheme, the global pool buys microcredits from MFIs, thereby 1) increasing return, 2) enabling many MFIs to obtain funds from capital markets by sharing fixed costs of funding, 3) reducing exchange rate and geographic concentration risks, and 4) creating secondary markets and liquidity. Some challenges to securitization still need to be overcome. Nevertheless, this paper demonstrates that; securitization in the microfinance global pool will be an effective means {{to bridge the gap between}} capital markets and MFIs and the poor. by Daisuke Ueno.

40|$|AbstractThe {{literature}} on financial development and growth {{has received a}} lot of attention over the past two decades. Unlike growth, not much of consideration has been given to poverty reduction. Moreover, most of the past studies focus on bank and stock market development. The advent of microfinance institutions (MFIs) lets to think about the potential role MFIs can play in a countrywide economy. In this study, we consider to what extent banks and MFIs reduce poverty. We apply the instrumental variables approach, namely the fixed-effects two-stage least squares, to a panel of 71 developing countries over the period 2002 – 2011. Using credit to GDP as the main financial development indicator, the results indicate that banks reduce poverty when poverty is measured by the headcount ratio and poverty gap. As for the squared poverty gap, there is no significant effect of banks. On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>MFIs</b> do not appear to have any impact on poverty regardless of the measure of poverty employed. These results imply that while banks have some ability to reduce poverty, MFIs do not, at least at the aggregate level. Our results are robust to the use of assets to GDP as an alternative measure of financial development...|$|R

The microcredit crisis following from microfinance-induced suicides in 2010 in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh indicates that weak corporate governance and imprudent risk taking have far-reaching consequences. Yet, analyses of corporate governance mechanisms among microfinance institutions (MFIs) remain underdeveloped. As a response, this study examines the impact of CEO power on MFI risk taking by deriving explicit predictions of this effect from a characterization of the microfinance industry. Based on a sample of 280 microfinance institutions, our results suggest that powerful CEOs of microfinance non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have more decision-making freedom than powerful CEOs of <b>other</b> types of <b>MFIs.</b> This induces them to make more extreme decisions that increase risk. Furthermore, the decision-making freedom powerful CEOs have in NGOs appears to lead to worse decisions, because the presence of powerful CEOs in microfinance NGOs is associated with lower performance...|$|R
40|$|Bangladesh is {{considered}} as a birthplace of modern microfinance movement. This movement has mainly been instigated by the various microfinance institutions irrespective of their size. This paper focuses on such an innovative microfinance institution namely SafeSave (SS). SS is definitely unique in that they have adopted {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) and built competence in dealing with vulnerable slum dwellers as a client even though they are a small firm in the market. This study compared the operational uniqueness and performance of SS among large MFIs equipped with ICT and small MFIs without ICT experience. In this context statistical analysis such as unpaired t-test and regression analysis were conducted. Customer satisfaction of SS was higher than <b>other</b> types of <b>MFIs</b> which showed the important lesson for small MFIs without ICT experience. Even though SS is innovative, there are scope to improve the operational mechanism by better management and more efficient information and communication technologies. </p...|$|R
40|$|In the past, the {{microfinance}} industry focused {{mainly on}} growth and outreach. Addressing financial exclusion implied a huge supply gap. Recent over-indebtedness crises {{in several countries}} have shown that this gap can turn into over-supply. The industry urgently requires research to understand the magnitude and consequences of this shift. This chapter reveals the broad spectrum of consequences over-indebtedness can have on borrowers and <b>other</b> stakeholders, mainly <b>MFIs.</b> It emphasizes that over-indebtedness consequences reach far beyond the risk management concerns that MFIs and investors have {{on top of their}} mind. In a second step the chapter reviews the existing empirical research on microfinance over-indebtedness and examines how prevalent over-indebtedness is in microfinance markets today. It highlights the evidence for over-indebtedness in crisis markets and non-crisis markets, especially when markets mature. Only if the extent of the problem is known and its effects are properly understood, can the microfinance industry develop appropriate measures against over-indebtedness and adapt to the challenge of oversupply. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|These units work {{together}} to take a specific task, such as [...] "fly forward", as an input and signals are sent through to both wings to produce a calibrated output to perform the task. This is a more in depth view {{of the flow of}} operations; the initial visual system analyzes the location in three-dimensional space, through computing the displacement between objects and itself. The fly is then chosen to execute a task, i.e. [...] "find an object" [...] or [...] "explore". Unlike <b>other</b> UAVs, the <b>MFI</b> has to have an autonomous computer system because it is too small to be controlled by a remote, so it must be able to sustain itself. Once the action has been chosen the signal moves on to the inertial system to then distribute the specific functions, in respect to the action, to the wings. The wings then use a number of sensors to deliver the most accurate wing thrusts to fulfill the action.|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} of this dissertation {{are based on}} a quantitative and qualitative survey that was conducted to assess the contribution of microcredit access of women to production and household food security status, and the factors associated with enterprise performance and food security outcomes. In order to do so four main issues were addressed: (a) assessment of the borrowing context and the match or mismatch between lender and borrower goals and objectives; (b) the extent to which taking microcredit affected business input expenditures and performance of non-farm MEs; (c) the extent to which taking microcredit affected production input expenditures and outputs from farming activities; (d) the changes in household food security associated with microcredit. The study was conducted among female microcredit clients of BRAC, one of the largest micro lenders in Uganda. The overall study design was a panel approach, involving two waves of data collection. In one analytical approach, baseline data for a group of existing borrowers (Old borrowers=OB) and incoming borrowers (New borrowers=NB) before they received their first loan, was used in a quasi-experimental cross-sectional design to assess the effect of borrowing as {{the difference between the two}} groups using propensity score matching (PSM). In an alternative approach, two waves of data for the NB and a control group (CG) of women who never borrowed from BRAC or <b>other</b> <b>MFI,</b> was subjected to difference-in-difference analysis (DID), with Kernel matching, to assess differences between borrowers and non-borrowers. We found that BRAC reaches poor, less educated subsistence farmers who also run diverse non-farm microenterprises (MEs). The group-lending model BRAC uses is effective in ensuring loan repayment. However, much as BRAC gives out production loans, many women borrow to meet lump-sum monetary needs, in addition to investment in non-farm MEs. High costs of borrowing, limited loan amounts, the stress caused by weekly loan repayment and resolution of lump-sum cash needs were identified as reasons for women to stop borrowing. The diversion of loans to non-production activities, the size and types of businesses, and loan terms and processes were identified and factors that could diminish the contribution of microcredit to ME expansion and income increase. Assessment of the effect of borrowing on non-farm ME performance revealed that much as borrowers invested reasonable fractions of received loans into non-farm MEs leading to improvement in monetary worth, the borrowing context, loan repayment terms, type and size of microenterprises did favour higher profits. In regard to farm production, borrowing did not lead to extra recurrent crop and animal production expenditures. The prevailing subsistence nature of crop and animal production did not seem to favour extra investment. As such, borrowing did not improve household food availability, through own production. Assessment of the effect of borrowing on household food security revealed a decline in food security following the uptake of microcredit. The analysis reveals robustly lower dietary diversity among long-time borrowers than among new borrowers, and larger reductions in dietary diversity scores among new borrowers, after one year, compared to controls. The reduction in dietary diversity was traced to a reduction in animal-source food, fruit and sugar intake. This was partly explained by observation of an apparent shift from own production to reliance on food purchase by households, which is not accompanied by substantial increase in income. Overall, we found that taking microcredit did not lead to improved farm and non-farm production or food security among the rural women borrowers studied. This was mainly attributed to nature of activities the women engage in, the loan terms and processes, and the local context the women operate under...|$|R

The definitive version is available from Wiley at: [URL] microfinance has been coming under public and media attacks. The microcredit crisis following from microfinance-induced suicides in 2010 in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh indicates that weak corporate governance and imprudent risk taking have far-reaching consequences.

40|$|Complex {{problems}} may require sophisticated, non-linear learning {{methods such as}} kernel machines or deep neural networks to achieve {{state of the art}} prediction accuracies. However, high prediction accuracies are not the only objective to consider when solving problems using machine learning. Instead, particular scientific applications require some explanation of the learned prediction function. Unfortunately, most methods do not come with out of the box straight forward interpretation. Even linear prediction functions are not straight forward to explain if features exhibit complex correlation structure. In this paper, we propose the Measure of Feature Importance (MFI). MFI is general and can be applied to any arbitrary learning machine (including kernel machines and deep learning). MFI is intrinsically non-linear and can detect features that by itself are inconspicuous and only impact the prediction function through their interaction with <b>other</b> features. Lastly, <b>MFI</b> can be used for both [...] - model-based feature importance and instance-based feature importance (i. e, measuring the importance of a feature for a particular data point).

40|$|The {{deactivation}} of the 10 -membered ring zeolites MFI, FER and TON was studied {{during the}} skeletal isomerization of n-butene {{in the presence}} of butadiene. The rate of deactivation per butadiene molecule was found to increase with the concentration of butadiene and the contact time. It decreased {{in the presence of}} Pt and hydrogen. FER and TON deactivated much faster than MFI. This was attributed to two factors: (i) Deactivation of TON occurred by pore-blocking, whereas direct poisoning of the acid sites by coke deposits took place on MFI. In the case of FER, coke was only deposited in the 10 -membered ring channels, whereas the access to the 8 -membered ring channels was blocked. (ii) The build-up of carbonaceous deposits on MFI was slower than that on the <b>other</b> zeolites, because <b>MFI</b> had a high activity for cracking oligomeric coke-precursors into smaller fragments, which desorbed. Although this cracking activity is responsible for the moderate selectivity of MFI for butene isomerization, it is beneficial with respect to the stability against deactivation by butadiene...|$|R
40|$|Microfinance, {{defined as}} “a credit {{methodology}} that employs effective collateral substitutes to deliver and recover short-term, working capital loans to microentrepreneurs,” 1 has demonstrated {{success as a}} poverty reduction strategy. Microfinance was initially developed by and is today still primarily deployed by non-government organizations (NGOs) who receive donor funds and on- lend to microfinance clients (often at subsidized interest rates). In many cases, governments also play a critical role—setting policy for the microfinance industry (most frequently vis-à-vis interest rates), providing lump sum grants to NGOs or <b>other</b> microfinance institutions (<b>MFIs),</b> or lending directly to the poor. Credit unions, cooperatives, commercial banks, and small informal groups (self help groups—SHGs) are other important players in microfinance. The critical challenge now is to make microfinance a sustainable and ubiquitous methodology. “Scaling up ” will require increasing the scope (number of individuals reached), impact (effect on the well-being of borrowers), and depth (ability to reach {{the poorest of the}} poor) of microfinance. The idea is to make microfinance available not just to the moderate poor at whom it has traditionally been targeted, but also to the extreme poor and the vulnerable non-poor, and to expand the set of microfinancial products offered. ...|$|R
5000|$|After MFI's {{request was}} made public, only Genshiken, whose fansubs had been {{completed}} before the notifications, and Kimi ga Nozomu Eien were licensed in the US. <b>MFI's</b> <b>other</b> major projects, including Pugyuru and Akane Maniax, were not picked up by American distributors. The lack of buzz that surrounded these titles has been linked by fansub supporters to MFI's suppression of fan distribution. They argue that by cutting off this means of [...] "free advertisement," [...] MFI has alienated fans who would normally buy their products after they were licensed and kept the shows from being as widely exposed as they might otherwise be. The end result, say fansub supporters, is a reduced interest from American anime companies {{and a loss of}} revenue for the studio. However, in August 2006, School Rumble was finally licensed by Funimation thanks to popularity of the series garnered from its manga release by Del Rey. It took the series over 2 years to be licensed, which was normal for anime licenses around 2002.

40|$|A {{continuing}} {{problem facing}} SACCOS {{is how to}} attain financial sustainability. Different study has been conducted but no one conducted in Ilala Municipality. Identification of the determinants of SACCOS’ financial sustainability was not done. This study aimed to bridge this knowledge gap. The study used both qualitative and quantitative research methodology. Data was collected through questionnaires and interviews from respondents who selected through purposive and convenience sampling techniques. Collected data was analysed through SSPS software. The study found that portfolio at risk, the cost per borrower and operating self-sufficiency were among the major factors that determine financial sustainability of the surveyed SACCOS. The study noticed that majority of SACCOS have their portfolios at risk of default, while only few of them are close to being self sustaining operationally. However, this study strongly qualifies that the surveyed SACCOS are highly efficient in absolute terms because they spend below the African average cost per borrower. <b>Other</b> factors determining <b>MFI</b> sustainability were productivity and delinquency rate. This study makes contribution to the knowledge by recommends reduction of default in loan repayment by monitoring borrowers regularly so as {{to ensure that they}} use the loans they received for the agreed and intended objective. Moreover, relevant and comprehensive training should be provided to loan officers...|$|R
