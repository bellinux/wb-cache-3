On the other hand, the dependent variable is the quality <b>of</b> financial <b>statement</b> (Y). Data were analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis (multiple regression). The results indicate that human resources competence, information technology, review <b>of</b> financial <b>statement</b> and internal control system simultaneously have a significant influence on the quality <b>of</b> financial <b>statement.</b> The value <b>of</b> the coefficient of determination shows that human resources competence, information technology, review <b>of</b> financial <b>statement</b> and internal control system simultaneously contribute to the quality <b>of</b> financial <b>statement.</b> R 2 is 71. 3 %, it means those dependent variables affect the quality <b>of</b> financial <b>statement</b> by 71. 3 %.
