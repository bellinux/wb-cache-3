500|$|The {{emperor penguin}} has a {{circumpolar}} {{distribution in the}} Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66° and 77° south latitudes. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to [...] offshore. Breeding colonies are usually located in areas where ice cliffs and icebergs shelter them from the wind. Three land colonies have been reported: one (now disappeared) on a shingle spit at the Dion Islands on the Antarctic Peninsula, one on a headland at Taylor Glacier in Victoria Land, and most recently one at Amundsen Bay. Since 2009, a number of colonies have been reported <b>on</b> <b>shelf</b> ice rather than sea ice, in some cases moving to the shelf in years when sea ice forms late.|$|E

2500|$|The poem {{is known}} {{only from a}} single manuscript, which is {{estimated}} to date from close to AD 1000, in which it appears with other works. The Beowulf manuscript {{is known as the}} Nowell Codex, gaining its name from 16th-century scholar Laurence Nowell. The official designation is [...] "British Library, Cotton Vitellius A.XV" [...] because it was one of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton's holdings in the Cotton library {{in the middle of the}} 17th century. Many private antiquarians and book collectors, such as Sir Robert Cotton, used their own library classification systems. [...] "Cotton Vitellius A.XV" [...] translates as: the 15th book from the left <b>on</b> <b>shelf</b> A (the top shelf) of the bookcase with the bust of Roman Emperor Vitellius standing on top of it, in Cotton's collection. Kevin Kiernan argues that Nowell most likely acquired it through William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, in 1563, when Nowell entered Cecil's household as a tutor to his ward, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.|$|E

The air stole {{into the streets}} of towns, And betrayed the fund of joy To the high-school and medalled boy: On from hall to chamber ran, From youth to maid, from boy to man, To babes, and to old eyes as well. 'Once more,' the old man cried, 'ye clouds, Airy turrets purple-piled, Which once my infancy beguiled, Beguile me with the wonted spell. I know ye skilful to convoy The total freight of hope and joy Into rude and homely nooks, Shed mocking lustres <b>on</b> <b>shelf</b> of books, On farmer's byre, on meadow-pipes, Or on a pool of dancing chips. I care not if the pomps you show Be what they soothfast appear, Or if yon realms in sunset glow Be bubbles of the atmosphere.

The world hath overmuch of pain,-- If Nature give me joy again, Of such deceit I'll not complain.' ...|$|E
