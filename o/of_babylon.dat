5|$|Although the Cylinder clearly post-dates Cyrus the Great's conquest <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> in 539 BC, {{the date}} of its {{creation}} is unclear. It is commonly said to date to {{the early part of}} Cyrus's reign over Babylon, some time after 539 BC. The British Museum puts the Cylinder's date of origin at between 539–530 BC.|$|E
5|$|The main {{intention}} of the tour was to transform Madonna's old hits musically and display her capacity for transformation and self-reflection. The tour was initially known as the Whore <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> World Tour, although Madonna later denied using this name. The idea was to portray Madonna as the Whore <b>of</b> <b>Babylon,</b> the figure of evil as mentioned in the Book of Revelation. However it was later changed to the Re-Invention World Tour, {{to make it a}} self-confident dig at all the critics and people who have expressed their views about Madonna re-inventing her image over the years. The official tour poster displayed Madonna in a vintage bolero gown and a large French Renaissance-like hair-bun. Air-conditioning was turned off during the tour on Madonna's request as she claimed it dried up her throat during singing.|$|E
5|$|According to the British Museum, the Cyrus Cylinder {{reflects}} {{a long tradition}} in Mesopotamia where, from {{as early as the}} third millennium BC, kings began their reigns with declarations of reforms. Cyrus's declaration stresses his legitimacy as the king, and is a conspicuous statement of his respect for the religious and political traditions <b>of</b> <b>Babylon.</b> The British Museum and scholars of the period describe it as an instrument of ancient Mesopotamian propaganda.|$|E

5|$|Sidon {{returned}} to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13years (586–573BC) by the Chaldean king NebuchadnezzarII. Nevertheless, the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court <b>of</b> <b>Babylon.</b> Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia's chief city in the Achaemenid Empire (529–333BC). During this period, XerxesI awarded king EshmunazarII with the Sharon plain for employing Sidon's fleet in his service during the Greco-Persian Wars.|$|E
5|$|The master founder {{initially}} {{tried to}} sell his services to the Byzantines, who were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him. Orban then left Constantinople and approached Mehmed II, claiming that his weapon could blast 'the walls <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> itself'. Given abundant funds and materials, the Hungarian engineer built the gun within three months at Edirne, from which it was dragged by sixty oxen to Constantinople. In the meantime, Orban also produced other cannons instrumental for the Turkish siege forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{text on the}} Cylinder praises Cyrus, {{sets out}} his {{genealogy}} and portrays him as a king from a line of kings. The Babylonian king Nabonidus, who was defeated and deposed by Cyrus, is denounced as an impious oppressor {{of the people of}} Babylonia and his low-born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus' kingly heritage. The victorious Cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by the chief Babylonian god Marduk to restore peace and order to the Babylonians. The text states that Cyrus was welcomed by the people <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> as their new ruler and entered the city in peace. It appeals to Marduk to protect and help Cyrus and his son Cambyses. It extols Cyrus as a benefactor of the citizens of Babylonia who improved their lives, repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries across Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the region. It concludes with a description of how Cyrus repaired the city wall <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king.|$|E

5|$|Several {{artists have}} applied Ovid's account to new {{translations}} or reworkings, or adapted {{the story for}} the stage. British poet Ted Hughes (1930–1998) used the myth in his 1997 work Tales from Ovid (1997) which was a loose translation and retelling of twenty-four tales from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Both Israeli dramatist Hanoch Levin (in The Great Whore <b>of</b> <b>Babylon)</b> and English playwright Joanna Laurens (in The Three Birds) wrote plays based on the story. Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer James Dillon in 2004 and a 1964 vocal composition by American composer Milton Babbitt with text by John Hollander.|$|E
5|$|The Code of Hammurabi was {{inscribed on}} a stele {{and placed in}} a public place so that all could see it, {{although}} it is thought that few were literate. The stele was later plundered by the Elamites and removed to their capital, Susa; it was rediscovered there in 1901 in Iran and is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The code of Hammurabi contained 282 laws, written by scribes on 12 tablets. Unlike earlier laws, it was written in Akkadian, the daily language <b>of</b> <b>Babylon,</b> and could therefore be read by any literate person in the city.|$|E

5|$|The Cylinder {{itself is}} part of a {{continuous}} Mesopotamian tradition of depositing a wide variety of symbolic items, including animal sacrifices, stone tablets, terracotta cones, cylinders and figures. Newly crowned kings <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> would make public declarations of their own righteousness when beginning their reigns, often in the form of declarations that were deposited in the foundations of public buildings. Some contained messages, while others did not, and they had a number of purposes: elaboration of a building's value, commemoration of the ruler or builder and the magical sanctification of the building, through the invocation of divine protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{hegemony of}} Yamhad {{affected}} Qatna's economy; the trade route connecting Mesopotamia and Mari to Qatna through Palmyra lost its importance, while the trade routes from the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia {{came under the}} full control of Aleppo, contributing to Qatna's loss of wealth. Following the destruction of Mari by Hammurabi <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> around 1761 BC, information about Qatna becomes scarce; in the late 17th century BC, Yamhad invaded and defeated Qatna {{during the reign of}} Yarim-Lim III. The political and commercial importance of Qatna declined quickly during the Late Bronze Age (LB I), around 1600 BC, as a result of growing Egyptian and Mitannian influences. Numerous small states appeared in the region and detached from Qatna.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Egypt venerated the lioness (the fierce hunter) {{as their}} war deities and {{among those in}} the Egyptian pantheon are, Bast, Mafdet, Menhit, Pakhet, Sekhmet, Tefnut, and the Sphinx; The lion was a {{prominent}} symbol in ancient Mesopotamia (from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times), where it was strongly associated with kingship. The classic Babylonian lion motif, found as a statue, carved or painted on walls, {{is often referred to}} as the striding lion <b>of</b> <b>Babylon.</b> The Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal is a famous sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs from c. 640 BC, now in the British Museum. The Nemean lion was symbolic in Ancient Greece and Rome, represented as the constellation and zodiac sign Leo, and described in mythology, where its skin was borne by the hero Heracles.|$|E
5|$|Hammurabi was an Amorite First Dynasty {{king of the}} {{city-state}} <b>of</b> <b>Babylon,</b> and {{inherited the}} power from his father, Sin-Muballit, in c. 1792 BC. Babylon {{was one of the}} many largely Amorite ruled city-states that dotted the central and southern Mesopotamian plains and waged war on each other for control of fertile agricultural land. Though many cultures co-existed in Mesopotamia, Babylonian culture gained a degree of prominence among the literate classes throughout the Middle East under Hammurabi. The kings who came before Hammurabi had founded a relatively minor City State in 1894 BC which controlled little territory outside of the city itself. Babylon was overshadowed by older, larger and more powerful kingdoms such as Elam, Assyria, Isin, Eshnunna and Larsa for a century or so after its founding. However his father Sin-Muballit had begun to consolidate rule of a small area of south central Mesopotamia under Babylonian hegemony and, by the time of his reign, had conquered the minor city-states of Borsippa, Kish, and Sippar.|$|E
5|$|Shamshi-Adad most {{dangerous}} alliance was with Qatna, whose king Ishi-Addu, became Assyria's agent at Yamhad borders and married {{his daughter to}} Yasmah-Adad, {{the son of the}} Assyrian king who was installed by his father as king of Mari. Sumu-Epuh was apparently killed during his fight with Shamshi-Adad and was succeeded by his son Yarim-Lim I, who consolidated his father's kingdom and turned it into the most powerful kingdom in Syria and northern Mesopotamia. Yarim-Lim surrounded Shamshi-Adad by alliances with Hammurabi <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> and Ibal-pi-el II of Eshnunna, then in 1777 BC he advanced to the east conquering Tuttul and installing Zimri-Lim as governor of the city. The death of the Assyrian king came a year later. Yarim-Lim then sent his army with Zimri-Lim, to restore his ancestors throne as an ally-vassal to Yamhad, cementing the relationship through a dynastic marriage between the new Mariote king and Shibtu, the daughter of Yarim-Lim.|$|E

5|$|The Nassers and Naify {{contracted}} with Pflueger in early 1926 to build three large movie theaters in central California cities. They assigned Pflueger {{the design of}} the Tulare Theatre (1927) in Tulare, the Senator Theatre (1928) in Chico and the State Theatre (1928) in Oroville. The $250,000 Tulare Theatre (now demolished) featured motifs based on the Ishtar Gate <b>of</b> <b>Babylon.</b> Pflueger included zigzag patterns in the twin-towered facade trimmed in neon accents, and brought Streamline Moderne stylings to the interior via sweeping curves in steel banister railings as well as Mayan touches in the stepped mirrors. The $250,000 State Theatre appeared Spanish Colonial with its tiled roof and concrete bas-relief exterior, but turned to Streamline Moderne in a 1,529-seat interior that featured chrome railings, plush carpet and indirect lighting. Aztec elements were incorporated in the proscenium design. The $300,000 Senator Theatre was delayed in construction by the discovery of running water under the foundation, a condition that required channelization and pumps. The movie palace's eclectic theme was largely Egyptian with Moorish, Asian and Aztec details dominated by a landmark tower topped by a giant faceted amber glass gem lit from within.|$|E
5|$|The text is a royal {{building}} inscription, a genre {{which had}} no equivalent in Old Persian literature. It illustrates how Cyrus co-opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control <b>of</b> <b>Babylon.</b> Many elements of the text were drawn from long-standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia: the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by the gods for his wickedness; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor, addressing {{the welfare of the}} people; the sanctuaries of the gods are rebuilt or restored, offerings to the gods are made or increased and the blessings of the gods are sought; and repairs are made to the whole city, in the manner of earlier rightful kings.|$|E
5|$|Yarim-Lim I was {{succeeded by}} his son Hammurabi I who had a {{peaceful}} reign. He was able to force Charchemish into submission, and sent troops to aid Hammurabi <b>of</b> <b>Babylon</b> against Larsa and Elam. The alliance ended after the Babylonian king sacked Mari and destroyed it. Babylon did not attack Yamhad, however, and {{the relations between the}} two kingdoms remained peaceful in later years; the power vacuum caused by Mari's fall opened the way for Hammurabi to extend Yamhad's hegemony over the upper Khabur valley in the east, where the ruler of Shubat Enlil became his vassal. Hammurabi I was succeeded {{by his son}} Abba-El I, whose reign witnessed the rebellion of the city Irridu, which was under the authority of prince Yarim-Lim, Abba-El's brother. The king responded to the rebellion by destroying Irridu, and compensating his brother by giving him the throne of Alalakh, thus creating a cadet branch of the dynasty.|$|E
