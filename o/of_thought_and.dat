5|$|In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians {{developed}} {{the idea that}} the grammars of all languages were a reflection of the universal basics <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>and</b> therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics. The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.|$|E

The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul.

Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> reflection.|$|E

5|$|Freedom for the Thought That We Hate: A Biography of the First Amendment is a 2007 non-fiction book by {{journalist}} Anthony Lewis {{about freedom}} of speech, {{freedom of the}} press, freedom <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>and</b> the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The book starts by quoting the First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from creating legislation which limits free speech or freedom of the press. Lewis traces the evolution of civil liberties in the U.S. through key historical events. He {{provides an overview of}} important free speech case law, including U.S. Supreme Court opinions in Schenck v. United States (1919), Whitney v. California (1927), United States v. Schwimmer (1929), New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and New York Times Co. v. United States (1971).|$|E
5|$|However, the {{widespread}} use of antipsychotic drugs has long been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive by people who have to take them, because they produce a general dullness <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{discussion}} in this article has focused on one style or tradition of philosophy in modern Western culture, usually called analytic philosophy (sometimes described as Anglo-American philosophy). Many other schools of thought exist, however, which are sometimes subsumed under the broad (and vague) label of continental philosophy. In any case, though topics and methods here are numerous, {{in relation to the}} philosophy of mind the various schools that fall under this label (phenomenology, existentialism, etc.) can globally be seen to differ from the analytic school in that they focus less on language and logical analysis alone but also take in other forms of understanding human existence and experience. With reference specifically to {{the discussion}} of the mind, this tends to translate into attempts to grasp the concepts <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> perceptual experience in some sense that does not merely involve the analysis of linguistic forms.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} literary writings in India, composed between 1700 BCE and 1200 CE, {{were in the}} Sanskrit language. Prominent {{works of}} this Sanskrit literature include epics such as the Mahābhārata and the Ramayana, the dramas of Kālidāsa such as the Abhijñānaśākuntalam (The Recognition of Śakuntalā), and poetry such as the Mahākāvya. Kamasutra, the famous book about sexual intercourse also originated in India. Developed between 600 BCE and 300 CE in South India, the Sangam literature, consisting of 2,381 poems, {{is regarded as a}} predecessor of Tamil literature. From the 14th to the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the emergence of devotional poets such as Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a varied and wide spectrum <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works differed significantly from classical traditions. In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the works of Bengali poet and novelist Rabindranath Tagore, who was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> <b>and</b> social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common genetic adaptation that protects against Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTrauma-focused {{cognitive}} {{behaviour therapy}} {{is effective in}} treating posttraumatic stress disorder but non-response rates range between 25 % and 50 %. Results of previous research on patient characteristics predicting outcome are inconsistent and mainly focused on demographic and diagnostic variables. This study examined whether behavioural predictors of poor treatment response {{can be observed in}} early sessions. It was predicted that greater patient perseveration, lower expression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings and weaker therapeutic alliance would be associated with poorer outcomes. We also explored the relationships of patient behaviours with therapeutic alliance and the efficiency and competence of treatment delivery. Audio or video recordings of the initial treatment sessions of 58 patients who had shown either good (n =  34) or poor response (n =  24) to cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD, Ehlers & Clark, 2000) were blindly coded for patient perseveration, expression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings, therapeutic alliance, efficiency and competency of treatment delivery and therapist competence. Poor responders showed more perseveration <b>and</b> less expression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings in the initial session. Patient perseveration <b>and</b> low expression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>and</b> feelings were associated with poorer therapeutic alliance and compromised treatment delivery. Patients with these behavioural characteristics may benefit from additional treatment strategies. Limitations of the study and implications for clinical practice are discussed...|$|R
