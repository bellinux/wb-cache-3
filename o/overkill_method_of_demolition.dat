The main girders weighed about 90 tons each, {{and the total}} weight of steel in the structure was about 3,150 tons. The <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> adopted was to burn off first {{as much of the}} steel decking as possible, allowing the material to fall lo the ground below; the girders were then tilted outwards by jacks on top of the brick piers until they overbalanced and fell to the ground. They were then cut up where they lay.|$|R

40|$|The {{study on}} the {{relative}} abundance of Amblyomma Boophilus microplus & cajennense was conducted in 32 colonies, divided into two ecological zones (ZE) and two rainfall regimes {{in the area of}} Yucumo, Beni, Bolivia. Visits were made every twenty day to collect mite of cattle population using the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>demolition.</b> The total number of mite was considered, the total number of ectoparasites sampled from each animal and all animals were added to each colony sampled, the value of each animal was divided it between all the animals of each colony to determine the average number of ticks per colony. Was detected B. microplus in all the colonies, during the months of May to October (2008). Statistical analysis was done for comparison of means and no differences were found between ZE, colonies for Boophilus microplus, Amblyomma cajennense as is found in association with the Boophilus microplus on the prairie. Although there were no differences between production systems, it emphasizes that the relative frequency of infestation of cattle in the ZE studied is very similar except for the colony August 6 ZE corresponding to the ridge which has elevated mite per animal. The need is to develop work which show the diversity of this important group of arthropods in the settlement area Yucumo, General José Province Ballivián, Beni, Bolivia, taking into account the possibility that these cause public health problems not only in animals, but that they affect humans...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{problems}} arising {{during construction}} and restructuring of {{buildings and structures}} in urban areas are considered in the article. A brief analysis of the knowhow used {{in the course of}} construction and restructuring of new and old construction facilities shows that the construction works that are most hazardous to the environment consist in <b>demolition</b> <b>of</b> buildings or their parts using the explosive <b>method</b> <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> and stone dressing using high-speed cutting and grinding machines. These types of work generate a lot of construction waste and dust harmful for the environment. Despite any scheduled environmental protection actions, construction wastes pollute each component of the environment to a different extent. Environmental protection is a complex problem of vital importance, and the international community must concentrate its efforts to tackle it as soon as possible. Analysis of unauthorized landfills and <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> urban waste management help local communities to develop and implement <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> environmental protection. New effective know-hows are employed to reduce the impact of soil pollutants and to prevent further pollution of urban ponds in the course of construction works within urban areas. Advanced patented methodologies have been developed at Samara State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering. They include the use of quick-setting substances capable of generating impervious elements. Implementation <b>of</b> these <b>methods</b> will reduce pollution of urban areas, their atmosphere, ground waters and ponds. The authors also describe particular aspects of the impact produced by the mining industry on the environment. Values of river water quality indices have been studied, and new effective actions aimed at protection of ponds from pollution are proposed. The actions prevent access of pollutants to the pond.

40|$|Article {{is devoted}} to the process of {{decommissioning}} nuclear power plant with reactor by type VVER. Now the world wide experience of carrying out these works, as the design life of most reactors have not reached yet, and those that came out ? was extended. The process involves decontaminating the facility to reduce residual radioactivity, dismantling the structures, removing contaminated materials to appropriate disposal facilities, storing used nuclear fuel until it can be removed from the site for disposal or consolidated storage, and releasing the property for other uses. Any nuclear power plant needs to be decommissioned, so this topic has relevance, considering the lack of sufficient experience. Given the <b>method</b> <b>of</b> optimization <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> works upon decommissioning. On the basis <b>of</b> this <b>method</b> created the program described in the article that calculates possible options for dismantling. The result is a lighting value of each of the options and their description. The options include such characteristics as: the number of employees, their qualifications, the necessary time to complete the work. The example of the calculation of the dismantling of the emergency cooling subsystems. The result is both qualitative and quantitative. The author focuses on the importance of the optimization of dismantling it for the purpose of saving financial resources. Also the program which was created by author of this article could have practice using because there aren?t enough tools which can help during decommissioning. The nuclear energy industry has proven that it has the technology, resources and expertise to successfully decommission commercial nuclear reactors. ?????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????? ? ????????? ????. ?????? ? ???? ?? ??????? ???? ?????????? ?????? ?????, ??? ??? ????????? ???? ???????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??? ?? ?????, ? ???, ??? ????? ? ??? ???????. ????? ?????????? ?????? ???? ??????? ?? ????????????, ??????? ?????? ???? ????? ????????????, ???????? ??? ? ?????????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????. ???????? ????? ??????????? ??????????? ????? ??? ?????? ? ????????????. ?? ?????? ??????? ?????? ??????? ?????????, ??????? ??????????? ? ??????, ??? ??????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????. ??????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?? ????????? ? ?? ????????. ? ???????? ????????? ????????? ????? ?????????????? ???: ?????????? ???????????, ?? ????????????, ??????????? ????? ?? ?????????? ??????. ?????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????????. ????????? ????? ??? ????????????, ??? ? ?????????????? ????????. ????? ??????????? ???????? ?? ???????? ??????????? ??????????? ????? ?????? ? ????? ???????? ?????????? ????????...|$|R

40|$|The {{demolition}} {{project is}} reasonably labour-intensive and the shortage <b>of</b> qualified <b>demolition</b> contractors resulted in poor workmanship in many demolition projects. The current performance assessment <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> contractors in Malaysia is highly based on subjective evaluation {{while a few}} of authorities and clients incorporated contractor past performance within the quality assessment process. This {{is due to the}} lack of an assessment framework that can supports the evaluation process <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> contractors. However, different contractor’s quality assessment methods have been successfully developed, but, there has been limited effort to view complexity parameters in the process of evaluation. Hence, it made it necessary to identify an appropriate assessment criteria in order to evaluate the quality <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> contractor’s performance in a structured way along with considering the complexity <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> project. This research first applied the Delphi method as a scientific means to collect the required information for developing of the assessment framework, which constitutes thirty performance indicators for demolition contractors. Then, an assessment method has been developed in the form of a hybrid Quality Function Deployment (QFD) and Cybernetic Analytic Network Process (CANP) model for demolition contractors. This involves the use of QFD to translate the customer’s expectations into assessment indicators and the CANP to weight the expectations and assessment criteria. Three different case studies were used to demonstrate the implementation of the model and the results indicated that despite the extensive consideration on cost and time in the assessment <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> contractors, the safety indicators were rated as the most significant Malaysian clients’ expectations for quality assessment <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> contractor. The results also show that, the project complexity indicators, comparatively received high priority in the quality assessment <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> contractors among all other indicators. In conclusion, this research has demonstrated that the developed hybrid model is an effective tool for assessing the quality <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> contractor’s performance and it is hoped that the research work may provide a first step into a better customer-driven demolition project, and eventually increase the quality <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> projects over time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Construction {{activity}} in South Korea must entail the process <b>of</b> <b>demolition.</b> There {{is such a}} high sense of awareness {{of the importance of}} managing ever-increasing quantities <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> waste. To ensure efficient management <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> waste, it is critical to quantitatively estimate the amount <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> waste. Based on such need, this study examined the sub-divided categorization models to predict the amount <b>of</b> <b>demolition</b> waste generation rates (DWGs). For the execution of study, the present researchers collected the data on DWGs from 394 buildings based on the mass balance principles. On the basis of the collected DWGs data, ANOVA analysis was performed to compare mean differences in structure and wall materials. Results of the analysis showed that the amount of DWGs varied, depending on the structure of buildings and the wall materials used. The results also indicated that describing even a single type of DWGs discarded from buildings would require multiple estimation models for demolition waste generation. 1...|$|R
