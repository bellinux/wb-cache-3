40|$|A {{company would}} respond {{accurately}} to changes occurring in today's global and liberal era. Employees {{should not only}} work hard but also be smart. Besides, {{they have to get}} support from their leaders and to understand the organizational structure so that they will not regard themselves more important than others or vice versa. This research is aimed at observing how commitment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders, understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational structure and empowerment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> affect <b>the</b> organizational climate and the employees' performance; {{this is due to the}} fact that <b>the</b> goal <b>of</b> any organization is to increase its operational results. The operational results, however, are dependent upon <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> and supported by conducive organizational climate. <b>The</b> variables <b>of</b> commitment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders, understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational structure, and empowerment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> are predicted to affect organizational climate, either individually or simultaneously. It is also predicted that <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> is affected by the climate. <b>The</b> commitment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders, understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational structure, and empowerment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> might refine <b>the</b> organizational climate. Climate in organization is determined by <b>the</b> style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders; how they direct and reward their employees. It is also affected by the empowerment and involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> employees; once <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> get involved, they feel honored. In addition, climate is closely related to the organizational structure. Previous studies show that centralization and conflict in organization affect the organizational climate which in turn influences <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees.</b> <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> this research shows that <b>the</b> commitment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders, understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational structure, and empowerment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> influence significantly <b>the</b> organizational climate (p= 0. 000) with <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> 0. 681. Partially, <b>the</b> variables <b>of</b> commitment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders, understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational structure, and empowerment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> affect <b>the</b> organizational climate (≥ 0. 05) significantly. Likewise, the organizational climate affects significantly (p= 0. 000) the employees' performance (p= 0. 000) with <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> 0. 763. Therefore, it can be concluded that variables <b>of</b> commitment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaders, understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational structure, and empowerment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employees</b> affect <b>the</b> employees' performance via an intervening variable, organizational climate. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organizational climate makes the relation between variable X and Y stronger...|$|R
25|$|If an {{employee}} creates a copyrightable {{work in the}} course of his duties vis-à-vis his employer, it is the employee who initially holds the copyright. The law stipulates, however, an automatic transfer of the economic rights to the employer, unless proven otherwise. Employers are required to pay the author royalties for each and every use of the work, but the parties are free to determine this fee and may set it arbitrarily low.

25|$|Job {{performance}} represents behaviors employees {{engage in}} while at work which contribute to organizational goals. These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization {{as part of}} an employee's responsibilities.

Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>employee</b> and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).|$|E
25|$|Copyright is {{free and}} {{automatic}} upon creation of the work.

In 2004–2005, Australia also introduced some complicated provisions that give performers part ownership rights in sound recordings, and directors some limited ownership rights in relation to films.|$|E
