5|$|A two-chamber {{parliament}} in Palermo and in Naples was formed. The {{formation of the}} parliament brought the end of feudalism in the Kingdom. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815 Ferdinand repealed all reforms. The people of Sicily rebelled but were defeated by Spanish and Austrian forces. In 1848 another Sicilian revolution of independence occurred, which was put down by FerdinandII <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Two</b> Sicilies, who was nicknamed Rè Bomba after his 5-day bombardment of Messina. From 1816 to 1861 the kingdoms were united under the name Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Two</b> Sicilies.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> △ values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple-band MPA can be {{controlled}} through adjusting the Au strip lengths. Figure 4 e gives <b>the</b> absorption curves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple-band MPA in different cases of length l 1. As you can see, the l 1 change mainly affects the third mode frequency, while <b>the</b> frequency shifts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> modes are negligible, which {{are consistent with the}} theoretical prediction. Due to <b>the</b> frequency variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third mode, we can tune <b>the</b> △ value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last <b>two</b> modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triple-band MPA. <b>The</b> △ values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last <b>two</b> modes can be tuned from 12.66 % in l 1 [*]=[*] 33 [*]μm to 10.04 % in l 1 [*]=[*] 34 [*]μm, and 7.22 % in l 1 [*]=[*] 35 [*]μm. <b>The</b> △ value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> modes can also {{be controlled}} by adjusting length l 3 (see Fig.  4 g). The minimum discrete distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> modes is 0.16  THz for l 3 [*]=[*] 38 [*]μm, and its △ value is 7.31 %. Furthermore, we can tune <b>the</b> △ values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> and last two modes via scaling the length l 2, i.e., <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second mode (see Fig.  4 f). Remarkably, the △ value changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> and last two modes are mutual restriction because we only change <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second mode. For example, for l 1 [*]=[*] 37 [*]μm (see the blue line in Fig.  4 f), <b>the</b> discrete distance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>two</b> modes has <b>the</b> minimum value <b>of</b> 0.16  THz, while maximum value of 0.29  THz for last two modes can be obtained.|$|R
