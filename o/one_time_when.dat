5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based map, with the battle system {{employing}} a turn-based system for the player, enemy units and allied units. The movement and attack ranges of enemies can be optionally displayed to players. While seventy-four units are accessible in-game by completing its chapters, only twelve can be taken into battle at any <b>one</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> two units engage, a separate battle screen activates, and the battle plays out automatically. Enemy resistances to weapons are covered by the Weapon Triangle: lances are strong against swords, swords are strong against axes, and axes are strong against lances. Each unit gains experience points with each action, and when they accumulate 100 points, they level up and their stats are randomly raised. Each unit has a class, which affects their weaponry and movement range: these classes, when at level 10, can be promoted to a stronger class using a Master Seal item.|$|E

Curtiss also recalled <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>when,</b> while she and Genie were walking and had stopped at a busy intersection, she unexpectedly heard a purse emptying; she turned to see a woman stop at the intersection and exit her car to give Genie a plastic purse, even though Genie had not said anything.

At <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> <b>when</b> the Zapatistas were advancing on Mexico City, Papen organized a group of European volunteers to fight for Huerta. In the spring of 1914, as German military attaché to Mexico, Papen was deeply involved in selling arms {{to the government of}} General Huerta, believing he could place Mexico in the German sphere of influence, though the collapse of Huerta's regime in July 1914 ended that hope. In April 1914, Papen personally observed the Battle of Veracruz when the Americans seized the city of Veracruz, despite orders from Berlin to stay in Mexico City. During {{his time in}} Mexico, Papen acquired the love of international intrigue and adventure that was to characterize his later diplomatic postings in the United States, Austria and Turkey.|$|E

Cubrilović stated to the court: [...] "Princip glared at me and very forcefully said 'If you want to know, it is for that reason {{and we are going}} to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'" [...] Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilović described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabež." [...] Cubrilović explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at <b>one</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: [...] "I was more afraid of terror than the law." ...|$|E

2500|$|Igbo {{people were}} spread on {{plantations}} on the island's northwestern side, specifically the areas around Montego Bay and St. Ann's Bay, andconsequently, their influence was concentrated there.

Slave owner Matthew Lewis spent time in Jamaica between 1815 and 1817 and studied the way his slaves organised themselves by ethnicity and he noted, for example, that at <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> he [...] "went down to the negro-houses to hear the whole body of Eboes lodge a complaint {{against one of the}} book-keepers".

Speaking to Gay Byrne in RTÉ's The Meaning of Life series, Mr Ahern {{described}} himself as a regular Mass-goer, but said he had not been to Confession for 40 years. In a lengthy interview, Mr Ahern revealed that he and the former DUP leader Dr Ian Paisley bonded over their shared faith when they had their first formal meeting together. The meeting took place in January 2004 at the Irish Embassy in London. He recalled how Dr Paisley began a prayer in the Irish Embassy and he joined in with him. He said the prayer was [...] "like our Confiteor" [...] and officials had wondered why they had spent so much time alone. The pair started discussing their values and the rules by which they lived. His government came under severe criticism for the deal they made with the religious orders, capping their contribution to the redress board at €128 million while taxpayers will have to pay out €1 billion. As a Catholic, he wanted the church to [...] "do well", but it could not retreat behind canon law, he said. [...] "There was <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the church tried to put up the defence of canon law and my colleagues just looked up to the sky and thought they were joking. Unfortunately, they weren’t joking, they made bad decisions." [...] Mr Ahern said he was convinced that life [...] "did not end at the graveyard" [...] and he often prayed to dead relatives for guidance. He used Mass as an opportunity to pray for people in trouble and stayed off alcohol in November and at Lent. He rationalised inexplicable events, such as the death of a young person, by stating that God cannot influence [...] "every single thing". He said he received a [...] "fair amount of hate mail" [...] about [...] "living in sin", but it upset other people more than it did him and he admitted that he had not lived up to his parents’ [...] "stereotype" [...] of married life.|$|E
