40|$|This study evaluates {{impacts of}} land use changes due to human {{settlement}} on regional summer climate <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central and western United States by performing 30 -day simulations during normal, drought, and flood years. Under current land use the simulated evapotranspiration increased noticeably <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> States where grassland {{has been replaced by}} crops. Simulated evapotranspiration decreased slightly in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> States. These changes produced wetter and cooler surface air <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> States and slightly drier and warmer air <b>over</b> <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> States. Responses of surface fluxes and thus screen height variables to land use changes were consistent from year to year, whereas rainfall showed strong interannual variations because of the combination of various dynamic processes involved in precipitation. For normal year conditions, average evapotranspiration and rainfall under current land use increased by 18 % and 8 %, respectively, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> States, whereas they slightly decreased in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> States. In both flood and drought years, current land use exhibited a rainfall increase in <b>the</b> western <b>United</b> States and a decrease <b>over</b> <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> States. <b>The</b> decrease of rainfall with increased evapotranspiration in <b>the</b> central <b>United</b> States was likely associated with weakening of the dynamic forcing needed to produce precipitation...|$|R

5|$|From 1921 to 1923 Wilson taught {{music at}} Bedales School, an {{appointment}} {{that left him}} time to take singing engagements all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom. In 1924 he left the English Singers and furthered his singing studies abroad, first in Nice with Jean de Reszke (1924–25), with whom he learned the roles of Otello, Parsifal and Tristan; he then took lessons with Sir George Henschel (1925–28), and studied 17th- and 18th-century music with Wanda Landowska in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Hope's {{absence from}} the early bebop scene largely {{continued}} {{after he left the}} army, as he played principally in rhythm and blues bands for a few years. He was part of an octet led by trumpeter Eddie Robinson late in 1947, and played briefly with Snub Mosley around the same time. Hope had his first long-term association, with the Joe Morris band, from 1948 to 1951, including for several recordings. This band toured all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing two systems instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter faced Deuce 'n Domino for the WWE Tag Team Championship.

5|$|At {{the end of}} September 1946, the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the Eastern Pacific moved {{north of}} its typical position. An {{associated}} weather disturbance moved over Central America and interacted with a surface low-pressure area over Guatemala. Meanwhile, a broad high-pressure area moved <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States behind an intense storm that moved eastward into the Atlantic Ocean. Connected to the cyclone was a shear line stretching from Bermuda to the Caribbean Sea, which spawned an upper-level low over open waters. It moved westward on October 4, and {{by the next day}} it was located over the Southeastern United States. The feature over Guatemala began moving toward the northeast as the upper-level low approached and began deepening. Modern-day analysis estimates that the system became a tropical storm early on October 5, shortly after emerging into the Caribbean.|$|E

5|$|Boston born Kenza Tazi was {{the sole}} female athlete {{competing}} for Morocco at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She had skied {{from the age of}} three onwards, and said her hero was American skier Bode Miller. At the time of the start of the 2014 Games, she was also 17; she celebrated her 18th birthday while in Sochi. She chose to represent Morocco <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States as the Moroccan Ski Association offered to fund her training. Tazi qualified for the Sochi Olympics after competing successfully at a number of qualification events, despite injury problems. Also accompanying the two athletes was a third skier, Sami Lamhamedi, the brother of Adam. However, Sami did not compete in events, and was only there as a potential substitute. These athletes were also accompanied by four officials.|$|E
