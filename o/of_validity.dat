5|$|The Lothian 'Ridacard' bus pass is a {{pre-paid}} plastic smartcard giving unlimited {{travel on}} regular daytime and night bus services, {{as well as}} Edinburgh Trams services. It is purchased initially from a Transport for Edinburgh Travelshop, where the owner's picture is incorporated on the card to prevent misuse. Once purchased, the card can be placed onto an on-board reader, which reads the contactless chip in the smartcard. Cards can be credited for a weekly, 4 weekly or annual period. A warning is displayed on the last five days <b>of</b> <b>validity.</b> The card can then be topped up at Transport for Edinburgh Travelshops or Pay Point equipped retailers.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{identify}} the conventional methods <b>of</b> determining <b>validity.</b> Then, analyze the methods from the Islamic perspective. The methods <b>of</b> determining <b>validity</b> here refer to methods that can ensure the instrument’s validity or measurement and data validity. Instrument’s validity or measurement and data validity leads to results and findings which are true. The question is what are the methods <b>of</b> determining <b>validity</b> contained in conventional research? Are these methods appropriate for research related to the affairs of Islam and the Muslims? This paper aims to answer both of these questions through a textual analysis on a few literatures. For the first question, this paper discusses the identified six conventional methods <b>of</b> determining <b>validity.</b> Such methods include methods for determining <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the instrument or measurement and methods <b>of</b> determining data <b>validity.</b> As for the second question, this paper concludes that the conventional methods <b>of</b> determining <b>validity</b> is inappropriate as the method <b>of</b> determining <b>validity</b> for research related to the affairs of Islam and the Muslims...|$|R

40|$|Research {{into the}} dynamicity of job {{performance}} criteria has found evidence suggesting {{the presence of}} rank-order changes to job performance scores across {{time as well as}} intraindividual trajectories in job performance scores across time. These findings have influenced a large body of research into (a) the dynamicity <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> individual differences predictors of job performance and (b) the relationship between individual differences predictors of job performance and intraindividual trajectories of job performance. In the present dissertation, I addressed these issues {{within the context of the}} Five Factor Model of personality. The Five Factor Model is arranged hierarchically, with five broad higher-order factors subsuming a number of more narrowly tailored personality facets. Research has debated the relative merits of broad versus narrow traits for predicting job performance, but the entire body of research has addressed the issue from a static perspective [...] by examining the relative magnitude <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets. While research along these lines has been enlightening, theoretical perspectives suggest that the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets may differ in their stability across time. Thus, research is needed to not only compare the relative magnitude <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets at a single point in time, but also to compare the relative stability <b>of</b> <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global factors versus their facets across time. Also necessary to advance cumulative knowledge concerning intraindividual performance trajectories is research into broad vs. narrow traits for predicting such trajectories. In the present dissertation, I addressed these issues using a four-year longitudinal design. The results indicated that the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> global conscientiousness were stable across time, while the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> conscientiousness facets were more likely to fluctuate. However, the <b>validities</b> <b>of</b> emotional stability and extraversion facets were no more likely to fluctuate across time than those of the factors. Finally, while some personality factors and facets predicted performance intercepts (i. e., performance at the first measurement occasion), my results failed to indicate a significant effect of any personality variable on performance growth. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

He controversially says the two are separate (i.e. he is in favour of the ‘abstraction principle’). So Caldwell should not have got his car back. Rights in property are passed on delivery and with intent to pass title. This is not dependent on {{the validity of the}} contract. In short, he argues for the abstraction principle.|$|E
25|$|Theorems in {{mathematics}} and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute {{is that it is}} falsifiable, that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by experiments. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain <b>of</b> <b>validity.</b> Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{scientific}} method as conceived in the 17th century, natural and artificial circumstances were set aside as a research tradition of systematic experimentation was slowly accepted by {{the scientific}} community. The philosophy of using an inductive approach to obtain knowledge — to abandon assumption and to attempt to observe {{with an open mind}} — was in contrast with the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction, by which analysis of known facts produced further understanding. In practice, many scientists and philosophers believed that a healthy mix of both was needed — the willingness to question assumptions, yet also to interpret observations assumed to have some degree <b>of</b> <b>validity.</b>|$|E
30|$|The <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> any {{instrumental}} variable strategy depends on two main conditions: first, {{the presence of}} a strong correlation between the instrument and the endogenous variable and, second, the absence of any correlation between the instrument and the error term (exogeneity condition).

On the contrary, the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the exogeneity condition cannot be tested directly; the robustness checks in this Section provide an indirect test <b>of</b> its <b>validity.</b>|$|R

25|$|Different {{fields in}} {{epidemiology}} have different levels <b>of</b> <b>validity.</b> One way {{to assess the}} validity of findings is the ratio of false-positives (claimed effects that are not correct) to false-negatives (studies which fail to support a true effect). To take the field of genetic epidemiology, candidate-gene studies produced over 100 false-positive findings for each false-negative. By contrast genome-wide association appear close to the reverse, with only one false positive for every 100 or more false-negatives. This ratio has improved over time in genetic epidemiology as the field has adopted stringent criteria. By contrast other epidemiological fields have not required such rigorous reporting and are much less reliable as a result.|$|E

Between 1943 and 1946, old stocks of postage stamps and earlier WCO stamps were issued with provisional surcharges. These were followed by a new issue between 1944 and 1956 in the same design as the previous stamps, but denominated 2d and once again in various colours.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} forms <b>of</b> <b>validity.</b> Criterion-related validity can be assessed by correlating a measure with a criterion measure theoretically expected to be related. When the criterion measure is collected {{at the same time as}} the measure being validated the goal is to establish concurrent validity; when the criterion is collected later the goal is to establish predictive validity. A measure has construct validity if it is related to measures of other constructs as required by theory. Content validity is a demonstration that the items of a test do an adequate job of covering the domain being measured. In a personnel selection example, test content is based on a defined statement or set of statements of knowledge, skill, ability, or other characteristics obtained from a job analysis.|$|E
