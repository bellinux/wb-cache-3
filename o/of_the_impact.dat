5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E

5|$|Carla {{spawned the}} largest hurricane-related tornado {{outbreak}} on record at the time, when 26tornadoes touched down within its circulation. However, it was overwhelmingly surpassed by Hurricane Beulah in 1967, which spawned at least 115tornadoes.

40|$|Migration is {{generally}} considered a problem {{or at least a}} negative phenomenon. However, it is considered rather positively in this thesis. I attempt to answer a question whether migration contributes to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> countries <b>of</b> origin. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this thesis is to evaluate the positive and <b>the</b> negative <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> migration and remittances on selected countries and to evaluate measures that contribute to a maximization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive <b>impacts</b> and a minimization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> negative <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> migration on development. The first chapter presents <b>the</b> theoretical concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> migration and remittances on development. In the second chapter I examine <b>the</b> specific effects <b>of</b> migration and <b>the</b> third chapter summarizes the measures maximizing <b>the</b> positive <b>impacts</b> and minimizing <b>the</b> negative effects <b>of</b> migration on development in <b>the</b> "optimization model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> migration and remittances on development. ...|$|R

40|$|The maxillary canine {{being the}} last {{anterior}} tooth to erupt {{in the oral}} cavity, is commonly <b>impacted</b> and <b>the</b> reasons for which are multifocal.

This article reviews the various radiographic techniques and summarizes the current literature about <b>the</b> localization <b>of</b> <b>impacted</b> maxillary canine.

5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that {{swept through the}} native populations of the Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout the Maya area {{the same year that}} it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% {{of the population of the}} Maya highlands perished.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{reforming}} actions such as the Bill of Middlesex, the Common Pleas became increasingly conservative and resistant to King's Bench changes because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> they had on {{the business of the}} Common Pleas. This was best emphasised by Slade's Case, a struggle between the old and new forms of suing for breach of contract; although an equilibrium between the common law courts was finally reached, it eventually led to their dissolution with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, and merger into a single High Court of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> crater.|$|E

5|$|For the 1958 season, the {{durations}} of timeouts {{was extended}} from 60 to 90 seconds and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters. The 1958 championship game {{became the first}} NFL championship game decided in overtime and it {{was considered to be}} the greatest football game ever played. The game further increased football's marketability to television advertising, and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst. Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell's realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> the game would have on the prevalence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|In January 1965, the Department of the Interior {{completed}} its three-volume, 1,000-page {{study of the}} Rampart project's feasibility and impact. The Fish and Wildlife study released in 1964 was included, as were studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> on the region's Alaska Native population. United States Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall then created {{a task force to}} review the findings before he made a final decision. Throughout 1965 and 1966, opponents and proponents of the project funded studies of their own, aimed either at supporting or rejecting the arguments for the dam.|$|E
5|$|In late 1960, the Alaska Conservation Society {{became the}} first large {{conservation}} group to oppose construction of the dam. The organization believed the flooding of the Yukon Flats would cause critical damage to Alaska waterfowl and promoted the alternative Susitna Hydroelectric Project to supply Alaska's electric needs. This was followed in early 1961 by an Alaska Sportsmen's Council resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing its funding for studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> of the project on fish and game stocks. In April of that year, Alaska Sportsman magazine took a formal stand against the project.|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are used}} to study <b>the</b> transient behavior <b>of</b> a four degree-of-freedom, rotational piecewise linear system. This study focuses on <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> between bodies in a system with backlash {{as a result of}} a sudden step input and the associated transient response. The subsequent single sided impacts and double sided impacts are studied as a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> step input and <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> backlash. Transitions have been observed between double sided impact regions and single sided impact regions, which agree with earlier findings. However, in this paper a more complete overview <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundaries is given. <b>The</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> is quantified with <b>the</b> peak-to-peak acceleration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacting</b> bodies. <b>The</b> increase in <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> step input increases <b>the</b> severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>impacts.</b> However, <b>the</b> increase in backlash size leads to an extremum in impact severity.
