5|$|Although {{assembled}} in the United States, the UK's Phantoms were a special batch built separately and containing {{a significant amount of}} British technology as a means of easing the pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> aerospace industry in the wake of major project cancellations. Two variants were initially built for the UK: the F-4K variant was designed from the outset as an air defence interceptor to be operated by the Fleet Air Arm from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers; the F-4M version was procured for the RAF to serve in the tactical strike and reconnaissance roles. In the mid-1980s, a third Phantom variant was obtained when a quantity of second-hand F-4J aircraft were purchased to augment the UK's air defences following the Falklands War.|$|E
5|$|Despite the truce, the chronicler Ibn Wadih {{mentions}} Arab raids into Asia Minor for {{the years}} 783, 784 and 785. If true, then these would probably represent only minor affairs, as the main sources agree that the truce was mutually respected until spring 785. In that year, as Irene had strengthened her hold over the army and was preparing to confront the iconoclasts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> front, she decided to cease payment of the tribute, and hostilities recommenced. In early 786, the Byzantines scored a major success, sacking and razing to the ground the fortress town of Hadath in Cilicia, which the Abbasids {{had spent the last}} five years turning into a major stronghold and military base for their cross-border expeditions. After the accession of Harun al-Rashid to the caliphal throne in the same year, however, the Abbasids regained the initiative. Arab pressure mounted, and in 798 Irene was forced to ask for a peace treaty that repeated the stipulations of the 782 truce.|$|E
5|$|From 3 June to 30 September 1960, Braathens SAFE {{was granted}} {{concession}} {{on the route}} from Oslo via Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Aalborg Airport in Denmark. This became possible because SAS had abandoned the route the previous year. It was flown with a DC-3, giving an 80% load factor. On 22 July, the Braathens SAFE applied for a three-year concession, but this was rejected because SAS stated that they would restart the route. In 1961, SAS started the route Stavanger–Kristiansand–Ålborg, and in 1963 on the route Oslo–Kristiansand–Ålborg. The concession allowed SAS to also take passengers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> legs, giving Braathens SAFE competition on the routes to Kristiansand.|$|E

5|$|JAL Express (JEX) was {{established}} on April 1, 1997, as a wholly owned domestic subsidiary airline of Japan Airlines (JAL), {{with an initial}} capital of ¥5.8 million. The airline operates scheduled passenger services to regional domestic destinations in Japan, {{as well as some}} low-demand flights for JAL under wet-lease agreement. It was anticipated that the airline may enter services <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> trunk and short-haul international routes. On July 1, 1998, JAL Express commenced operations from Osaka to Miyazaki and Kagoshima with two Boeing 737-400s, non-Japanese cockpit crew, and short-term contracted cabin attendants. The airline's cabin attendants are called Sky Cast, their duties include cleaning the 150-seat cabin between flights.|$|E
5|$|Most British breeders {{thought the}} {{regulation}} necessary and welcomed it, whereas most American breeders found it insulting, {{and believed that}} it was intended merely to protect the British racehorse market. The rule did adversely affect many British breeders as well though, including even one senior member of the Jockey Club, Lord Coventry, whose successful line of racehorses was ineligible for registration. Initially there was little foreign complaint or organized opposition, probably owing to the effect of the gambling bans in the United States <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> horse market. The American Jockey Club did not even remark on the Jersey Act in its official publication, the Racing Calendar, and no mention of it appears in the Jockey Club's meeting minutes for 1913. Contributing to the lack of outcry was a legal ruling in New York allowing oral betting at racetracks, which led to the growth of racing in the United States; by 1920 the American breeding market had rebounded and was booming.|$|E
5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
