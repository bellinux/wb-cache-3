6000|$|They had risen. Joan {{folded her}} hands. [...] "Thank {{you for your}} scolding, ma'am," [...] she said. [...] "Shall I write out a hundred lines of Greek? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be {{sufficient}} if I promise never to do it again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 101. You {{think that}} saying of the Greek school--Pindar's summary of it, [...] "[Greek: ti de tis; ti d'ou tis];"[15]--a sorrowful and {{degrading}} lesson. See at least, then, that {{you reach the}} level of such degradation. See that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy's climbing for his entangled kite. It will be well {{for you if you}} join not with those who instead of kites fly falcons; who instead of obeying the last words of the great Cloud-Shepherd--to feed his sheep, live the lives--how much less than vanity!--of the war-wolf and the gier-eagle. <b>Or,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a dishonor to man to say to him that Death is but only Rest? See that when it draws near to you, you may look to it, at least for sweetness of Rest; and that you recognize the Lord of Death coming to you as a Shepherd gathering you into his Fold for the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{speak of}} that hateful man!" [...] her ladyship exclaimed. [...] "I have {{something}} to tell you about Romayne. Are you completely absorbed in your presentiments of evil? <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can listen to me?" ...|$|R
3000|$|Mark: <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> there’s {{more risk}} going online, does that create more risk <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it’s less risky for getting knicked? [...]...|$|R
5000|$|... {{and shouts}} from far off: [...] "O unhappy citizens, what madness? :Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the enemy's sailed away? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bobby," [...] said Old Mother Nature sternly, [...] "why don't you own up {{that you}} went over there to try to steal eggs? <b>Or</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might catch a tender young Chicken? Where were you night before last?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you despise me?" [...] demanded Leslie in a fierce, low tone. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm wicked--unwomanly? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm {{just plain}} fool?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{say to a}} {{match between}} your fingers? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a pair of bracelets of living fire would answer better, to begin with?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Anthea {{looked at}} him with a sparkle in her eyes. [...] "Pshaw!" [...] she said. [...] "Are you going to {{masquerade}} always, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I am quite without intelligence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Carey. [...] "I {{want them}} to be where {{physical}} science is an object. <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that thorough classical training is a better preparation than taking up any individual line?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Cruel, heartless Hurons!" [...] exclaimed {{the still}} indignant Hetty--"Would you burn {{a man and}} a Christian, as you would burn a log of wood! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> never read your Bibles? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> God will forget such things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Now,” {{said his}} father to him one day, {{after he had been}} doing a fine job of wood-piling,--“now we will go and talk with the {{corporal}} about a wheelbarrow. <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could find the way yourself?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{who will}} lead her safely to the {{garrison}} if she land? Is not {{the night as}} dark on shore as on the water? <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I know less of my calling than you know of yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>do</b> not {{understand}} <b>you.</b> <b>You</b> <b>do</b> {{not mean to}} imply that I have not his perfect confidence, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I have managed him wrongly? If <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> pray tell me at once. I dare say I have.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing venture nothing have! Besides, {{you make}} sure that he's honourable before you begin. You'd be safe enough with yours. I wish I had the chance! Lots of girls <b>do</b> it; <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> they'd get married at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I knew he {{was going}} to {{introduce}} it, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I didn't know?' she said, with that gentle sauciness which shows itself in the loved one's manner when she has had a triumphant evening without the lover's assistance.|$|R
5000|$|Lindi Smith from EW wrote, [...] "Is Wu {{about to}} become a wesen, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> they will find a cure? Do we even want to see Wu as a wesen when he's one of the few humans on the show?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] said Locker, [...] "but if I {{remembered to}} bring my sword and pistol I must have {{put them in the}} bottom of my trunk, and that has gone on to the station. Have you two pistols or swords with <b>you?</b> <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> could get {{sufficient}} satisfaction out of a couple of piles of stones that we could hurl at each other?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{who know}} everything, Mr. Pepper," [...] she said, [...] "tell us how did those {{wonderful}} French ladies manage their salons? Did we ever do {{anything of the}} same kind in England, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that there is some reason why we cannot do it in England?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In my study, I suppose. I fear {{there is}} no chance of Flora's {{changing}} her mind first. <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> one of <b>you</b> could talk to her, and get her fairly to contemplate the real bearings of the matter?" [...] And, with these words, he left the room.|$|R
6000|$|She {{leaned back}} {{again in the}} chair and let her hands rest quietly in her lap. [...] "Would you have {{preferred}} me to remain outside, in the yacht, in the near neighbourhood of these wild men who captured <b>you?</b> <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that they, too, were got up to carry on a farce?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Mr. Crawley, very irate at this {{appeal to}} his wife, and {{speaking}} in a loud voice, [...] "do you misdoubt my word; <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that if I were minded to be false to you, that I should be corrected in my falsehood by the firmer faith of my wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah yes, I remember. One leg and {{a wooden}} stick {{to keep it}} company. I issue this order, dear friends, not because I am not fond of your society, but {{to keep you from}} getting into more trouble in a country where all is strange and unnatural to you. Am I right, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I am wrong?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Open another," [...] said Villon. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{ever hope}} to fill that big hogshead, your body, with little things like bottles? And how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> expect to get to heaven? How many angels, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> fancy, can be spared to carry up a single monk from Picardy? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{yourself}} another Elias--and they'll send the coach for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|So {{saying he}} turned away, leaving {{the others to}} talk the matter over. They went through their usual drill that {{afternoon}} without any allusion being made to the subject. When they met the next day Chris said cheerfully, [...] "Well, what have you decided? First, Brown, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> stick to what <b>you</b> said yesterday, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> better of it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Open another," [...] said Villon. [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{ever hope}} to fill that big hogshead, your body, with little things like bottles?

How many angels, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> fancy, can be spared to carry up a single monk from Picardy? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{yourself}} another Elias - and they'll send the coach for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you give}} no reason. Are we always to have {{warnings}} from you," [...] she continued, with a smile, [...] "without reasons? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> deem us so utterly unworthy of a reason? <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> us incapable of thought {{on a subject}} connected with the sea? You have {{failed to make the}} essay, and are too quick to decide. Try us this once. We may possibly deceive your expectations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Furlong," [...] exclaimed one of them, [...] "so {{fortunate}} {{to happen to}} catch you; we were just going into the rectory to consult you. Should the girls--for the lawn tea for the Guild on Friday, you know--wear white dresses with light blue sashes all the same, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> we might allow them to wear any coloured sashes that they like? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Some day I hope I can {{get away}} from this fool repairing, when I have the money saved up. I want to go East and work for some big dressmaker, and study art drawing, and become a high-class designer. <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that's a kind of fiddlin' {{ambition}} for a fellow? I was brought up on a farm. And then monkeyin' round with silks! I don't know. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> Myrtle Cass says you're awfully educated." ...|$|R
5000|$|Melissa Etheridge, one of {{the three}} panelists at the forum, asked Gov. Bill Richardson, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> {{homosexuality}} is a choice or is it biological?" [...] Richardson responded, [...] "It's a choice." [...] Etheridge restated the question: [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a homosexual is born that way, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that around seventh grade we go, 'Oh, I want to be gay'?" [...] Richardson replied, [...] "Well, I'm not a scientist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No surname signed! What's the post-mark? Only Charing-cross. Could {{you find}} out nothing, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> it worth while to look?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'll take it now?" [...] {{said the}} old man passionately. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that your charity will bring back my dead wife, the three years of my lost life, the love and respect of my children? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that your own wife and children, who deserted you in your wealth, will come back to you in your poverty? No! Let the mine stay, with its curse, where it is--I'll have none of it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|FROME. Now, ma'am, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>think</b> {{that your}} danger and {{unhappiness}} would seriously affect his balance, his {{control over his}} actions? ...|$|R
6000|$|Osborn's face got red and he knitted his brows. [...] "I {{have tried}} to be patient; but this is too much! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know more about {{managing}} an estate than a clever agent? <b>Or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> I'm a fool and Hayes leads me like a child? Anyhow, you are much too young to criticize my actions. Let us have no more of it! An unmarried girl is not entitled to opinions that clash with her parents'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whither would ye go? Is a Teton horse a {{salamander}} that he {{can walk}} amid fiery flames unhurt, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the Lord will show his might in your behalf, as {{in the days of}} old, and carry you harmless through such a furnace as you may see glowing beneath yonder red sky? There are Siouxes, too, hemming the fire with their arrows and knives on every side of us, or I am no judge of their murderous deviltries." ...|$|R
