500|$|Writing in 1952, Ramsey {{would call}} joining the army [...] "one of the {{greatest}} things which ever happened to me", adding [...] "I learnt, in a few weeks, more about life in general that I had picked up in years at home." [...] Military life taught Ramsey about discipline and leadership, and improved his social skills: [...] "I have never been very good at mixing with people {{but you have to}} in the army <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>you</b> are in trouble," [...] the journalist Nigel Clarke recalled him saying. Ramsey rose to be a company quartermaster sergeant in an anti-aircraft unit.|$|E
500|$|Ross was {{impressed}} with the in-camera effects achieved for the series, but he would always propose visual effect alternatives to these on set because [...] "you have to embrace what VFX can do for you. The cost of spending half a day on a special scene has got to be worth it, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>you</b> can just shoot a plate and do the rest in post and save yourself all that production time". Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works. [...] us a starting point for building our new shots. And whether they are all-CG or just elements, we are always dealing with Noah’s aesthetic of making it look as real as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell {{in autumn}} of 1990 to begin {{working on the}} next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell {{suffered}} a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the Mob Rules era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Some songs were re-written multiple times. [...] "Dehumanizer took a long time, it was just hard work", Iommi said. [...] "We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. [...] "It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works", he said. [...] "Sometimes you need that kind of tension, <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>you</b> end up making the Christmas album".|$|E

500|$|In September 1963, after Cox was {{discharged}} from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with his teeth in Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play with his teeth. He later commented: [...] "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there {{you have to play}} with your teeth <b>or</b> <b>else</b> <b>you</b> get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." [...] Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, and {{for the next two years}} Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson.|$|E
