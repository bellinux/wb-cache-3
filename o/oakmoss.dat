50|$|Evernia prunastri, {{also known}} as <b>oakmoss,</b> is a species of lichen. It {{can be found in}} many mountainous {{temperate}} forests throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of France, Portugal, Spain, North America, and much of Central Europe. <b>Oakmoss</b> grows primarily on the trunk and branches of oak trees, but is also commonly found on the bark of other deciduous trees and conifers such as fir and pine. The thalli of <b>oakmoss</b> are short (3-4 cm in length) and bushy, and grow together on bark to form large clumps. <b>Oakmoss</b> thallus is flat and strap-like. They are also highly branched, resembling the form of deer antlers. The colour of <b>oakmoss</b> ranges from green to a greenish-white when dry, and dark olive-green to yellow-green when wet. The texture of the thalli are rough when dry and rubbery when wet. It is used extensively in modern perfumery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oakmoss</b> {{should be}} avoided by people with known skin {{sensitization}} issues. Its use in perfumes is now highly restricted by International Fragrance Association regulations, and many scents have been reformulated in recent years with other chemicals substituted for <b>oakmoss.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Oakmoss</b> is commercially {{harvested}} in countries of South-Central Europe and usually exported to the Grasse region of France where its fragrant compounds are extracted as <b>oakmoss</b> absolutes and extracts. These raw materials {{are often used}} as perfume fixatives and form the base notes of many fragrances. They are also key components of Fougère and Chypre class perfumes. The lichen has a distinct and complex odor and {{can be described as}} woody, sharp and slightly sweet. <b>Oakmoss</b> growing on pines have a pronounced turpentine odor that is valued in certain perfume compositions.|$|E

5000|$|Fougère, , {{is one of}} {{the main}} olfactive {{families}} of perfumes. The name comes from the French language word for [...] "fern". Fougère perfumes are made with a blend of fragrances: top-notes are sweet, with the scent of lavender flowers; as the more volatile components evaporate, the scents of <b>oakmoss,</b> derived from a species of lichen and described as woody, sharp and slightly sweet, and coumarin, similar to the scent of new-mown hay, become noticeable. Aromatic fougère, a derivative of this class, contains additional notes of herbs, spice and/or wood.|$|E
50|$|Sandalwood oil is used {{extensively}} for its woody-floral scent. It pairs well with other wood or floral scents such as violet, rose, tuberose, clove, and <b>oakmoss.</b> But since the wood is so rare and expensive, cosmetic {{companies are now}} trying to find synthetic substitutes to try to imitate the structure and scent of sandalwood. There are several synthetic odorants with odor similar to sandalwood oil, used as lower-cost alternatives for perfumes, emollients, and skin cleaning agents. Two of these, Sandalore and Brahmanol, {{have been found to be}} agonists of the cutaneous olfactory receptor OR2AT4, with potential therapeutic benefits for wound healing. Natural sandalwood oil, and other synthetic sandalwood odorants, did not have the same effect.|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review is presented on extracts of a lichen, <b>oakmoss</b> (Evernia prunastri), {{that are used}} in the fragrance industry. Analytical aspects are discussed in detail, from both qualitative and quantitative standpoints, mainly in relation to the industrial processing of the lichen. It is shown that more than 170 constituents have been identified so far in <b>oakmoss</b> extracts, including 47 depsides or depside-derived compounds and 25 triterpenes or steroids. A survey of industrially relevant synthetic products with an <b>oakmoss</b> odour is included. Toxicology issues related to the use of <b>oakmoss</b> extracts in cosmetics and fragrance formulations are critically reviewed...|$|E
30|$|Annex III of the Cosmetic Regulation {{contains}} the ‘List of substances which cosmetic products must not contain except {{subject to the}} restrictions laid down’. <b>Oakmoss</b> extract (Evernia prunastri extract) as a strong contact allergen {{is part of this}} list and must be named in the list of ingredients referred to in Art. 19 (1)(g) when its concentration exceeds 0.001 % in leave-on products and 0.01 % in rinse-off products. Despite this restriction, there were 747 notifiers for <b>oakmoss</b> extract in the C&L inventory. According to the INCI list, <b>oakmoss</b> extract is used with the function of skin conditioning. <b>Oakmoss</b> is also listed in the INCI list part II (perfume and aromatic raw materials), together with treemoss extract (Evernia furfuracea lichen extract).|$|E
40|$|<b>Oakmoss</b> is {{a natural}} {{fragrance}} ingredient exhibiting highly specific, potent antibacterial activity against Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of severe water-bone pneumonia. In the present study, the antibacterial activity of individual compounds isolated from <b>oakmoss</b> was investigated against L. pneumophila and other Legionella spp. A total of 18 known compounds and two minor novel compounds (i. e., 3 -methoxy- 5 -methylphenyl- 2, 4 -dihydroxy- 6 -methylbenzoate (compound 9) and 8 -(2, 4 -dihydroxy- 6 -(2 -oxoheptyl) -phenoxy) - 6 -hydroxy- 3 -pentyl- 1 H-isochromen- 1 -one (compound 20)) were purified from <b>oakmoss.</b> The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against clinical and environmental isolates of L. pneumophila, L. bozemanii, L. micdadei, L. longbeachae, and L. dumoffii for 11 of the 20 compounds were less than 100 ??g/mL (range 0. 8 ? 64. 0 ??g/mL). Novel compounds 9 and 20 exhibited potent antibacterial activity against L. pneumophila strains (MIC ranges of 1. 3 ? 8. 0 ??g/mL and 3. 3 ? 13. 3 ??g/mL, respectively) and also against four other Legionella species (MIC ranges of 0. 8 ? 8. 0 ??g/mL and 3. 3 ? 21. 3 ??g/mL, respectively). Time?kill assays indicated that compounds 9 and 20 kill bacteria at a concentration equivalent to 2 ×MIC after 1 ?h and 6 ?h co-incubations, respectively. While <b>oakmoss</b> and the purified components exhibited antibacterial activity against Legionella spp., they were not active against other Gram-negative and -positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus...|$|E
30|$|From 1982 to 1992, Sun’s group {{systematically}} probed {{into the}} aromatic and chemical constituents of 22 lichen species. They successfully developed two new lichen perfumery products, namely Chinese <b>oakmoss</b> No. 1 (with ethyl divaricatinate {{as the main}} aromatic component) and Chinese odour No. 2 (with ethyl haematommate and ethyl everninate as the main aromatic components) [2]. The aromas of these two products exhibited great similarities to those of French <b>oakmoss</b> products but are not identical. The perfumery project belonged to the National Ministry of Light Industry and Chinese Academy of Sciences {{during the period of}} the “Sixth Five-Year Plan”. Moreover, the project promoted the pioneering research and development of perfume in China. These products were praised {{both at home and abroad}} as original Chinese <b>oakmoss</b> products, successively winning the Second Prize of the Scientific and Technological Progress Award of Yunnan Province, “Sixth Five-Year Plan” Key Issue Recognition award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Outstanding Product Award of Ministry of Light Industry in 1985 for its contribution to the perfume industry in China. In 1993, the project titled “Study on the Chemical Constituents and Application of Domestic Lichen Plants” was awarded the Third Prize of the Natural Science Award of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.|$|E
40|$|<b>Oakmoss</b> and its {{components}} {{are known as}} antibacterial agents, specifically against Legionella pneumophila. In the present study, we investigated the effects of <b>oakmoss</b> and {{its components}} (phenol, didepside and isochromen derivatives) on L. pneumophila biofilm formation, with particular reference to the bactericidal activity (minimum bactericidal concentration; MBC) of these components against the bacterial cells in the biofilm. Of the 20 compounds tested, two didepside derivatives and four phenol derivatives reduced biofilm formation by more than 50 % of that observed for the control at their respective minimum inhibitory concentrations (1 / 2 ×MIC). The inhibitory activities of these compounds were either equivalent {{to or greater than}} that of the clarithromycin reference. Isochromen derivatives had no effect on biofilm formation. Analysis of bactericidal activity of didepside and isochromen derivatives revealed that three of four didepside derivatives and one of four isochromen derivatives exhibited high bactericidal activity (MBC: 32. 0 ? 74. 7 ??g/mL) against the L. pneumophila in the biofilm after 24 ?h or 48 ?h of co-incubation; the antibacterial activities of these compounds were almost equivalent to clarithromycin and chlorhexidine gluconate (MBC: 42. 7 ? 64. 0 ??g/mL) that were used as references. Thus, based on their anti-biofilm forming and bactericidal activities, didepside derivatives are considered to be good candidates for disinfectants against L. pneumophila...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{comprehensive}} review of extracts from the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea (treemoss) that are used in the fragrance industry. Qualitative and quantitative analytical aspects are critically reviewed and the results are compared to those of the related <b>oakmoss</b> extracts. It is shown that more than 90 constituents have been identified so far in treemoss extracts, including 42 depsides, depsidones or depside-derived compounds, and 42 triterpenes or steroids. Constituents of certain host trees, mainly Pinus species, generate specific analytical and toxicological issues which need to be considered in addition to those related to the known degradation products of lichen compounds. A new classification of lichen extracts used as raw materials in fragrance compounding is proposed...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study we {{investigated}} the antibacterial activity of fragrance ingredients against Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of severe pneumonia. Among the 41 different fragrance ingredients tested, {{we found that the}} natural fragrance ingredients <b>oakmoss</b> (OM) and birch tar oil (BT), which contain many components, exhibit potent antibacterial activity. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, % (v/v)) of OM and BT were 0. 0020 and 0. 0024, respectively and were lower than that of cinnamic aldehyde (0. 0078), which has been previously shown to possess high antimicrobial activity. In a time?kill assay of OM and BT at MIC and two times MIC, the colony forming units (CFU) of the microbe were reduced to between 10 ? 3 to 10 ? 4 of the original CFU after 1 h co-incubation. After this time, the CFU gradually decreased in number, but remained above detection levels even after a 48 -h co-incubation, except for BT at two times MIC. In contrast, at a concentration of 0. 1 % OM and BT (approximately 50 times MIC), CFU were not detected after co-incubation for 1 h. Another 18 fragrance ingredients including ketone, aldehyde, lactone, acid, phenol derivative, aliphatic alcohol and quinoline also exhibited a lesser degree of antibacterial activity against L. pneumophila at a MIC of less than 0. 10...|$|E
