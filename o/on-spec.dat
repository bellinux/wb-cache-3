40|$|Single stage low-temperature-shift water-gas-shift (WGS-LTS) via a {{membrane}} reactor (MR) process was studied through both mathematical simulation and experimental verification in this quarter. Our proposed MR yields a reactor size that is 10 to > 55 % {{smaller than the}} comparable conventional reactor for a CO conversion of 80 to 90 %. In addition, the CO contaminant level in the hydrogen produced via MR ranges from 1, 000 to 4, 000 ppm vs 40, 000 to > 70, 000 ppm via the conventional reactor. The advantages of the reduced WGS reactor size and the reduced CO contaminant level provide an excellent opportunity for intensification of the hydrogen production process by the proposed MR. To prepare for the field test planned in Yr III, a significant number (i. e., 98) of full-scale membrane tubes have been produced with an <b>on-spec</b> ratio of > 76 % during this first production trial.

40|$|In {{the last}} report, we covered the {{experimental}} verification of the mathematical model we developed for WGS-MR, {{specifically in the}} aspect of CO conversion ratio, {{and the effect of}} the permeate sweep. Bench-top experimental study has been continuing in this period to verify the remaining aspects of the reactor performance, including hydrogen recovery ratio, hydrogen purity and CO contaminant level. Based upon the comparison of experimental vs simulated results in this period along with the results reported in the last period, we conclude that our mathematical model can predict reliably all aspects of the membrane reactor performance for WGS using typical coal gasifier off-gas as feed under the proposed operating condition. In addition to 250 C, the experimental study at 225 C was performed. As obtained at 250 C, the predicted values match well with the experimental results at this lower temperature. The pretreatment requirement in our proposed WGS-MR process can be streamlined to the particulate removal only. No excess water beyond the stoichiometric requirement for CO conversion is necessary; thus, power generation efficiency can be maximized. PROX will be employed as post-treatment for the elimination of trace CO. Since the CO contaminant level from our WGS-MR is projected to be 20 - 30 ppm, PROX can be implemented economically and reliably to deliver hydrogen with < 10 ppm CO to meet the spec for PEM fuel cell. This would be a more cost effective solution than the production of <b>on-spec</b> hydrogen without the use of prost treatment. WGS reaction in the presence of sulfur can be accomplished {{with the use of the}} Co/MoS{sub 2 } catalyst. This catalyst has been employed industrially as a sour gas shift catalyst. Our mathematical simulation on WGS-MR based upon the suggested pre- and post-treatment has demonstrated that a nearly complete CO conversion (i. e., 99 +%) can be accomplished. Although conversion vs production cost may play an important role in an overall process optimization, no cost optimization has been taken into consideration presently. We estimate that {approx} 90 % of the hydrogen produced from the H{sub 2 }+CO in the coal gasifier off-gas can be recovered via our proposed WGS-MR process. Its purity level ranges from 80 to 92 % depending upon the H{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 } selectivity of 10 to 25 respectively. If the purity of 95 % is required, the hydrogen recovery ratio will drop to {approx} 80 % level for the membrane with H{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 } = 25...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known that use of the {{hydrogen}} selective membrane as a reactor (MR) could potentially improve {{the efficiency of the}} water shift reaction (WGS), one of the least efficient unit operations for production of high purity hydrogen from syngas. However, no membrane reactor technology has been reduced to industrial practice thus far, in particular for a large-scale operation. This implementation and commercialization barrier is attributed to the lack of a commercially viable hydrogen selective membrane with (1) material stability under the application environment and (2) suitability for large-scale operation. Thus, in this project, we have focused on (1) the deposition of the hydrogen selective carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membrane we have developed on commercially available membranes as substrate, and (2) the demonstration of the economic viability of the proposed WGS-MR for hydrogen production from coal-based syngas. The commercial stainless steel (SS) porous substrate (i. e., ZrO{sub 2 }/SS from Pall Corp.) was evaluated comprehensively as the 1 st choice for the deposition of the CMS membrane for hydrogen separation. The CMS membrane synthesis protocol we developed previously for the ceramic substrate was adapted here for the stainless steel substrate. Unfortunately no successful hydrogen selective membranes had been prepared during Yr I of this project. The characterization results indicated two major sources of defect present in the SS substrate, which {{may have contributed to the}} poor CMS membrane quality. Near the end of the project period, an improved batch of the SS substrate (as the 2 nd generation product) was received from the supplier. Our characterization results confirm that leaking of the crimp boundary no longer exists. However, the thermal stability of the ZrO{sub 2 }/SS substrate through the CMS membrane preparation condition must be re-evaluated in the future. In parallel with the SS membrane activity, the preparation of the CMS membranes supported on our commercial ceramic membrane for large-scale applications, such as coal-based power generation/hydrogen production, was also continued. A significant number (i. e., 98) of full-scale membrane tubes have been produced with an <b>on-spec</b> ratio of > 76 % during the first production trial.

Bonvin Laboratoire d’Automatique, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, CH- 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland Optimization of Transitions in Industrial Polymerization Processes using Solution Models Increasing {{demand on}} {{delivering}} <b>on-spec</b> product, higher operating costs and diminishing profit margins in the polymerization industry require cost- optimal process operation. This {{has led to}} the development of new tools and techniques for the operation of polymerization processes. Besides the added complexity due to market-driven operation, polymerization processes have intrinsic characteristics that cause specific problems in applying advanced optimization and control techniques. Planned or unplanned polymer load and grade changes are typical transitions routinely performed in a polymerization process. In this contribution, transition optimization problems (e. g. minimization of the transition time or the amount of off-spec polymer product) under quality control are considered. We address the challenges faced by any polymerization control strategy, i. e. process uncertainty, which requires on-line updates of any off-line computed solution. Furthermore, it is assumed that measurements of key process variables are available both on- line and at the end of the transition. Two major measurement-based approaches are classified as: 1. Process model approach: Here, measurements are used on-line to correct the current state of the process and re-estimate key model parameters. The inputs are updated subsequently by a repetitive on-line solution of an optimization problem that utilizes a dynamic process model. 2. Solution model approach: Here, measurements are used to directly update the inputs using a parameterized solution model that has been obtained from off-line optimization using a nominal dynamic process model (this is explained later). In the solution model approach considered in this paper (see [1] for more details), the necessary conditions of optimality (NCO) are enforced using a solution model and measurements. Thus, the approach is also labeled NCO tracking [1]. The solution model is obtained by appropriately parameterizing a robust optimal solution of the optimization problem with uncertainty [2]. The solution model is defined in terms of the sequence of input arcs corresponding to constraint-seeking arcs (active path constraints) and sensitivity-seeking arcs. The constrained variables are kept active using simple PID-type controllers. Sensitivity-seeking input arcs minimize the objective function sensitivity. Terminal constraints are handled by updating the corresponding switching times in a run-to-run fashion using the constraint measurements available at the end of the transition. Furthermore, terminal constraints can also be enforced within a single run by proposing a model for predicting the terminal constrained variables or tracking feasible reference trajectories. For the sake of illustration, let us consider the optimal solution shown in Figure 1, where there is the terminal constraint ytf on y. The corresponding solution model includes three arcs: input upper bound arc (left), constraint-seeking arc (middle) and input lower bound arc (right). The input u is kept at its upper bound umax until the constraint y reaches its lower bound ymin that is kept active by manipulating u until the switching time ts is reached. This switching time, which is determined to satisfy the terminal constraint ytf, is adjusted on the basis of a prediction of ytf using a simple empirical. This empirical relationship has to be sufficiently conservative to guarantee end-point feasibility. We assume that this qualitative solution model remains the same in the presence of uncertainty. This might be restrictive in some cases, especially when solving a complex industrial optimization problem with many inputs as well as path and terminal constraints. Techniques to deal with changing sets of active constraints are explained elsewhere (see e. g. [3]). An industrial polymerization process is considered as a case study. The dynamic process model is fairly large with 2500 DAEs. Grade change transition in minimal time is targeted here. The optimization problem has three time-variant inputs and many path and terminal constraints. The optimization problem with nominal model parameters is solved off-line. The resulting solution is subsequently characterized to derive a robust solution model. It is verified that the solution model does not change for the class of uncertainty considered (unknown initial solvent concentration) and the choice of the initial steady state. Furthermore, it is assumed that polymer quality measurements are available on-line. The solution model is quite complex, thus leading to many controllers and switching times for enforcing the terminal constraints. The solution model optimization approach is applied using both within-run and run-to-run and updates for a number of uncertainty realizations. In most of the cases, the transition time is nearly optimal, which is verified by doing re-optimizations. Furthermore, in every realization of the class of uncertainty, all path and terminal constraints can be respected. This approach, in conjunction with techniques for on-line active set change and solution model detection, represents a very efficient and cost-effective operational strategy for general industrial problems.

40|$|In this work, we {{have studied}} the {{suitability}} of recycled Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (R-PET) for 3 D-pritning applications by studying the melt flow characteristics of the polymer. R-PET is known to experience a significant deterioration in its mechanical properties when recycled due to molecular weight loss that results from reprocessing. Lower molecular weight affects the polymer’s viscosity which hinders R-PET from being 3 D-printable from two aspects. First, due to this low viscosity the melt has a low melt strength not sufficient for the filament-making process which involves pulling the melt at certain force to achieve the desired filament diameter size. Second, the polymer would have a significantly higher melt flow when extruded in the 3 D-printer and {{that is likely to}} result in a very poor printing quality if not a failure for the printing task. The hypothesis was that R-PET can be modified with a reasonable effort and resources to overcome the low viscosity problem which should enhance both the melt strength and the melt flow of the polymer to become 3 D-printable. Since the filament-making process involves extrusion, it was decided that reactive extrusion is the most suitable modification method to be followed. Moreover, the melt flow index test was chosen to be an indicator of suitability of a thermoplastic for 3 D-printing applications. Before attempting modifying the polymer’s properties, the effect of moisture content and the reprocessing of R-PET on the melt flow index (MFI) value was studied. Results showed that for unprocessed R-PET, the MFI value was 400 % higher when the polymer was not dried compared to the value obtained after 1 hour of drying. This quantified the impact that the hydrolytic degradation makes on the polymer’s melt flow characteristics. Moreover, results showed a vast difference of around 3. 5 -fold in the MFI value between R-PET versus reprocessed R-PET which is attributed to the thermal and thermo-oxidative degradation that occur during reprocessing. Furthermore, the MFI values of 6 commercial filaments, that include 5 different kinds of thermoplastics, were all found to be within the range of 5 ~ 38 g/ 10 min when the MFI test for each filament was performed at the recommended 3 D-printing temperature. R-PET, on the other hand, had an MFI value of around 90. 56 g/ 10 min (mean value) when tested at 260 °C. This proved that there is {{a significant difference in the}} melt flow characteristics between R-PET and 3 D-printable thermoplastics. Modifying R-PET for the purpose of enhancing its melt flow characteristics was done by reactive extrusion with the chain extender PMDA (pyromellitic dianhydride) at 3 concentration levels 0. 25, 0. 5 and 0. 75 wt%. Furthermore, single-screw and twin-screw extruders were used for compounding and the MFI results of final products were compared. MFI results reveled that PMDA has successfully increased the viscosity of our polymer when used as the chain extender. A decrease of around 72 fold in the MFI was recorded when PMDA was added at 0. 75 wt% which lowered the MFI of our modified R-PET to a comparable value to commercial 3 D-printing filaments. Moreover, the comparison between the products processed by single-screw and twin-screw extruders showed that lower MFI was obtained when the single-screw extruder was used at PMDA concentrations of 0. 25 wt% and 0. 5 wt%. At 0. 75 wt%, however, the product of the twin-screw extruder had slightly lower MFI. It was proposed that when 0. 75 wt% PMDA was added, an excess PMDA has helped in recovering the molecular weight loss caused by several degradation routs that are anticipated to take place more severely in the twin-screw extruder. Having said that, it is worth noting that the difference between MFI obtained by single-screw and twin screw extruders at 0. 75 wt% is not vary large. Moreover, the effect of copolymer SEBS-g-MA (Styrene-Ethylene-Butylene-Styrene grafted Maletic Anhydride) on melt rheology when added along with PMDA was briefly studied. SEBS-g-MA has been used as a toughening agent but it was also reported that it acts as a thermal stabilizer when processed with polymers. Our results showed that MFI was higher when the copolymer was added and, therefore, it was eliminated as an additive from our final product. Furthermore, FT-IR analysis was performed to investigate the chemical composition of our product and compared it with unmodified R-PET. Three cases were investigated including: the composition change resulted from not drying the polymer prior extrusion, the change resulted from PMDA addition, and the change resulted from addition of SEBS-g-MA. First, when the polymer was not dried prior to extrusion it is expected that hydrolytic degradation will occur and, as a result, an increase in the hydroxyl end-group content should be seen as was confirmed by the FT-IR results. Moreover, the sample that contained SEBS-g-MA in the blend showed clear signals that are associated with SEBS-g-MA. This indicates that SEBS copolymer was effectively dispersed in our polymer. Furthermore, a very mild indication was seen in the IR spectrum that suggests a lower carboxyl end-group content when PMDA was added at the highest level (0. 75 wt%). This was attributed to the chain extension reaction which is known to reduce the -COOH end-group content. Finally, making a 3 D-printing filament from our modified R-PET was done by mimicking the main processing stations that exist in a filament making process which are: extrusion stage, water bath cooling stage and spooling stage. After setting certain important operational parameters, including extrusion temperature and cooling water bath temperature, we were able to obtain segments of <b>on-spec</b> filament shape. This result was much harder to achieved when PMDA concentration was lowered to 0. 5 wt% and it was impossible to be done with PMDA concentration of 0. 35 wt%. With 0. 75 wt% PMDA, the melt strength was satisfactory for pulling the filament by the spooler which is needed to control the filament’s diameter. Then, produced filaments were tried in a 3 D-printer. A small shape was successfully 3 D-printed using our filament product. It was found that the minimum recommended 3 D-printing temperature is 275 °C which required, in our case, a mild hardware and software modification on the 3 D-printer. Furthermore, recommendations were made to promote a smooth printing task and to enhance the quality of the print...|$|E
