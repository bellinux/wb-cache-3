5|$|Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars (also {{known as}} Circle <b>of</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States) is a 1996 point-and-click {{adventure}} game developed by Revolution Software. It {{is the first}} game in the Broken Sword series. The player assumes the role of George Stobbart, an American tourist in Paris, as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy. The game takes place in both real and fictional locations in Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{pneumothorax}} {{by physical}} examination alone {{can be difficult}} (particularly in smaller pneumothoraces). A chest X-ray, computed tomography (CT) scan, or ultrasound is usually used to confirm its presence. Other conditions that can result in similar symptoms include a hemothorax (buildup <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pleural space), pulmonary embolism, and heart attack. A large bullae may look similar on a chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|If the {{dissection}} of {{the artery}} {{extends to the}} part of the artery that lies inside the skull, subarachnoid hemorrhage may occur (1% of cases). This arises due to rupture of the artery and accumulation <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subarachnoid space. It may be characterized by a different, usually severe headache; it may also cause a range of additional neurological symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Of the 40% of {{patients}} who develop kidney involvement, almost all have evidence (visible or on urinalysis) <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, {{as well as the}} features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{landing craft}} used {{included}} twelve actual World War II examples, 10 LCVPs and 2 LCMs, standing {{in for the}} British LCAs that the Ranger Companies rode in to the beach during Operation Overlord. The filmmakers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive in operating condition. The Tiger I tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old, but functional, Soviet T-34 tanks. The two vehicles described in the film as Panzers were meant to portray Marder III tank destroyers. One was created for the film using the chassis of a Czech-built Panzer 38(t) tank similar {{to the construction of}} the original Marder III; the other was a cosmetically modified Swedish SAV m/43 assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} in the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire {{sightings}} in Transylvania, with frequent stakings and grave diggings taking place to identify and kill the potential revenants; even government officials were compelled into the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the Age of Enlightenment, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in what could only be called a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in East Prussia in 1721 and in the Habsburg Monarchy from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, which were the first to be officially recorded, involved the corpses of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have {{died at the age of}} 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich soon supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss <b>of</b> <b>blood.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second case, Arnold Paole, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while haying. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Paole had returned to prey on the neighbours.|$|E

30|$|The {{univariate}} {{linear regression}} model demonstrated a trend for {{a positive correlation}} between the mean SBP and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> loss <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-remifentanil group (slope 1.34, intercept 12.7, adjusted R 2 [*]=[*] 0.021, P[*]=[*] 0.07; Fig.  3 c).

25|$|Examination of {{the urine}} (urinalysis) allows a direct {{assessment}} for possible kidney problems, {{which may be}} suggested by appearance <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urine (haematuria), protein in the urine (proteinuria), pus cells in the urine (pyuria) or cancer cells in the urine.

25|$|When {{the crown}} is {{retracted}} inside the tube, the radioles and operculum cease {{to function as}} a respiratory organ. The movement <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capillaries of the thoracic membrane and body wall continues, however. Under these circumstances, respiratory exchange is probably carried out between the blood in these vessels and the surrounding water, which is kept moving through the tube by vigorous pumping movements of the abdomen and also by the activity of the ciliary tracts.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefits}} versus {{risks of}} placing a nasogastric tube {{in those with}} upper GI bleeding are not determined. Endoscopy within 24hours is recommended. Prokinetic agents such as erythromycin before endocopy can decrease the amount <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach and thus improve the operators view. Early endoscopy decreases hospital time {{and the amount of}} blood transfusions needed. Proton pump inhibitors, if they have not been started earlier, are recommended in those in whom high risk signs for bleeding are found. It is also recommended that people with high risk signs are kept in hospital for at least 72hours.|$|E

25|$|Acute aortic {{insufficiency}} In acute AI, {{as may be}} seen with acute perforation of the aortic valve due to endocarditis, {{there will be a}} sudden increase in the volume <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left ventricle. The ventricle is unable to deal with the sudden change in volume. The filling pressure of the left ventricle will increase. This causes pressure in the left atrium to rise, and the individual will develop pulmonary edema. Severe acute {{aortic insufficiency}} is considered a medical emergency. There is a high mortality rate if the individual does not undergo immediate surgery for aortic valve replacement.|$|E
25|$|Schistosomiasis is endemic in Egypt, {{exacerbated}} by the country's dam and irrigation projects along the Nile. From the late 1950s through the early 1980s, infected villagers were treated with repeated injections of tartar emetic. Epidemiological evidence suggests that this campaign unintentionally contributed {{to the spread of}} hepatitis C via unclean needles. Egypt has the world's highest hepatitis C infection rate, and the infection rates in various regions of the country closely track the timing and intensity of the anti-schistosomiasis campaign. From ancient times to the early 20th century, schistosomiasis' symptom <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urine was seen as a male version of menstruation in Egypt and was thus viewed as a rite of passage for boys.|$|E
25|$|By Knox's account, {{having spent}} the night with Sollecito, she arrived at Via della Pergola7 {{on the morning of}} 2November 2007, finding the front door open and drops <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{bathroom}} she shared with Kercher. Kercher's bedroom door was locked, which Knox took as indicating that Kercher was sleeping. After showering in the bathroom she and Kercher shared, Knox found feces in the toilet of the bathroom shared by Romanelli and Mezzetti. Knox went back to Sollecito's home and later returned with him to Via della Pergola7. Noticing a broken window in Romanelli's bedroom and alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, Sollecito unsuccessfully tried to force the door open. Sollecito called his sister, a lieutenant in the carabinieri, for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.|$|E
