40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of analytical techniques used to determine isoflavones (IFs) in foods and biological fluids with main emphasis on sample preparation methods. Factors influencing the content <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> in food including processing and natural variability are summarized and an insight into IF databases is given. Comparisons of dietary intake <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> in Asian and Western populations, in special subgroups like vegetarians, vegans, and infants are made and our knowledge on their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion by the human body is presented. The influences of the gut microflora, age, gender, background diet, food matrix, and the chemical nature <b>of</b> the <b>IFs</b> on the metabolism <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> are described. Potential mechanisms by which IFs may exert their actions are reviewed, and genetic polymorphism as determinants of biological response to soy IFs is discussed. The effects <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> on a range of health outcomes including atherosclerosis, breast, intestinal, and prostate cancers, menopausal symptoms, bone health, and cognition are reviewed {{on the basis of the}} available in vitro, in vivo animal and human data...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn Western cohorts, the {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> incidental findings (<b>IFs)</b> or incidentalome, referring to variants in genes that are {{unrelated to the}} patient's primary condition, is between 0. 86 % and 8. 8 %. However, data on prevalence and type <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> in Asian population is lacking. MethodsIn 2 cohorts of individuals with genomic sequencing performed in Singapore (total n= 377), we extracted and annotated variants in the 56 ACMG-recommended genes and filtered these variants based {{on the level of}} pathogenicity. We then analyzed the precise distribution <b>of</b> <b>IFs,</b> class <b>of</b> genes, related medical conditions, and potential clinical impact. ResultsWe found a total of 41, 607 variants in the 56 genes in our cohort of 377 individuals. After filtering for rare and coding variants, we identified 14 potential variants. After reviewing primary literature, only 4 out of the 14 variants were classified to be pathogenic, while an additional two variants were classified as likely pathogenic. Overall, the cumulative prevalence <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> (pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants) in our cohort was 1. 6 %. ConclusionThe cumulative prevalence <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> through genomic sequencing is low and the incidentalome may not be a significant barrier to implementation of genomics for personalized medicine...|$|R

40|$|Astrocytes, a {{prominent}} cell {{type in the}} brain, are receiving more and more attention from many neuroscientists. Astrocytes undergo a rather enigmatic process of activation in many pathological situations affecting the brain or spinal cord. These include CNS trauma, stroke, brain tumors or neurodegenerative diseases. A hallmark of astrocyte activation is upregulation <b>of</b> intermediate filaments (<b>IFs),</b> a part <b>of</b> the cytoskeleton. <b>IFs</b> are made <b>of</b> many <b>IF</b> proteins depending on the cell type, cell activation status and developmental stage of the organism. The role <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> in unchallenged or reactive astrocytes has been unknown. To study the role <b>of</b> astrocytic <b>IFs</b> in normal and pathological conditions, we have utilized mice deficient in astrocytic IF proteins, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and/or vimentin. Combined biochemical, morphological and ultrastructural analyses of astrocytes from these mice allowed us to define the partnership rules for astrocytic IF proteins. GFAP-/-vimentin-/- mice are devoid <b>of</b> astrocytic <b>IFs</b> in reactive astrocytes in vivo and in vitro. GFAP-/-vimentin-/- mice exhibited impaired glial scar formation following brain or spinal cord injury. This points to upregulation <b>of</b> astrocytic <b>IFs</b> as a crucial event {{in the process of}} astrocyte activation. Two in vitro studies offered potential explanation for the above finding. GFAP-/- astrocytes were incapable of inducing blood-brain barrier properties in endothelial cells, and the absence <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> led to a major defect in astrocyte motility. The latter finding suggests regulation of cell motility as a new function for IFs. IF-free astrocytes were also found to respond abnormally to hypotonic stress, a condition resembling cytotoxic edema in stroke, which implies the role <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> in astrocyte volume regulation...|$|R

5|$|After the High Councillor's {{downfall}} and the regime's {{defeat in}} Metropolis, the Regime is dismantled {{and all of}} its accomplices are arrested. Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the Universe to stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable <b>of</b> <b>if</b> he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court.

Multiple aspects of the story, including Personas and the character Philemon, were taken from Jungian psychology, while Kaneko's character designs were based on both staff members, and celebrities and fictional characters of the time. Reception to the game has generally been positive, with most praising its approach to the genre, while its navigation and localization were criticized. Its PSP port shared most points of praise with the original, along with the improved localization, but also drew negative comments for its by-then dated mechanics and graphics.|$|E

Patients and Methods: High-risk factors (HFs) were evaluated in 104 patients who underwent radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy {{for the treatment of}} stage IA 1 -IB 1 cervical cancer according to intermediate-risk factors (IFs). Results: Thirty-three patients without IFs had no HFs. As the number <b>of</b> <b>IFs</b> increased, the number of HFs increased (p= 0. 009).

5|$|The Joker is {{considered}} one <b>of,</b> <b>if</b> not, the most-recognizable and iconic fictional characters in popular culture (Batman's arguable equal), {{one of the best}} comic villains, and one of the greatest villains of all-time. The character was well-liked following his debut, appearing in nine out of the first twelve Batman issues, and remained one of Batman's most popular foes throughout his publication. The character {{is considered}} one of the four top comic book characters, alongside Batman, Superman, and Spider-Man. Indeed, when DC Comics released the original series of Greatest Stories Ever Told (1987â1988) featuring collections of stories about heroes like Batman and Superman, the Joker was the only villain included alongside them. The character has been the focus of ethical discussion on the desirability of Batman (who adheres to an unbreakable code forbidding killing) saving lives by murdering the Joker (a relentless dealer of death). These debates weigh the positive (stopping the Joker permanently) against its effect on Batman's character and the possibility that he might begin killing all criminals.|$|E

5|$|The {{first issue}} <b>of</b> <b>If</b> was dated March 1952, with Fairman as editor; it {{featured}} stories by Richard Shaver, Raymond Palmer, and Howard Browne, all writers who were regulars of the Ziff-Davis magazines. By {{the time the}} third issue reached the news stands, the disappointing sales figures for the first issue were in, and Quinn decided to let Fairman go. Quinn persevered with himself as editor. His first issue was dated July 1952, and he continued as editor on the masthead for some years. Quinn brought in Ed Valigursky as the art editor; he designed striking covers, including some wraparound artworkâan unusual featureâwhich helped improve circulation. Quinn began searching for a replacement editor: writer Lester del Rey turned down the job (a decision he {{is reported to have}} later regretted), but Quinn was able to engage Larry T. Shaw, an active science-fiction fan who had sold a few stories. Shaw joined in May 1953 as associate editor and soon began writing editorials (beginning with the September 1953 issue) and assisting with story selection. The magazine's quality quickly improved and soon Quinn felt able to switch to a monthly schedule, instead of bimonthly. Shaw left after only a year, and Quinn resumed full editorial responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{money raised}} for the Victory Loan {{campaign}} on If Day was $3.2million, {{which was the}} city's largest single-day total. Winnipeg passed its $24million Victory Loan quota on 24 February, {{largely because of the}} effects <b>of</b> <b>If</b> Day. The provincial total for the entire campaign was $60million, well above its target quota of $45million. The campaign raised approximately $2billion nationwide for the war effort, and If Day was {{considered one of the most}} successful fundraising events of the nationwide drive. Officials had expected a significant increase in army recruits as a result of the event, but it failed to end the long-term decline in recruitment numbers: 23 people enlisted at the Winnipeg recruitment office on If Day, compared to an average of 36 per day for the first half of February.|$|E
5|$|The new editor was Ejler Jakobsson, though Pohl {{continued}} to be listed as editor emeritus on the masthead until the JulyâAugust 1970 issue. Much of the editorial work was actually done by Judy-Lynn Benjamin, who was hired by Pohl in 1969 as an editorial assistant. The new regime failed to impress readers, and circulation dropped from over 67,000 for the year ending October 1968 to under 45,000 the following year, a drop of over 30%. If went bimonthly in May 1970, as Abramson attempted to juggle the frequency of publication of several of his titles to maximize profits; the page count and price were also adjusted more than once over the next year, again increasing profitability. Abramson also began a British distribution <b>of</b> <b>If,</b> reprinted with a separate cover, priced in British currency.
