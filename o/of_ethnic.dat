40|$|Abstract—Tolerance is a {{tool for}} {{achieving}} a social cohesion, particularly, among individuals and groups with different values. The aim is to study the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>ethnic</b> tolerance, the inhabitants <b>of</b> Latvia. The <b>ethnic</b> tolerance is taught {{as a set of}} conscious and unconscious orientations of the individual in social interaction and inter-ethnic communication. It uses the tools of empirical studies <b>of</b> the <b>ethnic</b> tolerance which allows to identify the explicitly and implicitly levels of the emotional component of Latvia's residents. Explicit measurements were made using the techniques of self-report which revealed the index <b>of</b> the <b>ethnic</b> tolerance and the <b>ethnic</b> identity <b>of</b> the participants. The implicit component was studied using methods based on the effect of the emotional priming. During the processing of the results, there were calculated indicators of the positive and negative implicit attitudes towards members of their own and other ethnicity as well as the explicit parameters <b>of</b> the <b>ethnic</b> tolerance and the <b>ethnic</b> identity <b>of</b> Latvia’s residents. The implicit measurements of the ratio <b>of</b> neighboring <b>ethnic</b> groups against each other showed a mutual negative attitude whereas the explicit measurements indicate a neutral attitude. The data obtained contribute to a further study <b>of</b> the <b>ethnic</b> tolerance <b>of</b> Latvia's residents. Keywords—ethnic tolerance, implicit measure, priming, ethnic attitudes T I...|$|R
