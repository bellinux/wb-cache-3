5|$|Some {{estimates}} include 220,000 Croats and 300,000 Serbs internally displaced for {{the duration}} of the war in Croatia. In many areas, large numbers <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> were forced out by the military. It was at this time that the term ethnic cleansing—the meaning of which ranged from eviction to murder—first entered the English lexicon.|$|E
5|$|The French {{suffered}} {{in the course of}} a ruinous retreat, including from the harshness of the Russian Winter. The Armée had begun as over 400,000 frontline troops, with fewer than 40,000 crossing the Berezina River in November 1812. The Russians had lost 150,000 in battle and hundreds of thousands <b>of</b> <b>civilians.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{situations}} of structural violence that include war and genocide, {{men and boys}} are frequently singled out and killed. The murder of targets by sex during the Kosovo War, estimates <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> male victims <b>of</b> mass killings suggest that they made up more than 90% <b>of</b> all <b>civilian</b> casualties.

5|$|After {{securing}} the island, the Allied forces developed Labuan into a significant base. The 24th Brigade {{left from the}} island to capture {{the eastern shore of}} Brunei Bay in late June, and the island's airfield was repaired and expanded to host Royal Australian Air Force units. While occupying Labuan, the Allies had to reconstruct the island's infrastructure and provide assistance to thousands <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> who had been rendered homeless by the pre-invasion bombardment. Following the war, a major Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery was established on Labuan.|$|E
5|$|Burning houses {{suspected}} of being partisan meeting places and poisoning water wells became common practice for soldiers of the German 9th Army. At Kharkov, the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union, food was provided only to the small number <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> {{who worked for the}} Germans, with the rest designated to slowly starve. Thousands of Soviets were deported to Germany to be used as slave labor beginning in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} the BBCAU {{detachment}} and 24th Brigade {{were faced with}} a significant humanitarian challenge. The Allied air and naval attacks had destroyed {{almost all of the}} buildings on Labuan, rendering large numbers <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> homeless. Within days of the invasion, about 3,000 civilians were housed in a compound within the beachhead. The BBCAU party were unable to assist so many civilians, and the 24th Brigade needed to assign soldiers to support them and transport supplies.|$|E
5000|$|The {{methods used}} during the Bosnian ethnic {{cleansing}} campaigns included [...] "murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> population, deliberate military attacks or threats <b>of</b> attacks on <b>civilians</b> and civilian areas, and wanton destruction of property".|$|R
50|$|Civilian {{officials}} who made representations {{to the commission}} {{indicated that they were}} not in a position, under the circumstances of conflict, to carry out any assessment <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> casualties. Consequently, no estimated or verified figures <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> casualties are available in the report.|$|R
30|$|Significantly, however, an {{in-depth}} analysis {{suggests that this}} perspective fails to distinguish between CIHL and IHL treaties. As IHL treaties definitively prohibit appropriation <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> property through illegal force, through the prohibition of pillage in GC IV Art 33, AP II (1977) Art 4  g), and also RS Art 8 2 (e) (v) and 8 2 (b) (xvi). In addition, the only allowance for legal appropriation <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> property is found in RS Art 8 2 (a) (iv). This analysis has shown that allowances in CIHL for appropriation <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> property due to imperative military necessity are extremely specific and do not, in any circumstances, justify pillage. We can maintain therefore that under IHL, pillage, or the appropriation <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> property by illegal force is categorically prohibited.|$|R
5|$|Human rights {{organizations}} documented a wide number {{of human rights}} violations and abuses committed by Soviet and Azerbaijani forces. These included forced deportations <b>of</b> <b>civilians,</b> unlawful killings, torture, kidnapping harassment, rape and the wanton seizure or destruction of property. Despite fierce protests, no measures were taken either to prevent the human rights abuses or to punish the perpetrators. Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.|$|E
5|$|Israel retaliated against Egyptian {{shelling}} with commando raids, artillery shelling and air strikes. This {{resulted in}} an exodus <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank. Nasser ceased all military activities and began a program to build a network of internal defenses, while receiving the financial backing of various Arab states. The war resumed in March 1969. In November, Nasser brokered an agreement between the PLO and the Lebanese military that granted Palestinian guerrillas {{the right to use}} Lebanese territory to attack Israel.|$|E
5|$|Later, the United Nations Security Council issued {{resolution}} 248 which {{condemned the}} Israeli raid on Jordanian territory and {{the violation of}} the cease-fire line, it recalled on resolutions 237 which had encouraged Israel {{to ensure the safety}} <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> in military areas. The resolution affirmed that reprisals were not to be tolerated and that repetitions of such violations would have forced the Security Council to take further steps.|$|E

50|$|Military and {{civilian}} aircraft interact {{in a number}} of complex ways, including shootdowns <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> planes, whether mistaken or not; military escorts <b>of</b> <b>civilian</b> planes; civilian planes being used for military transport, espionage, or other purposes; and/or no-fly zones being enforced to punish or sanction a target nation. Airpower also relates to space power, although militarization of space remains regulated by international treaty.|$|R
5|$|MacArthur's {{primary concern}} was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were {{required}} to support future operations. He urged his commanders on. On 25 January 1945, he moved his advanced headquarters forward to Hacienda Luisita, closer to the front than Krueger's. He ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. It reached the northern outskirts of Manila on 3 February, but, unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had decided to defend Manila to the death. The Battle of Manila raged {{for the next three}} weeks. To spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except in emergencies. For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
5|$|On Hitler's behalf, Himmler {{formed the}} Einsatzgruppen and built {{extermination}} camps. As facilitator and overseer of the concentration camps, Himmler directed {{the killing of}} some six million Jews, between 200,000 and 500,000 Romani people, and other victims; the total number <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> killed by the regime is estimated at eleven to fourteen million people. Most of them were Polish and Soviet citizens.|$|E

5|$|After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA {{leadership}} {{were unwilling}} to launch a full-scale campaign in Northern Ireland due to the possibility <b>of</b> <b>civilians</b> being killed. Instead they decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted Provisional IRA members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican paramilitary groups. The bridge had been targeted by the Irish Republican Army on 29 March 1939 {{as part of its}} Sabotage Campaign, and by the Provisional IRA on 24 April 1996.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{residents}} {{were allowed to}} return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis. Once authorized to enter their communities, many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return <b>of</b> <b>civilians.</b> In turn, dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations. In Pinellas County, laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters. As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E
5|$|By 21 June 2011, the Libyan {{government}} had dubiously {{claimed to have}} successfully shot down dozens of aircraft, including five Apaches; NATO denied these claims and no Apache losses have been acknowledged to date. On 8 July 2011, the MoD released information on {{the first month of}} Apache combat operations over Libya; noting that Apaches had engaged targets within Libya on 39 occasions. Apache operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information is continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of Surface to Air missiles (SAM), and the presence <b>of</b> <b>civilians,</b> enabling real time changes to mission profiles. On 6 August, Apaches struck a military communications facility and troops at Al Watiyah. Both the Apache and the Eurofighter Typhoon were withdrawn from Libyan operations in September 2011 as operational demands decreased.|$|E
