5|$|In 1948, Eric Dingwall, K. M. Goldney and Trevor H. Hall, {{three members}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Psychical Research (SPR), {{two of whom}} had been Price's most loyal associates, {{investigated}} his claims about Borley. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, The Haunting of Borley Rectory, which concluded that Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.|$|E

5|$|As radicalism {{took hold}} in Britain in the 1790s, Johnson became {{increasingly}} involved in its causes: {{he was a}} member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Constitutional Information, which was attempting to reform Parliament; he published works defending Dissenters after the religiously motivated Birmingham Riots in 1791; and he testified on behalf of those arrested during the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson published works championing the rights of slaves, Jews, women, prisoners, Dissenters, chimney sweeps, abused animals, university students forbidden from marrying, victims of press gangs, and those unjustly accused of violating the game laws.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, he was {{appointed}} an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society (HonFRS), the only amateur astronomer ever to achieve the distinction. In June 2002, he {{was appointed}} as the Honorary Vice-President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> the History of Astronomy. Also in 2002, Buzz Aldrin presented him with a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for services to television. He was patron of Torquay Boys' Grammar School in south Devon. Moore had a long association with the University of Leicester and its Department of Physics and Astronomy, and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science (HonDSc) degree in 1996 and a Distinguished Honorary Fellowship in 2008, the highest award that the university can bestow.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s Bánáthy began {{teaching}} courses in applied linguistics and systems science at San José State University. In 1962 {{he was named}} Dean and Chairman of the East Europe and Middle East Division at the Army Language School, overseeing ten language departments. In 1963 he completed his master's degree in psychology at San Jose State University, and in 1966 he received a doctorate in education for a transdisciplinary program in education, systems theory, and linguistics from the University of California in Berkeley. During the mid-1960s Bánáthy was named Chair of Western Division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> General Systems Research. He published his first book, Instructional Systems, in 1968.|$|E

5|$|Later {{residents}} of the area have included the classical scholar, essayist, poet and founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Psychical Research, Frederic Myers, {{who was born in}} Keswick, and the campaigner for animal welfare Donald Watson, founder of the Vegan Society, who lived in Keswick after retiring from teaching. The pioneer mountaineers and photographers George and Ashley Abraham lived and worked in Keswick. Their photographic shop in Lake Road, built in 1887, was later taken over by the local mountaineer and outfitter George Fisher; the shop still contains memorabilia, including photographs, from the Abrahams' era.|$|E
5|$|Moore was President of the British Astronomical Association, {{co-founder and}} {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Popular Astronomy (SPA), author of over seventy books on astronomy, and presenter of the world's longest-running television {{series with the}} same original presenter, the BBC's The Sky at Night. As an amateur astronomer, he became known as a specialist in Moon observation and for creating the Caldwell catalogue. Idiosyncrasies such as his rapid diction and monocle made him a popular and instantly recognisable figure on British television.|$|E
5|$|Stearn was {{a member}} of the Linnean Society for many years, {{becoming}} a fellow as early as 1934. He served as botanical curator 1959–1985, Council member 1959–1963 and as Vice-President 1961–1962 and President 1979–1982, producing a revised and updated history of the society in 1988. He also served as president of the Garden History Society and the Ray Society (1975–1977). The Royal Horticultural Society had made him an honorary fellow in 1946 and in 1986 he became a vice-president. Stearn became a member of the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI) in 1954, joining the Maps Committee the following year to prepare their Atlas of the British Flora (1962). He remained on that committee till 1968, when it became the Records Committee. For 40 years he was the BSBI referee for Allium. While at the Lindley Library, he became a founding member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> the Bibliography of Natural History (later, the Society for the History of Natural History) in 1936, was one of its most active publishing members based on his cataloguing work at the library, and published a history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> their 50th anniversary in 1986. Other societies on which he served include the British Society for the History of Science (vice-president), the British Society for the History of Medicine (Council), the Garden History Society (president 1977–1982) and was a corresponding member of the Botanical Society of America.|$|E

5|$|The {{tower and}} transepts were {{restored}} 1878–80 {{with a short}} spire similar to the original, but slated rather than oak-shingled. This work was done by Roderick Williams. The pulpit dates from this time. William Morris, on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> the Protection of Ancient Buildings, wrote to the vicar in 1877 asking for a less severe restoration. Unfortunately much had already been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} January 2007, the {{government}} declared it would postpone the demolition of Queen's Pier until a consensus could be reached on the course of action; consultations with the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Hong Kong Institute of Engineers, and the Conservancy Association were held. The Institute of Architects, whose members opposed dismantling the pier, originally maintained the pier should remain untouched. However, {{it was reported that}} after meeting {{the government}}, the Institute and the Conservancy Association were persuaded by the government that the pier could first be dismantled, and then reassembled at another location after completion of the reclamation. This change of heart was heavily criticised by Winston Chu, founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Protection of the Harbour. The HKIA clarified that their opposition had not in fact changed.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that the}} grounds were haunted, {{they decided to}} publish their {{findings}} in a book An Adventure (1911) under the pseudonyms of Elizabeth Morison and Frances Lamont. The book, containing the claim that Marie Antoinette had been encountered in 1901, caused a sensation. However, many critics did not take it seriously {{on the grounds of}} the implausibilities and inconsistencies that it was thought to contain. A review of the book by Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick in the Proceedings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Psychical Research suggested that the women had misinterpreted normal events that they had experienced. In 1903, an old map of the Trianon gardens was found and showed a bridge that the two women had claimed to have crossed that had not been on any other map. The identity of the authors of An Adventure was not made public until 1931.|$|E
50|$|He {{served as}} <b>the</b> {{founding}} President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Primary Care <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Gastroenterology and as <b>the</b> founding Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Primary Care Gastroenterology.|$|R
50|$|He further gave offence by {{his share}} in {{founding}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Societies</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Reformation <b>of</b> Manners. Gilbert Burnet says that Horneck and William Beveridge were leaders in this movement {{just before the}} Glorious Revolution.|$|R
50|$|President (from 2004) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Federation <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Music Education (RussSME) - National Affiliate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> International <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Music Education (ISME), {{a member}} of UNESCO.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{evidence of the}} wealth brought by the slave trade there are several significant links to the abolitionists. Bristol's Hannah More was an influential member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Effecting the Abolition of the African Slave Trade. In the Seven Stars Public House Thomas Clarkson collected evidence for William Wilberforce on the cruelty of the trade in humans. Bristol Cathedral contains several memorials to people active in the abolition cause, including a bust of Robert Southey. John Wesley opposed the trade in humans and in 1774 his sermon at the New Room against slavery was disturbed by explosion. Several plays adopted by the abolitionists were performed at the Bristol Old Vic, including Oroonoko, {{the story of an}} enslaved African and The Padlock, which was praised by Clarkson for its importance to the abolition cause.|$|E
5|$|Josephson {{said that}} Trinity College's long {{interest}} in the paranormal meant {{that he did not}} dismiss these ideas out of hand. Several presidents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore {{the idea that there is}} intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.|$|E
5|$|Piattoli {{arrived in}} the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that year, as a tutor for the sons of Piotr Potocki, {{a member of the}} magnate Potocki family. It was said in a {{contemporary}} account that his entire material wealth at that time was composed of a “sizable library”. Piattoli ended his service with the Potocki family around 1784 due to personal disagreements with Pelagia Potocka and Maria Radziwiłł. In the meantime, he became associated with the Lubomirski family—Izabela Lubomirska in particular—and through them befriended Stanisław Kostka Potocki and Grzegorz Piramowicz. Through Potocki and Piramowicz he became a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Elementary Books in 1784. In the Society he was tasked with writing a textbook on the history of science. Around that time he was also active in Warsaw freemasonry.|$|E
25|$|Leland Clark {{presented}} his first paper about the oxygen electrode, later named the Clark electrode, on 15 April 1956, {{at a meeting}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Artificial Organs during <b>the</b> annual meetings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federated <b>Societies</b> <b>for</b> Experimental Biology.|$|R
50|$|He {{acts and}} has acted on {{numerous}} advisory organs relating directly {{to life and}} material sciences, or to the economic applications thereof, and held positions such as chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Biomaterials and treasurer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Biomaterials.|$|R
50|$|Fox was <b>the</b> {{founding}} president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> History <b>of</b> Science, {{which was}} founded on October 12, 2003.

5|$|Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came {{to believe}} that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the {{relationship}} between the two broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among its first publications were Crowley's Collected Works, edited by Ivor Back. His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was J. F. C. Fuller, a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, The Star in the West (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest ever written.|$|E
5|$|Scott's restorations {{were not}} without their critics and caused much debate in {{architectural}} circles. Scott {{claimed to have}} archaeological evidence for his work, but the Liverpool architect, Samuel Huggins argued in an 1868 address to the Liverpool Architectural Society, that the alterations were less like restoration and more like rebuilding. One of the larger changes was to shorten the south aisle and restyle it as an apse. The changes also proposed {{the addition of a}} spire above the existing tower, but this proposal was later rejected. Samuel's further paper of 1871 entitled On so-called restorations of our cathedral and abbey churches compelled the Dean to attempt to answer the criticism. The debate contributed to the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> the Protection of Ancient Buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{transfer}} of ownership to the committee was legally complex, but both parties agreed that all shares in the railway company would be transferred from Haydn Jones' estate to a new company called Talyllyn Holdings Ltd., whose board consisted of two directors from the executors and two from the committee. The transfer took place on 8 February 1951, {{at which point the}} newly formed Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society effectively took control of the railway. The Society immediately began to publicise its efforts, hoping to raise funds and find further volunteers to help reopen the railway, and by May nearly 650members had joined the society. The railway re-opened under the control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Society</b> <b>for</b> the first time on the Whit Monday bank holiday, 14 May 1951, with trains running between Wharf and Rhydyronen stations. Regular trains began to run on 4 June and continued through the summer, with David Curwen acting as the first Chief Mechanical Engineer.|$|E
