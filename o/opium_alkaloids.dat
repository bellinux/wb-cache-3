25|$|Reddish-brown and {{extremely}} bitter, laudanum contains {{almost all of}} the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> including morphine and codeine, and its high morphine concentration makes it a potent narcotic. Laudanum was historically used to treat a variety of ailments, but its principal use was as an analgesic and cough suppressant. Until the early 20th century, laudanum was sold without a prescription and was a constituent of many patent medicines. Today, laudanum is recognized as addictive and is strictly regulated and controlled as such throughout most of the world. The United States Uniform Controlled Substances Act, for one example, lists it on Schedule II.|$|E

25|$|By 1972, {{the effects}} of the War On Drugs had caused {{widespread}} shortages of illicit and licit opiates because of a scarcity of natural opium, poppy straw, and other sources of <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> and the geopolitical situation was growing difficult for the United States. After much of the opium and morphine in the US National Stockpile of Strategic & Critical Materials was tapped in order to ease severe shortages of medicinal opiates — the codeine-based antitussives in particular — in late 1973, researchers were tasked with finding a way to synthesize codeine and its derivatives. They quickly succeeded using petroleum or coal tar and a process developed at the United States' National Institutes of Health.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{capsules}} can be {{dried and}} used for decorations, but they also contain morphine, codeine, and other alkaloids. These pods can be boiled in water to produce a bitter tea that induces a long-lasting intoxication (See Poppy tea). If allowed to mature, poppy pods (poppy straw) can be crushed and used to produce lower quantities of morphinans. In poppies subjected to mutagenesis and selection on a mass scale, researchers {{have been able to}} use poppy straw to obtain large quantities of oripavine, a precursor to opioids and antagonists such as naltrexone. Although millennia older, the production of poppy head decoctions {{can be seen as a}} quick and dirty variant of the Kábáy poppy straw process, which since its publication in 1930 has become the major method of obtaining licit <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids</b> worldwide, as discussed under the Wikipedia Morphine article.|$|E
2500|$|Poppy seeds yield 45–50% oil. [...] Like poppy seeds, poppyseed oil {{is highly}} palatable, high in vitamin E, and {{contains}} <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids</b> such as morphine and codeine in quantities {{of up to}} 400mg/L.|$|E
50|$|The Government <b>Opium</b> and <b>Alkaloid</b> Factories (GOAF) is an Indian government-owned organisation. Its {{headquarter}} {{is located}} in New Delhi.

50|$|Papaverine is an <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> used {{to treat}} visceral spasms, erectile {{dysfunction}} and investigated as antipsychotic drug due to its potency to inhibit phosphodiesterase PDE10A.|$|R
50|$|Papaverine is {{also present}} in {{combinations}} of <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> salts such as papaveretum (Omnopon, Pantopon) and others, along with morphine, codeine, {{and in some cases}} noscapine and others in a percentage similar to that in opium, or modified for a given application.|$|R
2500|$|Codeine {{is found}} in {{concentrations}} of 1% to 3% in opium prepared by the latex method from unripe pods of Papaver somniferum. The name codeine {{is derived from the}} Greek word kodeia (κώδεια) for [...] "poppy head". The relative proportion of codeine to morphine, the most common opium alkaloid at 4% to 23%, tends to be somewhat higher in the poppy straw method of preparing <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, opium {{tincture}} is marketed {{and distributed}} by several pharmaceutical firms, each producing a single {{formulation of the}} drug, which is deodorized. [...] Each mL contains 10mg of anhydrous morphine (the equivalent of 100mg of powdered opium), other <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids</b> (except noscapine), and ethanol, 19%. [...] It is available prepackaged in bottles of four ounces (118 mL) and 16 ounces (1 pint or 473 mL).|$|E
2500|$|Some minor <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids</b> {{and various}} {{substances}} with opioid action {{are also found}} elsewhere, including molecules present in kratom, Corydalis, and Salvia divinorum plants and some species of poppy aside from Papaver somniferum. There are also strains which produce copious amounts of thebaine, an important raw material for making many semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids. [...] Of all {{of the more than}} 120 poppy species, only two produce morphine.|$|E
40|$|Simple, {{sensitive}} and fairly rapid method for {{the determination of}} noscapine (an <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> of pharmaceutical importance) is described.

5000|$|Papaverine, an <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to act as a PDE10 inhibitor. PDE10A is almost exclusively expressed in the striatum and subsequent increase in cAMP and cGMP after PDE10A inhibition (e.g. by papaverine) is [...] "a novel therapeutic avenue in the discovery of antipsychotics".|$|R
5000|$|Narceine is an <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> {{produced}} by the Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) plant. It is a bitter, crystalline compound with narcotic effects. It was formerly used {{as a substitute for}} morphine. Its name is derived from the Greek [...] (nárkē), meaning numbness, and the postfix -ine referring to an alkaloid.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the drug}} opium is {{produced}} by [...] "milking" [...] latex from the unripe fruits ("seed pods") {{rather than from the}} seeds, all parts of the plant can contain or carry the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids,</b> especially morphine and codeine. This means that eating foods (e.g., muffins) that contain poppy seeds can result in a false positive for opiates in a drug test. However the results provided will not be the same for someone who uses opiates.|$|E
2500|$|Laudanum {{is known}} as a [...] "whole opium" [...] {{preparation}} since it historically contained all the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids.</b> [...] Today, however, the drug is often processed to remove all or most of the noscapine (also called narcotine) present as this is a strong emetic and does not add appreciably to the analgesic or anti-propulsive properties of opium; the resulting solution is called Denarcotized Tincture of Opium or Deodorized Tincture of Opium (DTO).|$|E
2500|$|Toward {{the middle}} 20th century, {{the use of}} opiates was {{generally}} limited {{to the treatment of}} pain, and opium was no longer a medically accepted [...] "cure-all". [...] Further, the pharmaceutical industry began synthesizing various opioids, such as propoxyphene, oxymorphone and oxycodone. [...] These synthetic opioids, along with codeine and morphine were preferable to laudanum since a single opioid could be prescribed for different types of pain rather than the [...] "cocktail" [...] of laudanum, which contains nearly all of the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids.</b> [...] Consequently, laudanum became mostly obsolete as an analgesic, since its principal ingredient is morphine, which can be prescribed by itself to treat pain. [...] Until now, there has been no medical consensus on which of the two (laudanum or morphine alone) is the better choice for treating pain.|$|E

50|$|Pantopon is, {{in other}} words, opium {{with all of}} the tar and other insolubles removed in an {{injectable}} form which, by weight, is nearly as potent as morphine. It was invented in 1909 by the Hoffmann-La Roche pharmaceutical company. Other drugs of the same type have included <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> sulphates (Papaveretum), phosphates, and valerates.|$|R
50|$|The {{oxycodone}} {{component in}} the combination is technically 14-hydroxy-7,8-dihydrocodein-6-one, a white odorless, crystalline powder which is synthesized from the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> thebaine. Thebaine by itself has no therapeutic value. Oxycodone is metabolized into oxymorphone. Unlike morphine and like codeine, oxycodone has a good oral potency. Prior {{to the introduction of}} paracetamol, Percodan was the mainstay in post-operative oral pain treatment due to the potency and long half-life of oxycodone. It originally contained a small amount of caffeine.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the opium}} poppy, the {{alkaloids}} {{are bound to}} meconic acid. The method is to extract from the crushed plant with diluted sulfuric acid, which is a stronger acid than meconic acid, but not so strong to react with alkaloid molecules. The extraction is performed in many steps (one amount of crushed plant is extracted at least six to ten times, so practically every alkaloid goes into the solution). From the solution obtained at the last extraction step, the alkaloids are precipitated by either ammonium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. The last step is purifying and separating morphine from other <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloids.</b> The somewhat similar Gregory process {{was developed in the}} United Kingdom during the Second World War, which begins with stewing the entire plant, in most cases save the roots and leaves, in plain or mildly acidified water, then proceeding through steps of concentration, extraction, and purification of alkaloids. Other methods of processing [...] "poppy straw" [...] (i.e., dried pods and stalks) use steam, one or more of several types of alcohol, or other organic solvents.|$|E

40|$|Buprenorphine (BUP) is a semisynthetic {{derivative}} of the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> thebaine {{found in the}} poppy Papaver somniferum. Its chemical structure contains the morphine structure but differs by having a cyclopropylmethyl group. Buprenorphine is a potent m opioid agonist. Buprenorphine undergoes extensive first-pass {{metabolism in the liver}} and gut. The development of a transdermal BUP formulation in 2001 led to its evaluation in cancer pain. This article provides the practitioner with an update on the current role of BUP in cancer care. It highlights data suggesting effectiveness in various types of cancer pain.

50|$|Neemuch or Nimach {{is a town}} in the Malwa {{region of}} the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The town shares its northeastern border with state of Rajasthan and is the {{administrative}} headquarters of Neemuch District. Formerly a large British cantonment of Gwalior princely state, in 1822 the town became {{the headquarters of the}} combined Rajputana-Malwa political agency and of the Malwa Agency in 1895. The British Cantonment was disbanded in 1932 after which it was maintained by a British Municipal Board. Neemuch was the birthplace of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in 1939 and is home to a large scale army recruitment centre for the organisation. The CRPF still maintains part of Neemuch's British Military Cantonment, which was {{the first of its kind}} in India. The bungalow area, native troops area, bazar area and fields and gardens were maintained initially by the municipal board and later by the Municipal Council. After independence Neemuch City and the Baghana area were included in the municipal area. Neemuch is known as India's Eye donation capital as it accounts for the highest per capita eye donation rate in the country'. Neemuch also has Asia’s biggest <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> processing plant which is a government-owned company named- <b>Opium</b> and <b>Alkaloid</b> Works. It is a road junction and distribution centre for agricultural products. Handloom weaving is the major industry here.|$|R

40|$|Cytotoxic free {{radicals}} and release of several neurotransmitters such as bradykinin {{contribute to the}} pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. We have studied the efficacy of noscapine, an <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid</b> and a bradykinin antagonist, in reducing post-hypoxic-ischemic damage in developing brain of 7 -d-old rat pups. Hypoxic-ischemic injury to the right cerebral hemisphere was produced by legation of the right common carotid artery followed by 3 h of hypoxia with 8 % oxygen. Thirty to 45 min before hypoxia the rat pups received noscapine (dose = 0. 5 - 2 mg/kg) or saline. Pups were scarified at 24 h post recovery {{for the assessment of}} cerebral damage by histological methods. Our results showed that noscapine was an effective agent in reducing the extent of brain injury after hypoxic-ischemic insult to neonatal rats. Therefore, it is concluded that noscapine may be a useful drug in the managements of patients after stroke...|$|R
30|$|Addiction to opium {{has been}} a {{worldwide}} problem {{for a long time}} (Mehendale et al. 2013; Kalantari Meibodi et al. 2015; Ebrahimi et al. 2011). Poisoning with <b>opium,</b> its <b>alkaloids,</b> and opioids are very common in some countries (Westermeyer et al. 1991). Thus, their precise and accurate detection in biological and non-biological samples is a matter of great importance in forensic and clinical toxicology (Ahadi et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} rhesus monkeys to assess some behavioral effects of the <b>opium</b> <b>alkaloid,</b> thebaine, in relation to its dependence liability. The concurrent intramuscular administration of naloxone did not antagonize the rate-decreasing effects of thebaine on a fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of food-reinforced responding. Animals trained to self-administer codeine (0. 3 mg/kg/inj) on an FR 30 schedule did not self-administer thebaine (0. 003 - 1. 0 mg/kg/inj) at rates {{comparable to those of}} codeine. Rates were minimally above those of saline at 0. 3 mg/kg/inj. Monkeys given 23 hrs/day continuous access to 1. 0 mg/kg/inj thebaine did, however, self-administer the drug at rates significantly higher than those maintained by saline, but not as high as those supported by 2. 0 mg/kg/inj codeine. Two animals self-administering thebaine did not show any signs of withdrawal when injected with 0. 1 - 1. 0 mg/kg of naloxone or when saline was substituted for thebaine. A third monkey showed a severe reaction leading to death following an injection of 1. 0 mg/kg naloxone...|$|R
