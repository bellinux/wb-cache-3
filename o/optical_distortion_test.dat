40|$|IEEE; IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society (I and M) <b>Optical</b> <b>distortion</b> {{is a kind}} of {{ubiquitous}} {{problem in}} optical system, although it has little effect on the clarity of the image, it has a bad effect on the precision of the imaging geometrical position, especially in the optical system with large field of view, and it will be increased largely with increasing the view field. In the LASIS(Large Aperture Static Imaging Spectrometer) system, if the <b>optical</b> system has <b>distortion,</b> it may lead to inadequate sampling, which means that it couldn&# 39;t satisfy the Nyquist sampling theorem, causing the recovery spectrum distortion. Because the larger the distortion, the lower the registration precision, it&# 39;s very hard to correct the distortion effect, thus, it is useful to analyze the influence of <b>optical</b> system <b>distortion</b> on the image quality. An <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> model is developed in the paper to evaluate the <b>optical</b> design, the <b>distortion</b> data is calculated from the optical design software and the influence of <b>optical</b> system <b>distortion</b> on the data acquired by LASIS is analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The glazing {{is today}} {{a part of}} the car design. The {{customer}} is more or less taking for granted that his or her view from inside the car is a direct mirror of the outside world. With more complex shapes, lower installation angles and thinner glass it is a great challenge to produce even better quality at a lower price. While the windscreen is regulated by law, the lack of well specified requirements for the optics in the backlight (rear window), together with the absence of direct customer complaints, is causing the optical quality of the backlight to decrease. The requirements and measuring methods used today are described in technical terms and do not correspond to the human perception of <b>optical</b> <b>distortion.</b> This report is a first step towards new technical requirements, for the optics of backlights, based on the driver’s perception of <b>optical</b> <b>distortion.</b> The knowledge of how <b>optical</b> transmission <b>distortion</b> occurs, how it should be measured and how it affects the driver, is essential in order to control it. Several databases were searched and contacts with experts were established, in order to gain knowledge. The connection between the technical requirements and the human perception of <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> in backlights was investigated by using psychophysical methods. A within factorial design was employed with two independent variables; viewing distance from backlight to tailing object and fixation time (viewing time). The result showed a significant difference in perception of <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> between 25 and 75 metres. Moreover, <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> is, according to the test, more disturbing during free fixation time than for fixation times of about one second. The requirements often used for backlights today (12 ± 5 millimetres) allow distortions that 68 percent of the test subjects perceived as disturbing. In order to please the test driver from Volvo the requirements need to be as high as 12 ± 2 millimetres, which correspond to the 96 th percentile. Furthermore, the result confirms that dynamic measurements are needed to find a connection to human perception of <b>optical</b> <b>distortion.</b> The principles of a new measuring method that measures the deformation and the dynamic distortion were developed to show the possibilities of measuring what the driver perceives. Even if a good measuring method can help controlling the produced glazing {{it is not enough to}} optimize the quality of the production. More important is the choice of thickness and curvature of the glass, the installation angle and the manufacturing method. It is important to set about the origin of the problem and develop a good routine of how to work with <b>optical</b> <b>distortions.</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>distortions</b> in backlights, similar to the tested backlight, have a low probability to disturb the driver in such extent that it has an effect on the driving. Nevertheless, it is a source of irritation and discomfort, which do not belong in a premium car. The video files are also clickable from the pdf file pages 29 and 56...|$|R

40|$|As a {{new type}} Fourier {{transform}} imaging spectrometry, large aperture static imaging spectrometry (LASIS) has come forth in recent years, which has many advantages such as simple principle, high stability and so on. However, the requirement for the optical system design of LASIS was very harsh. As one of the <b>optical</b> aberrations, <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> degrades the data quality acquired by LASIS, consequently limits its applications. According {{to the analysis of}} the data acquisition principle of LASIS, the data model with the effect of <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> was presented, which could be used for LASIS performance pre-evaluation. Finally, the computer simlulation of the data model was achieved with supposed parameters. The simulation results indicated that the relative error more than 5 % was induced in the recovery spectrum, and approximate 8 nm spectral line deviation was occurred at the long wavelength region. The results show that the 4 % <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> was inapplicable for LASIS although it is acceptant for common optical imaging system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The National Screening Committee {{recommends}} paired macular and nasal digital retinal {{images for}} diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening. Employment of trained retinopathy graders {{is a significant}} cost, and two images per eye increases grading time. Software to mosaic images is available but does not perform accurate registration or {{take account of the}} spherical nature of the retinal surface or <b>optical</b> <b>distortions.</b> Clinically significant data could potentially be hidden in the inaccurate overlap area. The aim was to devise and evaluate a system to accurately combine macular and nasal images into one composite image. Software was developed to register paired images by translation followed by warping to deal with spherical and <b>optical</b> <b>distortions.</b> The warping technique involves the application of thin-plate splines. To evaluate the system, twenty pairs of colour macular and nasal images were selected from a DR screening program. Blood vessels traversing image joins were classified by an experienced clinician. Linear transformation alone does not provide accurate registration of overlapping retinal images. The novel approach of using thin-plate splines accounts for the spherical retinal surface and <b>optical</b> <b>distortions</b> to produce accurate registration. ...|$|R

It was shown that LSM code correctly predicts the shear layer growth rate and structure evolution, as well as spectral content and amplitude of <b>optical</b> <b>distortions</b> imposed by the shear layer on the passing laser beam. Due to small number of vortices required to represent the shear layer dynamics, computational times are very short.

40|$|Abstract <b>Optical</b> <b>distortion</b> {{is one of}} {{the optical}} aberrations of optical systems that do not affect image sharpness. Thus, it can be {{beneficial}} to correct <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> computationally rather than optically. Computational correction versus optical correction will generally yields lighter optical systems. This is of great importance for head-mounted displays where the weight of the viewer needs to be minimized for efficient performance, safety, and optimum duration of usage. We shall describe in this paper, one method of computational correction that consists in warping polygon vertices. It is the case, however, that the algorithms given can be easily rewritten to handle pixels rather than vertices warpings. 1...|$|R
40|$|The wide {{using of}} digital {{photography}} {{has led to}} significant progress {{in the development of}} the theory and methods of restoring the three-dimensional space picture on base of two-dimensional digital images. To solve the problem of increasing the measurements accuracy of such systems, it is necessary to take into account the influence of a number of destabilizing factors. The aim of this work was development of technique for accounting and compensating of destabilizing factors influence, such as the deviation from the horizontal position line of the stereo pair lens, the non-parallelism of the lenses optical axes, the mutual inclination of the photo detector matrices, and the distortion of the stereo camera optical system for increasing of the measurements accuracy of rangefinder based on the correlation analysis of the stereo image. A software application has been developed for analyzing the <b>optical</b> <b>distortions</b> of serially produced lenses, which allows to visually demonstrate the distortions nature and to determine the polynomial coefficients for compensating of the <b>optical</b> <b>distortion.</b> It is obtained that for the Fujifilm FinePix Real 3 D stereo camera the distortion of the digital image reaches ± 20 – 35 pixels at the edges of the photo detective matrix and is not the same for the first and second lenses. The difference in the <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> values is due to the unequal slope of the photo detector matrix to the optical axis of the objective. Compensating polynomials for the <b>optical</b> system <b>distortions</b> of the first and second lenses of the stereo camera are experimentally determined. The range object expression from the stereo images taking into account the <b>optical</b> <b>distortion</b> compensation is obtained. It is shown for increasing of the measurements accuracy, the determining factor is not the absolute value of the lenses distortion, but the difference in the <b>optical</b> <b>distortions</b> of the stereo camera lenses, depending on the difference of the measured object coordinates of the on the photo detective matrices. Experimental studies of the developed technique for distortions compensation showed a decrease of the absolute measurements error more than by an order of magnitude at distances up to 100 m.  </p...|$|R

The images are detected, and image processing is used to enhance the detected images by compensating for the distortion, to achieve extended depth of field images of the object.
