25|$|On his return, Macleod was {{surprised}} and expressed doubt about the results. Banting took this as an attack on his integrity. They argued bitterly, but Banting finally accepted Macleod's instruction that further experiments were needed, and he even convinced Macleod to provide better working conditions and to give him and Best a salary. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings. Macleod was a far better orator, and Banting {{came to believe that}} he wanted to take all the credit. Their discovery was first published in the February 1922 issue of The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine. Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting's and Best's work. Despite their success, there remained the issue <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> enough pancreas extract to continue the experiments. Together, the three researchers developed alcohol extraction, which proved to be far more efficient than other methods. This convinced Macleod to divert the whole laboratory to insulin research and to bring in the biochemist James Collip to help with purifying the extract.|$|E
500|$|The film's preview and trailer were {{released}} on 24 December 2010 {{to a positive}} response from critics, who praised the whole presentation and Chopra's dialogues particularly: [...] "duniya ki har biwi ne kabhie na kabhie toh yeh zarur sochega, ki main apne pati se hamesha hamesha ke liye chutkara kaise paun" [...] ("Every wife {{in the entire world}} must have once in her lifetime thought <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of her husband forever"). Following the preview-trailer launches, Chopra promoted the film by appearing with seven men (dressed as bridegrooms) at the Radio Mirchi FM studio. The succession of marriages and funerals was illustrated at a promotional event for the film, where Chopra appeared as a Catholic bride in a wedding gown holding a bouquet. A short time later she reappeared as a widow in mourning, for her husbands' funerals.|$|E

2500|$|Wellington Phoenix {{has built}} a strong fan-base in Wellington, across New Zealand and amongst New Zealanders in Australia. The main {{supporters}} group, the [...] "Yellow Fever", was founded a day after Wellington Phoenix was announced in the A-League. Yellow Fever founder Mike Greene met with the founder of New Zealand cricket supporter group the Beige Brigade to get ideas <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the group started. The name was originally chosen {{on the assumption that}} the new Wellington-based team would play in a yellow playing strip (yellow being the dominant sporting colour of the region). Although the eventual strip is primarily black, Yellow Fever elected to retain the name. As such, many Yellow Fever members wear yellow to fixtures as opposed to black, such as the popular [...] "Retro Ricki" [...] T-shirt. The Phoenix have since moved to a predominantly Yellow strip.|$|E

She also reported to police that on one occasion she caught John {{on the phone with}} a girl named Rachel.

Authorities believe that Weeks was the mystery date who picked up Rachel and Shannon on the day they were last seen and that he arranged the date at the behest of Gabrion.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout most of {{her career}} Yasuda worked on colour designs for animators who {{employed}} the use of inks and paints for their creations but she also worked with digital media and used software like Toonz for her craft. At Studio Ghibli, Yasuda decided colours in consultation with Miyazaki and let the depicted objects guide her choices, based {{on the availability of}} materials and dyes in the time period portrayed. Her choice of individual colours and a colour scheme was also determined based on the mood of each film, a particular scene and the personality of each individual character. In the Los Angeles Times Cristy Lytal observed: [...] "For Yasuda, color is a storytelling tool that is every bit as powerful as words". In the article, Lytal quotes Yasuda, saying: [...] "What I like best is when I am building up the colors in my head, thinking <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the tone worked out," [...] and [...] "Color has a meaning, and it makes the film more easily understood.

2500|$|When {{it became}} clear that the crowd was not going to disperse, a group of 77 National Guard troops from A Company and Troop G, with bayonets fixed on their M1 Garand rifles, began to advance upon the {{hundreds}} of unarmed protesters. As the guardsmen advanced, the protesters retreated up and over Blanket Hill, heading out of the Commons area. Once over the hill, the students, in a loose group, moved northeast along the front of Taylor Hall, with some continuing toward a parking lot in front of Prentice Hall (slightly northeast of and perpendicular to Taylor Hall). The guardsmen pursued the protesters over the hill, but rather than veering left as the protesters had, they continued straight, heading toward an athletic practice field enclosed by a chain link fence. Here they remained for about 10 minutes, unsure <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the area short of retracing their path. During this time, the bulk of the students congregated to the left and front of the guardsmen, approximately [...] away, on the veranda of Taylor Hall. Others were scattered between Taylor Hall and the Prentice Hall parking lot, while still others were standing in the parking lot, or dispersing through the lot as they had been previously ordered.|$|E

2500|$|The lukewarm {{response}} to Monuments to an Elegy caused Corgan {{to change his}} plans for Day for Night. The critic's reviews of Monuments to an Elegy, which holds a rating of 70/100 at Metacritic based on 31 reviews, were criticized by Corgan for being [...] "middling, muddling" [...] reviews and not offering a [...] "fair" [...] evaluation of the album, while also admitting he didn't even read any of the reviews. Corgan said: [...] "I thought for sure I would get really strong reviews for our new album , based on all the feedback I was getting. But I'm getting the same reviews I {{got back in the}} day, these kind of middling, muddling reviews that just won't fucking say: 'This is a fucking brilliant album from a brilliant artist,'" [...] and also elaborated that, [...] "It's not a three-star fucking record. Nobody believes it's a three-star record. Nobody! OK, these people obviously did, so maybe I shouldn't be so absolute. But I've been in this business for 25 years and there is nobody in it who believes this is a three-star record. Nobody!" [...] The original plan was for Monuments to an Elegy to be a pop/rock album and then be followed by an experimental [...] "weird, arty" [...] album, Day for Night. However, the {{response to}} Monuments to an Elegy caused him to re-evaluate the Day for Night demos and decided that, [...] "The Smashing Pumpkins shouldn't be an arty band anymore," [...] and elaborated, [...] "Monuments is me solving a problem <b>of</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> The Smashing Pumpkins back into the mainstream. I had to solve that problem before I can solve problem two, which is where Day for Night comes in. That's why I'd thought 'I'll do the thing I should do, then I'll do the thing I want to do.' But now what I want to do is kick people out of the way." [...] Corgan later revealed that the follow up to Monuments to an Elegy would no longer to be titled Day for Night.|$|E
