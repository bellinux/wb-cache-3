500|$|In 2004, tickets {{sold out}} within 24 hours amid much {{controversy}} over the ticket <b>ordering</b> <b>process,</b> which left potential festival goers trying for hours to connect to the overloaded telephone and internet sites. [...] The website got two million attempted connections within the first five minutes of the tickets going on sale and an average of 2,500 people on the phone lines every minute. [...] The festival was not hit by extreme weather, but high winds on the Wednesday delayed entry, and steady rain throughout Saturday turned {{some areas of the}} site to mud. [...] The festival ended with Muse headlining the Pyramid Stage on Sunday, after Oasis had headlined on Friday. Franz Ferdinand and Sir Paul McCartney also performed. In the British press publications appeared about the use of psychedelic drugs by festival visitors. The magazine NME pronounced that 2004 would be [...] "the third summer of love" [...] due to the resurgence of the [...] "shroom" [...] that was praised as a natural alternative to ecstasy, which was said to be declining in popularity (LSD fuelled the first summer of love in 1967; ecstasy and LSD the second in 1988).|$|E

The Turing complete property rules out any algorithm to decide the equivalence between two higher <b>order</b> <b>processes.</b> The paper takes a look at a variant of the calculus of higher <b>order</b> <b>processes</b> that embodies the idea of resource sensitiveness. Resource sensitiveness means that a process received through a communication can only be used once. Two complete systems are given for the finite higher order pi-processes and the finite higher <b>order</b> CCS <b>processes.</b> These systems immediately suggest how to derive algorithms to check the equivalences on the finite higher <b>order</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|System {{identification}} {{is a necessity}} in control theory. Classical control theory usually considers <b>processes</b> with integer <b>order</b> transfer functions.

40|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) {{has been}} used to investigate the thermal transitions occurring for a series of eight Argonne Premium coals.

The sequential heating scans demonstrated that the rank of coal had a direct influence on the resistance of the second <b>order</b> <b>process</b> to exposure to heat. Low rank coals showed a greater degree of resistance and this was assumed to be related to the density of non-covalent bonds within the structure...|$|R

The time domain optimal tuning of FOPID controllers have also been carried out to handle these higher <b>order</b> <b>processes</b> by performing optimization with various integral performance indices.

50|$|A unique {{aspect of}} Rip's {{is the fact}} there is no {{tangible}} menu. The menu is given {{by word of mouth}} to the customers as they are waiting in line. This particular type of menu makes the <b>ordering</b> <b>process</b> simple; Bill Rounds, a current co-owner, asks each customer waiting in line if he or she would like to order a quarter light or a quarter dark. Depending on the day, he could also add chicken strips or fish to this question. The informal nature of the <b>ordering</b> <b>process</b> distinguishes Rip's from other taverns. Once seated, customers receive crispys and pickles, Rip's signature appetizers. Crispys are the spare batter pieces dropped from the chicken during the frying process.|$|E

40|$|We {{provide a}} novel {{approach}} to characterize the <b>order</b> <b>process</b> of continuous review (s,S) (s,S) and (r,nQ) (r,nQ) inventory policies, and study {{the impact of the}} batching parameter (the value of Q or S-sS-s) on the variability in the <b>order</b> <b>process.</b> First, we characterize the distribution of the time between orders, as well as the distribution of order sizes. We find that the coefficient of variation (cv) of the time between orders is smaller than the cv of the time between demands. The size of the orders can exhibit either variance amplification or dampening, compared to the demand sizes, depending on the demand size distribution and the value of the batching parameter. This may motivate a supplier to adjust his imposed fixed order cost to influence the batching size. Second, we look at the compound <b>order</b> <b>process,</b> defined by the number of units ordered during an arbitrary interval. The compound <b>order</b> <b>process</b> always exhibits variance amplification compared to the compound demand, which increases linearly in the batching parameter for large values of Q or S-sS-s; for small values, the variance amplification is fluctuating. We point out that the time interval, during which the number of units ordered/demanded is observed, also impacts the level of variance amplification, and we show to what extent larger time intervals (resulting in more aggregation of the data) lead to lower values of variance amplification. Both perspectives (looking at time between orders and order quantities, or observing the compound <b>order</b> <b>process)</b> provide useful information for the upstream supplier. status: publishe...|$|R
