Smithers added his own message under Martin's, encouraging men to gather in Gonzales {{to go to the}} relief of the Texians at the Alamo.|$|E
5|$|Shepseskare's {{relations}} to his predecessor and successor {{are not known}} for certain. Verner has proposed {{that he was a}} son of Sahure and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh Nyuserre Ini. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.|$|E

5|$|Beato pioneered {{and refined}} the {{techniques}} of hand-colouring photographs and making panoramas. He may have started hand-colouring photographs {{at the suggestion of}} Wirgman, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have seen the hand-coloured photographs made by partners Charles Parker and William Parke Andrew. Whatever the inspiration, Beato's coloured landscapes are delicate and naturalistic and his coloured portraits, more strongly coloured than the landscapes, are appraised as excellent. As well as providing views in colour, Beato worked to represent very large subjects in a way that gave a sense of their vastness. Throughout his career, Beato's work is marked by spectacular panoramas, which he produced by carefully making several contiguous exposures of a scene and then joining the resulting prints together, thereby re-creating the expansive view. The complete version of his panorama of Pehtang comprises seven photographs joined together almost seamlessly for a total length of more than 2 metres (6 1/2ft).|$|E
5|$|Behind {{the coup}} were almost {{certainly}} the Byzantines, who had every interest in removing a dangerous enemy and replacing him with somebody, if {{not from a}} pro-Byzantine faction, at least less actively aggressive. Gian Piero Bognetti advances a few hypotheses about Helmichis' motivation for his coup: his reason could have involved a family link to the Lethings, the Lombard royal dynasty that had been dispossessed by Alboin's father Audoin; <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have been related through Amalafrid to the Amali, the leading dynasty of the Goths. Helmichis easily obtained {{the support of the}} Lombards in Verona, and he probably hoped to sway all the warriors and Lombard dukes to his side by having Alboin's only child, Albsuinda, under his control. He may also have hoped for Byzantine help in buying the dukes' loyalty economically.|$|E
5|$|Domnall's rise {{to power}} in the Kingdom of Dublin took place in 1075, after the {{expulsion}} of the reigning Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill, King of Dublin by the latter's overlord, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster. The circumstances surrounding Domnall's accession are uncertain. He may have collaborated with Gofraid to wrench the kingdom from {{the grip of the}} Uí Briain, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have been installed in the kingship by Toirdelbach himself, and ruled under the latter's overlordship. Whatever the case, Domnall died within the year, and Toirdelbach placed his own son, Muirchertach, upon the throne.|$|E

5|$|In 1004-5 al-Maʿarri {{learned that}} his father had died and, in reaction, wrote an elegy where he praised his father. Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well {{received}} in the literary salons of the time, though he was a controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and {{learned that his}} mother had died before his arrival.|$|E
5|$|The first list {{fragment}} {{is followed}} by the canon tables of Eusebius of Caesarea. These tables, which predate the text of the Vulgate, were developed to cross-reference the Gospels. Eusebius divided the Gospel into chapters and then created tables that allowed readers to find where a given episode in the life of Christ was located in each of the Gospels. The canon tables were traditionally included in the prefatory material in most mediaeval copies of the Vulgate text of the Gospels. The tables in the Book of Kells, however, are almost unusable because the scribe condensed the tables {{in such a way as}} to make them confused. In addition, the corresponding chapter numbers were never inserted into the margins of the text, making it impossible to find the sections to which the canon tables refer. The reason for the omission remains unclear: the scribe may have planned to add the references upon the manuscript's completion, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have deliberately left them out so as not to spoil the appearance of pages.|$|E

25|$|On the 'ava cup being {{presented}} to a chief {{he takes it}} {{in his right hand}} and after a moment's pause, he spills a few drops onto {{the floor of the house}} on his right side at the same time speaking a few words in a low tone. Today these words have some Christian significance but in olden times were no doubt a form of prayer to one of the numerous gods. He then raises the cup and says Ia manuia which means be happy or prosperous. He then drinks a varying quantity of the 'ava and throws any remainder over his shoulder. He then hands the cup back to the tautu'ava who steps forward and returns to the refill the cup. Should the person served not desire to drink the 'ava he may take a mouthful and then spew it out, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> merely touch the cup held in the hand of the bearer <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> take hold of the cup and holding it out in front of him address a few remarks to the assembly, finally exclaiming Ia manuia.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} around 604 that Æthelfrith's son Oswald was born. Oswald's mother was Acha, {{daughter}} of Ælla, and thus Edwin's sister. Although Bede does not explicitly say Æthelfrith married Acha, {{it is thought}} that he did so; he may have married her prior to taking power in Deira, in which case the marriage may have facilitated it, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have done so afterwards in order to consolidate his position there.|$|E

William of Rubruck and a Muslim chronicler state that Batu killed the imperial envoy, and one of his brothers murdered the Great Khan Güyük, but these claims are not completely corroborated by other major sources. Güyük's widow Oghul Qaimish took over as regent, but she would be unable to keep the succession within her branch of the family.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} {{indications}} that Hipparchus knew spherical trigonometry, {{but the first}} surviving text {{of it is that}} of Menelaus of Alexandria in the 1st century, who on that basis is now commonly credited with its discovery. (Previous to the finding of the proofs of Menelaus a century ago, Ptolemy was credited with the invention of spherical trigonometry.) Ptolemy later used spherical trigonometry to compute things like the rising and setting points of the ecliptic, or to take account of the lunar parallax. Hipparchus may have used a globe for these tasks, reading values off coordinate grids drawn on it, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have made approximations from planar geometry, or perhaps used arithmetical approximations developed by the Chaldeans. He might have used spherical trigonometry.|$|E
25|$|The Acuera, one of {{the peoples}} noted by the French as part of Chief Utina's alliance, {{encountered}} the conquistador Hernando de Soto's expedition in 1539. De Soto stole corn from the Acuera while camped out {{in the nearby town}} of Ocale. However, extensive contact with Europeans did not occur until 1564, when the French Huguenots from the recently established Fort Caroline in present-day Jacksonville first visited the area. The French noted that at this time all the villages along the middle St. Johns, as well as some farther into the interior such as those of the Acuera, were part of a chiefdom ruled by a young leader named Utina. Though only 25 years old, Utina had sovereignty over forty other chiefs and their villages, and was {{one of the}} most powerful figures in northern Florida. The exact nature of Utina's chiefdom is unclear. He may have been the paramount head of an integrated chiefdom, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have been simply the leading chief in a confederacy of smaller chiefdoms. In any case he was treated as a powerful figure by the French and Spanish.|$|E

500|$|It {{is unknown}} how Morgan {{made his way}} to the Caribbean. He may have {{travelled}} to the Caribbean as part of the army of Robert Venables, sent by Oliver Cromwell as part of the Caribbean expedition against the Spanish in the West Indies in 1654, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have served as an apprentice to a maker of cutlery for three years in exchange for the cost of his emigration. Richard Browne, who served as surgeon under Morgan in 1670 stated that Morgan had travelled either as a [...] "private gentleman" [...] soon after the 1655 capture of Jamaica by the English, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>may</b> have been abducted in Bristol and transported to Barbados, where he was sold as a servant. In the 17th century the Caribbean offered an opportunity for young men to become rich quickly, although significant investment was needed to obtain high returns from the sugar export economy. Other opportunities for financial gain were through trade or plunder of the Spanish Empire. Much of the plunder was from privateering, whereby individuals and ships were commissioned by government to attack the country's enemies.|$|E
