50|$|Pralines have {{a creamy}} consistency, similar to fudge. They are usually made by {{combining}} sugar (often brown), butter, cream or buttermilk, and pecans {{in a pot}} <b>over</b> <b>medium-high</b> heat, and stirring constantly until most of the water has evaporated and it has reached a thick texture with a brown color. This is then usually dropped by spoonfuls onto wax paper or a sheet of aluminum foil greased with butter, and left to cool.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Plateau Rosa Alpine station (Italy) has {{collected}} atmospheric concentrations {{of carbon dioxide}} since 1989. If the complete set of hourly data is observed, two distinct and exceptional very high concentration events are evident for February 2004. Similar and almost contemporary peaks were registered at the European high–altitude stations of Zugspitze–Schneefernerhaus and Sonnblick in the Alps, and at Mt. Cimone in the Northern Apennines. A regional meteorological model (the Weather Research and Forecast) was applied <b>over</b> a <b>medium–high</b> resolution grid to study {{the evolution of the}} meteorological fields and to identify the trajectories of the polluted air masses during the CO 2 observed peaks. The results show that, during both episodes, atmospheric circulation conveyed highly polluted air from the European plains to the Alpine stations. This conclusion has been also confirmed through concentration measurements of the atmospheric trace gases in the same area...|$|R
