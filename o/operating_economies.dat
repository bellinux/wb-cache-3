50|$|J. Peter Grace, Jr. {{took over}} {{management}} of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964. In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the <b>operating</b> <b>economies</b> that full containerization promised.|$|E
50|$|Early {{versions}} of the PCC streetcars were referred to as Streamliners in North America. However, aerodynamic research appeared much earlier on the interurban scene, i.e. among the forerunners of the recent light rail. In 1905, the Electric Railway Test Commission started a series of test runs to develop a carbody design that would reduce wind resistance at high speeds. Vestibule sections of different shapes were suspended independent of the carbody, with a dynamometer to measure the resistance of each. Over 200 test runs were made at speeds up to 70 mph (c. 112 km/h) with parabolic, wedge, standard, and flat vestibule ends. The test results indicated that a parabolic-shaped front end reduced wind resistance at high speeds below that of the conventional rounded profile. However, with that times heavy railcars and moderate speeds, no significant <b>operating</b> <b>economies</b> were realized. Streamlining was discarded for another quarter century. From the 1920s, however, stronger alloys, lightweight metals, and better design were all used to reduce carbody weight - which in turn permitted the use of smaller bogies and motors with corresponding economies in power consumption. In 1922, the G. C. Kuhlman Car Company built ten lightweight cars for the Western Ohio Railway. After an elaborate wind tunnel investigation - {{the first in the}} railway industry - J. G. Brill Company in 1931 made their first Bullet railcars, capable to speeds above 90 mph (145 km/h). With 52 seats, they weighed only 26 tons though some of theme were almost 60 years in use.|$|E

50|$|To {{improve the}} {{efficiency}} of train working, Train Controllers (also known as Controllers, District Controllers, Line Controllers and Area Controllers) were progressively introduced on many British-style railways {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, the first being on the Midland Railway in 1907. Although the specifics of their duties varied between railways, Train Controllers were responsible for tracking train movements (especially freight), ensuring freight trains were loaded economically and provided with suitable locomotive power, liaising with train crew rostering personnel, ordering additional trains to run for the carriage of extra freight tonnage or passengers as required, allocating paths for unscheduled services and making alterations to scheduled working in order to maximize efficiency and deal with any irregularity in traffic which may affect smooth operation. On busy railways such as the Midland, it was at times very difficult for Signalmen to keep track of train movements and make optimal traffic regulation decisions whilst operating signalling equipment. Consequently, fast trains could be delayed by slower trains on the line ahead. Moreover, there was no-one with specific responsibilities relating to the efficient, economical use of rolling stock in traffic, which made it difficult to manage the contingencies of underutilisation, wastage and allocation of inappropriate locomotive power. In the face of rising costs, <b>operating</b> <b>economies</b> were particularly important to the private British railway companies in the early twentieth century. The Train Controller was intended to manage these and other difficulties. It is important to note that while Train Controllers were responsible for traffic regulation within their areas of control, they generally had no safety-critical responsibilities, which were within the realm of the Signalmen and Station Masters.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model the {{tradeoff}} between regional oligopsony power and cost efficiency resulting from consolidation {{in a food}} processing industry. The model {{can be used to}} calculate the cost reductions necessary to offset the anticompetitive effects of market power and to compare them to actual cost savings achieved through plant scale or multiplant <b>operating</b> <b>economies.</b> For an application, we choose the beef packing industry. For this case, we find that the estimated cost savings necessary to neutralize the anticompetitive effects of consolidation in beef packing are about half the actual cost savings from scale economies. Key words: beef packing, oligopsony power, scale economies. Consider a drastic restructuring of an industry that results in either plant scale economies through replacement of existing plants with fewer, larger, more efficient ones, or multiplant <b>operating</b> <b>economies</b> through reorganization and consolidation of assets of existing firms into a more efficient configuration, or both. 1 If such a restructuring also leads to a more highly concentrated ownership structure, improved cost efficiency may be accompanied by in-creased market power. Because the welfare ef-fects of consolidation work in opposite direc-tions, it is natural to inquire whether the net ef-fect is welfare enhancing or reducing. In other words, are the cost reductions through consoli-dation enough to offset the allocative ineffi-ciency resulting from greater market power?

40|$|FanWing is an {{aircraft}} configuration {{that uses a}} simple cross-flow fan mounted in the wing to provide both distributed propulsion and augmented wing lift at very low flying speeds. One of the current flight-test vehicles has been modified to accept both a novel OHS twin-tail arrangement and a new wing section and this has shown both increased flight stability and reduced drag, leading to significantly higher cruise speeds. The good slow flight capability, inherent safety and relatively quiet propulsion of the FanWing rotorcraft could fit well with cargo operations close to urban areas. A comparison with aircraft and helicopters showed that the recent developments of the FanWing concept could now uniquely offer short-field performance close to that of helicopters and tilt-rotor aircraft, but with <b>operating</b> <b>economies</b> close to that of conventional aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The study {{investigated}} the prescription drug purchasing behaviors of independent retail pharmacies, and selected pharmacy characteristics which {{may be related to}} purchasing behaviors. The purchasing function was considered as a major area of concern for independent pharmacies in attempting to improve operating efficiencies, particularly in view of increased competition from large scale retailing and institutional health care organizations. Attention was directed to purchasing patterns exhibited from all sources, and particularly to those which would provide relatively low per-unit drug costs. The findings indicated that pharmacy size was the only explanatory characteristic related to the use of sources of supply associated with lower per unit drug costs. Thus, one alternative is that pharmacies must increase in size in order to attain greater purchasing advantages. One proposed means was to integrate horizontally and vertically into cooperative-type organizations to achieve greater <b>operating</b> <b>economies.</b> The findings also led {{to the conclusion that the}} purchasing function may not be effectively or efficiently managed in independent retail pharmacies...|$|E

40|$|The next {{generation}} of space very long baseline (SVLBI) missions will require a minimum downlink data rate of 1. 024 Gb/s, and even more advanced missions propose to utilize 8. 196 Gb/s. These high data rates place new demands on down-link spectrum resources and implementation technologies, especially for the space research Ka-band frequency allocation of 37 to 38 GHz which is only 1 GHz wide. To meet this challenge, it becomes necessary {{to make use of}} simultaneous left-hand circular and right-hand circular polarized carriers, as well as various forms of band-width compressive modulation, along with modulation pulse shaping. Consideration is also given to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration regulations regarding out-of-band spectrum emissions.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a brief {{excursion}} into the comparative history {{of competition in}} the railroad industries of the United States and Britain. It starts from the observation that {{when faced with the}} unprecedented dynamics and costs of duopolistic and oligopolistic competition, railroad leaders in both countries searched for stability. The response in America appears to have moved from informal cooperation to pools and finally, once these had failed, to large-scale consolidations. In Britain the response and outcome were somewhat different. Having sought stability through pools, rates agreements, leases, working agreements, and corporate investment, and having found these wanting in certain respects, railway leaders were unable, for political reasons, to contemplate mergers. In any case market conditions in Britain set a close boundary on the <b>operating</b> <b>economies</b> that were achievable through cooperation. The major factors here were coastal shipping competition, especially for long-haul traffic after 1870 when sea freight rates fell, and a high level of dependency on small traders who offered small, often short-haul consignments. There were, however, a number of similarities. For example, in both countries pooling agreements could not readily contain or accommodate changes ' in the shares of traffic carried by the partners. And in both countries there were legal and political problems, although their character and impact on the railroads differed significantly...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} some {{simulations of}} the proposed California power exchange, or pool, as it might interact with the regional market in the Western U. S. Pooling will increase interdependence with the regional market. We study this using a multi area chronological production simulation model. We find that overall <b>operating</b> <b>economies</b> resulting from pooling are small. Physical changes in the dispatch of the electrical system, however, are rather large {{in comparison with the}} economic effects. The two driving forces for the physical changes are the reduced unit commitment resulting from pooling and transmission pricing policy. As a result of increased regional trade, transmission congestion increases. The costs of congestion appear small, however, since marginal costs in the regional are quite close to one another. Within the California pool, marginal cost pricing will produce economic rents for the generating companies. These rents are not particularly large, {{especially in light of the}} fixed operating and maintenance costs of the plants that must be covered by those rents. Finally we examine the potential for new entry into the market. Entry conditions in the near term do not appear particularly favorable. If the fixed costs of new supply are sufficiently low to allow entry, regional economics show no clear preference for siting within California versus more remote locations. The trade-off between moving gas versus transmitting power do not show a clear trend. These results are quite preliminary, but suggest that quantitative modeling of electricity restructuring can yield useful insights...|$|E
