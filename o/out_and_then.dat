5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It {{was in this}} {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E
5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} Test, too, Ring's batting made more impact than his bowling. A wet pitch led to 22 wickets {{falling on the}} first day, and {{temporary}} Australian captain Arthur Morris rejigged his batting order {{at the end of}} the day, opening the second innings with Ian Johnson and Gil Langley, sending Geff Noblet in when Johnson was <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Ring as a second nightwatchman when Noblet was out. Ring lasted into the second day when conditions were easier, and top-scored for the Australian team with 67, which remained his best score in Tests. He took three of the four wickets that fell as West Indies successfully chased a target of 233 on Christmas Day.|$|E

5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> knock them down with a tap.|$|E
5|$|The Union Springs is an organic-rich, pyritiferous, thinly bedded, blackish gray {{to black}} shale with {{mudstone}} concretionary layers, and thin silt bands at the bottom. To the east, {{it becomes the}} Bakoven Member, a darker, less organic shale with fewer limestone layers. To the west the Union Springs beds thin, with its upper limestones merging with the overlying calcareous Cherry Valley Member. A regional unconformity appears in western New York, as the Union Springs lenses in and <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> reappears in northwest Pennsylvania and northeast Ohio between the Onondaga and Cherry Valley.|$|E
5|$|The second movie Cagney's company {{produced}} was Blood on the Sun. Insisting {{on doing}} his own stunts, Cagney required judo training from expert Ken Kuniyuki and Jack Halloran, a former policeman. The Cagneys {{had hoped that}} an action film would appeal more to audiences, but it fared worse {{at the box office}} than Johnny Come Lately. At this time, Cagney heard of young war hero Audie Murphy, who had appeared on the cover of Life magazine. Cagney thought that Murphy had the looks to be a movie star, and suggested that he come to Hollywood. Cagney felt, however, that Murphy could not act, and his contract was loaned <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sold.|$|E
50|$|Metacritic {{gave the}} game an 80/100 despite that some textures seem to pop in <b>and</b> <b>out</b> now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> also the game's weird way of laying down track.|$|R

5|$|Unlike other Portia species, P. fimbriata in Queensland readily invades {{the nests}} of cursorial spiders, {{plucking}} or cutting the nest. If the resident spider eventually leaves the nest, P. fimbriata stalks it. If the resident spider tries to counterattack and then retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata may attack the other spider as it re-enters the nest, or may wait motionless until the prey exits. If a stabbed prey spider retreats into the nest, P. fimbriata in Queensland never enters the nest, but {{waits for the}} prey to move <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> P. fimbriata kills it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of the Gold Glove Award, there have been eleven double-play combinations, or pairs of middle infielders, that have won awards in the same year. Shortstops and second basemen depend upon each other for the {{majority}} of double plays. The most common type of double play occurs with a runner on first base and a ground ball hit towards the middle of the infield. The player fielding the ball (generally the shortstop or second baseman) throws to the fielder covering second base, who steps on the base before the runner from first arrives to force that runner <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> throws the ball to the first baseman to force out the batter for the second out. Mark Belanger won four Gold Gloves with the Baltimore Orioles alongside winning partner Bobby Grich, and Joe Morgan paired with Dave Concepción for four combination wins with the Cincinnati Reds. The most recent teammates to accomplish the feat are Brandon Crawford and Joe Panik, who won with the San Francisco Giants in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before it disappears. After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E
5000|$|Most unassisted triple {{plays in}} MLB {{have taken this}} form: an infielder catches a line drive (one out), steps on a base to double off a runner (two <b>outs),</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> tags another runner on the runner's way to the next base (three outs). The [...] "next base" [...] usually being the same base that the infielder stepped on to record the second out. Infrequently, {{the order of the}} last two putouts is reversed.|$|R

25|$|The wooded {{height of}} Castle Crag rises between Broadslack Gill and the Derwent, the two streams meeting {{to the north}} beneath the {{outlying}} knoll of Low Hows. It has steep faces on all sides except the south, where a low ridge runs <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> swings west around the head of Broadslack Gill.

25|$|Burke {{made his}} come-back by {{combining}} business and cricket, moving to England {{for a season}} as Todmorden's professional in the Lancashire League in 1954. He failed to manage a century, but did score five half-centuries including two nineties in 23 matches. Burke made 97 not <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> took 8/14 in a win over East Lancashire, his best batting and bowling figures for the whole season. He took five or more wickets in an innings in 11 matches.|$|E
25|$|Cylinder to {{manifold}} connection malfunction, though rare, {{can result}} in an extremely violent gas loss. In case of the right side manifold connection leak, the diver closes the isolating valve to secure the gas in the left cylinder, and continues to use the gas from the right cylinder until it runs <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> switches to the secondary regulator. At {{least half of the}} remaining gas volume is available {{for the remainder of the}} dive once the isolation valve has been closed.|$|E
