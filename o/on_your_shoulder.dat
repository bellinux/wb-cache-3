500|$|Following surgery, Raonic {{withdrew from}} the Italian Open and the French Open. He {{returned}} {{in time for the}} grass court season. [...] Having played in Halle in previous years, Raonic elected to play at the Queen's Club Championships for the first time. [...] Raonic lost in the quarterfinals in his Queen's debut, and lost in the third round at Wimbledon. After his Wimbledon loss to Kyrgios, Raonic commented that his foot injury had led to problems throughout his body: [...] "There wasn't a place it wasn't ... First ankle, then the hip, and then the back. Then when those things aren't working, you just put too much pressure <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and then your shoulder hurts." [...] The cascading injuries led to a withdrawal from Canada's Davis Cup tie against Belgium; a withdrawal from the Washington Open, where Raonic was the defending champion; first round losses at the Canadian Open and Cincinnati Masters; and a third round loss at the US Open to López.|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder</b> and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do that. Because you just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E

Please accept our greetings to you and deep respect to our brothers in Egypt and its people, wishing Egypt steady stability and security." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 1984, Double Trouble began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He {{was kind of}} like a nice hand <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulder,</b> as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E
