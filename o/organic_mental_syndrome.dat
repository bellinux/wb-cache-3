5000|$|An organic brain {{syndrome}} (OBS), {{also known}} as an organic brain disease/disorder (OBD), an <b>organic</b> <b>mental</b> <b>syndrome</b> (OMS), or an organic mental disorder (OMD), is a syndrome or disorder of mental function whose cause is alleged {{to be known as}} organic (physiologic) rather than purely of the mind. These names are older and nearly obsolete general terms from psychiatry, referring to many physical disorders that cause impaired mental function. They are meant to exclude psychiatric disorders (mental disorders). Originally, the term was created to distinguish physical (termed [...] "organic") causes of mental impairment from psychiatric (termed [...] "functional") disorders, but during the era when this distinction was drawn, not enough was known about brain science (including neuroscience, cognitive science, neuropsychology, and mind-brain correlation) for this cause based classification to be more than educated guesswork labeled with misplaced certainty, which is why it has been deemphasized in current medicine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the extent and quality of consultation-liaison (C-L) activity in Italy, a multicenter in-vestigation was conducted in 17 general hospitals. All of the hospitalized patients referred to C-L psychiatry during a 1 -year period were assessed {{by means of a}} specific instrument (Patient Registration Form, PRF-SF). Of 518, 212 patients, 4182 were referred to C-L services (referral rate 5 0. 72 %). Typical con-sultations were for female patients (60. 1 %), admitted to med-ical wards (71. 5 %), aged 55 – 75 years. Most interventions were carried out within 2 days; a minority (22 %) were urgent requests. Gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders, and unexplained medical symptoms were the most frequent ICD- 9 somatic diagnoses at admission. One-third of the patients were not informed of having been referred to C-L and half of them had a lifetime history of psychiatric disturbances. Most fre-quent ICD- 10 psychiatric diagnoses were neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform syndromes (33. 1 %), affective syn-dromes (19. 4 %), and <b>organic</b> <b>mental</b> <b>syndromes</b> (10. 7 %). Two-thirds of the patients were given only one consultation whereas the reminder received two to four follow-up visits. The rate of transfer to psychiatric wards was low (2. 1 %).

40|$|Objective - Emergency Department (ED) in General Hospitals has a {{significant}} role in providing for psychiatric evaluation. The aims of the present study were to examine the decision-making process of consultation psychiatry at the GH-ED and to analyze the differences between psychiatric patients admitted to a medical ward with those admitted to the psychiatry unit and those who are discharged from the ED. Method - Psychiatric consultations requested by ED physicians over a period of three years were recorded by using a form to describe epidemiological and clinical data on the consultation. Results - Of 1, 962 consultations, most regarded subjects who had had previous psychiatric contacts (76. 2 %) and at least one psychiatric admission (53. 6 %), and were currently cared for by the Mental Health Services (51. 1 %). Neurotic disorders (27. 98 %), schizophrenia (27. 67 %), and personality disorders (21. 81 %) were the most frequent ICD- 10 diagnoses. The psychiatrist’s disposal was to discharge the patient in 49. 9 % cases, to admit him/her to medical wards of the General Hospital (26. 9 %) (GH) or to the Acute Inpatient Psychiatric Unit (23. 1 %) (AIPU). GH group statistically differed from AIPU group for being female (p< 0. 01), older (p < 0. 01), having an ICD- 10 diagnosis of neurosis and related syndromes (p< 0. 01) or <b>organic</b> <b>mental</b> disorder (p< 0. 01), and less likely having a diagnosis f schizophrenia (p< 0. 01), being in charge of the Mental Health Services (p< 0. 01) and having had previous psychiatric admissions (p < 0. 01).

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{review of}} the charts of 52 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the New York Hospital was conducted to determine the prevalence of recorded psychiatric complications {{and the use of}} psychiatric consultation. Neuropsychiatric complications were found to be pervasive clinical features in AIDS patients hospitalized during acute illness. Mood disturbance was identified in an overwhelming majority of the patients (82. 7 percent), and signs of <b>organic</b> <b>mental</b> <b>syndrome</b> (DSM III) were noted in 65. 4 percent; references to neuropsychiatric complications appeared in every patient's chart. Neurological complications were seldom explicitly diagnosed or treated. Psychiatric consultation was requested for 10 patients (19. 2 percent) because of management problems, for diagnostic assessment, or by self-referral. Only one patient was given a psychiatric diagnosis at discharge. The results suggest that the neuropsychiatric complications of AIDS are underdiagnosed during acute medical illness and that psychiatric consultation is underutilized. AIDS patients have a heightened risk of psychological problems. Contributing factors may include the threat to life, severe physical debilitation, central nervous system involvement, fear of contagion, disclosure of homosexuality or drug abuse, and guilt associated with sexual transmission...|$|E

In the last 5 years, 13 % of patients had therapeutically significant stenoses or occlusions {{above and below}} the groin, while 35 % had them at two or three levels below the inguinal ligament. Unobstructed arterial flow to the distal half of the thigh was present in 26 % of patients, and 16 % had unobstructed flow to the upper third of the leg with occlusions of all three leg arteries distal to this point and reconstitution of some patent named artery in the lower leg or foot. In the last 2 years, 99 % of all {{patients with}} a threatened limb and without severe <b>organic</b> <b>mental</b> <b>syndrome</b> or midfoot gangrene were amenable to revascularization by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), arterial bypass, or a combination of the two, although some distal arteries used for bypass insertion were heavily diseased or isolated segments without an intact plantar arch. Limb salvage was achieved and maintained in more than 90 % of recent patient cohorts, with a mean procedural mortality rate of 3. 3 %. Recent strategies that contributed to these results include (1) distal origin short vein grafts from the below-knee popliteal or tibial arteries to an ankle or foot artery (291 cases); (2) combined PTA and bypass (245 cases); (3) more distal PTA of popliteal and tibial artery stenoses (233 cases); (4) use of in situ or ectopic reversed autogenous vein for infrapopliteal bypasses, even when vein diameter was 3 to 4 mm; (5) composite-sequential femoropopliteal-distal (PTFE/vein) bypasses; (6) reintervention when a procedure thrombosed (637 cases) or was threatened by a hemodynamically significant inflow, outflow, or graft lesion (failing graft, 252 cases); (7) frequent follow-up to detect threatening lesions before graft thrombosis occurred and to permit correction of lesions by PTA (58 %) or simple reoperation; and (8) unusual approaches to all infrainguinal arteries to facilitate secondary operations, despite scarring and infection.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{investigates the}} {{clinical}} use of neuroleptics within a general hospital in acutely ill medical or surgical patients {{and its relation}} with dementia three months after admission compared with control subjects. Methods Cases were defined as every adult patient to whom a neuroleptic medication was prescribed during their hospitalization in our Hospital from February 1 st, to June 30 th, 1998. A control matched by age and sex was randomly selected among patients who had been admitted in the same period, in the same department, and had not received neuroleptics drugs (205 cases and 200 controls). Demographic, clinical and complementary data were compared between cases and controls. Crude odds ratios estimating the risk of dementia in non previously demented subjects compared with the risk in non-demented control subjects were calculated. Results 205 of 2665 patients (7. 7 %) received a neuroleptic drug. The mean age was 80. 0 ± 13. 6 years and 52 % were females. They were older and stayed longer {{than the rest of}} the population. Only 11 % received a psychological evaluation before the prescription. Fifty two percent were agitated while 40 % had no reason justifying the use of neuroleptic drug. Three months after neuroleptic use 27 % of the surviving cases and 2. 6 % of the surviving controls who were judged non-demented at admission were identified as demented. Conclusions The most common reason for neuroleptic treatment was to manage agitation symptomatically in hospitalised patients. <b>Organic</b> <b>mental</b> <b>syndromes</b> were rarely investigated, and mental status exams were generally absent.

The {{aim was to}} evaluate of sociodemographical and psychopathological differences in delirium patients with alcoholand surgical genesis, studied in period from January 1 st 2003 to December 31 st 2012 in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H). Subjects and methods: Subjects {{were divided into two}} groups: alcoholics (N= 75) and surgical patients (N= 75) and multicentric, prospective study was performed in B&H. The following instruments have been used: list of general data (according to MCD- 10 criteria), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), Becks test of anxiety (BAI), Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale (HDRS) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Descriptive and analytical statistical processing of patients has been performed (alpha level: 0. 001). Results: Patients from alcohol group showed, with statistical significance p= 0. 001, the following: unemployment (OR= 0. 657, CI 0. 540 - 670), ruined marriage (OR= 0. 570, CI 0. 650 - 710), alcohol abuse (OR= 0. 179, CI 0. 860 - 0. 990), on represented expressed psychoticism, (OR= 0. 635, CI 0. 550 - 0. 715) in EPQ test, HDRS total was more frequent (OR= 0. 925, CI 0. 870 - 1. 120) and on MMSE test, total score was more frequent (OR= 0. 560, CI 0. 570 - 810).

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the criterion-based validity of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Cognitive Capacity Screening Examination (CCSE), and the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE) {{in a sample of}} older adults with suspected cognitive impairment. As cognitive screening tests, the MMSE, CCSE, and NCSE should predict performance relative to a more thorough testing procedure. In the present study, performance on the Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Test Battery (HRNTB) was employed as the criterion measure. Scores on the General Neuropsychological Deficit Scale (G-NDS), a global performance measure computed from the HRNTB, served as the standard by which to judge the presence of cognitive impairment. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of each screening test, as well as how well each screening test correlated with the G-NDS, were investigated. Results of this investigation found that, although the MMSE, CCSE, and NCSE were all significantly correlated with the G-NDS, only the NCSE demonstrated an appropriate balance between high sensitivity and specificity. When a rigorous neuropsychological evaluation was employed as the criterion standard, the NCSE accurately detected the presence of cognitive impairment: in 82 % of the cases. The MMSE and CCSE, however, failed to detect cognitive deficits in approximately 80 % of the cases. These findings strongly suggest that the MMSE and CCSE may have limited utility in the identification of cognitive impairment in older adults. The heightened sensitivity of the NCSE appears {{to be the result of}} several unigue features of the instrument, including a multidimensional scoring system and a graded series of increasingly difficult items within each ability area.
