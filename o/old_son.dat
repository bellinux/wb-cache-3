50|$|The {{traditional}} {{ideal of}} the ie system designates the <b>oldest</b> <b>son</b> as an heir to the family, and expects his family {{to live with his}} parents. When the <b>oldest</b> <b>son</b> is not available or not able to assume this position, one of the younger sons may do so. The elderly parents may opt for living with one of their married daughters, usually when they have no available son. Implied here is a sex/age hierarchy in terms of living with the parents, descending from <b>oldest</b> <b>son</b> to youngest <b>son,</b> and <b>oldest</b> to youngest daughter. It thus can be expected that <b>oldest</b> <b>sons</b> and <b>oldest</b> daughters without brothers are more likely to live with their parents than other children.|$|R

Since both batsmen wanted to feel the ball on bat before the Test, I volunteered the use of the Hawthorn Indoor Cricket Centre, in which I was a partner, for a two hour work-out on Christmas morning. It was quite a contrast to open the children's presents in the early hours and to open the bowling at the two English batsmen before lunch. My fifteen <b>old</b> <b>son,</b> Philip, thought the latter experience to be quite the best of his Christmas presents.|$|E
