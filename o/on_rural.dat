5|$|The Congress governments under Reddy placed {{emphasis}} <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> development, {{agriculture and}} allied sectors.

Reddy's first term as Chief Minister ended in 1960 after he resigned on being elected President of the Indian National Congress. In 1964, he resigned voluntarily following unfavourable observations made against the Government of Andhra Pradesh by the Supreme Court in the Bus Routes Nationalisation case.|$|E

5|$|According to Bruce, {{men were}} needed to allow Australia's {{extensive}} resources to be developed. In 1923, much of Australia's land was virtually unoccupied, and Bruce believed Australia {{had the potential to}} be one of the most fertile and productive nations in the world, which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times the population of his time. Despite dissenting voices from scientists, who noted that poor climate, soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations, the Bruce-Page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of British to migrate to Australia. Under the auspices of the new Development and Migration Commission, £34 million in loans took place over the decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure, land access, and subsidising immigrant journeys ("passages"). Estimates as high as half a million British immigrants over ten years were predicted at the start of the policy, whereas just over 200,000 travelled to Australia during that time period. Bruce's settlement plan rested <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> growth. Migrants were often selected on the basis of their willingness to work on the land; state and Commonwealth governments concentrated their investment <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on the periphery of settled areas. Despite this, a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas, as Australia's rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work (than for example England's) and many of those taking advantage of the assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled. Immigration from outside Great Britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable the Bruce government upheld the White Australia policy by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas, notwithstanding its population growth targets.|$|E
5|$|After {{the split}} with I-35, the Kansas Turnpike {{continues}} northeast as I-335. However, its exits are numbered as if I-35 had continued along it. This highway exists entirely {{as a part}} of the Kansas Turnpike. In fact, until 1987, this stretch of the turnpike was designated solely as the Kansas Turnpike without an Interstate number. It was only after a change in the National Maximum Speed Law, when state legislators were given the authority to raise the speed limits <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> Interstate Highways to , that this segment of the Kansas Turnpike was given the I-335 designation so that it could fall under the new law.|$|E
5|$|CARE International proposes several {{strategies}} that might reduce the destructive {{economic impact of}} HIV/AIDS <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> households. They recommend introducing new technologies that improve productivity to allow households affected by HIV/AIDS to continue supporting themselves through agriculture. Women in patrilineal/patrilocal villages are often unable to support {{themselves and their children}} when their husbands die of HIV/AIDS; therefore, helping women acquire traditionally masculine agricultural skills might decrease their vulnerability while improving agricultural productivity at the household and community levels. CARE International recommends increasing cooperation at the community level by establishing labor and food banks in areas that have been devastated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Finally, CARE International highlights the importance of increasing access to information about HIV/AIDS in Malawi to help families prepare for and cope with the economic burdens associated with the epidemic.|$|E

Hadley has developed his theory of animal property rights through his doctoral research, his 2015 monograph, and other academic works. In addition, he has authored popular articles on the subject for The Guardian, The Conversation and The Ethics Centre. He also discussed the topic on Knowing Animals, a podcast series produced by Siobhan O'Sullivan. His proposal has received attention in the popular press, with strong criticism from farmers' groups and journalists writing <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> affairs.|$|E
5|$|Non-use of {{seat belts}} is a {{significant}} risk factor. According to Col. Tom Butler, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, preliminary 2015 data indicated that 178 of the 224 vehicle occupant fatalities were of individuals not wearing seat belts. The fine in Montana for not wearing a seat belt in 2015 was $20. Although speed limits increased from 75mph to 80mph <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads. Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither U.S. or state highways.|$|E
5|$|Under Morales, Bolivia {{experienced}} unprecedented economic strength, {{resulting in}} the increase in value of its currency, the boliviano. His {{first year in office}} ended with no fiscal deficit; the first time this had happened in Bolivia for 30 years, while during the global financial crisis of 2007–08 it maintained some of the world's highest levels of economic growth. Such economic strength led to a nationwide boom in construction, and allowed the state to build up strong financial reserves. Although the levels of social spending were increased, they remained relatively conservative, with a major priority being placed on constructing paved roads, as well as community spaces such as soccer fields and union buildings. In particular, the government focused <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> infrastructure improvement, to bring roads, running water, and electricity to areas that lacked them.|$|E

5|$|During {{the later}} {{reign of the}} second emperor of the Sui dynasty, Yang, the dynasty's {{authority}} began to wane. The main reason was the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo. Coupled with natural disasters, the conscription of more and more men for {{the war and the}} hoarding of scarce grain reserves for the army's needs increased provincial discontent. As a result, from 611 <b>on,</b> <b>rural</b> revolts broke out across the empire, and with the Emperor's prestige and legitimacy diminished by military failure, ambitious provincial magnates were encouraged to challenge his rule. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and only as unrest spread within the empire and the powerful Eastern Turks turned hostile, did he realize the gravity of the situation: in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his move}} to Pakistan, Khan {{was asked to}} {{implement}} the Comilla Model in rural settlements of North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Punjab, and Sindh. He declined the offer {{on the grounds that}} the proposals were predominantly motivated by political interests rather than the common well-being. However, he continued to advise the authorities on various aspects of rural development, such as participatory irrigation management. He worked as a research fellow at the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad from 1971 to 1972, and as Director of Rural Economics Research Project at Karachi University from 1972 to 1973. Khan went to Michigan State University as a visiting professor in 1973 and remained there until 1979. During this time, he carried on advising the Rural Development Academy at Bogra in northern Bangladesh, and the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, Peshawar, on the Daudzai Integrated Rural Development Programme. He also traveled extensively during this period in the capacities of speaker, advisor, or consultant <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> development programmes across the world. In 1974, he was appointed as a World Bank consultant to survey rural development situations in Java, Indonesia. He also briefly worked as a visiting professor at Lund University, Harvard University, and Oxford University.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the economists}} in the Eisenhower {{administration}} became frustrated with Diem's refusal to devaluate the piaster once the Republic of Vietnam {{had become a}} stable nation. Diem refused to make the CIP exchange rate equivalent to the free market exchange rate for the two currencies. Although the fixed exchange rate meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods for their money, the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market. Diem was reluctant to cut the currency rate, arguing that it would diminish the value of US aid to South Vietnam and undermine the urban middle class support for his regime as they would resent {{the loss of their}} cheap consumer and luxury goods. In 1963, the US Ambassador Frederick Nolting and his economic advisers exhorted Diem to spend more of the CIP funds <b>on</b> <b>rural</b> development in an attempt to shore up peasant support in the face of increasing communist pressure, but were rebuffed.|$|E
