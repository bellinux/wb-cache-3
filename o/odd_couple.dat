40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of the R parity odd renormalizable {{interactions}} on flavor non-diagonal rates and CP violation asymmetries in the production of slepton pairs at e^- - e^+ leptonic colliders, for center of mass energies spanning the interval from the Z-boson pole up to 1000 GeV. The lepton number violating interactions, associated with the lepton number violating coupling constants, are assumed to incorporate CP odd complex phases. The flavor changing rates are controlled by tree level amplitudes and quadratic products of different R parity violating coupling constants and the CP asymmetries by interference terms between tree and loop level amplitudes and quartic products. The consideration of loop amplitudes is restricted to the photon and Z-boson vertex corrections. We present numerical results using a family and species independent mass parameter, m̃, for all the scalar superpartners and making simple assumptions for the family dependence of the R parity <b>odd</b> <b>coupling</b> constants. The flavor non-diagonal rates, _JJ', vary in the range, (ł/ 0. 1) ^ 4 2 - 20 fbarns, as one spans the interval of center of mass energies from the Z-boson pole up to 1000 GeV. For sleptons masses, m̃> 150 GeV, these observables could be of use at NLC energies to set useful bounds on the R parity <b>odd</b> <b>coupling</b> constants.

Shifted hysteresis loops with an asymmetry and coercivity enhancement are observed only {{in the presence of}} the odd interaction term in the Hamiltonian expression and their magnitudes show strong dependence on the value of L. The observed coercivity and EB in C/S NPs originated from nonzero <b>odd</b> <b>coupling</b> energies and their dependence on temperature (T) and particle size (R) are also discussed in relation to experimental findings...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{marriage}} as a union {{of a man and}} a woman was fundamentally challenged by the introduction of registered partnership in Denmark in 1989. <b>Odd</b> <b>Couples</b> is the first comprehensive history of registered partnership and gay marriage in Scandinavia. It traces the origins of laws which initially were extremely controversial—inside and outside the gay community—but have now gained broad popular and political support. Through a comparison of how these laws have been received and practiced in all of the Scandinavian countries, the author presents a nuanced study of a fascinating political process that began in the 1960 s and continues through the present day...|$|R

40|$|A real-space {{renormalization}} {{transformation is}} constructed for lattices of nonidentical oscillators with {{dynamics of the}} general form dvarphi_{k}/dt=omega_{k}+g summation operator_{l}f_{lk}(varphi_{l},varphi_{k}). The transformation acts on ensembles of such lattices. Critical properties corresponding to a second-order phase transition toward macroscopic synchronization are deduced. The analysis is potentially exact but relies in part on unproven assumptions. Numerically, second-order phase transitions with the predicted properties are observed as g increases in two structurally different two-dimensional oscillator models. One model has smooth coupling f_{lk}(varphi_{l},varphi_{k}) =phi(varphi_{l}-varphi_{k}), where phi(x) is nonodd. The other model is pulse coupled, with f_{lk}(varphi_{l},varphi_{k}) =delta(varphi_{l}) phi(varphi_{k}). Lower bounds for the critical dimensions for different types of coupling are obtained. For nonodd coupling, macroscopic synchronization cannot be ruled out for any dimension D>/= 1, whereas {{in the case of}} <b>odd</b> <b>coupling,</b> the well-known result that it can be ruled out for D< 3 is regained...|$|R

40|$|The parity (P) and time-reversal (T) <b>odd</b> <b>coupling</b> {{constant}} {{associated with}} the tensor-pseudotensor (T-PT) electron-nucleus interaction and the nuclear Schiff moment (NSM) have been determined by combining {{the result of the}} measurement of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of ^{ 129 }Xe atom and calculations based on the relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. Calculations using various relativistic many-body methods have been performed at different levels of approximation and their accuracies are estimated by comparing the results of the calculated dipole polarizability of the ground state of the above atom with its most precise available experimental data. The non-linear terms that arise in the RCC theory at the singles and doubles approximation were found to be crucial for achieving high accuracy in the calculations. Our results for the ^{ 129 }Xe EDM due to the odd T-PT interaction and the NSM are, respectively, d_A= 0. 501 x 10 ^{- 20 } C_T |e|cm and d_A= 0. 336 x 10 ^{- 17 } S/(|e| fm^ 3) |e|cm.

50|$|Anders Parker is a first-generation Swedish American. He {{was born}} circa 1970 {{and grew up}} in Upstate New York, in the Hudson Valley, in a musical family. His father lived in Vermont. In the 1990s Anders moved briefly to Portland, Oregon. He spent some time in North Carolina where he lived with Matt Brown, founder of Bladen County Records. Brown recalled: “I lived with Anders for a while. We <b>odd</b> <b>coupled.</b> I’d drink tequila and rant, he’d drink whiskey and smolder. We both got jobs at a little bar called the Stingray. He’s a Northerner and a big guy with a dark {{presence}} who likes to drink alone. If a Southerner (like myself) drinks alone, it means he’s probably going to fight. I imagined Anders had all the fight he could handle inside of himself; I’d heard right from his first album Man of Sin. I could tell he cared, and that it confounded him.” He then moved back up north with his one-eyed dog Oly. He lived for some time in New York City. In 2008 he moved to Burlington, Vermont, where he lived with his wife as of 2014. In 2016 he had been living in the town of Alert, Nunavut in the Canadian Arctic - the northernmost permanently inhabited place in the world, located 508 miles from the North Pole.|$|R
