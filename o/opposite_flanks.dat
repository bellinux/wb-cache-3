I was very uneasy about the coolies, who were far behind, {{and some of them}} had been frost-bitten in {{crossing}} the Kambachen pass. Still I thought the best thing was to push on, and light large fires at the first juniper we should reach. The change, on passing from off the snow to the dark earth and rock, was so bewildering, that I had great difficulty in picking my way. Suddenly we came on a flat with a small tarn, whose waters gleamed illusively in the pale moonlight: the <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of the valley were so well reflected on its gloomy surface, that we were at once brought to a stand-still on its banks: it looked like a chasm, and whether to jump across it, or go down it, or along it, was the question, so deceptive was the spectral landscape. Its true nature was, however, soon discovered, and we proceeded round it, descending. Of course there was no path, and after some perplexity amongst rocks and ravines, we reached the upper limit of wood, and halted by some bleached juniper-trees, which were soon converted into blazing fires.|$|E

The surface, though level, is very uneven, being worn into hollows, and presenting ridges and hillocks of blown sand and gravel, with small black tufts of rhododendron. Enormous boulders of gneiss and granite were scattered over the surface; one of the ordinary size, which I measured, was seventy feet in girth, and fifteen feet above the ground, into which it had partly sunk. From the southern pointed end I took sketches of the <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of the valleys east and west. The river was about 400 feet below me, and flowed in a little flat lake-bed; other terraces skirted it, cut out, as it were, from the side of that I was on. On the opposite flank of the valley were several superimposed terraces, of which the highest appeared to tally with the level I occupied, and the lowest was raised very little above the river; none were continuous for any distance, but the upper one in particular, could be most conspicuously traced up and down the main valley, whilst, on looking across to the eastern valley, a much higher, but less distinctly marked one appeared on it. The road to the pass lay west-north-west up the north bank of the Yangma river, on the great terrace; for two miles it was nearly level along the gradually narrowing shelf, at times dipping into the steep gulleys formed by lateral torrents from the mountains; and as the terrace disappeared, or melted, as it were, into the rising floor of the valley, the path descended upon the lower and smaller shelf.|$|E
6000|$|The {{greatest}} of all economists are those most opposed to the doctrine of [...] "laissez faire," [...] namely, the fortifying virtues, which the wisest men of all time have arranged under the general heads of Prudence, or Discretion (the spirit which discerns and adopts rightly); Justice (the spirit which rules and divides rightly); Fortitude (the spirit which persists and endures rightly); and Temperance (the spirit which stops and refuses rightly). These cardinal and sentinel virtues are not only the means of protecting and prolonging life itself, {{but they are the}} chief guards, or sources, of the material means of life, and the governing powers and princes of economy. Thus, precisely according to the number of just men in a nation, is their power of avoiding either intestine or foreign war. All disputes may be peaceably settled, if a sufficient number of persons have been trained to submit to the principles of justice, while the necessity for war is in direct ratio to the number of unjust persons who are incapable of determining a quarrel but by violence. Whether the injustice take the form of the desire of dominion, or of refusal to submit to it, or of lust of territory, or lust of money, or of mere irregular passion and wanton will, the result is economically the same;--loss of the quantity of power and life consumed in repressing the injustice, added to the material and moral destruction caused by the fact of war. The early civil wars of England, and the existing[95] war in America, are curious examples--these under monarchical, this under republican, institutions--of the results on large masses of nations of the want of education in principles of justice. But the mere dread or distrust resulting from the want of the inner virtues of Faith and Charity prove often no less costly than war itself. The fear which France and England have of each other costs each nation about fifteen millions sterling annually, besides various paralyses of commerce; that sum being spent in the manufacture of means of destruction instead of means of production. There is no more reason in the nature of things that France and England should be hostile to each other than that England and Scotland should be, or Lancashire and Yorkshire; and the reciprocal terrors of the opposite sides of the English Channel are neither more necessary, more economical, nor more virtuous, than the old riding and reiving on the <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of the Cheviots, or than England's own weaving for herself of crowns of thorn, from the stems of her Red and White roses.|$|E

50|$|Klein’s group {{demonstrated}} that during its evolution, the Mhc undergoes repeated rounds of expansion and contraction by gene duplications and deletions -in Klein’s terminology, an accordion mode of evolution. Thus, for example, they {{showed that in}} each of the three major primate lineages - the prosimians, the NWM and the OWM - evolution of some of the class II gene families started anew after a contraction to a single ancestral gene. And on the example of two “class III” genes, C4 and CYP21, they illustrated a mechanism by which the accordion might be expanding and contracting. The C4 gene, as already stated, codes for a component of the complement system; the CYP21gene codes for a key enzyme in the synthesis of glucocorticoid and mineralcorticoid hormones. The two genes are thus unrelated to each other and to the class I and class II genes, but they are accidentally hooked together into a module, which has been found to duplicate or triplicate as a unit during primate evolution. The hook-up seems to have arisen, when an identical short sequence motif arose by chance at both flanks of the initial C4-CYP21 doublet. Since then, an occasional misalignment of the <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> has led to an unequal crossing-over and so to duplications or deletion of the module.|$|E
50|$|Gravitropism is {{a turning}} or growth {{movement}} by a plant or fungus {{in response to}} gravity. It is equally widespread in both kingdoms. Statolites are required in both fungi and plants for the mechanism of gravity-sensing. The Zygomycota sporangiophores originate from specialized “basal hyphae” and pass through several distinctive developmental stages until the mature asexual spores are released. In addition to the positive phototropism, the sporangiophores are directed by a negative gravitropic response into a position suitable for spore dispersal and distribution. Both responses are growth reactions i.e. the bending is caused by differential growth on the respective <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of the sporangiophore, and influence each other. The only model for the mechanism of the gravitropic reaction of Phycomyces {{is based on the}} floatability of the vacuole within the surrounding cytoplasm. The resulting asymmetric distribution of the cytoplasm is proposed to generate increased wall growth on the lower side of horizonally placed sporangiophores as in the thicker cytoplasmic layer forming there the number of vesicles secreting cell-wall material would be higher than on the upper side. Gravitropic bending starts after approximately 15 - 30 min in horizontally placed sporangiophores and continues until after, approximately 12 - 14 hours, the sporangiophore tip has recovered its original vertical position. Usually, the gravitropic response is weaker compared to the phototrophic one. However, in certain conditions, equilibrium could be established and the responses are comparable. In plants and fungi, phototropism and gravitropism interact in a complex manner. During continuous irradiation with unilateral light, the sporangiophore (fruiting body) of the zygomycete fungus, Phycomyces blakesleeanus reach a bending angle of photogravitropic equilibrium at which the gravitropic and phototropic stimuli balance each other (Fig. 1, bending angle +α, due to light irradiation).|$|E
40|$|Gravitropism allows plant organs {{to guide}} their growth in {{relation}} to the gravity vector. For most roots, this response to gravity allows downward growth into soil where water and nutrients are available for plant growth and development. The primary site for gravity sensing in roots includes the root cap and appears to involve the sedimentation of amyloplasts within the columella cells. This process triggers a signal transduction pathway that promotes both an acidification of the wall around the columella cells, an alkalinization of the columella cytoplasm, {{and the development of a}} lateral polarity across the root cap that allows for the establishment of a lateral auxin gradient. This gradient is then transmitted to the elongation zones where it triggers a differential cellular elongation on <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of the central elongation zone, responsible for part of the gravitropic curvature. Recent findings also suggest the involvement of a secondary site/mechanism of gravity sensing for gravitropism in roots, and the possibility that the early phases of graviresponse, which involve differential elongation on <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of the distal elongation zone, might be independent of this auxin gradient. This review discusses our current understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying these various phases of the gravitropic response in roots...|$|E

40|$|Two cores of Holocene sediment, {{collected}} on <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of the Vanderford Glacier in Vincennes Bay, while representing contemporaneous sedimentation, have different sediment characteristics, {{with a relatively}} lower biogenic content {{on the western side}} than on the east. These sedimentological signatures are attributed to differences in circulation patterns. Circulation involves landward flow at depth, bringing warmer ocean water into contact with the base of the glacier. This water becomes mixed with fresh meltwater and suspended glacial sediments to form a buoyant plume that rises and flows in a seaward direction under the ice shelf. The landward and seaward flows are deflected to the left in the Southern Hemisphere by the Coriolis effect and, hence, are laterally separated. This pattern explains the differences observed in sediments deposited {{on opposite sides of the}} ice shelf in front of the Vanderford Glacier and may be a common feature beneath all large-scale ice shelves...|$|E
40|$|The glass {{transition}} GT is usually {{thought of as}} a structural arrest that occurs during the cooling of a liquid, or sometimes a plastic crystal, trapping a metastable state of the system before it can recrystallize to stabler forms 1. This phenomenon occurs in liquids of all classes, most recently in bulk metallic glassformers 2. Much theoretical interest has been generated by the dynamical heterogeneity observed in cooling of fragile liquids 3, 4, and many have suggested that the slow-down is caused by a related increasing correlation length 5 - 9. Here we report both kinetics and thermodynamics of arrest in a system that disorders while in its ground state, exhibits a large !Cp on arrest (!Cp = Cp,mobile - Cp,arrested), yet clearly is characterized by a correlation length that is decreasing as GT is approached from above. We show that GT kinetics in our system, the disordering superlattice Fe 50 Co 50, satisfy the kinetic criterion for ideally 'strong' glassformers 10, and since !Cp behavior through Tg also correlates 10, we propose that very strong liquidsand very fragile liquids exist on <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of an order-disorder transition - one that is already known for model systems...|$|E

When mice bearing a B 16 F 1 melanoma and a lymphoma on <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> were given NPrCAP/M, iron was observed only in B 16 F 1 melanoma cells and iron particles (NPrCAP/M) were identified within late-stage melanosomes by electron microscopy.

Growth of transplanted B 16 melanoma was suppressed effectively by NPrCAP/M-mediated hyperthermia, suggesting a clinical application of NPrCAP/M to lesional therapy for melanoma. Finally, melanoma cells treated with NPrCAP/M plus AMF showed little sub-G 1 fraction and no caspase 3 activation, suggesting that the NPrCAP/M-mediated hyperthermia induced non-apoptotic cell death.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the role of the epidermis and cortex in gravitropic curvature of seedling roots of maize (Zea mays L. cv. Merit), the cortex on the two <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> was removed from the meristem through the growing zone; gravitropic curvature was measured with the roots oriented horizontally with the cut flanks either on the upper and lower side, or on the lateral sides as a wound control. Curvature was slower in both these treatments (53 degrees in 5 h) than in intact roots (82 degrees), but {{there was no difference between}} the two orientations in extent and rate of curvature, nor in the latent time, showing that epidermis and cortex were not the site of action of the growth-regulating signal. The amount of cortex removed made no difference in the extent of curvature. Curvature was eliminated when the endodermis was damaged, raising the possibility that the endodermis or the stele-cortex interface controls gravitropic curvature in roots. The elongation rate of roots from which just the epidermis had been peeled was reduced by 0. 01 mM auxin (indole- 3 -acetic acid) from 0. 42 to 0. 27 mm h- 1, contradicting the hypothesis that only the epidermis responds to changes in auxin activity during gravistimulation. These observations indicate that gravitropic curvature in maize roots is not driven by differential cortical cell enlargement, and that movement of growth regulator(s) from the tip to the elongating zone is unlikely to occur in the cortex...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the kinetics of auxin redistribution across the caps of primary roots of 2 -day-old maize (Zea mays, cv Merit) seedlings {{with the time}} course of gravitropic curvature. [3 H] indoleacetic acid was applied {{to one side of the}} cap in an agar donor and radioactivity moving across the cap was collected in an agar receiver applied to the opposite side. Upon gravistimulation the roots first curved upward slightly, then returned to the horizontal and began curving downward, reaching a final angle of about 67 °. Movement of label across the caps of gravistimulated roots was asymmetric with preferential downward movement (ratio downward/upward = ca. 1. 6, radioactivity collected during the 90 min following beginning of gravistimulation). There was a close correlation between the development of asymmetric auxin movement across the root cap and the rate of curvature, with both values increasing to a maximum and then declining as the roots approached the final angle of curvature. In roots preadapted to gravity (alternate brief stimulation on <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> over a period of 1 hour) the initial phase of upward curvature was eliminated and downward bending began earlier than for controls. The correlation between asymmetric auxin movement and the kinetics of curvature also held in comparisons between control and preadapted roots. Both downward auxin transport asymmetry and downward curvature occurred earlier in preadapted roots than in controls. These findings are consistent with suggestions that the root cap is not only the site of perception but also the location of the initial redistribution of effectors that ultimately leads to curvature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Down {{syndrome}} (DS), {{caused by}} trisomy of human chromosome 21 (HSA 21), {{is the most}} common genetic cause of mental retardation in humans. Among complex phenotypes, it displays a number of neural pathologies including smaller brain size, reduced numbers of neurons, reduced dendritic spine density and plasticity, and early Alzheimer-like neurodegeneration. Mouse models for DS show behavioural and cognitive defects, synaptic plasticity defects, and reduced hippocampal and cerebellar neuron numbers. Early postnatal development of both human and mouse-model DS shows the reduced capability of neuronal precursor cells to generate neurons. The exact molecular cause of this reduction, and the role played by increased dosage of individual HSA 21 genes, remain unknown. Results We have subcutaneously injected mouse pluripotent ES cells containing a single freely segregating supernumerary human chromosome 21 (HSA 21) into syngeneic mice, to generate transchromosomic teratomas. Transchromosomic cells and parental control cells were injected into <b>opposite</b> <b>flanks</b> of thirty mice in three independent experiments. Tumours were grown for 30 days, a time-span equivalent to combined intra-uterine, and early post-natal mouse development. When paired teratomas from the same animals were compared, transchromosomic tumours showed a three-fold lower percentage of neuroectodermal tissue, as well as significantly reduced mRNA levels for neuron specific (Tubb 3) and glia specific (Gfap) genes, relative to euploid controls. Two thirds of transchromosomic tumours also showed a lack of PCR amplification with multiple primers specific for HSA 21, which were present in the ES cells at the point of injection, thus restricting a commonly retained trisomy to {{less than a third of}} HSA 21 genes. Conclusion We demonstrate that a supernumerary chromosome 21 causes Inhibition of Neuroectodermal DIfferentiation (INDI) of pluripotent ES cells. The data suggest that trisomy of less than a third of HSA 21 genes, in two chromosomal regions, might be sufficient to cause this effect. </p...|$|E
