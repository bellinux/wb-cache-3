50|$|PTTGC {{produces}} and distributes aromatics and {{downstream products}} at two locations in Rayong, at the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate and the RIL Industrial Estate. The total aromatics production including benzene, paraxylene, cyclohexane, <b>orthoxylene,</b> toluene, and mixed xylenes sums up to 2,259,000 tons per year.|$|E
5000|$|Dragon Aromatics Company, or Tenglong Aromatic Hydrocarbon (...) , is a Chinese {{chemical}} {{company on the}} coast of Fujian province, Southeast China. Its plant has been producing paraxylene and <b>orthoxylene</b> for polyester fiber and garment manufacturers since 2013. Dragon Aromatics is a subsidiary of the Taiwanese Xianglu Dragon Group. A massive explosion and fire in April 2015 burnt for 4 days, and led to the evacuation of 30,000 residents.|$|E
5000|$|Besides PX, the PX {{facility}} creates other aromatics components (over 1.0 tpy per 2007 plan): It produces <b>orthoxylene</b> (160,000 {{tons per}} year (tpy) per 2007 plan), needed to make plasticizers and resins in paints, coating and auto parts industries. The plant also produces benzene (228,000 tpy per 2007 plan), [...] "the starting block of a large set of polymeric materials such as nylon fibers, polystyrene for plastic packaging, polycarbonates for impact-resistant glass substitutes and compact disks".|$|E
5000|$|The post-war {{years were}} also {{marked by a}} {{dramatic}} increase in demand for petrochemicals to serve as the building blocks for hundreds of essential consumer products. In 1951, a new unit was constructed to manufacture paraxylene, a basic material used for making synthetic fibers, and was {{the first of its kind}} to produce the chemical from petroleum. The West Coast's first phenol plant was completed in 1954 for the production of lubricating oil and lubricating oil additive, resins and plastic, and plywood adhesives. A year later, another chemical plant for the manufacture of isophtalic was constructed, the first in the US. Isophtalic is a chemical intermediate used in plastics and surface coatings. In 1960, construction began on a $17 million complex for production of para- and <b>orthoxylenes,</b> important chemical intermediates, at the Richmond refinery. Another major project increased the capacity for production of alpha olefins, used extensively in the manufacture of [...] "soft" [...] detergents, lubricant additives, plastics and plasticizers. None of these chemical plants are still in operation today except for the alpha olefin plant, which produces an intermediate chemical for the production of Techron, Chevron's gasoline additive.|$|R
40|$|Films of regio-random and regio-regular poly(3 -hexylthiophene) {{were grown}} by matrix {{assisted}} pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE), where {{the target is}} a frozen solution of the polymer in <b>orthoxylene.</b> Analysis by MALDI mass spectroscopy confirms that the deposition does not result in any degradation of the polymer. UVâ€“visible absorption spectroscopy and AFM images show that {{the structure of the}} films strongly depends on the temperature of the substrate during deposition. Best results are obtained when the substrate is held at low temperature...|$|E
40|$|EAU+CDSAlumina-supported Pd {{catalysts}} {{with different}} particle surface densities {{have been prepared}} using incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous solution of a palladium nitrite complex. Buta- 1, 3 -diene and <b>orthoxylene</b> hydrogenation reactions were performed both in a batch and a fixed bed reactor. Hydrogen surface mobility was studied using H- 2 -D- 2 isotopic exchange. The influence of (i) the particle surface density and (ii) the surface area of the support on the catalytic properties are discussed. The turnover frequency (TOF) of the but- 1, 3 -diene hydrogenation was highly sensitive to the surface density of Pd particles (D-sp). Moreover, for a given surface density, TOF also depend {{on the nature of}} the alumina support. For a given support, modifications of the electronic properties of palladium can explain the increase of the reaction rate with D-sp while changes in the kinetics of hydrogen surface diffusion are proposed to explain the support effect.

40|$|The {{mineralization}} of 14 -C Acetate was {{studied in}} bottles with fresh soil and groundwater. Addition of toxicants inhibited {{the formation of}} 14 -CO 2 and dose effect curves were obtained. The acetate mineralization was not inhibited by zinc, cadmium, K 2 CR 2 O 7, chloropyrifos, and paraquat in an acid sandy soil at 1000 mg/kg dry soil. The IC 10 is the toxicant concentration which inhibits 10 % of the initial mineralization rate. The IC 10 concentrations for 3, 4 -dichloroaniline, triphenyltin, and <b>orthoxylene</b> were 48, 96 and 730 mg/kg, respectively in the acid sandy soil. The IC 10 of pentachlorophenol was measured in samples from the acid sandy soil and in several other soil and subsoil samples. The geometrical mean of the thirteen IC 10 values was 16 mg pentachlorophenol/kg. A statistical method was {{used to calculate the}} PCP concentration above which 5 % of the most sensitive acetate mineralizing communities in all soils are influenced. The best estimate of this concentration is 0. 3 mg PCP/kg but {{to be on the safe}} side the 95 % confidence level of this concentration is 25 mug/kg. ...|$|E
