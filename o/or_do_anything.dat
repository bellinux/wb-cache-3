5|$|Mann's next fight (and {{third in}} the Cage Rage organisation) was against top {{domestic}} prospect, Robbie Olivier. The fight saw both fighters neutralise the other's ground game. In the stand-up, Mann was regarded as being unusually tentative, which gave Olivier {{the opportunity to take}} him to the floor, where again, neither fighter was able to advance position <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> of note. After three rounds, Olivier was declared the winner via unanimous decision.|$|E

Nana does not speak <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> beyond the physical capabilities of a large dog, but acts with apparent understanding of her responsibilities. The character is played in stage productions by an actor in a dog costume. Barrie based the character of Nana on his dog , a Newfoundland.|$|E

25|$|The Holocaust {{has been}} {{explained}} away officially as merely {{the relocation of}} the Jewish population into areas of Eastern Europe where communications and transport networks are still very poor. Despite this, many Germans suspect the government has eliminated the Jews, but generally don't care or are too afraid of the Nazi authorities to say <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> with this knowledge. Some surviving Jews escaped to Soviet territory, where they have provided testimony of the extermination efforts - while Nazi authorities decry this as Bolshevik propaganda, the outside world {{is aware of the}} Holocaust. The American president, however, remains neutral so as not to further damage relations, and refers only to vague 'human rights violations' he wishes to investigate while visiting Berlin.|$|E
500|$|On 3 August Hobhouse {{conveyed}} {{the view of}} the Attorney-General that the magistrates were incorrect to declare 9 August meeting illegal as it was called to consider the election of a representative [...] and it was not the intention to elect an MP that was illegal, but the execution of that intention. On 4 August Hobhouse advised against any attempt to forcibly prevent 9 August meeting if it went ahead, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> beyond collecting evidence for subsequent prosecution unless the meeting got out of hand: ...|$|E
500|$|Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Lal Krishna Advani of the BJP criticising {{the attacks}} commented, [...] "No {{political}} party should say <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that weakens the country's unity or undermines the Constitution". BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar {{alleged that the}} Congress State government deliberately delayed taking any action when the attacks on North Indians began in Mumbai. He said that he suspected Congress had a strategy to divide Maharashtrian and non-Maharashtrian votes, by creating a feeling of insecurity among non-Maharashtrians {{in the hope that}} they would vote for the Congress. He blamed the party for trying to divert people's attention from more critical problems that Maharashtra faces, such as the agrarian crisis and load shedding. He added, [...] "India is one and every Indian has a right to settle down and work in any part of the country".|$|E

500|$|Cooper's acting style {{consisted}} of three essential characteristics: his ability to project elements of his own personality onto the characters he portrayed, to appear natural and authentic in his roles, and to underplay and deliver restrained performances calibrated for the camera and the screen. Acting teacher Lee Strasberg once observed: [...] "The simplest examples of Stanislavsky's ideas are actors such as Gary Cooper, John Wayne, and Spencer Tracy. They try not to act but to be themselves, to respond or react. They refuse to say <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> they feel not to be consonant with their own characters." [...] Film director François Truffaut ranked Cooper among [...] "the greatest actors" [...] because {{of his ability to}} deliver great performances [...] "without direction". This ability to project elements of his own personality onto his characters produced a continuity across his performances to the extent that critics and audiences were convinced that he was simply [...] "playing himself".|$|E
500|$|The game went gold on August 5, 2002, and was {{released}} on August 27. After the release of Icewind Dale II, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the Icewind Dale series, saying that, [...] "I wasn't particularly thrilled with how my work on [...] came out..." [...] and, [...] "... managed to actually be worse than my Icewind Dale stuff." [...] In regards to Icewind Dale II he said, [...] " [...] came out better than I expected, but still, not exactly awe-inspiring." [...] Chris Avellone later said, [...] "Icewind Dale was a fun series, but it didn't try to set the bar for {{anything other than a}} fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls." [...] A Collector's Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. Icewind Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 July 1918 he {{travelled}} {{to the home of}} his fiancé, Miss Alex-Tweedie in Whitehall Court. Tweedie recalled their conversation revolved around his new posting and his book. He had delivered the manuscript to Mr Grey two days earlier and was expecting its publication. While there, McCudden promised to surpass von Richthofen who had been killed in action on 21 April 1918. In view of what happened to von Richthofen, and John McCudden, he promised that [...] "I won't bustle, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> foolish like my brother". He then went next door and had breakfast with his sister Mary. Upon leaving, he fumbled around in his pocket and handed her a bulky envelope containing his Victoria Cross and other decorations. He took his leave of her and drove to Hounslow where he climbed into his S.E.5a (C1126). He took off shortly after 13:00. McCudden certainly stopped en route, as about six o'clock that afternoon he called the AOC No. 13 Wing, Patrick Playfair, to announce his imminent arrival at Boffles, where No. 60 Squadron was stationed.|$|E

500|$|A King's or Queen's Serjeant was a Serjeant-at-Law {{appointed}} {{to serve the}} Crown as a legal adviser to the monarch and their government {{in the same way}} as the Attorney-General for England and Wales. The King's Serjeant (who had the postnominal KS, or QS during the reign of a female monarch) would represent the Crown in court, acting as prosecutor in criminal cases and representative in civil ones, and would have higher powers and ranking in the lower courts than the Attorney- or Solicitor General. King's Serjeants also worked as legal advisers in the House of Lords, and were not allowed to act in cases against the Crown <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that would harm it; in 1540 Serjeant Browne was heavily punished for creating a tax avoidance scheme. The King's Serjeants would wear a black Coif with a narrow strip of white, unlike the all-white Coif of a normal Serjeant. The King's Serjeants were required to swear a second oath to serve [...] "The King and his people", rather than [...] "The King's people" [...] as a Serjeant-at-Law would swear. The King's favoured Serjeant would become the King's Premier Serjeant, while the oldest one was known as the King's Ancient Serjeant.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013, the {{relationship}} between the two nations was strained due to allegations of spying. In response, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said of the bilateral relations: [...] "I will never say <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that might damage the strong relationship and the close cooperation that we have with Indonesia, which is all in all our most important relationship." [...] Indonesia then froze ties with Australia, as Abbott refused to apologise. Indonesians then protested Australia's actions, including burning the flag of Australia as Australians were warned to be vigiliant in the country.|$|E

Its size would have been just over that of a modern condor, {{but it would have been}} at least twice as heavy at an estimated [...] Despite the modern-looking wings, due to this size and weight the animal was unlikely to be able to [...] "fly or glide <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> in the air".|$|E

2500|$|The government's {{activities}} aroused controversy at {{home and}} strong criticism abroad. A visiting delegation of US Congressmen led by Representative Steny Hoyer reported that there were [...] "severe human rights problems within the present new government, which {{is not willing to}} address them or admit them <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> about them yet." [...] American commentators cited the human rights issue as being {{one of the main reasons}} for Georgia's inability to secure widespread international recognition. The country had already been granted recognition by a limited number of countries (including Romania, Turkey, Canada, Finland, Ukraine, the Baltic States and others) but recognition by major countries, including the U.S., Sweden, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Pakistan, India, came only during Christmas of 1991.|$|E
2500|$|Alfred Henry Lewis {{introduced}} Masterson to President Theodore Roosevelt {{and the two}} {{formed a}} friendship that resulted in Masterson being a frequent White House guest and also included regular correspondence. President Roosevelt also arranged for Masterson's appointment as deputy U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of New York. On February 2, 1905, President Roosevelt wrote Masterson a [...] letter which concluded with the lines: [...] "You {{must be careful not}} to gamble <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> while you are a public officer which might afford opportunity to your enemies and my critics to say that your appointment was improper. I wish you to show this letter to Alfred Henry Lewis and go over the matter with him." [...] Bat served in his $2,000 per year job until August 1, 1909.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 November 1455 the retrial {{opened at}} Notre Dame Cathedral. Joan's family were present, and Isabelle made an impassioned speech which began: [...] "I had a {{daughter}} born in lawful wedlock, whom I had furnished worthily with the sacraments of baptism and confirmation and had reared in the fear of God {{and respect for the}} tradition of the Church... yet although she never did think, conceive, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> whatever which set her out of the path of the faith... certain enemies ... had her arraigned in religious trial... in a trial perfidious, violent, iniquitous, and without shadow of right... did they condemn her in a fashion damnable and criminal, and put her to death very cruelly by fire... for the damnation of their souls and in notorious, infamous, and irreparable damage done to me, Isabelle, and mine".|$|E

2500|$|A {{group of}} Palestinian dignitaries came {{to protest the}} visit, as did three Arab Knesset Members. With the dignitaries {{watching}} from a safe distance, the Shabab (youth mob) threw rocks and attempted {{to get past the}} Israeli security personnel and reach Sharon and his entourage. [...] Still, Sharon's deportment was quiet and dignified. He did not pray, did not make any statement, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> else that might be interpreted as offensive to the sensitivities of Muslims. Even after he came back near the Wailing Wall under the hail of rocks, he remained calm. [...] "I came here as one who believes in coexistence between Jews and Arabs," [...] Sharon told the waiting reporters. [...] "I believe that we can build and develop together. This was a peaceful visit. Is it an instigation for Israeli Jews to come to the Jewish people's holiest site?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{narrator is}} first-person, omniscient: [...] "I would {{introduce}} myself {{if it were}} not useless. The name I had last night will not be the same as the name I have tonight." [...] This might be a conscious echo of the opening of Melville's Moby-Dick: [...] "Call me Ishmael," [...] or perhaps a contemporary bathos. The title of the novella alludes to an old joke, also alluding to Moby-Dick. One of Sam's friends tells a shaggy dog story of a man who goes to India to study yoga, echoing Pip's passing mention of a joke in Melville's novel: he unscrews his navel, thinking he {{is on the verge of}} a revelation, and his ass falls off. This instance seems to suggest Sam's reluctance or inability to take risks <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to break the monotony of his routine life. His navel gazing is what makes him the object of Mailer's scorn and drains his life of significance.|$|E
2500|$|Frank P. Ramsey {{visited him}} on 17 September 1923 {{to discuss the}} Tractatus; he had agreed to write a review of it for Mind. He {{reported}} in a letter home that Wittgenstein was living frugally in one tiny whitewashed room that only had space for a bed, washstand, a small table, and one small hard chair. Ramsey shared an evening meal with him of coarse bread, butter, and cocoa. Wittgenstein's school hours were eight to twelve or one, and he had afternoons free. After Ramsey returned to Cambridge a long campaign began among Wittgenstein's friends {{to persuade him to}} return to Cambridge and away from what they saw as a hostile environment for him. He was accepting no help even from his family. Ramsey wrote to John Maynard Keynes: [...] " [...] are very rich and extremely anxious to give him money <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for him in any way, and he rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of invalid's food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because they aren't on good terms but because he won't have any money he hasn't earned ... It is an awful pity." ...|$|E
