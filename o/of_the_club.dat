Liverpool was sold to Fenway Sports Group on 15 October 2010 for £300m.|$|E

5|$|The {{current crest}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>club</b> {{is based on}} the {{official}} emblem of the city of Maribor, which is in turn based on a 14th-century seal with minor differences. The badge is formed in a shape of a shield, and shows the former Piramida Castle that used to stand on top of the Pyramid Hill before it was demolished {{at the end of the}} 18th century. A violet blossom forms the backdrop. Unlike the coat of arms of the city of Maribor, the current badge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>club</b> does not represent a white dove facing downwards to the castle, but an athlete. At the top of the shield the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>club</b> and the year of its foundation is inscribed. The entire badge uses only two colours, purple and yellow. Previous versions of the crest included the colour white, one of the traditional colours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>club,</b> in the form of a white castle in the centre and a white ball that was on top of the shield. Since May 2012 the official badge includes a yellow star above the crest, which indicates the first ten domestic titles won by the club.|$|E
