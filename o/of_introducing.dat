40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to compare the number, proportion, and species {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> plant species in forest patches situated within predominantly forested, agricultural, and urban landscapes. A previous study suggested that agricultural landscape context {{does not have a}} large effect on the proportion <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> species in forest patches. Therefore, our main goal was to test the hypothesis that forest patches in an urban landscape context contain larger numbers and proportions of non-native plant species. We surveyed the vegetation in 44 small remnant forest fragments (3 - 7. 5 ha) in the Ottawa region; 15 were situated within forested landscapes, 18 within agricultural landscapes, and 11 within urban landscapes. Forest fragments in urban landscapes had about 40 % more introduced plant species and a 50 % greater proportion <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> plant species than fragments found in the other two types of landscape. There {{was no significant difference in}} the number or proportion <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> species in forest fragments within forested vs. agricultural landscapes. However, the species composition <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> species differed among the forest patches in the three landscape types. Our results support the hypothesis that urban and suburban areas are important foci for spread <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> plant specie...|$|R

Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years.

5|$|Boron is {{a useful}} dopant for such {{semiconductors}} as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method <b>of</b> <b>introducing</b> boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas {{is also an important}} chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.|$|E

Davies was so captivated by everything that he had seen and heard, from host Chris Tarrant's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show's lighting system and music tracks, that he chose to abandon his work on the $64,000 Question revival in favor <b>of</b> <b>introducing</b> Millionaire to American airwaves, convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular.|$|E

5|$|His most {{significant}} influence was {{the introduction of}} the idea of wild gardening, which first appeared in The Wild Garden and was further developed in The English Flower Garden. The idea <b>of</b> <b>introducing</b> large drifts of native hardy perennial plants into meadow, woodand, and waterside is taken for granted today, but was revolutionary in Robinson's time. In the first edition, he happily used any plant that could be naturalised, including half-hardy perennials and natives {{from other parts of the}} world—thus Robinson's wild garden was not limited to locally native species. Robinson's own garden at Gravetye was planted on a large scale, but his wild garden idea could be realised in small yards, where the 'garden' is designed to appear to merge into the surrounding woodland or meadow. Robinson's ideas continue to influence gardeners and landscape architects today—from home and cottage gardens to large estate and public gardens.|$|E
5|$|Leif and {{his crew}} {{travelled}} from Greenland to Norway in 999 AD.

The Saga of Erik the Red and the Saga of the Greenlanders, both thought to have been written around 1200, contain different accounts of the voyages to Vinland. The only two known strictly historical mentions of Vinland are found in the work of Adam of Bremen c. 1075 and in the Book of Icelanders compiled c. 1122 by Ari the Wise. According to the Saga of Erik the Red, Leif apparently saw Vinland for the first time after being blown off course on his way to introduce Christianity to Greenland.|$|E

40|$|This review {{examines}} {{the potential impact}} <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> fish on amphibians, with particular emphasis on Australian freshwater systems. Firstly, the ecological relationships between fish predators and their amphibian prey are examined, {{and how they can}} be altered when non-native fish are introduced into aquatic systems. The current knowledge and research on the impacts <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> fish on amphibians both overseas and within Australia is then reviewed. Evidence in the literature strongly suggests that introduction of exotic fish or translocation of native species could have enormous impacts on the amphibian assemblages of Australian freshwater systems. Introduced fish have been implicated in the decline of several anuran species, though few cases have been subject to thorough research. Many Australian amphibian assemblages, including several threatened species,are potentially threatened by a variety <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> fish species. Future research priorities and guidelines for examining the impact <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> fish on Australian amphibians are outlined. Key management objectives for conservation agencies are identified...|$|R
40|$|Introduced {{birds are}} a {{pervasive}} and dominant element of urban ecosystems. We examined the richness and relative abundance <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> bird species in small (1 – 5 ha) medium (6 – 15 ha) and large (> 15 ha) remnants of native vegetation within an urban matrix. Transects were surveyed during breeding and non-breeding seasons. There {{was a significant}} relationship between introduced species richness and remnant size with larger remnants supporting more introduced species. There {{was no significant difference in}} relative abundance <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> species in remnants <b>of</b> different sizes. <b>Introduced</b> species, as a proportion of the relative abundance of the total avifauna (native and introduced species), did not vary significantly between remnants of differing sizes. There were significant differences in the composition <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> bird species between the different remnant sizes, with large remnants supporting significantly different assemblages than medium and small remnants. Other variables also have substantial effects on the abundance <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> bird species. The lack of significant differences in abundance between remnant sizes suggests they were all equally susceptible to invasion. No patches in the urban matrix are likely to be unaffected by introduced species. The effective long-term control <b>of</b> <b>introduced</b> bird species is difficult and resources may be better spent managing habitat in a way which renders it less suitable for introduced species (e. g. reducing areas of disturbed ground and weed dominated areas). <br /...|$|R

Leach decided to supplement the idea of evil with mischief, as he thought being completely evil by annoying or killing followers was senseless. Molyneux wanted a conflict between good and evil, and for the enemy gods to have the opposite alignment to the player.

5|$|Bogdan-Pitești was by then an {{inspiration}} for the blooming Romanian Symbolist movement. In effect, {{he was the first}} Romanian expert on the work of Symbolist celebrities like Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and (his favorite) Alexandre Séon. He soon became a contributor to Literatorul, a Symbolist magazine, and was close friends with its founder, Alexandru Macedonski. In 1897, he was chosen by the latter to edit and promote his book of French-language poems, Bronzes. In the end, Bogdan-Pitești provided the funds needed for Bronzes to be published in Paris. It came out with an introductory note, in which Bogdan-Pitești favorably compared Macedonski with arch-rival Mihai Eminescu. In more general terms, the preface showed Bogdan-Pitești as an unyielding Francophile, who reported with alarm that Romania risked being seduced and then engulfed by German culture. Himself a disciple of Macedonski, T. Vianu comments that Bogdan-Pitești was probably unsuited for the task <b>of</b> <b>introducing</b> Bronzes, and that, despite expectations, the volume failed to impress the French public. He notes the virtually complete lack of press reviews—with the notable exception of a May 1898 article in Mercure de France, written by the Symbolist-anarchist Pierre Quillard.|$|E
5|$|Heliade inaugurated {{his series}} of {{proposals}} for reforming {{the language in}} 1828, when his work on Romanian grammar called for the Cyrillic script to be reduced to 27 letters, reflecting phonetic spelling (for this rule, Heliade cited {{the example of the}} Latin alphabet as used in Ancient Rome). Soon after, he began a campaign in favor <b>of</b> <b>introducing</b> Romance neologisms, which he wanted to adapt to Romanian spelling. By that time, Romanians in various regions had grown aware of the need to unify the varieties of Romanian and create a standard Romanian lexis: this notion was first supported by the Transylvanians Gheorghe Şincai and Petru Maior, whose proposal was to unite Romanians around the issue of the choice of liturgical language, both Orthodox and Greek-Catholic (see Transylvanian School). Heliade, who first proposed a language regulator (an idea which was to be employed in creating the Romanian Academy), expanded on this legacy, while stressing that the dialect spoken in Muntenia, which had formed the basis of religious texts published by the 16th century printer Coresi, serve as the standard language.|$|E
