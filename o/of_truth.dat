60|$|In the {{preceding}} chapter {{we saw that}} there are two sorts of knowledge: knowledge of things, and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>truths.</b> In this chapter we shall be concerned exclusively with knowledge of things, of which in turn we shall have to distinguish two kinds.

Knowledge of things by description, on the contrary, always involves, as we shall find {{in the course of the}} present chapter, some knowledge <b>of</b> <b>truths</b> as its source and ground. But first of all we must make clear what we mean by 'acquaintance' and what we mean by 'description'.|$|R
