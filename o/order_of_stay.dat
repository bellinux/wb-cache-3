50|$|In May 2006, {{she came}} very close to {{becoming}} the first acting female president, when Luis Inacio Lula da Silva was travelling abroad. According to Brazilian law, when the President is away from the country the next in succession becomes interim president. However, since elections were drawing near, anyone who occupied the post would be disqualified from running for office, so the vice-president, Jose Alencar, and the speaker of the house, Aldo Rebelo, the next in succession and who were considering running, also left Brazil. This would have made her the interim president for at least 10 hours. However, President of the Senate Renan Calheiros, who was not up for re-election and preceded her in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> succession, <b>stayed</b> behind.|$|R

50|$|Actions {{taken against}} the United States must be {{initiated}} {{within two years}} of when the claimant has had a reasonable chance to discover the violation. All cases are presented before a judge, not a jury. However, the court will <b>order</b> a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> proceedings if they determine that if during the court case civil discovery will hurt {{the ability of the}} government to conduct a related investigation or the prosecution of a related criminal case. If the court <b>orders</b> the <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> proceedings they will extend the time period that a claimant has to take action on a reported violation. However, the government may respond to any action against it by submitting evidence ex parte in order to avoid disclosing any matter that may adversely affect a related investigation or a related criminal case. The plaintiff is then given an opportunity to make a submission to the court, not ex parte, and the court may request further information from either party.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the influence of rapid diagnosis of influenza on patient management and laboratory tests as well as the length <b>of</b> the <b>stay</b> in the emergency department of children presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI) without signs of focal infection. Material and Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the pediatric emergency department of Vakif Gureba Hospital, Istanbul, between December 2008 and March 2009, including patients aged 8 months to 11 years presenting with fever and cough, coryza, myalgias,and /or malaise. After obtaining informed consent, patients were allocated into two groups. Group 1 : physician informed about the rapid influenza test result; or Group 2; physician not informed of the rapid influenza test result. Nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from all patients were immediately tested with Influenza A/B Rapid Test® for influenza A and B. Laboratory tests <b>ordered</b> and length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in the emergency department were compared between the resultant influenza-positive groups (informed and not informed). After initial presentation, a control visit check was carried out 1 month later. Results: One hundred and fifty children were enrolled, (mean age 4. 2 ± 3. 8 years years, male/female ratio 1. 2) among whom 72 (48 %) tested positive for influenza. Comparison of the groups revealed that the number <b>of</b> tests <b>ordered</b> and length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> in the emergency department were significantly lower in the first group (12 versus 35 cases, and 62 versus 145 minutes respectively, (p<. 0001). Clinical presentation symptoms were not significantly different between two groups. Conclusion: During the influenza season, rapid diagnosis of influenza may allow a reduction of additional laboratory tests and decreased length of time to discharge in a pediatric emergency department...|$|R

50|$|Though the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied Berry's {{request to}} stop his {{execution}} (citing exceeded time limits to challenge the constitutionality of lethal injection), the U.S. Supreme Court <b>ordered</b> a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> execution minutes prior to Berry's scheduled execution at the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Parchman. This effectively delayed but did not commute Berry's sentence. The order to delay execution was due to a pending Kentucky case before the court regarding the constitutionality of lethal injection.|$|R
5000|$|On June 10, 2014, the Judge Chambers <b>ordered</b> a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> {{proceedings}} {{until there}} is a ruling in Bostic v. Shaefer.

The district judge reasoned that [...] "because of the overlap in the issues present" [...] the Virginia case should be decided first. His order matched those in two other same-sex marriage cases in the Fourth Circuit: Harris v. Rainey, a Virginia case, and Bradacs v. Haley, a South Carolina case.|$|R

50|$|The Appeals Court usually hears {{cases in}} three-judge panels, which rotate {{so that every}} judge has an {{opportunity}} to sit with every other judge. However, single judges will often hear interlocutory appeals concerning such issues as court <b>orders,</b> <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> civil proceedings, and awards of attorney's fees. The Appeals Court consists of twenty-five active justices as well as several recall justices who despite having retired continue to assist the Court with its case load. Appeals are heard from September through June at the John Adams Courthouse as well as at special sessions held at various locations such as law schools throughout Massachusetts.|$|R

500|$|The {{process of}} being called to the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> Serjeants-at-Law <b>stayed</b> fairly constant. The {{traditional}} method was that the Serjeants would discuss among themselves prospective candidates, and then make recommendations to the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. He would pass these names on to the Lord Chancellor, who would appoint the new Serjeants. This was intended to provide a way to select possible judges in a period where political favouritism was rampant – since only Serjeants could become judges, making sure that Serjeants were not political appointees was seen to provide for a neutral judiciary. Serjeants were traditionally appointed by a writ directly from the King. The writ was issued under the Great Seal of the Realm and required [...] "the elected and qualified apprentices of the law to take the state and degree of a Serjeant-at-Law". The newly created Serjeants would then assemble {{in one of the}} Inns of Court, where they would hear a speech from the Lord Chancellor or Lord Chief Justice and be given a purse of gold. The Coif was then placed on the Serjeant's head. The Serjeants were required to swear an oath, which was that they would: ...|$|R

At that time, Prothom Alo was Bangladesh’s largest circulation paper, and a frequent critic of the Islamists.

40|$|Context: Reducing {{unnecessary}} testing lessens {{the cost}} burden of medical care, but decreasing use depends on consistently following evidence-based clinical decision rules. The Ottawa foot and ankle rules (OFARs) are validated, longstanding evidence-based guidelines to predict fractures. Frequently, radiography is automatically ordered for acute ankle injuries despite findings from OFARs suggesting no fracture. Objectives: First, {{to determine whether}} implementation of protocol-driven use of the OFARs at triage would decrease the number <b>of</b> radiography <b>orders</b> and length <b>of</b> <b>stay</b> (LOS) in the emergency department. Second, to quantify the incidence of OFARs use at triage and to assess patient expectations of radiography use and patient satisfaction as rated by both patients and clinicians. Methods: In this prospective, 2 -stage sequential pilot study, patients with acute ankle and foot injuries were screened in the emergency department between January 2013 and October 2013. In the first stage, clinicians (physician assistants, residents, and attending physicians) performed their usual practice habits for radiography use in the control group. For the second stage, they were educated to appropriately apply the OFARs before ordering radiography. Fo...|$|R
