[...] After the meeting, a Liberal Democrats negotiator, David Laws, said members had [...] "endorsed in full" [...] the strategy outlined by Clegg that the Conservatives should have first choice in negotiations on forming a government.

500|$|Naz {{is one of}} {{four main}} {{characters}} from series two of EastEnders: E20, created by its team of thirteen writers, along with Asher, Sol and Stevie. Newcomer Emaa Hussen was cast in the role, and said: [...] "It's a really exciting place to start my career. I'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders, which is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do the show." [...] Hussen said she was offered the part as the producers saw something [...] "authentic and real" [...] in her and that she could play the character how they wanted, and said she is similar to the character in some ways, adding that she enjoyed playing a strong character and felt like Naz as soon as she got into cotume. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Humbug" [...] {{was written}} by Darin Morgan; {{it was his first}} script for the series. Earlier in the second season, he {{appeared}} in the second episode [...] "The Host" [...] as the Flukeman. He also helped his brother Glen Morgan—already a regular writer on The X-Files—with the script for the following episode, [...] "Blood". Series creator Chris Carter offered Darin Morgan a permanent place on The X-Files writing team, which he reluctantly accepted. Morgan said he was uncomfortable initially, stating [...] "One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> was uncomfortable joining the staff is that I'm a comedy writer and this isn't a comedy show, so I was trying more or less to have an episode {{with a little bit of}} humor, without telling anybody what I was doing." [...] Glen suggested that he write an episode about sideshow performers. Before writing the episode Darin Morgan watched a tape of Jim Rose's circus sideshow and subsequently cast Rose and The Enigma as Dr. Blockhead and The Conundrum, respectively. Other guest stars were Twin Peaks regular Michael J. Anderson as Mr. Nutt and Vincent Schiavelli as Lanny.|$|E
500|$|Many rappers {{have taken}} note of Illmatics {{influence}} on their lyricism. Ghostface Killah recounted, “When I used to listen to Nas back in the days, it was like, ‘Oh shit! He murdered that.’ That forced me to get my pen game up... The whole Illmatic album forced you {{to go ahead and}} do shit... It was inspiration." [...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

Producers {{of the show}} {{were not allowed to}} photograph the interior of the actual buildings as part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a point of reference due to its high security. Although the location was not featured in the comics of the same name, Hurd felt {{that it was important to}} add because of its close proximity to the survivor's camp. As opposed to the previous episode, where filming mostly took place outside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for [...] "TS-19" [...] occurred inside of the building. Darabont conceived the idea of exploring into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [...] "When Frank was pitching the idea to me, saying he wanted to bring them to the CDC and telling me all the different things that he felt would come out of that story, the science of it all and the being trapped in the small location, I was very much picturing a lot of Day of the Dead stuff," [...] stated creator Robert Kirkman.

He writes in dialect, sets his stories in cities, talk about gangs and other contemporary issues, and produces stories {{that no one else}} is telling. That no one else is even attempting to tell. Because if there’s one thing Neri does well it’s tell a tale that needs to be told." ...|$|R

In a prepublication interview Grass for the first time revealed that he {{had been a member of}} the Waffen-SS, and not only a Flakhelfer (anti-aircraft assistant) as he had long said. On being asked what caused the need for public confession and revelation of his past in the book he answered: [...] "It was a weight on me, my silence over all these years is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> wrote the book.

60|$|That is, as I would {{interpret}} the text;--the ideas in and by which God reveals himself to man {{are not the}} same with, and are not to be judged by, the conceptions which the human understanding generalizes from <b>the</b> notices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senses, common to man and to irrational animals, dogs, elephants, beavers, and the like, endowed with the same senses. Therefore I regard this paragraph, p. 223-4, as a specimen of admirable special pleading 'ad hominem' in <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> eristic Logic; but I condemn it as a wilful resignation or temporary self-deposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> will not suppose what my reason declares to be no position at all, and therefore an impossible sub-position.|$|R

Blunt claimed all the amendment did [...] "was repeat [...] authority that the secretary in a hearing the other day, before the Agri Approp committee the other day, said he already had.

2500|$|One {{specific}} {{scene in}} the film perceived {{as an example of}} anti-Semitism was in the dialogue of Caiaphas, when he states [...] "His blood [...] on us and on our children!", a quote historically interpreted by some as a curse taken upon by the Jewish people. Certain Jewish groups asked this be removed from the film. However, only the subtitles were removed; the original dialogue remains in the Hebrew soundtrack. When asked about this scene, Gibson said: [...] "I wanted it in. My brother said I was wimping out if I didn't include it. But, man, if I included that in there, they'd be coming after me at my house. They'd come to kill me." [...] In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, [...] "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said." ...|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was interviewed}} for Blues & Soul in 2010, Rowland {{explained}} that the album would blend her urban roots with a strong dance music influence.

I just wanted a great track that I could sing and that people would enjoy." [...] Part of the inspiration for the new sound on the album was wanting to do something different. In her interview with The Independent, she said [...] "For me, it was being kind of at a flat line with urban music and wanting something different ... when I did 'When Love Takes Over', it was easy to do it – it was almost like it happened before me in spirit and I walked right into it. ...so I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction." [...] Then in response to criticisms that her long-standing fans would not have their expectations met, she said [...] "I did not forget about my urban roots, nor will I ever ... That is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> am here period ... I thank everyone for being so wonderful and so open to me trying something new.
