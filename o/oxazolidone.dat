40|$|The {{benefits}} of reclaiming amine systems are trumpeted by many and doubted by others. Removing the contaminants generally results in smoother operations. Various methods of removing contaminants from amine solutions {{have been developed}} and improved over the years, {{primarily because of the}} enthusiasm of the users of reclaiming services. Suspended solids and hydrocarbons have been routinely dealt with by filtration and absorption technologies for longer than anyone can remember, but other contaminants have only relatively recently been targeted. Heat Stable Salts were rarely spoken of 15 years ago, but are now universally known as an operational concern. Of the several potential chemical degradation products of amines, only HEEU and BHEEU (ureas formed by MEA and DGA, respectively) have had a long-standing routine way of dealing with them. As analytical capabilities improved, more and more contaminants can be identified and have become of interest. Amino acids (bicine, HES, and others) have received particular interest because of their strong contribution to corrosion. In recent years, amides, diamines, ureas, <b>oxazolidones</b> have become common targets of reclaiming efforts. Amides and <b>oxazolidones</b> have been converted back to useable amine. Over the last 15 years, reclaiming services have become available employing a variety of technologies to remove contaminates. These are reviewed and compared...|$|R
25|$|Penicillin {{remains the}} {{drug of choice}} for {{treating}} streptococcal infections, and S.dysgalactiae strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin have never been reported. Treatment duration varies from 5 days to 3 months, depending on the clinical diagnosis. Second-line agents include macrolides and clindamycin, although increasing resistance, due to both efflux and target modification, has been documented in some geographic regions. Aminoglycosides are not active against streptococci due to their lacking respiratory metabolism. However, administered in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, aminoglycosides appear to produce a synergistic effect towards streptococci. Streptococcus dysgalactiae is uniformly susceptible to glycopeptides and <b>oxazolidones.</b>|$|R

50|$|Rivaroxaban {{chemically}} {{belongs to}} the group of n-aryloxazolidinones. Other drugs of that group are linezolid and tedizolid, both of whom are antibiotics. A synthesis of n-aryloxazolidinones starting with an O-silyl protected ethyl(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-carbamate was published in 2016. In a one-pot reaction the carbamate cyclisizes to a 2-oxazolidone ring under slightly basic conditions while simultaneously the <b>oxazolidone</b> nitrogen is arylized by copper-catalization. For rivaroxaban in particular, 3-morpholinone substitutes the iodine in p-position of the benzene ring by copper-catalization. Afterwards, the silyl protecting group is removed and the resulting alcohol is replaced by an amino group which is then acylated in the last step.|$|E

40|$|Background: Infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) {{bacteria}} are increasing both {{in hospitals and}} in the community and are characterized by high mortality rates. New molecules are in development to face the need of active compounds toward resistant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. In particular, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has supported the initiative to develop ten new antibacterials within 2020. Principal targets are the so-called ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacteriaceae). Purpose: To review the characteristics and the status of development of new antimicrobials including new cephalosporins, carbapenems, beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, quinolones, <b>oxazolidones,</b> glycopeptides, and tetracyclines. Conclusions: While numerous new compounds target resistant gram-positive pathogens and have been approved for clinical use, very few new molecules are active against MDR gram-negative pathogens, especially carbapenemase producers. New glycopeptides and oxazolidinones are highly efficient against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and new cephalosporins and carbapenems also display activity toward MDR gram-positive bacteria. Although new cephalosporins and carbapenems have acquired activity against MRSA, they offer few advantages against difficult-to-treat gram-negatives. Among agents that are potentially active against MDR gram-negatives are ceftozolane/tazobactam, new carbapenems, the combination of avibactam with ceftazidime, and plazomicin. Since a relevant number of promising antibiotics is currently in development, regulatory approvals over the next 5 years are crucial to face the growing threat of multidrug resistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{bacteriological}} investigation with determining of the microflora nature {{enables a}} rational antibiotic therapy. The {{aim of the}} research was to verify the specific composition according to the results of bacteriological investigation on appendix lumen and peritoneal extraction, and to analyze its sensitivity to antibiotics in patients with appendicular peritonitis. Materials and methods. 356 hospital records of the patients with acute appendicitis were analyzed. Local sampling of biological material was conducted during the operation to perform microbiological investigations. The antibacterial efficiency of 33 antibiotics was investigated. Results and discussion. High frequency of aerobic and anaerobic microbial associations and considerable identity of appendix and abdominal exudation microflora were confirmed. The positive result of bacteriological investigation of the pus from the abdominal cavity during appendicular peritonitis was collected in 44 (88. 0 %) patients. No flora growing was observed in 6 (12. 0 %) cases. The most efficient were gatifloxacin (100. 0 %), imipenem (86. 1 %), meropenem (85. 7 %). Conclusions.

40|$|Biotechnology {{is often}} {{presented}} as if {{progress in the}} past two decades represented a major success, but the reality is quite different. For example, ten major classes of antibiotics were discovered between 1935 and 1963, but after 1963 there has been just one, the <b>oxazolidones.</b> To illustrate the possibilities of doing better by taking account of the real behaviour of metabolic systems, we can examine how one might modify the activity of an enzyme in the cell (for example by genetic manipulation, or by the action of an inhibitor, etc.) to satisfy a technological aim. For example, if the objective is to eliminate a pest, one might suppose that the effect of an inhibitor could be to depress an essential flux to a level insufficient for life, or to raise the concentration of an intermediate to a toxic level. The former may seem the more obvious, but the latter is easier to achieve in practice, and there are some excellent examples of industrial products that work in that way, such as the herbicide ‘Roundup’ and antimalarials of the quinine class. A study of glycolysis in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei (which causes African sleeping sickness) indicates that for this approach to work the selected target enzyme must have a substrate with a concentration that is not limited by stoichiometric constraints. That is not necessarily easy to find in a complicated system, and typically needs the metabolic network to be analysed in the computer. To cite this article: A. Cornish-Bowden, M. L. Cárdenas, C. R.

40|$|Antibiotic {{consumption}} in pigs can be optimized by developing treatment guidelines, which encourage veterinarians to use effective drugs with low probability of developing resistance {{of importance for}} human health. In Denmark, treatment guidelines for use in swine production are currently under review at the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. Use of pleuromutilins in swine has previously been associated with a very low risk for human health. However, recent international data and sporadic findings of novel resistance genes suggest a change of risk. Consequently, a reassessment was undertaken inspired by a risk assessment framework developed by the European Medicines Agency. Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of clonal complex 398 (MRSA CC 398) and enterococci were identified as relevant hazards. The release assessment showed that the probability of development of pleuromutilin resistance was high in MRSA CC 398 (medium uncertainty) and low in enterococci (high uncertainty). A relatively small proportion of Danes has an occupational exposure to pigs, and foodborne transmission was only considered of relevance for enterococci, resulting in an altogether low exposure risk. The human consequences of infection with pleuromutilin-resistant MRSA CC 398 or enterococci were assessed as low for the public in general but high for vulnerable groups such as hospitalized and immunocompromised persons. For MRSA CC 398, the total risk was estimated as low (low uncertainty), among other due to the current guidelines on prevention of MRSA in place at Danish hospitals, which include screening of patients with daily contact to pigs on admittance. Moreover, MRSA CC 398 has a medium human–human transmission potential. For enterococci, the total risk was estimated as low due to low prevalence of resistance, low probability of spread to humans, low virulence, but no screening of hospitalized patients, high ability of acquiring resistance genes, and {{a limited number of}} alternative antimicrobials (high uncertainty). This assessment reflects the current situation and should be repeated if pleuromutilin {{consumption in}}creases substantially, resulting in increased prevalence of mobile, easily transmissible resistance mechanisms. Continuous monitoring of pleuromutilin resistance in selected human pathogens should therefore be considered. This also includes monitoring of linezolid resistance, since resistance mechanisms for pleuromutilins and <b>oxazolidones</b> are often coupled...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{light is}} known {{to be one of the}} most {{efficient}} methods to initiatc polymeric reactions in the presence of a photonitiator. Photopolymerizations are advantageous because the chemistry of the materials can be tailored to design liquid monomers for ultrarapid polymerization into a solid polymer material. One way to achieve rapid photopolymerizations is to utilize multifunctional (meth) acrylate monomers. which form highly crosslinked polymers; however, these monomers typically do not achieve complete functional group conversion. Recently, Decker et al. developed novel monovinyl acrylate monomers that display polyriicrization kinetics that rival those of multifunctional acrylate monomers. These novel acrylate monomers incorporate secondary functionalities and end groups such as carbonates, carbamates, cyclic carbonates and <b>oxazolidone</b> which promote the increased polymerization kinetics of these monomers. In addition to thc polynierization kinetics, these novel monovinyl monomers form crosslinked polymers, which are characterized by having high strength and high flexibility.

40|$|New {{flexible}} aliphatic oxazolidone-isocyanurate networks (AISOX) {{are obtained}} by reacting a {{low molecular weight}} diisocyanate (4, 4 -methylene dicyclohexyl diisocyanate, H 12 MDI) and a macro-diepoxyde (poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether, M-n= 526, PEGDGE) in different molar ratio. The curing reaction, carried out from 25 degrees C to 200 degrees C, is studied by using DSC and FTIR. The effect of the molar ratio of the two monomers on thermal and mechanical properties of AISOX resins is investigated by DSC, thermogravimetric analysis, stress-strain measurements and optical microscopy.

Materials and methods: In a double-center retrospective study, blood cultures positive for S. aureus were obtained from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2014. The BACTEC 9120 blood culture system and the Vitek- 2 system were used to process blood samples and identify species, respectively. We also collected these patients’ data to confirm clinical and laboratory characteristics. Results: Twenty of 275 (7. 3 %) liver recipients developed S. aureus bacteremia during the study period. The median time to the onset of S. aureus bacteremias was 6 days after liver transplantation and all episodes of bacteremias were early onset. The lung {{was the most common}} source of primary infection, followed by the intra-abdominal/biliary tract. A total of nine (45 %) liver recipients died due to S. aureus bacteremias. Of these 20 S. aureus cases, 80 % were methicillin-resistant. S. aureus was highly resistant to erythromycin and penicillin (resistance rate > 90 %). No S. aureus resistant to glycopeptides and <b>oxazolidone</b> antibiotics was observed. There were seven (35 %) liver recipients with an inappropriate antibiotic therapy. Between the periods of 2001 – 2007 and 2008 – 2014, the distribution of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was not significantly different (P= 1. 000). Pneumonia as a predominant primary source, a high body temperature, abnormal blood pressure, and decreased platelets, which occurred in the early period after liver transplantation, as well as high morbidity and mortality, were the main characteristics of S. aureus bacteremias. Conclusion: S. aureus led to severe bacteremias in liver recipients, with high morbidity and mortality, and the majority of them comprised methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

40|$|Because of the {{banning of}} {{chlorofluorocarbons}} (CFCs) that used in the traditional PUIR foams by the 1987 Montreal Protocol, we have targeted our research on new CFC-free PUIR formulations. In this study, we have focused on chemical blowing techniques for PUIR foams that were based on CO 2 -forming reactions of isocyanate chemistries. Our goal is to prepare a 100 % CO 2 -blown PUIR foams with density of 2 ~ 3 lb/ft 3 possessing fine-cell sizes of less than 150 μm and stable dimension stability that still have the mechanical properties of traditional heat resistant PUIR foams. In my optimization efforts, I have screened systematically various combinations of blowing/trimerization catalysts and in conjunctions with other additives for introducing heat stable functional groups. It was found {{that a combination of}} PC- 41 (trimerization catalyst) and dimethyl phospholene oxide (DMPO) has been the most efficient for foam blowing process. In the meantime, these blowing combinations also have to be complimented by the addition of epoxy resin (Epon 188) in range of 20 % to 25 % in the formulation in achieving suitable exotherm for further crosslinking reactions. In the 100 % CO 2 blown foam prepared by this study, successful introductions of isocyanurate, carbodiimide, <b>oxazolidone</b> and amide-imide functional groups into the foam polymer have been achieved by a one-shot process. In the meantime, the modified foams have been found to have higher heat resistant properties. They were dimensional stable and exhibiting foaming profiles suitable for adaptation to the current PUIR manufacturing facility. 因為 1987 年的蒙特婁公約規定，禁止在傳統的PUIR發泡體上使用氟氯碳化物（CFCs），所以我們把研究的重點放在不使用氟氯碳化物之新型PUIR發泡體的配方上。在本研究中，我們著重在以異氰酸鹽產生CO 2 的化學發泡的技術來生成PUIR。目標是製備 100 %以CO 2 發泡的PUIR發泡體，且具 2 ~ 3 lbm/ft 3 的密度及細微的泡孔粒徑維持小於 150 μm，更擁有穩定的體積形狀，也就是說我們保有了傳統耐熱PUIR發泡體的機械性質。 在最佳化的努力之下，我們已能系統化揭示各式各樣不同的組合，包括：發泡╱三量化觸媒與結合其他添加物﹙如導入熱穩定性官能基﹚。實驗中發現結合PC- 41 與DMPO是最有效的發泡體發泡程序。同時在發泡配方中可藉由添加環氧樹脂﹙Epon- 188 ﹚，配方使用量約 20 ~ 25 w. t. %即可達到適當的放熱溫度，令發泡體在所處的環境下，能有效促成進一步的交聯反應。 製備 100 % CO 2 發泡的發泡體研究中，我們成功的將異氰脲酸酯﹙isocyanurate﹚、碳二醯胺﹙carbodiimide﹚、惡唑烷基﹙oxazolidone﹚及醯胺-醯亞胺﹙amide-imide﹚等官能基成功導入發泡體高分子中，並只採一步合成的方式即可達成。同時經改質過後的發泡體發現具有較高抗熱的性質，並擁有體積形狀穩定的特性，且發泡過程所展現的方法可被現行PUIR發泡體的製程設施所接受。摘要…….
