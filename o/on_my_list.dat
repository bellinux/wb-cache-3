500|$|In the 1939–40 season, Ring {{played in}} all of Victoria's Sheffield Shield matches, and {{though he did not}} improve on either his best bowling or best batting figures, he took over as the side's {{principal}} spin bowler from Fleetwood-Smith, with 28 wickets in the six matches against the senior player's 17. At the end of the season, he was picked for [...] "The Rest" [...] team, composed of the best players from the other states, for the match against the Shield winners, New South Wales, though he was upstaged by the 48-year-old Clarrie Grimmett, who took 10 wickets to Ring's one in the match. Wisden noted in a brief report on the 1939–40 Sheffield Shield in its 1940 edition that Bill O'Reilly, Grimmett and Ring [...] "carried off chief bowling honours in the competition".

Rooksby described the track as [...] "conjuring {{the atmosphere of}} a smoky nightclub". Madonna sings in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. It opens with a [...] "lazy" [...] clarinet solo and portrays the singer {{as a kind of}} sexual magnate. [...] "I always get my man", she sings [...] "If you're <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>list</b> it's just a question of when". The song is set in the time signature of common time with a moderate tempo of 75 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of B major with Madonna's voice spanning from F3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of B9–B6/F–B9–B6/F as its chord progression. In the film, [...] "Sooner or Later" [...] is the signature song of Breathless and was primarily performed during a montage just after Dick Tracy has placed a microphone in Alphonse [...] "Big Boy" [...] Caprice's boardroom and operator.|$|E

500|$|On February 27, 2011, he and Anne Hathaway {{hosted the}} 83rd Academy Awards. The two were {{selected}} to help the awards show achieve its goal of attracting a younger audience. Franco had previously said that he accepted the job for the experience {{and because it was}} a once in a lifetime opportunity. Numerous media viewers criticized Franco for his discontent and lack of energy on stage and the show was widely panned, with some reviewers dubbing it the worst telecast in its history. The actor later spoke about his hosting in an interview on the Late Show with David Letterman. He explained that when accepting the job he never had high hopes, adding [...] "It was never <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>list</b> of things to do.

500|$|After {{returning}} he only {{managed to}} play one match before being loaned out again on 24 March 2005, this time to League Two club Bristol Rovers, {{until the end of}} the season. He made his debut two days later as a substitute on 79 minutes in a 2–1 victory away to Notts County. He stated his desire to stay at the club long-term in April 2005, saying [...] "I do need a change, just to get myself going again really because it has been disappointing not playing." [...] He made his first start for the club in a 4–0 away defeat against Scunthorpe United on 30 April 2005. The loan expired in May 2005 after playing five times and he again expressed his desire to stay at the club. Wycombe Wanderers agreed to sign Carruthers on a two-year contract on a free transfer on 16 June 2005 and Rovers manager Ian Atkins revealed his disappointment at not signing him, saying [...] "He was high <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>list.</b> There are not many players who can play left-back, wing-back or as out-and-out wingers". However, after speaking to Atkins and being guaranteed regular football, he decided to join Rovers instead on 29 June 2005.|$|E
500|$|Peel was {{the first}} English bowler to take 100 Test wickets against Australia. At a time when {{international}} matches were relatively rare, his 20 Test matches were a considerable achievement, and it was unusual for a player to tour Australia {{as often as he}} did: he went there four times. His main rival as a spinner and for a place in the England team was Johnny Briggs; Peel bowled faster, which made him harder to hit. Archie MacLaren, who captained England from the late 1890s and was a team-mate and captain of Briggs, described Peel as [...] "the cleverest bowler of my time". MacLaren stated that Peel thoroughly understood tactics and could spot weaknesses in a batsman's technique. He concluded: [...] "I place Peel first <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>list</b> of great left-handed bowlers on account of his wonderful judgement, his diabolical cleverness and his great natural ability." [...] When Rhodes took over the role of left-arm spin bowler in the Yorkshire team, there was some debate over who out of Peate, Peel and Rhodes was the best left-arm spinner to play for Yorkshire. Historians regard Peel as part of a long-lasting chain of successful Yorkshire left-arm spinners, preceded by Peate and succeeded by Rhodes.|$|E

500|$|I {{was visiting}} {{my friend and}} generous benefactor, Prof. Edward C. Pickering. With {{characteristic}} kindness, he had volunteered to have the spectra observed for all the stars—including comparison stars—which had been observed in the observations for stellar parallax which Hinks and I made at Cambridge, and I discussed. This piece of apparently routine work proved very fruitful—it led to the discovery that all the stars of very faint absolute magnitude were of spectral class M. In conversation on this subject (as I recall it), I asked Pickering about certain other faint stars, not <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>list,</b> mentioning in particular 40 Eridani B. Characteristically, he sent a note to the Observatory office and before long the answer came (I think from Mrs Fleming) that the spectrum of this star was A. I knew enough about it, even in these paleozoic days, to realize at once {{that there was an}} extreme inconsistency between what we would then have called [...] "possible" [...] values of the surface brightness and density. I must have shown that I was not only puzzled but crestfallen, at this exception to what looked like a very pretty rule of stellar characteristics; but Pickering smiled upon me, and said: [...] "It is just these exceptions that lead to an advance in our knowledge", and so the white dwarfs entered the realm of study! ...|$|E

Recently I began to organize the notes I had taken since 1979 for the Nebraska Bird Review 2 ̆ 7 s semi- annual occurrence reports. Partly I wanted to verify my suspicions about variation in the occurrence of several species during that period of time. I try to visit the area called Wolff Lake (a sand-arid-gravel operation {{on the south side of}} the Platte River in northwestern Saunders Co. each weekend. But there are many variations, and there are periods of prolonged absences. I average about 20 such visits each half year. On each visit I spend several hours from dawn to late morning walking through the area, and sometimes there is an added walk in late afternoon or evening. WILD TURKEYS are one of only two encouraging notes in this report. They were introduced into the area in 2 ̆ 782 or 2 ̆ 783. They began to show up <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>lists</b> in Spring of 2 ̆ 784.
