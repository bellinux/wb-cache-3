5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels {{so long as they}} have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E
5|$|The letter, {{which is}} a {{response}} to Boniface who had requested his support, reveals Ælfwald's sound understanding of Latin. Ælfwald's letter reassures Boniface that his name was being remembered by the East Angles: it contains an offer to exchange the names of their dead, so that mutual prayers could be read for them. According to Richard Hoggett, a phrase in the letter, 'in septenis monasteriorum nostorum sinaxis', has been interpreted incorrectly by historians to imply that there were at the time seven monasteries in Ælfwald's kingdom in which prayers were being read, a theory which has proved difficult for scholars to explain. Hoggett argues that the words in the phrase refer to the number <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> the monks offered praise during the monastic day and not to the number of monasteries then in existence. He points out that this interpretation was published by Haddan and Stubbs as long ago as 1869.|$|E

25|$|Silks {{derived from}} Bombyx mori are {{generally}} made of two parts: the silk fibroin fiber which contains a light chain of 25kDa {{and a heavy}} chain of 350kDa (or 390kDa) linked by a single disulfide bond and a glue-like protein, sericin, comprising 25 to 30 percentage by weight. Silk fibroin contains hydrophobic Beta sheet blocks, interrupted by small hydrophilic groups. And the beta-sheets contribute much to the high mechanical strength of silk fibers, which achieves 740 MPa, tens <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of poly(lactic acid) and hundreds <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>that</b> of collagen. This impressive mechanical strength has made silk fibroin very competitive for applications in biomaterials. Indeed, silk fibers have {{found their way into}} tendon tissue engineering, where mechanical properties matter greatly. In addition, mechanical properties of silks from various kinds of silkworms vary widely, which provides more choices for their use in tissue engineering.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the amount of homework assigned to sophomore and senior high school students of White Plains High School, White Plains, New York, during a typical school day, and to determine certain parent, teacher and student reactions and expectations relative to those assignments. The subject areas for which homework assignments were studied in detail, and upon which correlations were made, were English, mathematics, social studies, and science. Instruments, specifically developed to correlate responses from three different groups were completed by 159 parents of students involved in the study, 54 teachers of the four subject areas indicated above, 505 sophomores, and 408 seniors. Two hundred and eighteen student response sheets which were electronically rejected because of deviations in responding techniques, were hand scored to obtain responses to specific questions. All other response sheets were tabulated electronically. Because of an insufficient number of responses, data gathered from the parent instruments were not used for statistical analysis. Data obtained from the various instruments were applied to the chi-square test of independence to determine rejection of null hypotheses. In applying data obtained from questionnaires to the chisquare formula, eight hypotheses were rejected and five hypotheses were not rejected. There was insufficient data to allow application of this formula to one of the hypotheses; one hypothesis, therefore, remains untested. The hypotheses that were rejected are:There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> English teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> mathematics teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework between college-bound and non college-bound students. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework between boy and girl populations. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework in the subject of English between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework in the subject of mathematics between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework in the subject of science between sophomore and senior populations. The hypotheses that were not rejected are:There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> social studies teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> homework is worked on in school between boy and girl populations. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> homework is worked on in school between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework in the subject area of social studies between sophomore and senior populations. The hypothesis that was not tested because of insufficient data is:There is no significant difference in the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> science teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> students actually work on those assignments. In general, the data indicate that girls tend to spend more time on homework than boys, sophomores spend more time on homework than seniors, college-bound students spend more time on homework than non college-bound students, and that there is a disparity between the length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> teachers think that it will take students to complete an assignment and the length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> students work on those assignments.
