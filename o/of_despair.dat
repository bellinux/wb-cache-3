5|$|In 1999 Wizards of the Coast {{published}} a new {{revision of the}} original Dragonlance story, including Dragons <b>of</b> <b>Despair,</b> in Dragonlance Classics: 15th Anniversary Edition {{as part of their}} TSR's Silver Anniversary line. In 2000 the entire DL module series was reprinted exactly as the originals but in a smaller size. This printing was available as two slip case sets, with Dragons <b>of</b> <b>Despair</b> included in Dragonlance Volume 1: DL1 – DL8. The four chapters of Dragons of Autumn, an updated version of some Dragonlance modules converting them to Dungeons & Dragons version 3.5, corresponds to the material in Dragons <b>of</b> <b>Despair.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings <b>of</b> <b>despair</b> and hopelessness brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at least initially, they simply did not have the motivation to leave.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Tesla {{returned}} to Smiljan. Shortly after he arrived, he contracted cholera, was bedridden {{for nine months}} and was near death multiple times. Tesla's father, in a moment <b>of</b> <b>despair,</b> (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood) promised {{to send him to}} the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.|$|E

60|$|Edgar moved away, feeling relieved. George, instead <b>of</b> <b>despairing,</b> was {{considering}} new measures. He {{was far from}} beaten yet.|$|R
5|$|In the {{alternative}} version, plot points are changed or expanded upon {{to allow the}} game {{to serve as a}} sequel. It also features an extended ending in which Twinrova kidnaps Zelda, and lights the third Flame <b>of</b> <b>Despair</b> to revive Ganon. The player can then enter Twinrova's lair and battle Twinrova and Ganon. Upon completing {{the alternative}} game, another password is shown that gives the player the Victory Ring, which commemorates the defeat of Ganon.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{series was}} updated to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons second edition and repackaged {{as the three}} Dragonlance Classics modules, using module code DLC. DLC1 Dragonlance Classics Volume 1 reprinted Dragons <b>of</b> <b>Despair,</b> along with Dragons of Flame, Dragons of Hope, and Dragons of Desolation, in 1990.|$|E
5|$|If {{one game}} is played as a sequel to the other by a linked password, Twinrova captures Princess Zelda, {{lighting}} the Flame <b>of</b> <b>Despair.</b> Link enters a warp point by the Maku Tree and faces Twinrova, who is attempting to use the three Flames to revive Ganon, the primary antagonist in the Zelda series. Link defeats both Twinrova and a mindless, poorly resurrected Ganon. He frees Zelda, whose sacrifice {{would have been the}} full resurrection of Ganon; together, they exit the crumbling castle. After the credits, Link is seen waving to a crowd from a sailboat off the shore of a land with a castle in the background.|$|E

60|$|So feared Sakr-el-Bahr. He {{more than}} feared it. He knew that save for some miraculous rising {{of the wind}} it must be as she said. And then out <b>of</b> his <b>despair</b> leapt inspiration--a desperate inspiration, true child <b>of</b> that <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> which it was begotten.|$|R
5|$|Dragons <b>of</b> <b>Despair</b> is {{the first}} in a series of 16 Dragonlance adventures {{published}} by TSR, Inc. (TSR) between 1984 and 1988. It is the start of the first major story arc in the Dragonlance series of Dungeons & Dragons (D) role-playing game modules, a series of ready-to-play adventures for use by Dungeon Masters in the game. This series provides a game version of the original Dragonlance storyline later told in the Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy of novels. This module corresponds to the events told in the first half of the novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. Its module code is DL1, which is used to designate it as the first part of the Dragonlance adventure series.|$|E
5|$|Saruman is in {{part the}} {{architect}} of his own downfall. Kocher, Randall Helms and Shippey write that Saruman's actions {{in the first half}} of The Two Towers, although intended to further his own interests, in fact lead to his defeat and that of Sauron: his orcs help split the Fellowship at Parth Galen, and in carrying off two of the hobbits initiate a series of incidents that lead to his ruin. In turn this frees the Rohirrim to intervene at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and then together with the men of Gondor to assault Sauron's stronghold of Mordor and distract him from Frodo's final effort to destroy the Ring. Shippey says that this demonstrates the value of persistence in the face <b>of</b> <b>despair,</b> even if a way out cannot be seen; Kocher and Helms write that it is part of a pattern of providential events and of the reversed effects of evil intentions throughout the book.|$|E
5|$|The group {{assumes that}} {{completing}} this task {{will result in}} the granting of their wishes. The Wicked Witch of the West (Miss Piggy) sees them coming and consults with her pet Foo-Foo and her henchman Johnny Fiama. When the Wicked Witch of the West plans to have either her pack of 40 great man-eating wolves, a flock of 40 crows <b>of</b> <b>despair,</b> a swarm of angry black bees, a group of vicious squirrels, or a group of bloodthirsty cockatoos to do away with them, Johnny tells her that the animals that work for her are unavailable due to various reasons. This forces her to resort to using her Magic Biker Cap to call Sal Minella and the other Flying Monkeys (played by Sweetums, Crazy Harry, Black Dog, Calico, Old Tom, Spotted Dick, and Aretha from Fraggle Rock) to deal with them. The Witch and the Flying Monkeys capture Dorothy and Lion while Scarecrow and Tin Thing are dismantled by the Flying Monkeys.|$|E
2500|$|Many times an {{individual}} has a physical sickness {{and goes to the}} physician for help. But is that the only kind of sickness there is? Kierkegaard was interested in spiritual sickness called sin and the expectancy of forgiveness which are both Christian categories. We [...] "must want to understand the forgiveness <b>of</b> sins-and then <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> understanding it." [...] Later, in The Sickness Unto Death Kierkegaard writes of the sin <b>of</b> <b>despairing</b> over one's sin and the sin <b>of</b> <b>despairing</b> <b>of</b> the forgiveness of sins. Robert L. Perkins from Mercer University published a group of essays about these three discourses in 2006. Kierkegaard has moved forward from fear and trembling to fear and wonder within the two years of his published works. Wonder is more positive than fear.|$|R
6000|$|Not a disembodied spirit can {{the weapons}} of tyrants let loose, [...] But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling, cautioning. [...] Liberty, let others <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> you--I never <b>despair</b> <b>of</b> you.|$|R
60|$|Altogether, instead <b>of</b> <b>despairing,</b> I am full of hope. It {{seems to}} me {{probable}} that {{the door is open}} to a wider and calmer political liberty than France has yet enjoyed. Let us wait.|$|R
5|$|As {{they travel}} across the war-torn land, they are confronted by avatars {{in the service}} of {{multiple}} nations, and Arca - a cult made up of avatars led by a woman known as Mathias. Chitose joins Arca to further their cause of a utopia for avatars, and tries to persuade Luca to join, causing a rift between them. The conflicts between the groups is further inflamed as more people regain their memories as warriors of Sensus or Ratio, sparking old conflicts. In their adventures, the group works to end the fighting and learn about their past lives. When the full truth is revealed, they decide to fulfill Asura's wishes and unite the two worlds. This brings them into conflict with Mathias, who is revealed to be the incarnation of Asura's wrath at being betrayed, and now wishes to destroy both Devaloka and Naraka. Chitose, consumed by Sakuya's love for Asura, helps Mathias in her task. The party confront Mathias and Chitose in Devaloka's ruined capital, where the Manifest is hidden. They defeat Mathias, and Chitose kills herself in a fit <b>of</b> <b>despair.</b> Luca then proceeds to use the Manifest to merge Devaloka and Naraka, nullifying the avatars' powers and lessening the chance of future conflicts. The group then returns to their normal lives.|$|E
5|$|Gallipoli {{marked the}} end for Hamilton and Stopford but Hunter-Weston went on to lead VIII Corps {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme. The {{competence}} of Australian brigade commanders, John Monash (4th Infantry Brigade) and Harry Chauvel (1st Light Horse Brigade, New Zealand and Australian Division), was recognised by promotion to divisional and corps command. The influence of Kitchener waned after the coalition government was formed in May 1915, partly because of the growing sense of failure in the Dardanelles and culminated in Kitchener being over-ruled on support for the French at Salonika in early December 1915, when his influence on the Cabinet was at its lowest. The campaign gave confidence to the Ottomans in their ability to defeat the Allies. In Mesopotamia, the Turks surrounded a British expedition at Kut Al Amara, forcing their surrender in April 1916. Ottoman forces in southern Palestine were poised to launch an attack against the Suez Canal and Egypt. Defeat at the Battle of Romani and lack of materials to complete the military railway, necessary for such an operation, {{marked the end}} of that ambition. The optimism which came from the victory at Gallipoli was replaced by a gathering sense <b>of</b> <b>despair</b> and the British remained on the offensive in the Middle East for the rest of the war.|$|E
5|$|TSR {{decided to}} create a franchise, {{including}} modules, board games, lead figures, andfor the first timenovels. Weis had been hired as an editor; with Hickman, she began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren't satisfied with the author, and decided they should {{be the ones to}} write the books. They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue for the first five chapters of the first novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, based on the module Dragons <b>of</b> <b>Despair.</b> TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released Dragons of Autumn Twilight as a supplement to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. TSR had doubts about the finished novel's sales potential, and attempted to order thirty thousand copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand. Dragonlance eventually received ancillary products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and books of artwork.|$|E

25|$|Another {{instance}} of absurdist themes in Kierkegaard's work appears in The Sickness Unto Death, which Kierkegaard signed with pseudonym Anti-Climacus. Exploring the forms <b>of</b> <b>despair,</b> Kierkegaard examines the type <b>of</b> <b>despair</b> known as defiance. In the opening quotation reproduced {{at the beginning}} of the article, Kierkegaard describes how such a man would endure such a defiance and identifies the three major traits of the Absurd Man, later discussed by Albert Camus: a rejection of escaping existence (suicide), a rejection of help from a higher power and acceptance of his absurd (and despairing) condition.|$|E
