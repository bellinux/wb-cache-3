5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} {{the first edition of}} Leaves <b>of</b> <b>Grass,</b> critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. Leaves <b>of</b> <b>Grass</b> was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E

The less abundant species <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata).

5|$|Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman {{worked as}} a journalist, a teacher, a {{government}} clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves <b>of</b> <b>Grass,</b> {{was first published in}} 1855 with his own money. The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.|$|E
5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> rustling"—and the ability to incapacitate others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} {{publications}} of Leaves <b>of</b> <b>Grass,</b> Whitman had financial difficulties {{and was forced}} to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's Daily Times starting in May 1857. As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials. He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave. Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.|$|E
5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} <b>of</b> <b>grass</b> hay (Chloris gayana) {{were studied}} to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost any}} herbivore, they consume other plants if {{presented}} with them, but their diet in nature consists almost entirely <b>of</b> <b>grass,</b> with only minimal consumption of aquatic plants. Hippos {{are born with}} sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from their mothers' feces to digest vegetation. Hippos have (rarely) been filmed eating carrion, usually close to the water. There are other reports of meat-eating, and even cannibalism and predation. The stomach anatomy of a hippo is not suited to carnivory, and meat-eating is likely caused by aberrant behaviour or nutritional stress.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{monograph}} was {{to prepare}} the text portion of the topic ornamental grasses, outline their origins, {{to deal with the}} selected properties <b>of</b> <b>grasses,</b> whether environmental, horticultural or compositional. Furthermore, the search for information concerning reproduction, significance and possible recommendations on the use <b>of</b> <b>grasses.</b> Drafted was both a literary review, and the results of the discussions that are new valuable for practical application. At selected model areas were conducted annual observations in the 14 -day interval in 100 selected taxa <b>of</b> ornamental <b>grasses</b> in order to evaluate the properties <b>of</b> selected <b>grasses</b> on which there has been redefined and graphic arts habitual types. Results and discussion therefore engaged a total of five subchapters.

The exhibit was so popular, the hippos became the logo of the Toledo Zoo.|$|E
