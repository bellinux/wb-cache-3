5|$|English {{heraldry}} flourished as {{a working}} art up to around the 17th century, when it assumed a mainly ceremonial role. The Royal Arms <b>of</b> <b>England</b> continued to embody information relating to English history. Although the Acts of Union 1707 placed England within the Kingdom of Great Britain, prompting new, British Royal Arms, the Royal Arms <b>of</b> <b>England</b> are still used occasionally in an official capacity, and has continued to endure {{as one of the}} national symbols <b>of</b> <b>England,</b> and has a variety of active uses. For instance, the coats of arms of both The Football Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board have a design featuring three lions passant, based on the historic Royal Arms <b>of</b> <b>England.</b> In 1997 (and again in 2002), the Royal Mint issued a British one pound (£1) coin featuring three lions passant to represent England. To celebrate St George's Day, in 2001, Royal Mail issued first– and second-class postage stamps with the Royal Crest <b>of</b> <b>England</b> (a crowned lion), and the Royal Arms <b>of</b> <b>England</b> (three lions passant) respectively.|$|E
