5|$|The Canterbury Catch Club was {{a musical}} and social club which {{met in the}} city between 1779 and 1865. The club (male <b>only)</b> <b>met</b> weekly in the winter.

5|$|Because of the {{aforementioned}} entry restrictions, Manchester United had <b>only</b> <b>met</b> English opposition in Europe twice before, while Chelsea had far more experience against English opposition, having played 12 matches against compatriot clubs, winning five, drawing five and losing just two. There had been two previous Champions League finals between teams from the same country: in 2000, when Real Madrid beat fellow Spanish side Valencia 3–0 at the Stade de France; and in 2003, when Italian sides Milan and Juventus played out a 0–0 draw before Milan won 3–2 on penalties.|$|E
50|$|Zachry's poor season {{continued}} in New York, as {{he lost his}} first two decisions to fall to 3-9 combined. A four hit gem against the Montreal Expos on July 10 signaled a return to form for Zachry. Over {{the rest of the}} season, Zachry went 7-4 with a 3.53 ERA, and was the <b>only</b> <b>Mets</b> starting pitcher to post a winning record (7-6) besides Seaver (7-3).|$|R

5|$|For the {{majority}} of its history the area now recognised as the Rhondda Valley was an exclusively Welsh speaking area. It was only in the early 20th century that English began to supplant Welsh as the first language of social intercourse. In 1803, English historian Benjamin Heath Malkin mentioned while travelling through Ystradyfodwg, that he had <b>only</b> <b>met</b> one person with whom he could talk, and then {{with the help of an}} interpreter. This situation was repeated with John George Wood, who on his visit to the area complained of the awkwardness of understanding the particular dialects and idioms used by the native speakers, which were on times difficult for other Welsh speakers to understand. This dialect was once called 'tafodiaith gwŷr y Gloran' ('the dialect of the men of Gloran').|$|E
5|$|Manchester United and Bayern Munich had <b>only</b> <b>met</b> {{twice in}} {{competitive}} matches before the final, both meetings coming {{earlier in the}} 1998–99 season and both finished as draws. Manchester United's only other German opponents in their history were Borussia Dortmund, against whom they had an overall winning record, with three wins, two defeats and a draw in their six matches, including a 10–1 aggregate win {{in the second round}} of the 1964–65 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and a 2–0 aggregate defeat in the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League semi-finals. Bayern Munich had an equally narrow advantage in their 22 matches against English opposition, with seven wins, nine draws and six defeats, including a win over Leeds United in the 1975 European Cup Final and a defeat to Aston Villa in the 1982 final.|$|E

5|$|The M {{class was}} {{intended}} {{for use as a}} scout for the commerce raiding squadrons envisioned under Plan Z. The ships design process started in 1936; the ships were intended for long-range commerce raiding. They were an improvement over previous designs, which suffered from insufficient range to be effective commerce raiders. However, the requirements placed on the designhigh maximum and cruising speeds, long range, heavy armament, and armor sufficient to withstand 15cm shells, all on a displacement no more than 8,000metric tonswere deemed impossible by the design staff. In July 1937, the Oberbefehlshaber der Marine (commander in chief of the navy) requested proposals from both the naval design staff as well as private dockyards. None of the designs by the dockyards were practical, and so the official design, which <b>only</b> <b>met</b> some of the requirements, was chosen.|$|E
5|$|Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is {{the leader}} of the Fireflies, a militia {{movement}} hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, to look out for her daughter, but Ellie <b>only</b> <b>met</b> her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to her would help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one is left to come after them.|$|E

Although she only formally adopted Bonifaciu in 1858, to solidify his claim to the Florescu estate, he grew up knowing that the exiled Bălcescu was his father.

The Cretan assembly had few powers and <b>only</b> <b>met</b> once every two years. Moreover, ministers were in fact counselors to the prince, who alone could approve laws.|$|E
