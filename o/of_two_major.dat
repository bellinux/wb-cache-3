5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies. Samples of each of these compositions were recovered in one or both <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> surface units of the Apollo 14 landing site within Fra Mauro: the immediate impact blanket of Cone crater, about 25 million years old, and surrounding older terrain.|$|E
5|$|Easy is {{the most}} recent major {{hurricane}} to strike the Homosassa, Florida, area.

Hurricane Easy was one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> hurricanes to strike Florida during the year; the other was Hurricane King which affected Miami.|$|E

5|$|Inertial {{confinement}} fusionis one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> {{lines of}} fusion power development, the other being magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), notably the tokamak concept {{which is being}} built in a major experimental system known as ITER. Magnetic confinement is widely {{considered to be the}} superior approach, and has seen significantly greater development activity over the decades. However, there are serious concerns that the MCF approach of ITER cannot ever become economically practical.|$|E
5|$|Mustering is a {{labour-intensive}} {{process that}} results in one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> outcomes: slaughter for sale, or relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the modern Pawnee people were not a single unified tribe. At {{the middle of the}} 18th century, they consisted <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> groups. The Skidis, or Wolf Pawnees, had migrated northward with the Arikaras, and had probably been in Nebraska since 1600 or earlier. By the beginning of the 18th century, they were established on the Loup River, which flows through central Nebraska into the Platte River from the north.|$|E

5|$|Albany {{also has}} {{significant}} history with rail transport, as the location <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> regional railroad headquarters. The Delaware and Hudson Railway was headquartered in Albany {{at what is}} now the SUNY System Administration Building. In 1853, Erastus Corning, a noted industrialist and Albany's mayor from 1834 to 1837, consolidated ten railroads stretching from Albany to Buffalo into the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR), headquartered in Albany until Cornelius Vanderbilt moved it to New York City in 1867. One of the ten companies that formed the NYCRR was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, which was the first railroad in the state and the first successful steam railroad running regularly scheduled service in the country.|$|E
5|$|Built by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR), Oroville Dam {{is one of}} the key {{features}} of the California State Water Project (SWP), one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> projects passed that set up California's statewide water system. Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant, then the country's largest underground power station.|$|E

The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian, the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups, Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{there were}} 50injuries in the state, {{as well as}} at least three deaths. Two of them– a woman in West Hollywood, Florida and a man in Hallandale– were killed when their houses {{collapsed}} from the strong winds. The third death occurred in Sanford when a boy drowned in a flooded stream. There were also unconfirmed reports of a fourth person drowning when his boat capsized west of Bunnell. The hurricane was one <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> hurricanes– a Category3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson scale– to hit the state in 1950. It was the first time on record that two storms of such intensity hit Florida in the same year, and has only been repeated since in 2004 with hurricanes Charley and Jeanne, and in 2005 with hurricanes Dennis and Wilma.|$|E
5|$|Proteins are {{essential}} to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from amino acid building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. Protein synthesis consists <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> steps: transcription and translation.|$|E

On the field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a 3D representation of an area, {{in which the}} player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E

On the field map, character interactions between the party can also be viewed {{in the form of}} a sketch story; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a 3D representation of an area in which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs.|$|E
5|$|The Battles of Latrun were {{a series}} of {{military}} engagements between the Israel Defense Forces and the Jordanian Arab Legion {{on the outskirts of}} Latrun between 25 May and 18 July 1948, during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Latrun takes its name from the monastery close to the junction <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>major</b> highways: Jerusalem to Jaffa/Tel Aviv and Gaza to Ramallah. During the British Mandate it became a Palestine Police base with a Tegart fort. The United Nations Resolution 181 placed this area within the proposed Arab state. In May 1948, it was {{under the control of the}} Arab Legion. It commanded the only road linking the Yishuv-controlled area of Jerusalem to Israel, giving Latrun strategic importance in the battle for Jerusalem.|$|E
