The ground, on which these blocks are laid, is beat solid, and the stones are also beat down, after being laid, so as to give them all the solidity possible.

40|$|A {{numerical}} model of primary clarifiers performance, emphasizing {{the prediction of}} both the velocity field {{and the distribution of}} particulate concentration is presented in this dissertation. The model is restricted to those mean steady flows which are isothermal, neutral density, operating at low concentration and nearly two-dimensional. The simulation is for either rectangular or circular basins. The simulation requires a hydrodynamic submodel and a transport submodel. The hydrodynamic submodel employs the Strip Integral Method (SIM) to solve the governing differential equations of motion and continuity. This method is an improvement <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> flow models in that it can reproduce the principle features of the flow such as the boundary layer and recirculation. It has an advantage over the finite element and the finite difference models since it requires relatively low computer storage and computational time. This is particularly important if the model is to be implemented on a micro-computer. The SIM assumes a dominant flow direction. Velocity shape functions are used to reduce the equations of motion and continuity to a set of simultaneous ordinary equations in terms of preselected parameters in the dominant independent variable. A modified mixing length approach was applied to obtain the turbulent shear in the mixing zone. The hydrodynamic submodel was calibrated using measured velocity distributions in physical models. The model was also verified by comparing its results with other tests that were not used in the calibration. The SIM was also used to solve the transport equation. The transport submodel was verified by comparing the results with similar work of other researchers. The model was used to simulate the primary clarifiers used at the cities of Windsor, and Sarnia, Ontario. The predicted removal efficiency agreed well with the measured values. As an application to the model, it was used to simulate the removal of non-uniform size discrete suspension. It was also used to improve the design of the inlet to the tank. The hydrodynamic submodel was used to modify Camp 2 ̆ 7 s theoretical solution for solids removal in turbulent flow. It was also used to simulate the internal flow structure of a submerged hydraulic jump. The computation time for the model was 50 to 65 secs CPU time on an IBM 3031.

25|$|Traditional {{spark plugs}} {{need to be}} {{indented}} into {{the walls of the}} combustion chamber to enable the apex of the rotor to sweep past. As the rotor's apex seals pass <b>over</b> <b>the</b> spark <b>plug</b> hole, a small amount of compressed charge can be lost from the charge chamber to the exhaust chamber, entailing fuel in the exhaust, reducing efficiency, and resulting in higher emissions. These points may be overcome by using laser ignition, eliminating traditional spark <b>plugs</b> and removing <b>the</b> narrow slit in the motor housing so the rotor apex seals can fully sweep with no loss of compression from adjacent chambers. This concept has a precedent in <b>the</b> glow <b>plug</b> used by Toyota (SAE paper 790435), and the SAE paper 930680, by D. Hixon et al., on 'Catalytic Glow <b>Plugs</b> in <b>the</b> JDTI Stratified Charge Rotary Engine'. <b>The</b> laser <b>plug</b> can fire its spark through the narrow slit. Laser spark plugs can also fire deep into the combustion chamber using multiple sparks. Direct fuel injection, to which the Wankel engine is suited, combined with laser ignition in single or multiple laser plugs, has been shown to enhance the motor even further reducing the disadvantages.|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of movement activities and alternative fitting procedures on protection levels afforded by four hearing pro-tection devices (HPDs). Psychophysical attenuation measurements at nine one-third-octave bands from 125 to 8000 Hz were obtained prior to, during, and fol-lowing a 2 -hr wearing stint that included periods of either highly kinematic but controlled work activity or vigorous temporomandibular movement. The 40 sub-jects, who were nonusers of HPDs, initially fit the protectors according to either the instructions on the package (i. e., subject fit) or after receiving interactive train-ing on proper fit (i. e., trained fit). Thereafter no further protector adjustments were allowed during the wearing period. The subject-fit condition resulted in signifi-cantly lower protection levels, from 4 to 14 dB, at 1000 Hz and below for a pre-molded polymer earplug, a user-molded foam earplug, and a double protector consisting of a muff <b>over</b> <b>the</b> foam <b>plug.</b> <b>The</b> muff alone was significantly more resilient to fitting effects on attenuation than were <b>the</b> <b>plugs.</b> Movement activity caused up to a 6 -dB significant reduction in frequency-specific attenuation <b>over</b> time for <b>the</b> premolded <b>plug,</b> muff, and muff-plug combination. The compliant foam earplug was largely resistant to either type of movement effect but did ben-efit more than the other devices from use of the trained-fit procedure.

40|$|National audienceResearch has {{demonstrated}} that the implementation of hearing protectors to prevent noise-induced hearing loss merits from individual verification at the workfloor. Therefore, the MIRE (Microphone In Real Ear) technique has been adapted for custom-made earplugs with an inner bore drilled <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>plug's</b> total length. So a microphone can be inserted to measure via this test bore the sound pressure level behind the hearing protector. The measurement setup appears to be practically feasible, but a clear discrepancy is expected between the sound pressure level at the microphone {{and the level of}} interest at the eardrum. To gain insight into this difference - henceforth called transfer function - research has first been conducted with a HATS (Head And Torso Simulator) equipped with the custom-made earplugs. More concrete, the transfer function between the sound pressure at the HATS "eardrum" and the MIRE microphone has been measured and numerically simulated with the FDTD approach (Finite-Difference Time-Domain). The transfer functions appear to be stable and reproducible, moreover their most distinct characteristics can be traced down to the main acoustical features of earplug and ear canal. Further the influence of an individual's specific geometry of the earplug - ear canal complex on the transfer functions has been addressed by performing measurement and simulations with human subjects similar to the research conducted with the HATS. The concordance between individualized simulations and measurements is very satisfying, but the computational cost of the FDTD technique is too large to be implemented in measurement equipment used to test hearing protectors at the workfloor. Therefore a filter approach has been developed based on the FDTD model. The filter transfer functions show good resemblance with the original measurements and simulations if the length of the test bore and of the residual part of the ear canal are taken into account...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} cell proliferation in platelet-enriched collagen plugs with and without addition of amniotic fluid-derived heterologous foetal cells to seal an iatrogenic membrane defect in the foetal rabbit model. METHODS: Amniotic fluid cells were harvested from three donor does at 23 days of gestation (term = 32 days) and labelled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE). In 42 other does, foetal membrane defects were induced by foetoscopic needle puncture at 23 days of gestation, and closed with either a platelet-enriched collagen plug with (n = 44) or without (n = 32) amniotic fluid cells. At 30 days of gestation, the defects were harvested and assessed microscopically. RESULTS: <b>The</b> <b>plugs</b> enriched with heterologous amniotic fluid cells more commonly had proliferating cells in the centre of <b>the</b> <b>plug</b> than those without cell addition. CFDA-SE labelling confirmed the presence of heterologous amniotic fluid cells <b>over</b> <b>the</b> entire membrane <b>plug.</b> Cell typing showed a mixture of fibroblasts and epithelial cells at the wound edges, whereas in the centre, there was an abundance of fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: When sealing iatrogenic membrane defects in the foetal rabbit model, enrichment of collagen plugs with platelets and amniotic fluid-derived heterologous foetal cells increases local cell proliferation. status: publishe...|$|R
