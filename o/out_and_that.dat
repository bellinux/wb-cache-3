Later that month, while Van der Sloot and his father were in New York City {{for an interview with}} ABC's Primetime, they were served with a lawsuit filed by Natalee's parents, Beth and Dave Holloway, alleging personal injury; the case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds that August.|$|E
5|$|The Charlemagne-class ships did not {{function}} {{well in a}} head sea. Stormy weather in the Bay of Biscay in 1900 caused the captain of Gaulois to complain that the ship's forward gun turret and casemates were flooded <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the ship generated enormous sheets of spray when water came over the bow. Like most French capital ships of the period, they had pronounced tumblehome. Gauloiss captain also said that his ship was a steady gunnery platform and manoeuvered well in tight spaces but he criticized the armour layout as not high enough to prevent munitions from penetrating above the main armour belt and detonating below the secondary armament positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} led {{to major}} changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> radio equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock. An International Ice Patrol {{was set up to}} monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.|$|E

5|$|It {{was planned}} to launch four {{satellites}} in December 1962. However, before the launches could take place, then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara cancelled the program, due to concerns {{that it would}} not be able to operate if a full scale nuclear war broke <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> only a small number of SAINTs could be launched at a time. The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet satellites was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their satellites, that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, or if it sensed that it was being scanned. The standard American military reconnaissance satellite was capable of scanning other satellites long range, along with ground based detection of satellites.|$|E
5|$|Some historians, such as Chandler and Weller, {{assert that}} the British heavy cavalry were {{destroyed}} as a viable force following their first, epic charge. Barbero states that the Scots Grey were practically wiped <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the other two regiments of the Union Brigade suffered comparable losses. Other historians, such as Clark-Kennedy and Wood, citing British eyewitness accounts, describe the continuing role of the heavy cavalry after their charge. The heavy brigades, far from being ineffective, continued to provide valuable services. They countercharged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades), halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only), were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades). This service was rendered {{at a very high}} cost, as close combat with French cavalry, carbine fire, infantry musketry and—more deadly than all of these—artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades. At 6 o'clock in the afternoon the whole Union Brigade could field only 3 squadrons, though these countercharged French cavalry, losing half their number in the process. At the end of the fighting the two brigades, by this time combined, could muster one squadron.|$|E
5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site of the helicopter being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E

5|$|The sixth {{line into}} Preston {{was that of}} the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line {{immediately}} south of Farrington Station (respelt “Farington” from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the East Lancashire Railway (ELR) on 3 August 1846. Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own line into Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the Ribble (which later became the dividing line between Avenham and Miller Parks) be ornamentally laid <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> a pedestrian path (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built {{on the east side of}} the North Union station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station. The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} May, the {{government}} replaced Kuhn with Lanther, who immediately announced a prohibition on openly bearing arms. At the same time, he also announced {{that the value of}} the remaining feudal titles would be bought <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> this process was to be completed by January 1803. While such a buy-out would in practice abolish those titles and the associated taxes, it remained unclear whether the buying back was to be done by the canton, or the peasants. Because of the lack of clarity, the countryside remained agitated, and over the following weeks, {{the government}} enjoined Lanther to clamp down firmly on the population.|$|E

Tōjō argued that yielding to the American demand to withdraw troops would wipe out all the gains of the Second Sino-Japanese War, depress Army morale, endanger Manchukuo and jeopardize control of Korea; hence, doing nothing {{was the same as}} defeat and a loss of face.|$|E
25|$|In 1977 {{that was}} also changed by Prabhupada, and even the {{function}} of the second initiation was delegated to a few selected disciples.

25|$|Contractors Noel Fitzpatrick {{working for}} British Waterways managed {{to reopen the}} road {{within a week of}} the breach occurring. British Waterways {{announced}} on 5 November 2007 that a 16-mile (26km) stretch of the canal from Llanover to Llangynidr would be drained completely, so that a full inspection of the canal structure could be carried out. They stated that they were working with boat owners to move all boats to parts of the canal which would not be affected by this drainage, but that the towpath would remain open during this phase. Subsequently, they announced that a full geotechnical survey would be carried <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> they expected the stretch to be closed for up to a year.
