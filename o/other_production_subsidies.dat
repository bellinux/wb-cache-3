The majority of the feedstock for this ethanol is corn grain. The use of crop residues and perennial grasses has been proposed as an alternative feedstock for ethanol production using cellulosic conversion processes. Commercial scale production of cellulosic ethanol is still on the horizon. In the meantime a wide variety of studies examining both the technical and economic feasibility of cellulosic ethanol production have been conducted. This is the first study that combines both county level cellulosic feedstock production and farmer participation rates to determine the feasibility of supplying it to cellulosic ethanol plants. This research determines the economic feasibility of supplying cellulosic feedstocks to seven potential add-on cellulosic ethanol plants of 25 million gallons per year at seven existing starch ethanol plants in Kansas. The feedstocks considered are corn stover, sorghum stalks, wheat straw, and perennial switchgrass. A mixed integer programing model determines the amount and mix of cellulosic feedstocks that can be delivered to these plants over a range of plant-gate feedstock prices given transportation costs and farm-gate production costs or breakeven prices. The variable costs of shipping are subtracted from the difference between plant-gate price and farm-gate price to find savings to the plant. The objective function of the model minimizes transportation costs which in turn maximizes savings to the plant. The role switchgrass may have as a feedstock given various switchgrass production subsidies is examined. The results indicate the minimum plant-gate price that must be paid to feedstock producers for all plants to have enough cellulosic feedstocks is $ 75 per dry ton. Switchgrass feedstocks were only a minor portion of biomass supplied and used without a production subsidy. A Biomass Crop Assistance Program payment increased the supply of switchgrass more than <b>other</b> <b>production</b> <b>subsidies...</b>|$|E

Yeh (1971) has shown that if the country is large, a tari will be superior to a <b>production</b> <b>subsidy,</b> assuming that the level of support required for the import competing industry is not greater than the one needed when the optimum tari is in operation. Maintaining the hypothesis that exporters do not react to importing country policies, the paper shows that tari s and subsidies can always be ordered.

40|$|The Common Market Organisation (CMO) for {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} products is currently evaluated by the European Commission. The evaluation {{may lead to a}} reform of the CMO. One of the elements under debate is the <b>production</b> <b>subsidy</b> for processing tomatoes. The processing tomato sector is one of most heavily subsidized sectors in primary production of {{fruit and vegetable}}s. The current <b>production</b> <b>subsidy</b> equals approximately 50 % of producer turnover. This paper evaluates two possible reforms of the processing tomato supply chain: (1) an abolishment of the <b>production</b> <b>subsidy</b> and (2) a replacement of the <b>production</b> <b>subsidy</b> by area payments (decoupling). The evaluation focuses on the impact the reform may have on production and trade patterns of fruits and vegetables in Europe. On the basis of a simulation model, the paper argues that in the first scenario production will shift in the Mediterranean from processing tomatoes and extensive crop production in general towards fruit and fruit vegetables. The abolishment of the <b>production</b> <b>subsidy</b> will lead to a production shift in the direction in which Mediterranean countries have a comparative advantage. In the second scenario, Mediterranean production will remain stuck in extensive crop production: processing tomatoes, extensive vegetables and arable crops. In the first scenario, Mediterranean countries will crowd out North European fruit production. As a result, North European production shifts towards vegetable production. In the second scenario, the impact on North Europe is negligible. International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

Over time, low cost exporters gain market share from the swing supplier, which further attenuates the market response to subsidy elimination.

40|$|We utilize a two-good, two-period intertemporal {{framework}} {{to examine the}} effects of terms of trade improvement on a small economy. A temporary terms of trade improvement in the current period increases the real GDP in the current period—total welfare and welfare within each period rise by the net wealth effect and the net intertemporal effect. The rise in GDP is more than consumption in the current period, leading to a balance of trade improvement in the current period. ^ We modify this two-period {{framework to}} analyze the effects of export and <b>production</b> <b>subsidies</b> on a small open economy. In the absence of investment, a temporary subsidy in the current period leads to a welfare loss as well as a balance of trade deterioration in the current period. A temporary subsidy in the current period, by bringing in production distortions, reduces GDP in the current period. The resulting welfare loss is distributed between two periods. Since GDP falls more than consumption, the balance of trade deteriorates in the current period. A temporary export subsidy, compared to a <b>production</b> <b>subsidy,</b> in the current period leads to a lower welfare level, higher exports, and a smaller balance of trade deterioration in the current period. ^ We utilize a two-good infinite horizon model to compare the effects of export and <b>production</b> <b>subsidies</b> on a small open economy, in presence of investment. A permanent subsidy permanently raises capital stock—the net foreign assets fall in order to finance investment. A permanent subsidy raises net output and welfare through capital formation and the lowering of installation costs of investment, but lowers welfare by creating distortions—the net effect on welfare is ambiguous. A permanent export subsidy, compared to a permanent <b>production</b> <b>subsidy,</b> introduces an additional distortion by raising the domestic installation costs of investment—consequently, the rise in the capital stock and level of the net foreign assets, are lower in case of a permanent export <b>subsidy.</b> A temporary <b>production</b> <b>subsidy</b> always induces initial investment—however, a minimum level or duration of export subsidy is necessary to spur initial investment.

Retaliation will be modelled as a multistage game. At the first stage, the foreign country sets its export subsidy to maximise national welfare.

There is usually no profit shifting argument for an export subsidy when the foreign country faces retaliation with countervailing tariffs. When the domestic country uses a tariff and a <b>production</b> <b>subsidy</b> in response to a foreign export subsidy, then the surprising result is that an export subsidy may increase foreign welfare.

40|$|This paper uses {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models {{to assess the}} efficiency impacts of agricultural policies in a second-best setting with pre-existing distortionary taxes. We analyze <b>production</b> <b>subsidies,</b> <b>production</b> quotas, acreage controls, subsidies for acreage reductions and lump sum transfers to agricultural producers. We find that pre-existing taxes raise the cost of all these policies and by a substantial amount. Under our central estimates this increase in cost is typically at least 100 - 200 percent. Two effects underlie these results. First, raising the rates of distortionary taxes to finance subsidy policies leads to additional efficiency losses. Second, policies that raise (lower) the costs of producing agricultural output lead to a reduction (increase) in the economy-wide level of employment. This implies an efficiency loss (gain) in the labor market, which is distorted by taxes. The latter effect is not incorporated in earlier studies. Consequently, previous studies have significantly overstated the costs of <b>production</b> <b>subsidies</b> and understated the costs of production quotas, acreage controls and subsidies for acreage reductions. ...|$|R

However, when monopolistic distortions are corrected, terms of trade effects dominate the choice of trade policy and lead to an import subsidy (an export tax) ...|$|R
