50|$|The Palestine sunbird or {{northern}} <b>orange-tufted</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris osea) {{is a small}} passerine bird of the sunbird family {{which is}} found {{in parts of the}} Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa. It is also known as <b>orange-tufted</b> <b>sunbird,</b> a name which is also used for the similar <b>orange-tufted</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Cinnyris bouvieri), found further south in Africa. It is the national bird of Palestine.|$|E

40|$|In a {{study of}} male song in the <b>orange-tufted</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Nectarinia osea) in an urban neighbor-hood in Ramat-Aviv, Israel, we {{discovered}} the occurrence of song variation on a microgeo-graphic scale {{in the form of}} two distinct dialects with a sharp boundary between them. The main distinction between the two song dialects is the frequency of the trill, which comprises the terminal part of the song. A large difference of 2 - 3 kHz in the peak frequency of the trill was discovered between the two dialects, which could be easily distinguished by ear. Thirty-sevenmales were recorded singing the ‘low ’ dialect and 21 birds sang the ‘high ’ dialect. Four other birds sang both dialects or ‘hybrid ’ songs. Along the boundary that separated the two dialect populations, neighboring birds sang different dialect songs, although they were only 20 - 30 meters apart. All four ‘bilingual ’ birds occupied territories near the dialect boundary. The historical processes leading to the formation of this dialect system may result from the pattern of human settlement {{at the time of the}} establishment of this neighborhood in the early 1950 ’s. The spatial distribution of the two sunbird dialect populations, and the apparent low dispersal rates of birds from their natal dialect area, suggest the existence of a mechanism, which currentlymaintains these dialects at the current boundaries. 2) Corresponding author...|$|E
40|$|Territorial {{behavior}} of the <b>orange-tufted</b> <b>sunbird</b> (Nectarinia osea Bonaparte) was studied {{in a suburb of}} Tel Aviv. Both male and female orange-tufted sunbirds occupied and guarded their territory throughout the year, but did so at different intensities in relation to season and fertility stages. When they were in the territory, both sexes spent most of their time at its center, and more so during the breeding season. Throughout the year, males tended to perch in exposed locations, while females spent 90 % of their time in concealed loca-tions. Males were also much more vocal than females, and during the breeding season they sang from high places, which females never did. It is suggested that occupying a territory during autumn may increase the chances of the territory’s owners continuing to occupy it during the breeding season. Territories were also defended and advertised during the breeding season, with the female fertility stage having a significant effect on the {{behavior of}} her male partner, whose presence in the territory and occupancy of its center and exposed locations reached their peak. Male vocality, particularly singing rate, also reached its peak during the fertility stage, and decreased thereafter. These behaviors may indicate that during the pre-fertility and fertility stages, males guard their females, presumably in an attempt to prevent extra-pair copula-tions. On the other hand, the distance between male and female did not change in relation to the female fertility stage, and when resident males were re-moved, intrusion by non-resident females was higher than by males. These results suggest that territorial behavior during the breeding season functions to defend territory against male and female floaters...|$|E
