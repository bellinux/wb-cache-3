40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} at Kg Ko'ol Lata Janggut. The objective of this experiment is to study the influence {{of different types of}} sucker (crown and water) on growth and development of banana Musa acuminata cv. Berangan. Two types of sucker were chosen at En. Hashim farm at Kg Ko'ol Lata Janggut under two sucker treatment with 10 replications. Growth parameters were measured starting first days plants was choosing. The growth parameters that were measured are plant height (cm), number <b>of</b> <b>leaves,</b> length <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> (cm), width <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> (cm) and plant girth (cm). The result shows that that the number <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> per plant, the length <b>of</b> <b>leaves,</b> the width <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> and the plant girth were significantly different in different sucker types. Plant height showed no significant difference with the different sucker types.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{recognize}} plant species from their shapes, shapes <b>of</b> contours <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> can be used. However, contours <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> are complicated and have variations. In order {{to deal with}} the complexities and variations <b>of</b> contours <b>of</b> <b>leaves,</b> a hierarchical representation <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> is presented in this paper. First, global structures and shapes <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> are represented by polygons whose vertices are critical points of curvature of smoothed contours <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> Second, detailed shapes of mid-most pieces are represented by linear approximation of the contours of pieces. Last, teeth on the contour <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> are represented by triangles. Such triangles are detected from contours that are not smoothed enough to remove teeth. Features at each hierarchy are represented statistically. Such a hierarchical representation is more powerful than previous methods that represent only global structures <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> ...|$|R

The results obtained {{indicated that the}} ethanol extract <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> SM is a good adsorption inhibitor for the corrosion of mild steel in HCl solution. The inhibition efficiency of ethanol extracts <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> SM was found to increase with increasing temperature. The adsorption of the ethanol extracts <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> SM on mild steel surface is exothermic, spontaneous and is best described by the Langmuir adsorption model. The values of activation and free energies obtained were within the range limits expected for the mechanism of physical adsorption. Quantum chemical calculations revealed that the active constituents of ethanol extracts <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> SM are carotene, nicotinic acid, ascorbic acid and riboflavin and that the order for their inhibition potentials is thiamine>β-carotene> riboflavin> ascorbic acid> nicotinic acid. Examination of the FTIR spectra of the corrosion products of mild steel and that of ethanol extracts <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> SM before and after adsorption indicated that the adsorption of the inhibitor is enhanced by the aromatic and C=C in β-carotene and –OH bonds in thiamine, riboflavin, ascorbic acid and nicotinic acid...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the correlation between pollen viability, germination and the morphological traits, 15 Saintpaulia genotypes were analysed. Pollen viability was obtained by staining with potassium iodide (25 %) and germination was estimated using solid nutrient medium (15 % sucrose, 85 % humidity, 22 °C temperature). Several morphological traits such as number of flowers, diameter <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> rosette, number <b>of</b> <b>leaves,</b> length and width <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> and petiole length were evaluated to determine growth indices. The results obtained indicated that ‘Hot Pink Bell’ genotype achieved {{the highest number of}} flowers and the largest diameter <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> rosette. Genotypes ‘Tomahawks’ and S. grotei recorded the highest number <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> Higher width <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> values was obtained in ‘Aloha Orchid’, while genotype ‘Park Avenue Blue’ was noted for a high length <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> Positive correlations were recorded among viability and germination in S. jonantha, S. rupicola and S. grotei. Significant positive correlation was registered between pollen viability and the number of flowers, but also between germination and the number of flowers per plant.

40|$|Masters Thesis {{completed}} in 1987 by P. M. Kotanen at the University of Toronto. Supervised by Dr. R. L. Jefferies. SUMMARY: 1. The responses to herbivory of above-ground organs of the sedges Carex subspathaces and Carex X flavicans were investigated at La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba. Demographic techniques {{were used to}} compare the production and turnover <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> and shoots and the elongation <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> between plants <b>of</b> swards on which lesser snow Geese fed and plants of swards from which geese were excluded. The effects of herbivory on the shoot demography of carex aquatilis were also studied. 2. Patterns of foraging by the geese varied seasonally. Following their arrival at La Pérouse Bay, the geese fed by pulling shoots of carices and by grubbing the roots and rhizomes of graminoids. After the hatch of the goslings, the geese fed by clipping the <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> grasses and sedges. 3. Within one summer, gazing increased the cumulative production <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> Carex subspathaceaand of Carex X flavcas. Though the geese removed few <b>leaves,</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> shoots of both species in grazed plots had shorter lifespans than <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> shoots in ungrazed plots. Grazing also increased the total number <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> per shoot which died during the growing season. 4. The rates <b>of</b> elongation <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> shoots of Carex subspathacea and Carex X flavicans in grazed plots did not consistently differ from the rates <b>of</b> elongation <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> shoots in ungrazed plots. 5. Herbivory by geese did not consistently alter the production of shoots of Carex aquatilis, Carex subspathacea, or Carex X flavicans. 6. The increased production <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> is the primary response of above-ground organs of these carices to herbivory by geese. The unresponsiveness of shoot production suggests that these carices are more vulnerable to damage from the loss of shoots than from the clipping <b>of</b> <b>leaves...</b>|$|R
