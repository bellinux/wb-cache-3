5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> water, decreases the number <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change on {{agriculture}} will be diverse and complex. Some important qualitative conclusions emerge from the literature. First, it is important to focus on the rate at which climate changes and the capacity of farmers to adjust, rather than on absolute changes in temperature. Second, given that significant warming is inevitable, it is important to focus on the marginal effects of feasible changes in the rate <b>of</b> <b>warming,</b> rather than on the aggregate rate <b>of</b> <b>warming.</b> With a convex damage function, the expected marginal cost <b>of</b> <b>warming</b> may be large even when aggregate damage, given the expected rate <b>of</b> <b>warming,</b> is close to zero. Third, uncertainty is crucial and remains poorly understood. In particular, modelling of low-probability catastrophic outcomes remains very limited. Finally, it seems likely that global climate change will enhance extremes of all kinds. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa behind Hurricane Luis on August 31. Strong outflow from Luis prevented development of the wave, and it continued westward until crossing into the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 12.

Based on the development of a low-level circulation, it is estimated the system organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on September 16 while located around 290miles (465km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico.

5|$|As river {{development}} {{continued in}} the 20thcentury, each of these major fishing sites was flooded by a dam, beginning with Cascades Rapids in 1938.

5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence <b>of</b> <b>warm</b> air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, {{in the form of a}} visible condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
