5|$|Radioactive samarium-153 is a {{beta emitter}} with a {{half-life}} of 46.3 hours. It {{is used to}} kill cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and <b>osteosarcoma.</b> For this purpose, samarium-153 is chelated with ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP) and injected intravenously. The chelation prevents accumulation of radioactive samarium in the body that would result in excessive irradiation and generation of new cancer cells. The corresponding drug has several names including samarium (153Sm) lexidronam; its trade name is Quadramet.|$|E
5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug samarium (153Sm) lexidronam (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and <b>osteosarcoma.</b> Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation {{and is one of the}} important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.|$|E

40|$|Tumour grading assesses {{biological}} aggressiveness and is of prognostic {{significance in}} many malignancies. The clinicopathological features of 140 primary canine <b>osteosarcomas</b> and their metastases were analysed, and the interrelations {{between them and}} an established grading system and its constituent parameters (mitotic index, necrosis, pleomorphism) were examined. Of these tumours, 35 % were grade III (high-grade), 37 % grade II and 28 % grade I. Primary tumours that had metastasized were of significantly higher grade than non-metastatic <b>osteosarcomas.</b> <b>Osteosarcomas</b> belonging to the osteoblastic minimally productive subtype, but not chondroblastic or telangiectatic subtypes, differed from fibroblastic <b>osteosarcomas</b> in being associated with a significantly higher number of high-grade cases. Dogs younger than 4 years of age had <b>osteosarcomas</b> with higher grade, score and mitotic index than did older animals. Appendicular differed from axial tumours in having a higher mitotic index; distal differed from proximal tumours in being of higher grade; cranial tumours differed from tumours in most other sites in being of lower grade and lower mitotic index. Rib <b>osteosarcomas</b> showed a particularly high degree of necrosis. The mitotic index varied widely between tumour locations. Pleomorphism did not have prognostic merit when examined separately, as most <b>osteosarcomas</b> were highly pleomorphic. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Mice of a {{transgenic}} mouse lineage 501, produced by zygotic injection of the parotid alpha-amylase promoter-SV 40 T-antigen hybrid gene, developed <b>osteosarcomas</b> at about 15 months of age. The tumors predominantly involved the axial skeleton, were sometimes multiple, and metastasized to the liver. A cell line {{derived from a}} primary tumor produced <b>osteosarcomas</b> on transfer to nude mice. The 501 transgenic lineage thus provides a valuable new model for studying the histogenesis of <b>osteosarcomas...</b>|$|R
5|$|On November 12, 1976, as Fox {{was driving}} to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed {{into the back of}} a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of {{basketball}} season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with <b>osteosarcoma,</b> a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require chemotherapy treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.|$|E
25|$|Stage I <b>osteosarcoma</b> is {{rare and}} {{includes}} parosteal <b>osteosarcoma</b> or low-grade central <b>osteosarcoma.</b> It {{has an excellent}} prognosis (>90%) with wide resection.|$|E

40|$|<b>Osteosarcomas</b> often suffer {{mutations}} of the RB (retinoblastoma) gene, with resultant inactivation of the pRb protein. pRb is {{one component}} in a cell-cycle control pathway {{that includes the}} p 16 (encoded by the CDKN 2 A gene) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk 4, encoded by the CDK 4 gene) proteins. We therefore sought {{to determine whether the}} CDKN 2 A and CDK 4 genes were altered in those <b>osteosarcomas</b> that lacked RB inactivation. Twenty-one <b>osteosarcomas</b> (2 low-grade and 19 high-grade) were evaluated for homozygous deletion of the CDKN 2 A gene, CDK 4 amplification, and allelic loss of the RB gene, as well as for expression of p 16 and pRb proteins. Five high-grade <b>osteosarcomas</b> showed loss of p 16 expression; four of these had homozygous CDKN 2 A deletions, and the fifth had a probable deletion obscured by numerous nonneoplastic, p 16 -immunopositive multinucleated giant cells. Thus, p 16 immunohistochemistry may provide a sensitive means for assessing CDKN 2 A status. Twelve tumors (including the two low-grade <b>osteosarcomas)</b> were immunopositive for pRb, and nine tumors were immunonegative for pRb. Of the five cases with CDKN 2 A/p 16 alterations, none had allelic loss of the RB gene and all expressed pRb, suggesting that each of these tumors had an intact RB gene. None of the tumors showed CDK 4 amplification. No alterations were detected in the two low-grade <b>osteosarcomas.</b> This study suggests that CDKN 2 A is a tumor suppressor inactivated in <b>osteosarcomas</b> that lack RB mutations and that the p 16 -pRb cell-cycle control pathway is deregulated in a large number of high-grade <b>osteosarcomas...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Currently, {{very few}} studies are {{available}} concerning the ă mammalian Hippo pathway in bone sarcomas. YAP/TAZ transcription ă co-activators are key downstream effectors of this pathway {{and may also}} ă have oncogenic properties. Additionally, recent in-vitro experiments ă showed that expression of beta 1 -integrin promoted metastasis in ă <b>osteosarcomas.</b> This study investigated the expression of YAP/TAZ and ă beta 1 -integrin in human <b>osteosarcomas.</b> ă Materials and methods: We performed automated immunohistochemistry on ă tissue-microarrays (TMA) in which 69 conventional <b>osteosarcomas</b> biopsies ă performed prior to chemotherapy were embedded. Cellular localization and ă semi-quantitative analysis of each immunostain was performed using ă Immunoreactive Score (IRS) and correlated to clinico-pathological data. ă Results: Cytoplasmic expression of beta 1 -integrin was noted in 54 / 59 ă <b>osteosarcomas</b> (92 %), with 33 / 59 cases (56 %) displaying membranous ă staining. YAP/TAZ was expressed in 27 / 45 <b>osteosarcomas</b> (60 %), with 14 ă cases (31 %) showing cytoplasmic expression while 13 other cases (28 %) ă displayed nuclear expression. No link was found between YAP/TAZ or beta ă 1 -integrin expression and response to chemotherapy. In univariate ă analysis, YAP/TAZ immunoreactive score was pejoratively correlated with ă overall survival (p = 0. 01). Expression of beta 1 -integrin on cell ă membrane was also pejorative for OS (p = 0. 045). In multivariate ă analysis, YAP/TAZ nuclear expression was an independent prognostic ă factor for PFS (p = 0. 035). ă Conclusion: this study indicates that beta 1 -integrin and YAP/TAZ ă proteins are linked to prognosis and therefore could be therapeutic ă targets in conventional <b>osteosarcomas...</b>|$|R

40|$|Expressions of p 53 protein, {{a product}} of the tumor {{suppressor}} gene were studied in <b>osteosarcomas</b> relating to various prognostic factors. Thirty-four <b>osteosarcomas</b> were investigated immunohistochemically with a monoclonal antibody clone PAb 240, which recognizes a common conformational epitope of mutant p 53 proteins and another clone PAb 1801, which reacts with both wild- and mutant-type p 53 proteins. The results were compared with expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki- 67 providing a simple method for the assessment of growth fractions of tumors. PAb 240 stained nuclei and cytoplasm of tumor cells in 8 of 34 <b>osteosarcomas</b> (23. 5 %), whereas PAb 1801 reacted in all 34 <b>osteosarcomas</b> (100 %). Fifteen tumors (44. 1 %) showed positivity for PAb 1801 in {{more than half of the}} tumor cells. Twelve patients were alive and thirteen were dead. Tumors from 9 patients (75 %) who survived revealed only focal positive immunoreactions with PAb 1801 and tumors from 6 patients (46. 1 %) who died revealed diffuse reactions. Twelve cases (35. 3 %) showed a high PCNA index (> 40 %) and fibroblastic <b>osteosarcomas</b> revealed the highest PCNA positivity. Twenty-two cases (64. 7 %) revealed a very low Ki- 67 index (less than 10 %) and Ki- 67 index showed a good correlation with PCNA positivity (r = 0. 6247).

40|$|AbstractThe gene hypermethylated {{in cancer}} 1 (HIC 1) is epigenetically inactivated, but not mutated, in cancer. Here {{we show that}} {{cooperative}} loss of Hic 1 with p 53, but not INK 4 a, yields distinct tumor phenotypes in mice. Germline deletion of one allele of each gene on the opposite chromosome yields breast and ovarian carcinomas and metastatic <b>osteosarcomas</b> with epigenetic inactivation of the wild-type Hic 1 allele. Germline deletion of the two genes on the same chromosome results in earlier appearance and increased prevalence and aggressiveness of <b>osteosarcomas</b> with genetic deletion of both wild-type genes. In human <b>osteosarcomas,</b> hypermethylation of HIC 1 is frequent only in tumors with p 53 mutations. Our results indicate the importance of genes altered only through epigenetic mechanisms in cancer progression in conjunction with genetically modified tumor suppressor genes...|$|R
