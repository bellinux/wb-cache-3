40|$|In this thesis, an {{automatic}} {{data acquisition system}} for spin-stand imaging and drive independent data recovery is developed. This system enables a user to perform data acquisition of on-track hard disk data by using a commercial spin-stand. At {{the heart of this}} system are the three techniques: the track-centering technique, the dynamic track-following technique and the servo-based track-following technique. By using the track-centering technique, we are able to efficiently make the center of the prewritten data tracks coincide with the rotational center of the spin-stand spindle so that the track eccentricity can be eliminated. Both the dynamic track-following and servo-based track-following techniques utilize a small piezoelectric actuator (PZT) as the micro-positioning device. The former is of an <b>open-loop</b> <b>controlling</b> scheme, and the desired tracking trajectory is extracted from the whole-track spin-stand images. The latter is of a closed-loop feedback control scheme, and the feedback signals are from the existing servo patterns on the disk. The former deals with PZT hysteresis by using a special algorithm based on the Preisach model while the approach taken by the latter is based on iterative compensation. By using the developed techniques, we are able to perform spin-stand microscopy on hard disks with longitudinal and perpendicular modes of recording taken from latest commercial hard disk drives (HDDs) with ultra-high areal densities (as high as 131. 5 Gbits/in 2). The automatic data acquisition system has been successfully applied to recover actual hard disk data from failed HDDs...|$|E
40|$|Based on the CubeSat {{framework}} of California Polytechnic State University {{this work is}} dedicated to data transmission from pico satellites towards a ground station. It is designed especially {{to be applied to}} COMPASS- 2, the second CubeSat of Aachen University of Applied Sciences (FH Aachen). First the existing ground stations of RWTH Aachen University and FH Aachen are analyzed. Calculating a link budget for the up- and downlink channel evaluates the chance of successful data communication. The transfer function of the commuication channel changes during a flyover. To take advantage of this fact, a multi-valued modulation scheme designed for ham radio equipment is developted from theoretical basics. The ground station will measure constantly the raw bit error rate during a flyover and send commands towards the satellite, which adapt the parameters of the modulations scheme in a optimal way to the actual SNR. Using a pseude-noise preamble the ground station can synchronize itself onto the clock of the satellite. The modulations schemes and the synchronization algorithm are verified by simulations. Possible channel codings like Turbo Codes are presentated. Their parameters are kept felxible. After the theoretical investigation a modular prototype is developted, built, mesasured and documentated. The design is based on the concept of software defined radios (SDR). This means that baseband is built up digitally by the means of a microcontroller. An analog-digital-converter followed by an anti-aliasing- filter in switched-capacitor technology generates the analog baseband signal. A programmable voltage-controlled crystal oscilator is set up to the desired transmit frequency in the 437 MHz band by the microcontroller. By modulating the frequency a FM signal is generated. The oscillator is followed by a preamplifier and a bandpass filter, lifting up the power level to fit the requirements of the final power amplifier. The maximum output power of 30 dBm can be reduced via an analog input by the microcontroller. As this is an <b>open-loop</b> <b>controlling</b> a directional coupler with small dimensions is developted. It measures the forward and reverse power on the antenna feeding line giving information about the actual output power and additionally benchmarking the antenna deploying mechanism. Finally the antennas used on COMPASS- 2 are presentated. Their characteristics are simulated taking into consideration the material parameters of the satellite’s structure...|$|E

We {{propose the}} general form of Kapitza’s {{effective}} potential method for a classical particle {{in the external}} filed of a rapidly changing <b>open-loop</b> <b>control</b> force with factorized dependency on the spatial and time coordinates. The result {{is illustrated by the}} application to stabilize the harmonic oscillator in non-trivial stable point. Key words: <b>open-loop</b> <b>control.</b> PACS: 05. 45. -a; 45. 80. +r The set of <b>open-loop</b> <b>control</b> methods is very wide and difficult to system-atize to compare with feedback control [1]. An important part of it is a sub-set of the methods based on the rapidly changing external forces [1, 2]. Here we generalize the famous Kapitzas effective potential method [3, 4] to the form allowing an arbitrary dependency of the <b>open-loop</b> <b>control</b> signal on the time, that includes the particular cases of harmonic modulation [3] and Fourier-expanded periodical modulation [5]. We apply the model of a classical particle with the mass m in two fields: one is a time-independent potential U, and another is rapidly changing <b>open-loop</b> <b>control</b> field f(x, t) with a characteristic time of changing T. For the simplicity we will discuss one-dimensional movement. As it has been shown in [3], the dynamical equations for the particle can be presented as a superposition x = X + ξ of the smooth motion X and the fas...|$|R

The described situation is intermediate relative to purely <b>open-loop</b> <b>control</b> and continuous measurement feedback control under uncertainty. The novelty of this paper lies in considering incomplete noisy measurements of the state space variable at points of correction rather than exact complete measurements of these.
