5|$|Among major {{structural}} elements used in poetry are the line, the stanza or verse paragraph, and larger combinations of stanzas or lines such as cantos.

5|$|He was not {{an elegant}} exponent. His normal {{language}} is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so.

Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.|$|E

His poetry, notably his elegiac poem Demeter, was highly respected by later ancient poets. However, almost all his work has since been lost.|$|E

5|$|Godwin had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} {{in language and}} communication (as is evident in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), {{and this was the}} topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> phrases also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, François Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et Idem, all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number <b>of</b> <b>words</b> <b>and</b> by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, dazzled by the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E

40|$|This {{graduation}} thesis {{deals with}} {{the interpretation of the}} nature <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> name found in the works of P. Florensky (1882 - 1937), the Russian philosopher, scientist and poet. The question <b>of</b> <b>word,</b> name <b>and</b> symbol was crucial for P. Florensky and all his works as well as for other important authors of the so called Russian religious and philosophical Renaissance, especially for V. F. Ern, S. N. Bulgakov and A. F. Losev. According to Florensky real cognition can only be achieved by means <b>of</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> symbol. To this issue Florensky also linked the question of correlation between a <b>word</b> <b>and</b> a thing, a man <b>and</b> a <b>word,</b> sacral terminology/denomination etc. Thus focus on the nature <b>of</b> <b>word</b> is vital for understanding P. Florensky's philosophy. The goal of this thesis is to outline the basic features of philosophic and theological understanding <b>of</b> name <b>and</b> <b>word</b> in Pavel Florensky's works, and also to define his cognition theory which is based on this way of thinking...|$|R
