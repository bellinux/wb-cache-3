5|$|A {{determination}} {{of whether or}} not the person has dehydration is an important part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment,</b> with dehydration typically divided into mild (3–5%), moderate (6–9%), and severe (≥10%) cases. In children, the most accurate signs of moderate or severe dehydration are a prolonged capillary refill, poor skin turgor, and abnormal breathing. Other useful findings (when used in combination) include sunken eyes, decreased activity, a lack of tears, and a dry mouth. A normal urinary output and oral fluid intake is reassuring. Laboratory testing is of little clinical benefit in determining the degree of dehydration. Thus the use of urine testing or ultrasounds is generally not needed.|$|E

5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment.</b> Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|By the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> {{process for}} the ten routes, two remained.

Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than {{to the rest of the}} drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|Background: With several {{assessments}} {{available that}} purport {{to measure the}} letter reversal rates of young school-aged children, the question was raised how reliable and comparable these assessments are {{and to what extent}} each <b>assessment</b> addresses <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> letter reversals? A systematic review of these assessments was performed to evaluate the measurement properties and administration guidelines, and to compare <b>the</b> reversal content <b>of</b> these assessments. Method: Relevant assessments and studies were identified through literature searches. For each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> <b>the</b> measurement properties, quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studies that report the measurement properties, and administration guidelines were evaluated, and <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> were compared. Results: Insufficient evidence existed for <b>the</b> measurement properties <b>of</b> all three <b>assessments.</b> None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>assessments</b> clearly explain to what extent they address <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> letter reversal. Due to the differences in design and scoring, comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results between <b>the</b> different <b>assessments</b> will be difficult. Conclusion: <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current <b>assessments</b> are questionable due to <b>the</b> low level <b>of</b> evidence supporting their measurement properties, and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> clarity surrounding <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> reversals and <b>the</b> underlying construct <b>the</b> <b>assessments</b> are measuring.

25|$|The CPSS scale assesses {{avoidance}} {{and change}} of activities, {{which may not}} accurately reflect pathology. This could possibly result in higher PTSD prevalence estimations. In a study, the CPSS scale correctly classified 72.2% of children. Nearly one-quarter of children were misclassified and 5.6% were misclassified (false negative). CPSS is a self-reporting assessment and is, therefore, subject to social desirability bias. Social desirability bias influences respondents to answer questions {{in a way that}} presents them more favorably to others. This interferes with the purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> and prevents clinicians from properly screening for PTSD.|$|E

The FDIC board voted to require insured banks to prepay $45 billion in premiums to replenish the fund. News media reported that the prepayment move would be inadequate to assure the financial stability of the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC elected to request the prepayment so that the banks could recognize the expense over three years, instead of drawing down banks' statutory capital abruptly, at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment.</b>|$|E

25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment.</b> The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different from what they are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E
25|$|The Domesday survey {{therefore}} {{recorded the}} names of the new holders of lands and the assessments on which their tax was to be paid. But it did more than this; by the king's instructions, it endeavoured to make a national valuation list, estimating the annual value of all the land in the country, (1) at the time of Edward the Confessor's death, (2) when the new owners received it, (3) {{at the time of the}} survey, and further, it reckoned, by command, the potential value as well. It is evident that William desired to know the financial resources of his kingdom, and it is probable that he wished to compare them with the existing assessment, which was one of considerable antiquity, though there are traces that it had been occasionally modified. The great bulk of Domesday Book is devoted to the somewhat arid details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> and valuation of rural estates, which were as yet the only important source of national wealth. After stating the assessment of the manor, the record sets forth the amount of arable land, and the number of plough teams (each reckoned at eight oxen) available for working it, with the additional number (if any) that might be employed; then the river-meadows, woodland, pasture, fisheries (i.e. fishing weirs), water-mills, salt-pans (if by the sea) and other subsidiary sources of revenue; the peasants are enumerated in their several classes; and finally the annual value of the whole, past and present, is roughly estimated.|$|E
