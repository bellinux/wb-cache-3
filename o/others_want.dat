5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what <b>others</b> <b>want.</b> Introduced to the reader as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E
5|$|However, Davidson disobeys {{orders and}} {{continues}} to attack Athshean towns, refusing to return to Centralville. After a couple of weeks, the Athsheans attack Davidson's camp, killing or capturing everybody except Davidson and two others, who escape in a helicopter. Although the <b>others</b> <b>want</b> to return to Centralville, Davidson orders them back to fight the Athsheans. The Helicopter crashes, killing all but Davidson, who is captured. He is taken before Selver, who says that Davidson gave Selver the gift of murder, but that Selver would not kill Davidson, {{because there was no}} need. Instead, the Athsheans abandon Davidson on an island that Terran logging has rendered barren. Three years later the Terran ships return and take the surviving colonists off the planet; the commander of the ships states that the Terrans will not return except as observers and scientists, as the planet has been placed under a ban by the League of Worlds. Selver gives Lyubov's research, which he has saved, to one of the emissaries, who tells him that Lyubov's efforts to protect the Athsheans will not be forgotten, and that his work will be given the value it deserves. Selver reflects that although the planet may have been won from the Terrans, his people have now learned the ability to kill without reason.|$|E

Some were in favor of taking off his shoes and socks and letting him down into the river {{through a hole in the}} ice, wetting him up to his knees. <b>Others</b> <b>wanted</b> him to crawl on his hands and knees to another spot on the river, quarter of a mile away. Still <b>others</b> <b>wanted</b> to make a snow house and shut him inside for awhile, letting him breathe through a piece of gaspipe which had been brought along. <b>Others</b> <b>wanted</b> him to make a ten minutes' speech on [...] "What Mackerels Have Done for Astronomy," [...] or some subject equally [...] "deep." ...|$|R
25|$|In Israel, {{a debate}} {{continues}} over the Law of Return. Some people wish to retain {{it as it}} stands, <b>others</b> <b>want</b> to modify it, and some to abolish the Law completely. Those who would abolish the Law object to it because it grants Jews rights that members of other groups governed by the State of Israel do not have. Others argue that the law permits the entry of too many non-Jews, thereby undermining its purpose.|$|E
25|$|Later fictionalizations of Yue's {{biography}} {{would build}} upon the tattoo. For instance, {{one of his}} earliest Ming era novels titled The Story of King Yue Who Restored the Song dynasty (《大宋中興岳王傳》) states that after the Jurchen armies invaded China, young heroes in Yue's village suggest that they join the bandits in the mountains. However, Yue objects and has one of them tattoo the aforementioned characters on his back. Whenever <b>others</b> <b>want</b> to join the bandits, he flashes them the tattoo to change their minds.|$|E
25|$|In {{the present}} day, President Martinez learns of the facility's {{existence}} {{shortly after his}} inauguration and decides, after meeting {{the leader of the}} detainees, to release them and disclose their existence to the world, despite the objections of the intelligence agencies. His plans are put on hold when an assassination attempt on him is foiled by means beyond human technology. The CIA realizes there are other extraterrestrials and secretly plans to find and detain them. Unknown to the agency, the agent chosen to head the effort is himself one of those extraterrestrials. The escaped extraterrestrials, upon learning of the CIA's plans, have mixed reactions: some want to try to salvage attempts to peacefully assimilate, while <b>others</b> <b>want</b> to fight against the populace.|$|E

25|$|Modern liberal {{democracy}} is a compromise between the twin ideals of freedom and democracy. Mosterín emphasizes their differences: freedom comes down to doing what I want to do; democracy, to doing what (the majority of) the <b>others</b> <b>want</b> me to do. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in my personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social life, but the more freedom we enjoy, the better. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) {{in the name of}} the nation, the church or the party. From this point of view, Internet provides a much more attractive model than the obsolete nation-state or the nationalistic movements. Mosterín thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not-sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations.|$|E
500|$|Since its founding, {{there have}} been many calls for reform of the UN but little {{consensus}} on how to do so. Some want the UN to play a greater or more effective role in world affairs, while <b>others</b> <b>want</b> its role reduced to humanitarian work. There have also been numerous calls for the UN Security Council's membership to be increased, for different ways of electing the UN's Secretary-General, and for a UN Parliamentary Assembly. Jacques Fomerand states the most enduring divide in views of the UN is [...] "the North–South split" [...] between richer Northern nations and developing Southern nations. Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a stronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs, while Northern nations prefer an economically laissez-faire UN that focuses on transnational threats such as terrorism.|$|E
500|$|In 2014, Rollins {{admitted}} a {{disdain for}} rehashing old {{music for the}} sake of it - [...] "I don’t want to play old music. To me, it is fighting battles that are already over and calling yourself a warrior. For me, I see no courage or adventure in doing the old thing over again. If <b>others</b> <b>want</b> to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics. I just had nothing to contribute to the form, and I was done with band practice and travelling in groups." ...|$|E

50|$|This led to {{conflicts}} {{among the}} provinces of the viceroyalty: some factions wanted to maintain the country under the centralist organization used so far, <b>others</b> <b>wanted</b> to use a federalist system, and <b>others</b> <b>wanted</b> to secede their provinces as independent countries. This led to the Argentine Civil Wars. The Supreme Directors of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata were centralists, and José de San Martín and José Gervasio Artigas were federalists. Those groups evolved into the Unitarian Party and the Federal Party respectively.|$|R
500|$|According to {{film critic}} Roger Ebert, Susie adheres to the Hollywood {{tradition}} of being {{depicted as a}} hooker with a heart of gold, while her tough demeanor {{is little more than}} an act. Matt Brunson of Creative Loafing described Susie as a [...] "tough-talking, street-smart" [...] character who is [...] "always ready with a quip (or a sharp counter to a quip)." [...] Writing for The Daily Beast, Elizabeth Kaye identified Susie as [...] "a woman who must battle to keep her emotions from showing". Film Quarterlys Steve Vineberg wrote that the character boasts [...] "a cannily concealed underlayer of childlike dreaminess," [...] comparing her appearance and wardrobe to that of singer Ricky Lee Jones. Wounded by life, Susie wears an [...] "armor" [...] that is both impenetrable yet makes <b>others</b> <b>want</b> to experience more of the character. Kaye felt that the role was especially poignant for Pfeiffer, who in real life had still been recovering from an affair with actor John Malkovich {{at the same time she}} was filming The Fabulous Baker Boys. According to Cinapse's Frank Cavillo, Pfeiffer [...] "had never been as open or vulnerable on screen until starring in The Fabulous Baker Boys." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{appropriate}} description was debated by Jewish Agency officials, {{who were}} keen {{not to give}} a negative impression of Palestine to prospective immigrants. In private, however, David Ben-Gurion was unequivocal: the Arabs, he said, were [...] "fighting dispossession...

2500|$|Salesmen are [...] "persuaders", charismatic {{people with}} {{powerful}} negotiation skills.

2500|$|Following the Chinese {{crackdown}} on the opium trade, discussion arose {{as to how}} Britain would respond, as {{the public in the}} United States and Britain had previously expressed outrage that Britain was supporting the opium trade. Many British citizens sympathized with the Chinese and wanted to halt the sale of opium, while <b>others</b> <b>want</b> to contain or regulate the international narcotics trade. However, a great deal of anger was expressed over the treatment of British diplomats and towards the protectionist trading policies of Qing China. The Whig controlled government in particular advocated for war with China, and the pro-Whig press printed stories about Chinese [...] "despotism and cruelty." ...|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a paradox}} that haunts these charges of anti-Semitism. On the one hand, Rosenfeld, Harris, and <b>others</b> <b>want</b> {{to deny that}} American Jews and American Jewish {{organizations}} like AIPAC [...] suffer from dual loyalty in trying to influence U.S. foreign policy. It's anti-Semitic or contributes to anti-Semitism, they say, to make that charge. On the other hand, they want to demand of American Jewish intellectuals a certain loyalty to Israel, Israeli policies, and to Zionism {{as part of their}} being Jewish. They make dual loyalty an inescapable part of being Jewish {{in a world in which}} a Jewish state exists. And that's probably the case. Many Jews now suffer from dual loyalty – the same way that Cuban-Americans or Mexican-Americans do. By ignoring this dilemma – and, worse still, by charging those who acknowledge its existence with anti-Semitism – the critics of the new anti-Semitism are engaged in a flight from their own political selves.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{and study}} Minkowski games. In these games, two players take turns to choose positions in R^d {{based on some}} rules. Variants include boundedness games, where one player wants to keep the positions bounded (while the <b>other</b> <b>wants</b> to escape to infinity), and safety games, where one player wants to stay within a given set (while the <b>other</b> <b>wants</b> to leave it). We provide some general characterizations of which player can win such games, and explore the computational complexity of the associated decision problems. A natural representation of boundedness games yields coNP-completeness, whereas the safety games are undecidable...|$|R
