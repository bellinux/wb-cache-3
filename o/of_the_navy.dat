This thesis is <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cost associated with expanding <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug abuse education {{program as a}} means <b>of</b> controlling <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug abuse problem. It focuses on <b>the</b> former <b>Navy</b> Drug and Alcohol Safety Action Program (NADSAP) now the Personal Responsibility and Values Education and Training (PREVENT) course. The thesis asks the questions: What are <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug population? What are <b>the</b> costs/benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> Level III rehabilitation program? What are <b>the</b> costs <b>of</b> separating sailors who use illegal drugs? What are <b>the</b> costs/benefits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug education program? In conclusion, the thesis proposes that <b>the</b> <b>Navy's</b> drug education program is the most cost-effective alternative and should be expanded. It also suggest that <b>the</b> appropriate mix <b>of</b> education, rehabilitation, and separation would balance the marginal benefits per dollar for each alternative.
