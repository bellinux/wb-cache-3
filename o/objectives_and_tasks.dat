40|$|This article {{reports on}} a survey of {{academics}} with respect to teaching advertising in the first retailing course. Most respondents cover methods of budgeting advertising {{as part of the}} course. Furthermore, they report on both the methods they recommend for small and large retailers and the tech-niques they believe small and large retailers use. The favorite budgeting technique among academics is the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>task.</b> Academics reflect this as (1) establishing advertising objectives, (2) determining tasks to achieve specified objec-tives, (3) determining costs for each of these <b>tasks,</b> <b>and</b> (4) totaling the costs. The authors maintain that the implementa-tion of the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> approach requires the use of methods of both prioritizing alternative expenditures and set-ting a cutoff point. These points are often neglected by aca-demics, including textbook writers, when defining the approach. Furthermore, for the most part, a combination of techniques should be used when implementing an <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> method. Recommendations for the teaching of advertising budgeting in the introductory retailing course are offered. Advertising is one of the controllable variables of the retail mix. Retailers select the types of advertising to employ, when and where to advertise, and how much to spend on the adver-tising effort. Substantial academic attention has been given t...|$|R

Cost estimates are developed for each communication task in order to arrive at a total budget estimate.

Hundreds of international Earth and ocean scientists participated in IODP on a voluntary basis. Participation took many forms: submission of a drilling proposal; sailing on an expedition; participation in an advisory capacity; attendance at a planning workshop or topical symposium. The program’s central management office, IODP Management International, coordinated an integrated work plan between and among all IODP organizational partners.

That was followed by the opening speech held by Trường Chinh, the second-ranked member of the 4th Politburo. Trường asked the delegates and foreign representatives to observe a minute of silence for Ho Chi Minh, and for Central Committee members, for ordinary Party members who died during the war and any individual who had participated in the country's liberation and reconstruction process.

40|$|A good {{product is}} like having no product at all unless {{information}} {{about it is}} communicated to the target consumer group, and a company without products cannot survive. It is therefore {{not a question of}} whether the company should communicate with the market or not, but how the company can communicate with the market as efficiently as possible. There is very little guidance available to the practitioner in this area: the absence of accounting standards for advertising and promotion costs and a lack of communications knowledge make it hard to know whether too much is spent or not enough. Academic research has shown that there has been an increased use of the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> method over the years, which indicates an increased degree of sophistication. Looking into more details about advertising and promotion budgeting, however, shows that most companies have to rely on approximations of the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> method. The technological development that would allow consumer product companies to establish a cause-effect relationship between advertising and sales has not been introduced in Sweden yet, and only large companies will be able to afford to use the method in the future. On the whole, one can conclude that academic recommendations on theoretically sound budgeting practices lie one step ahead of what is possible for the practitioners to accomplish.

40|$|ABSTRACT Seemingly, the sex {{differentiation}} (SD) {{in animals}} and human {{is determined by}} the amount of constitutive heterochromatin region (HR) in the chromosomes of the undifferentiated embryonic gonads (UEG) via cell thermoregulation.

If the amount of the HR is enough for efficient elimination of heat difference between the nucleus and cytoplasm in rapidly growing UEG cells the medulla tissue survives. Otherwise it doomed to degeneration and a cortex tissue will remain in the UEG. For artificial regulation of the SD it is proposed to remove a layer of cortex or medulla in the UEG depending on the <b>objective</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> of the research...|$|R
