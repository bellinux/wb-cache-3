In the later stages, samandarin can cause convulsions, dyspnea, and paralysis. Death eventually occurs by respiratory paralysis after a few hours. Animals poisoned with samandarin show hemorrhaging in the internal organs.|$|E
50|$|The dual {{effect of}} seletracetam is an overall {{decrease}} {{in the amount of}} Ca2+ influx in the cell during an action potential due to binding at N-type channels, which prevents <b>over-excitation</b> of the neuron, as well as a decrease in neurotransmitter release as a product of cellular excitation due to the interaction of the drug with SV2A, which reduces the spread of excitation to nearby cells.|$|E
50|$|Operation of a {{transformer}} at its designed voltage {{but at a}} higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. For example, transformers {{may need to be}} equipped with 'volts per hertz' <b>over-excitation,</b> ANSI function 24, relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Over-excitation</b> is used {{to achieve}} a faster {{response}} time. It’s when a coil momentarily receives a higher voltage than its nominal rating. To be effective the over excitation voltage must be significantly, {{but not to the}} point of diminishing returns, higher than the normal coil voltage. Three times the voltage typically gives around ⅓ faster response. Fifteen times the normal coil voltage will produce a 3 times faster response time. For example, a clutch coil that was rated for 6 V would need to put in 90 V to achieve the 3 times factor.|$|E
50|$|When {{there is}} a painful {{stimulus}} there are two pathways that can be taken. The nociceptive neurons in lamina 1 become compromised or the WDR neurons become compromised. The WDR neurons can respond to electrical, mechanical, and thermal stimulation. The dorsal cord has faulty plasticity, which encourages the development of neuropathic pain after an injury to a nerve. This allows for the <b>over-excitation</b> discussed previously, resulting in chronic pain.  The unique pain pathway of the WDR neurons allows information about the stimulus {{to be used to}} map out the intensity of the pain through sensory discrimination.|$|E
50|$|Ca2+ ions {{can damage}} cells if they enter in {{excessive}} numbers (for example, {{in the case}} of excitotoxicity, or <b>over-excitation</b> of neural circuits, which can occur in neurodegenerative diseases, or after insults such as brain trauma or stroke). Excessive entry of calcium into a cell may damage it or even cause it to undergo apoptosis, or death by necrosis. Calcium also acts as one of the primary regulators of osmotic stress (Osmotic shock). Chronically elevated plasma calcium (hypercalcemia) is associated with cardiac arrhythmias and decreased neuromuscular excitability. One cause of hypercalcemia is a condition known as hyperparathyroidism.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} reports of excitatory GABAA receptors. According to the excitatory GABA theory, this phenomenon is due to increased intracellular concentration of Cl¯ ions either during development {{of the nervous system}} or in certain cell populations. After this period of development, a chloride pump is upregulated and inserted into the cell membrane, pumping Cl− ions into the extracellular space of the tissue. Further openings via GABA binding to the receptor then produce inhibitory responses. <b>Over-excitation</b> of this receptor induces receptor remodeling and the eventual invagination of the GABA receptor. As a result, further GABA binding becomes inhibited and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are no longer relevant.|$|E
50|$|With <b>over-excitation</b> the in-rush voltage is momentary. Although {{it would}} depend upon {{the size of the}} coil the actual time is usually only a few milliseconds. The theory is, for the coil to {{generate}} as much of a magnetic field as quickly as possible to attract the armature and start the process of acceleration or deceleration. Once the over excitation is no longer required the power supply to the clutch or brake would return to its normal operating voltage. This process can be repeated a number of times as long as the high voltage does not stay in the coil long enough to cause the coil wire to overheat.|$|E
5000|$|Glutamate {{excitotoxicity}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important mechanisms known to trigger cell death in CNS disorders. <b>Over-excitation</b> of glutamate receptors, specifically NMDA receptors, allows for an increase in calcium ion (Ca2+) influx due to the lack of specificity in the ion channel opened upon glutamate binding. [...] As Ca2+ accumulates in the neuron, the buffering levels of mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration are exceeded, which has major consequences for the neuron. [...] Because Ca2+ is a secondary messenger and regulates a large number of downstream processes, accumulation of Ca2+ causes improper regulation of these processes, eventually leading to cell death.

50|$|Damage to the CTZ {{can come}} via stroke, {{physical}} injury, or <b>over-excitation</b> resulting in neuron death. Once the damage has occurred, the effects {{can cause the}} emetic response to disappear, or cause the emetic response to heighten, in some cases causing intractable vomiting that leave patients in severe distress. In cases such as these, if the damage is severe enough, little {{can be done to}} inhibit an intractable vomiting response because the chemoreceptors in the CTZ are physically damaged or hindered in some way. Recently, it has been discovered that physical changes in the area postrema and CTZ do in fact cause emesis or inhibit it. Specifically, compression of blood vessels which are physically located near in or around the CTZ, and that result in physical compression of the area postrema as a whole, {{have been found to be}} the cause of chronic medically intractable emesis and weight loss. Surgical microvascular decompression resulted in postoperative and long-term resolution of emesis.|$|E
5000|$|Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on {{the central}} nervous system by binding to the GABAA receptor, {{increasing}} the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., it is a positive allosteric modulator). In chronic alcohol abuse, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. becoming generally less sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the GABA system). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect; compounded with the fact that GABA normally inhibits action potential formation, there are not as many receptors for GABA to bind to — meaning that excitatory neurotransmission is unopposed, leading to <b>over-excitation.</b> Acamprosate's mechanism of action is supposed to be, at least partially, due to an enhancement effect on GABA receptors. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle.|$|E

40|$|Shock {{modelling}} predicts {{an electron}} density enhancement within the magnetic precursor of C-shocks. Previous observations of SiO, H 13 CO+, HN 13 C and H 13 CN toward the young L 1448 -mm outflow showed an <b>over-excitation</b> of the ion fluid that {{was attributed to}} an electron density enhancement in the precursor. We re-visit this interpretation and test if it still holds when we consider different source morphologies and kinetic temperatures for the observed molecules, and also give some insight on the spatial extent of the electron density enhancement around L 1448 -mm. We estimate the opacities of H 13 CO+ and HN 13 C by observing the J= 3 → 2 lines of rarer isotopologues {{to confirm that the}} emission is optically thin. To model the excitation of the molecules, we use the large velocity gradient (LVG) approximation with updated collisional coefficients to i) re- analyse the observations toward the positions where the <b>over-excitation</b> of H 13 CO+ has previously been observed [i. e. toward L 1448 - mm at offsets (0, 0) and (0,- 10) ], and ii) to investigate if the electron density enhancement is still required for the cases of extended and compact emission, and for kinetic temperatures of up to 400 K. We also report several lines of SiO, HN 13 C and H 13 CO+ toward new positions around this outflow, to investigate the spatial extent of the <b>over-excitation</b> of the ions in L 1448 -mm. From the isotopologue observations, we find that the emission of H 13 CO+ and HN 13 C from the precursor is optically thin if this emission is extended. Using the new collisional coefficients, an electron density enhancement is still needed to explain the excitation of H 13 CO+ for extended emission and for gas temperatures of< 400 K toward L 1448 -mm (0,- 10), and possibly also toward L 1448 -mm (0, 0). For compact emission the data cannot be fitted. We do not find any evidence for the <b>over-excitation</b> of the ion fluid toward the newly observed positions around L 1448 -mm. The observed line emission of SiO, H 13 CO+ and HN 13 C toward L 1448 -mm (0, 0) and (0,- 10) is consistent with an electron density enhancement in the precursor component, if this emission is spatially extended. This is also true for the case of high gas temperatures (< 400 K) toward the (0,- 10) offset. The electron density enhancement seems to be restricted to the southern, redshifted lobe of the L 1448 -mm outflow. Interferometric images of the line emission of these molecules are needed to confirm the spatial extent of the <b>over-excitation</b> of the ions and thus, of the electron density enhancement in the magnetic precursor of L 1448 -mm.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a current differential relay for transformer protection that operates {{in conjunction with}} a core saturation detection-based blocking algorithm. The differential current for the magnetic inrush or <b>over-excitation</b> has a point of inflection at the start and end of each saturation period of the transformer core. At these instants, discontinuities arise in the first-difference function of the differential current. The second- and third-difference functions convert the points of inflection into pulses, the magnitudes of which are large enough to detect core saturation. The blocking signal is activated if the third-difference of the differential current is larger than the threshold and is maintained for one cycle. In addition, a method to discriminate between transformer saturation and current transformer (CT) saturation is included. The performance of the proposed blocking scheme was compared with that of a conventional harmonic blocking method. The test results indicate that the proposed scheme successfully discriminates internal faults even with CT saturation from the magnetic inrush, <b>over-excitation,</b> and external faults with CT saturation, and can significantly reduce the operating time delay of the relay...|$|E

Recent preclinical and clinical reports exhibit a surge in interest in the role of GABAergic neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of AD. The interaction among GABAergic signaling, amyloid-β and acetylcholine is shown to affect the homeostasis between excitation (glutamate) and inhibition (GABA) in the brain. As a consequence, <b>over-excitation</b> leads to neurodegeneration (excitotoxicity) and impairment in the higher level functions. Previously, the glutamate arm of this balance received the most attention. Recent literature suggests that <b>over-excitation</b> is primarily mediated by dysfunctional GABA signaling and can possibly be restored by rectifying anomalous metabolism observed in the GABAergic neurons during AD. Additionally, neurogenesis and synaptogenesis have also been linked with GABAergic signaling. This association may provide a basis for the needed repair mechanism. Furthermore, several preclinical interventional studies revealed that targeting various GABA receptor subtypes holds potential in overcoming the memory deficits associated with AD.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{algorithm}} for fault detection, faulted {{phase and}} winding {{identification of a}} three-winding power transformer based on the induced voltages in the electrical power system. The ratio of the induced voltages of the primary-secondary, primary-tertiary and secondary-tertiary windings {{is the same as}} the corresponding turns ratio during normal operating conditions, magnetic inrush, and <b>over-excitation.</b> It differs from the turns ratio during an internal fault. For a single phase and a three-phase power transformer with wye-connected windings, the induced voltages of each pair of windings are estimated. For a three-phase power transformer with delta-connected windings, the induced voltage differences are estimated to use the line currents, because the delta winding currents are practically unavailable. Six detectors are suggested for fault detection. An additional three detectors and a rule for faulted phase and winding identification are presented as well. The proposed algorithm can not only detect an internal fault, but also identify the faulted phase and winding of a three-winding power transformer.

Practically, synchronous generators in DSH rarely operate in an under-excitation mode, but mostly in an <b>over-excitation</b> mode with a high-power factor.

40|$|The {{influence}} of peak-dose drug-induced dyskinesia (DID) on manual tracking (MT) was examined in 10 dyskinetic patients (OPO), and compared to 10 age/gendermatched non-dyskinetic patients (NDPD) and 10 healthy controls. Whole body movement (WBM) and MT were recorded with a 6 -degrees of freedom magnetic motion tracker and forearm rotation sensors, respectively. Subjects {{were asked to}} match {{the length of a}} computer-generated line with a line controlled via wrist rotation. Results show that OPO patients had greater WBM displacement and velocity than other groups. All groups displayed increased WBM from rest to MT, but only DPD and NDPO patients demonstrated a significant increase in WBM displacement and velocity. In addition, OPO patients exhibited excessive increase in WBM suggesting overflow DID. When two distinct target pace segments were examined (FAST/SLOW), all groups had slight increases in WBM displacement and velocity from SLOW to FAST, but only OPO patients showed significantly increased WBM displacement and velocity from SLOW to FAST. Therefore, it can be suggested that overflow DID was further increased with increased task speed. OPO patients also showed significantly greater ERROR matching target velocity, but no significant difference in ERROR in displacement, indicating that significantly greater WBM displacement in the OPO group did not have a direct influence on tracking performance. Individual target and performance traces demonstrated this relatively good tracking performance with the exception of distinct deviations from the target trace that occurred suddenly, followed by quick returns to the target coherent in time with increased performance velocity. In addition, performance hand velocity was not correlated with WBM velocity in DPO patients, suggesting that increased ERROR in velocity was not a direct result of WBM velocity. In conclusion, we propose that <b>over-excitation</b> of motor cortical areas, reported to be present in DPO patients, resulted in overflow DID during voluntary movement. Furthermore, we propose that the increased ERROR in velocity was the result of hypermetric voluntary movements also originating from the <b>over-excitation</b> of motor cortical areas...|$|E

40|$|Results {{support the}} {{hypothesis}} that epileptogenic phenomena are related to traumatic stress in pathogenesis of dissociative states in schizophrenia because of significant correlations of traumatic stress, dissociation, and complex partial seizure-like symptoms. This is in accord with recent findings that schizophrenia as well as epilepsy is related to a loss of physiological balance between excitation and inhibition. Epilepsy is linked to <b>over-excitation</b> while on the other hand schizophrenia is connected to over-inhibition in the nuclei of the limbic system, hypothalamus and their projection sites (Stevens, 1999). In epilepsy the normal equilibrium between excitation and inhibition is permanently altered by repeated focal excitation or kindling, resulting in a permanent state of excessive focal excitability and spontaneous seizures (Stevens 1999; Goddard, McIntyre, Leech, 1969). Similar "kindling" or sensitization may be induced in inhibitory systems in response to focal physiological pulsed discharges of limbic and hypothalamic neurons and this excess of inhibitory factors may then be manifested as a psychosis (Stevens, 1992, 1999). This might correspond to intracranial (stereo-tactic) EEG studies in schizophrenia patients which reported epileptic discharges in limbic structures (Heath, 1962, 1975; Monroe, [...] ...|$|E
