5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the ecology of the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Bart and Lisa {{stay at the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, {{and they}} {{discover}} a metal detector in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen it turns <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> sanitized and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it {{but one of the}} spectators, The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include this happy ending to the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E

25|$|Missions {{flown by}} the 366th TFW {{consisted}} generally of two types—MiG-CAP patrols to protect strike aircraft from attack by marauding North Vietnamese fighters and fighter-bomber strikes {{carried out with}} iron bombs against ground targets. The MiG patrols and attacks in North Vietnam were {{taken over by the}} F-4s and F-105s based in Thailand, which could carry a larger bomb load further and faster. In addition, the F-105 was built to take the extreme structural loads of low-level, high-speed flight, whereas the F-100 was not. Consequently, the F-100D fighter bombers generally operated only in South Vietnam where the F-100 turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective ground support aircraft, and beat back many enemy attacks.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} phase of whaling the hauls were {{generally}} good, some exceptional. For example, Mathijs Jansz. Hoepstock caught 44 whales in Hoepstockbukta in 1619, which produced 2,300 casks of whale oil. During the second phase the hauls were much lower. While 1631 turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good season, the following year, due to the weather and ice, only eight whales were caught. In 1633 eleven ships managed to catch just 47 whales; while a meager 42 were caught by the same number in 1635. The bowhead whale was locally hunted to near-extinction around 1640 (approximately 1000 had been killed and processed on the island), at which time Jan Mayen was abandoned and stayed uninhabited {{for two and a half}} centuries.|$|E
25|$|Balao {{began the}} year 1944 with a contact that turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large steamer and two escorts. The weather impeded {{her efforts to}} close the convoy, but also offered {{protection}} when a rain squall covered Balao while she fired six torpedoes. The submarine counted three explosions and then went deep {{to wait out the}} inevitable depth charge attack by the escorts. When Balao surfaced the next morning, the convoy had disappeared. Certain that the freighter had been sunk, Balao resumed her patrol of the shipping lanes. She later sighted a convoy of a damaged freighter and two escorts and moved in for an attack only to discover that the freighter was her target of 1 January. The escorts drove Balao off, and on 7 January, she was ordered back to Brisbane, still without a confirmed kill under her belt.|$|E

25|$|Lövkvist's first {{professional}} season turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful one. The week after turning 20 {{he won the}} last stage of Circuit de la Sarthe with a 171km breakaway, covering 150 alone after getting rid of Christophe Moreau. The stage win also gave him the Overall Classification, drawing comparisons with Tour de France winners Bernard Hinault and Greg LeMond, who also won the race {{at the age of}} 20. Lövkvist finished 10 seconds ahead of Franck Bouyer, who four days later earned his revenge by beating Lövkvist in the French semi-classic Paris–Camembert. Later in the season he also won the Swedish National time trial championships and participated in the 2004 Summer Olympics. In the 2004 Tour de l'Avenir he won the last stage and finished second overall on the same time of the winner, Sylvain Calzati.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the car {{returned}} with defending Craftsman Truck Series champion Mike Skinner driving with Realtree sponsoring {{the car in}} four of the five races it ran. Skinner had three top-ten starts that year, including one on the outside pole. The team finally ran full-time in 1997, with Skinner driving and Lowe's signing a five-year deal to sponsor the entry. The move made RCR a multi-car operation for the first time. Skinner won the pole position for both of the races at Daytona, and defeated what has turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> scant field of drivers for Rookie of the Year. He suffered some injuries in 1998, and Morgan Shepherd and Childress' son-in-law Mike Dillon filled in for him. Teamed with crew chief Larry McReynolds, 1999 was his best season ever, winning the pole position twice, and finished tenth in points after being the championship leader at one point earlier in the year. Skinner would finish 12th in points in 2000, earning his career-best finish of second at Talladega. However, Skinner was never able to win a points-paying race, although he won two exhibition races in Japan, at Suzuka and Twin Ring Motegi, respectively, as well as some other non-point events.|$|E
25|$|The first Test at Chennai turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high scoring affair, with South Africa batting {{first and}} making 540, then India {{responding}} strongly, led by Virender Sehwag who scored 319 from 304 balls, to reach 468/1 {{by the end}} of the third day. On the fourth day Steyn helped to restrict India's lead to 87 runs by dismissing MS Dhoni with a bouncer then blasting through the lower order, taking three wickets in two overs for the cost of two runs, all bowled with reverse swinging deliveries. He finished the innings, and the match which petered out into a tame draw, with four wickets for 103 runs. On the morning of the second Test at Ahmedabad, South Africa demolished the much vaunted Indian batting line within twenty overs, for the meagre total of 76 runs. Steyn was the pick of the bowlers taking five wickets for 23 runs, dismissing Sehwag and Rahul Dravid then mopping up the last three batsmen for the cost of 11 runs. In the second innings he added a further three wickets to his match tally, finishing the game with eight wickets for 114 runs, as South Africa completed a crushing victory by an innings and 90 runs. The final Test at Kanpur saw Steyn pick up three first innings wickets which took him to 15 wickets in the series at an average of 20.20. As a result of this, the cumulation of an outstanding 2007/08 season in which he took 75 wickets in 11 matches, Steyn moved up to joint first place (alongside Muttiah Muralitharan) in the ICC Test match bowling rankings.|$|E

They could be time-travelling aliens again." [...] He said the [...] "biggest issue" [...] is that a [...] "gung-ho" [...] approach to play is infeasible and that the [...] "precise and tactical" [...] approach faithful to earlier games in the series [...] "turns <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different experience from before. Far less satisfying". This {{is due to the}} [...] "key problem" [...] of the ease with which enemy weapons such as rocket launcher-armed turrets can destroy the player's soldiers. The player is thus forced [...] "to play with aching, paranoid care, picking away at base defences {{from as far away as}} possible, and rubbing up against the save points like a lovely cat finally reunited with its owner. This is not fun." [...] He also complained about the arbitrary death inflicted by exploding barrels [...] "raining down over the entire screen." [...] Cobbet summarised that the departure from the original game meant that Cannon Fodder 3 did not evoke nostalgia and was a [...] "poor substitute" [...] for other action or strategy games. On the other hand, he found the game [...] "admittedly nowhere near as frustrating" [...] as the original. He reflected that it [...] "does have a solid crack at updating the action for a new age, and it's far from as bad as expected" [...] given its obscure development.|$|E
