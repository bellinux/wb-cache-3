As the victim falls out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> to the ground, we see it is Bobby Ewing that has been shot.|$|E

25|$|The 33rd-floor {{boardroom}} {{contained a}} massive oval {{table with a}} Macassar ebony veneer. The hallway leading to the boardroom and solarium contained coat hooks {{for each of the}} board members and senior officers. The foyer had a chart listing the presidents and board members of the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society through the years and where they sat at the boardroom table. The foyer also featured a sketch of the old Walnut Street Headquarters and a list of bank offices and the dates they opened. The board room was decorated with portraits of the bank's founders and its presidents. The chairs around the board table each have a plaque on the back that showed the number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> the names of the current and previous board members who sat there.|$|E
500|$|Kinman {{first used}} {{the large number}} of elkhorns shed near his farm every year to create a fence. [...] With the help of George Hill, about 1856 he created his first elkhorn chair, which he traded to Dr. Josiah Simpson of Fort Humboldt for a telescope. [...] The {{construction}} of an elkhorn chair included using matching horns to make the front legs and arms of the chair. [...] These horns interlocked with another matching pair, which formed the rear legs and the back of the chair. An elk-hide seat was added, along with actual elk feet as the feet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair,</b> <b>and</b> the horns were connected beneath the seat.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Breathing" [...] {{was directed by}} Colin Tilley and premiered exclusively on PopCrush.com on November 3, 2011. The video begins with Derulo {{on the balcony of}} a building at night, as well as scenes of him sitting in an old chair surrounded by cobwebs inside an industrial warehouse. There are then scenes which feature Derulo standing shirtless in a dark, blue-tinted room, digitally showing the insides of his body to show the intensity of his emotion. After the first chorus, Derulo then rises out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> begins to dance. During the bridge, Derulo is shown kissing his former love interest, before several female backup dancers join him to perform choreography in the final chorus. Aaron-Spencer Charles of Metro noted that the video had [...] "some impressive footwork and a great 'straight jacket' dance move with the choreographed piece with female dancers." [...] A reviewer for 4Music also praised Derulo's dance routines in the video. Contessa Gayles of AOL Music described the video as [...] "creepy" [...] and compared it to Rihanna's [...] "Disturbia" [...] (2008) video.|$|E

500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emin's use {{of fabric}} is diverse, {{one of her}} most famous works came from sewing letters onto her grandmother's {{armchair}} in There's A Lot of Money in Chairs (1994). The chair was very detailed, [...] "including her and her twin brother's names, the year of her grandmother's birth (1901) and the year of her birth (1963) {{on either side of the}} words another world, referring to the passing of time. An exchange between the artist and her grandmother using the nicknames they had for each other: ‘Ok Puddin, Thanks Plum’, covers the bottom front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> a saying of Emin’s grandmother's, [...] "There's a lot of money in chairs", is appliquéd in pink along the top and front of its back.

2500|$|Within the Board of Governors, {{authority}} {{resides in}} the Executive Committee to exercise all rights, powers, and authorities of LLNS, excepting only certain decisions that are reserved to the parent companies. The LLNS Executive Committee is free to appoint officers or other managers of LLNS and LLNL, and may delegate its authorities as it deems appropriate to such officers, employees, or other representatives of LLNS/LLNL. The Executive Committee may also retain auditors, attorneys, or other professionals as necessary. For {{the most part the}} Executive Committee has appointed senior managers at LLNL as the primary officers of LLNS.

2500|$|The Idiot is a perfect, and {{her most}} famous, example of this. Her color palette is {{extremely}} vivid and striking. Malfatti makes great use of primary colors, and she outlines her subject in black which clearly defines the shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> the woman, but which leaves the background indiscernible as to {{exactly what it}} is representing. The brush-strokes are large and imperfect as well and do not lend a solid feeling of spatial organization to the painting. Instead, the woman and the background seem to exist on the same plane, only being separated by color movement and shapes. The subject of a woman seated on a chair is nothing remarkable in the art world, but the subject title of the piece as well as the striking upward glance of the woman's eyes explains how it would be shocking to a conservative Brazilian culture. Not only is Malfatti painting an (as it would seem) underbelly representation of society, but she is doing so at a time when society was searching for a [...] "Brazilian" [...] style. All of a sudden it becomes uncertain what Malfatti is representing of Brazil.|$|E
2500|$|Some years later, when Samuel {{has become}} an adult, the Philistines attack Eben-Ezer, {{eventually}} capturing the Ark of the Covenant from the Israelites and kill Eli's sons, who accompany the Ark to battle as priests. (The Israelites had brought the Ark with them to battle under the premise {{that there was no}} possible way God would allow it to enter enemy hands, an assumption that proved to be incorrect.) Eli, who is nearly blind, is unaware of the event until he asks about all the commotion. Eli, sitting in a chair, is told what has happened by a soldier who has fled the battle. In reaction to the news that the Ark of God has been captured, Eli falls backwards out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> <b>and</b> dies from a broken neck, on the 10th day of Iyar. [...] He was a Judge of Israel for a total of 40 years, and dies at the age of 98. His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, is pregnant and near the time of delivery. When she hears the news that the Ark of God has been captured and that her father-in-law and husband are dead, she goes into labour and gives birth, but is overcome by labour pains. As she is dying, the women attending her say, Don't despair; you have given birth to a son. But she does not respond or pay any attention. She names the boy Ichabod, saying The Glory has departed from Israel- because of the capture of the Ark of God and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband.|$|E
60|$|Now, whilst {{this little}} act {{had been in}} course of performance, there stood among the promenading spectators a man of {{somewhat}} different description from the rest.
