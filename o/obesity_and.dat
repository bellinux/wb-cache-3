40|$|Objective: Mechanism of high fat diet-induced <b>obesity</b> is {{analyzed}} <b>and</b> serum tumor necrosis factor, malondialdehyde and glutathione {{levels of}} obesity resistant rats are effectively analyzed. Methods: 120 male SD rats were grouped into <b>obesity</b> group <b>and</b> control group, each group with 60 rats. Obese rats were fed with high fat diet, while control rats were fed with ordinary fodder. After {{six months of}} feeding, growth degree of two groups of rats is observed, and the rats are divided into <b>obesity</b> group <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> resistant group based on extent of growth. Then glutathione, tumor necrosis factor-α and MDA content in bat serum are detected with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The content of tumor necrosis factor α in obese rats <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> resistant rats is far higher than that in control group (P    0. 05) in tumor necrosis factor α in <b>obesity</b> group <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> resistant group, glutathione level of <b>obesity</b> group rats <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> resistant group rats is significantly increased (P    0. 05). However, high fat diet will impact mechanisms in vivo in rats, which then induces oxidative stress response and inflammatory response in rats...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, an attempt {{has been made}} to report the {{prevalence}} of overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> in 1, 000 adult urban males of Amritsar city of Punjab.

5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} direct a film set largely in space. WALL-E has minimal dialogue in its early sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, <b>obesity,</b> <b>and</b> global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to reveal the various {{strategies}} for preventing and managing overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> in relation to reducing morbidity and mortality due to overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity.</b> Thus, overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> are defined as Body Mass Index (BMI) of 25. 0 - 29. 9 kg/m and> 30. 0 kg/m 2 2 respectively. Overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> are complex multifactorial chronic diseases that develop from an interaction of genotype and the environment. It was therefore concluded that overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> involve the interaction of social, behavioural, cultural, physiological, metabolic and genetic factors. Thus, it was recommended that multi-component intervention which include nutrition and physical activities and strategies such as providing nutrition education or dietary prescription, physical activity, pharmacological and behavioural skills development and training could help to prevent and manage overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity...</b>|$|R

5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, which typically contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, <b>obesity,</b> <b>and</b> forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include <b>obesity</b> <b>and</b> smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do. Research is needed to determine specific causes of obesity in lesbians.|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the socio-economic correlates of overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> among Inuit undergoing rapid cultural changes. Study design. A cross-sectional health survey of 2, 592 Inuit adults from 36 {{communities in the}} Canadian Arctic. Methods. Main outcome measures were overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> (BMI 25 kg/m 2 and 30 kg/m 2, respectively) and as characteristics were similar, groups were combined into an at-risk BMI category (BMI 25 kg/m 2). Logistic regression {{was used to determine}} the association between various socio-demographic characteristics and physical activity with overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity.</b> Results. The prevalence of overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> was 28 <b>and</b> 36 %, respectively, with a total prevalence of overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> of 64 %. In analyses of sociodemographic variables adjusted for age, gender and region, higher education, any employment, personal income, and private housing were all significantly positively correlated with an at-risk BMI (p 50. 001). Smoking, Inuit language as primary language spoken at home, and walking were inversely associated with overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity.</b> Conclusions. The current findings highlight the social disparities in overweight <b>and</b> <b>obesity</b> prevalence in an ethnically distinct population undergoing rapid cultural changes...|$|R
5|$|<b>Obesity</b> <b>and</b> {{metabolic}} syndrome are both {{closely related to}} plasma triglyceride levels. Therefore, the focus on an association between APOA5 and BMI or {{metabolic syndrome}} is understandable. Available studies show that minor APOA5 alleles could be associated with an enhanced risk of obesity or metabolic syndrome development. However, genome wide studies have failed to prove that APOA5 is a gene associated with BMI values and/or obesity, so the effect could be far from clinically significant or at least significantly context-dependent.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse, diabetes, <b>obesity,</b> <b>and</b> family history. Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor, UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment fails, a urine culture may be useful.|$|E
