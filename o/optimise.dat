5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection. Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method {{as a result of}} the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to <b>optimise</b> the design of systems.|$|E

5|$|Many teleosts form shoals, {{which serve}} {{multiple}} purposes in different species. Schooling is sometimes an antipredator adaptation, offering improved vigilance against predators. It {{is often more}} efficient to gather food by working as a group, and individual fish <b>optimise</b> their strategies by choosing to join or leave a shoal. When a predator has been noticed, prey fish respond defensively, resulting in collective shoal behaviours such as synchronised movements. Responses do not consist only of attempting to hide or flee; antipredator tactics include for example scattering and reassembling. Fish also aggregate in shoals to spawn.|$|E

5|$|More recently, an {{alternative}} approach has been applied: rational drug design uses the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme's active site to predict which molecules might be inhibitors. These predictions are then tested and one of these tested compounds may be a novel inhibitor. This new inhibitor is then {{used to try to}} obtain a structure of the enzyme in an inhibitor/enzyme complex to show how the molecule is binding to the active site, allowing changes to be made to the inhibitor to try to <b>optimise</b> binding. This test and improve cycle is then repeated until a sufficiently potent inhibitor is produced. Computer-based methods of predicting the affinity of an inhibitor for an enzyme are also being developed, such as molecular docking and molecular mechanics.|$|E

40|$|Weight <b>optimised</b> {{direct current}} (DC) motors {{have been used}} lately as {{actuators}} for micro-robotics and biomedical equipment. The evolution of these motors originated from the need for lightweight compact motors with good response in the industry. Many techniques {{have been used in}} developing permanent magnet (PM) and wound-field (WF) DC motors, such as numerical analysis, selecting adequate magnetic material, finite element analysis and optimisation models. Yet, published articles on <b>optimising</b> the weight and response of WF DC motors reveal the development of WF weight <b>optimised</b> motors with problems for example non-proportional geometry, saturated armature teeth, weak output torque and high operating specific electric loading. To overcome these problems, this paper presents a method that separately <b>optimises</b> wound-field DC motors operating with closed-loop proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controllers.

This paper aims to provide a methodology that would enable the development of <b>optimised</b> CFS beam sections with maximum flexural strength for practical applications. The <b>optimised</b> sections are designed {{to comply with the}} Eurocode 3 (EC 3) geometrical requirements as well as with a number of manufacturing and practical constraints. The flexural strengths of the sections are determined based on the effective width method adopted in EC 3, while the optimisation process is performed using the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) method. To allow {{for the development of a}} new ‘folded-flange’ cross-section, the effective width method in EC 3 is extended to deal with the possible occurrence of multiple distortional buckling modes. In total, ten different CFS channel cross-section prototypes are considered in the optimisation process. The flexural strengths of the <b>optimised</b> sections are verified using detailed nonlinear finite element (FE) analysis. The results indicate that the <b>optimised</b> folded-flange section provides a bending capacity which is up to 57 % higher than standard <b>optimised</b> shapes with the same amount of material...|$|R
