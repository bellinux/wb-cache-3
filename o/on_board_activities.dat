40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research was to clarify the duties and responsibilities of ship’s trumpeters and drummers. They were mainly employed to provide signals to coordinate <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>activities.</b> In addition they performed at ceremonies and entertained the officers and crew. Trumpet signals were also used {{as a means of}} communication with other vessels or strangers on shore. The reason to focus on Zeeland is that here three organisations left behind {{a large part of the}} crew data that has been looked into. They were: the Chamber of Zeeland of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC), the Middelburgsche Commercie Compagnie (MCC) and the Admiralty of Zeeland. Zeeland was rather isolated geographically and the province was the base for most of the Republic’s naval activities. The VOC tried to supply every large ship with a trumpeter. For want of trumpeters a large number of VOC ships were supplied with drummers. Between 1700 and 1780 about 92 % of outward bound VOC vessels employed signal players. Muster rolls of ships of the MCC also mention trumpeters and drummers. However considerably fewer MCC ships employed trumpeters or drummers. Between 1575 and 1796 the Admiralty of Zeeland employed well over six hundred single trumpeters and almost ninety drummers. Drummers were put to work on war ships, trumpeters were found on war ships, caravels, guard ships and troop ships. The duration of service of trumpeters and drummers differed clearly. VOC trumpeters served for three years, drummers five, not counting the length of the voyages. MCC drummers and trumpeters served considerably shorter terms. The Admiralty made a distinction between a contract with indefinite length of service (“ordinaris”) and a service for the duration of an expedition (“extra ordinaris”). The majority of trumpeters as well as drummers were employed by the Admiralty between one and two years. Ship trumpeters’ pay with the VOC, MCC and the Admiralty were similar and differed no more than twelve to twenty guilders per month. Drummers earned less, equalling the pay of sailors. In particular among trumpeters and drummers who worked for the VOC there was a remarkable difference in their countries of origin. Trumpeters came from all over Western Europe. More than a third of them were German nationals. The percentage of German trumpeters with the Admiralty was significantly lower. Drummers generally came from present-day Benelux. The brass trumpets used were mostly made in Nuremberg and bought at the many Nuremberg shops in the Republic. Also most trumpets found in the wrecks of lost VOC ships were Nuremberg instruments. The Admiralty also used silver trumpets, which were decorated with braids and banners. From an entry of purchase, it can be concluded that these instruments were made in the Republic. After the “Glorious Revolution” and until 1705 some war ships employed fife players besides drummers, thus following the English practice. At the close of the eighteenth century ship trumpeters left the warships and their position was taken by drummers and fife players. What signals ship trumpeters and drummers gave, remains unknow...|$|E
40|$|The {{corporate}} {{failures of}} the last decade have drawn attention to the performance of the boards leading the companies that shape nations’ economies. The structural and financial measures previously used to determine board effectiveness and company success are now being questioned, and governance research is shifting towards examining behavioural aspects of boards. This reorientation reflects a growing recognition that the board is a social system that operates as a work group, so its behavioural elements will influence board effectiveness. This view has been supported by research that has sought the views of directors - those inside the boardroom - <b>on</b> <b>board</b> <b>activities</b> and performance. Calls have been made for further studies that draw on the ‘insider’ perspectives of directors to expand this body of knowledge, but it is recognised that gaining access to those inside the boardroom presents practical challenges. This study used semi-structured interviews to access the views and experiences of 35 New Zealand boardroom ‘insiders’ on the characteristics and outcomes of effective and ineffective boards. It therefore adds to the important emerging strand of behavioural research into board performance and, as the first New Zealand study of its type, contributes to international studies on board behaviour. The findings identify insights from the different participant groups inside the boardroom - chairs, directors and CEOs - to identify the varying perspectives they may have based on their different board roles. In addition, comparisons are drawn between the experiences of board members from two company types – public listed companies (PLCs) and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) - which have differing characteristics that influence boardroom dynamics. Further, this study examines the characteristics and outcomes of ineffective boards, a perspective often neglected in prior studies. The findings point to certain board characteristics as having particular significance because of their potential to undermine board effectiveness. A key contribution {{of this study is that}} it has confirmed the importance of understanding behavioural, as opposed to structural, dimensions of board performance, since internal board relationships and board-management relationships in particular are seen as both a cause (characteristic) and effect (outcome) of both effective and ineffective boards. The findings also offer some notable extensions to these behavioural aspects of boards, which have been less apparent in prior research. First, the New Zealand board member participants identified the extent to which negative director characteristics and poor internal board relationships can negatively impact board effectiveness. Second, boardroom practice - a new concept developed from this study that encompasses boardroom atmosphere, debate, and decision making - was found to be both a driver and outcome of both effective and ineffective boards. In particular, poor boardroom practice was perceived to be the most significant contributor to an ineffective board. Third, the findings point to the potentially negative impact of board diversity (in terms of social and value diversity) on board effectiveness, as well as the positive impact of informational and skills diversity amongst board members. These insights emerged from this study’s unique comparison of directors’ experiences across two company types (SOEs and PLCs) that have differing approaches to board selection and diversity. Finally, the role of the board chair was seen as having the greatest influence (both positive and negative) on boardroom practice and board effectiveness/ineffectiveness. While the importance of the chair’s role is increasingly recognised in the corporate governance literature, the extent of the potential negative influence of the chair is less apparent in prior studies. In combination, the findings of this study provide insights into the drivers of board effectiveness and ineffectiveness and the sorts of outcome measures that are thought to signal good board performance. They have the potential to help improve board performance and evaluation, and to reduce the likelihood of perpetuating the corporate governance {{failures of the}} past...|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about {{developing}} effective safety culture within high reliability industries, and accordingly, the International Maritime Organization has recognised the importance of developing a strong safety culture amongst shipping companies and in individual seafarers. A recent safety investigation conducted by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau has highlighted some of the complexities involved in supporting an effective safety commitment culture <b>on</b> <b>board</b> merchant ships. In most high risk industries, workers and leaders demonstrate their commitment to safety by consistently planning for and applying safe working procedures and practices. There is no requirement on them to apply these practices in their leisure time away from their workplace. Seafarers, however, live where they work. Their leisure time is spent in the same inherently risky environment, with available leisure activities bearing comparable risk to their work tasks. The investigation established that seafarers <b>on</b> <b>board</b> this ship (and likely many others) did not appreciate the importance of employing safe work practices and using safety equipment beyond their work tasks, for the conduct of their <b>on</b> <b>board</b> leisure time <b>activities.</b> This conceptual separation of work and leisure was indicative of a culture of safety compliance, rather than safety commitment. The investigation found that these attitudes and beliefs about when and when not to apply safe work practices contributed to the man overboard event and subsequent fatality...|$|R
