The castle is built on a {{trapezoidal}} foundation with a tower <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>corner.</b> Today, {{only three of the}} four towers have survived. There are also some circular bastions that remain. All of these are clearly visible as one approaches Pacentro from the Conca Peligna (Peligna Valley) below.|$|E

It is 12 metres (39 feet) high and 7 metres (23 feet) in diameter and consists of 9 levels in total. The exterior is built of adobe bricks and is filled with grass and mud mixed with lime.

25|$|John Ranard (1952-2008) {{began his}} social {{documentary}} photography in his {{depictions of the}} brutal and ironic world of boxing. Portions of his boxing portfolio, The Brutal Aesthetic , {{were published in the}} book On Boxing (Doubleday, 1987) with the text written by Joyce Carol Oates. Ranard went on to photograph squatters and the homeless in New York City, and spent lengthy periods in Russia photographing perestroika and the poignant problem of HIV/AIDS in Russia. He gained access to Russian prisons and photographed the grim life of Russian prisoners. A good many of his Russian photographs appeared in Forty Pounds of Salt (Fly by Night Press, 1995), Full Life and The Fire Within (the last two published by Medecins Sans Frontieres (Holland) & AIDS Foundation East-West, 2001). Ranard was closely connected with Louisville, Kentucky throughout his career. In his portfolio <b>On</b> <b>Every</b> <b>Corner</b> he photographed the inside world of the black communities' store-front churches. The churches were faced with the problem of violence by black teenagers.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of modern Mexico saw {{a decrease in}} the regulations imposed on pulquerias. This was {{because of the lack of}} strong central government in the newly independent state, as well as the political and economic advantages that local governors saw in this well-established institution. The second half of the 19th century saw another jump in the number of pulquerias, especially in Mexico City, because of this lack of regulation and further urban growth. Previously, established pulquerias were located on the outskirts of the city, but during this time they forged their way into the heart of the city. By 1900 the number of pulquerias in Mexico City had ballooned to nearly a thousand, nearly one <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>corner.</b> This was the time when pulquerias also gained the character for which they are known today: elaborate décor and unique names. Both inside and outside the pulquerias were decorated with vibrant, gaudy murals (commonly of the Virgin of Guadalupe) and the extravagant names of the pulquerias competed to attract customers.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Five Corners" [...] {{intersection}} of NY32 and NY94 at Vails Gate was a four-way junction until World War II, when the Army extended Temple Hill Road, later NY300, southeast to the junction so that troops and materiel could get between West Point and the airbase {{at what was}} then Stewart Field more quickly.

500|$|By {{the time}} of the Ohio Whig Convention in Columbus on February 22, the theme and enthusiasm had taken full hold. Tens of {{thousands}} of delegates and spectators filled the streets as a mile-long parade featured log cabins on wheels, with the builders drinking hard cider on the roof, and giant wooden canoes with the image of Old Tippecanoe, though General Harrison was not in attendance. Many of those who came to Columbus dressed as pioneers, in buckskins with coonskin cap. Barrels of hard cider were provided <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>corner.</b> Serious business was accomplished; the national ticket was endorsed and Congressman Corwin nominated for governor.

During production, bands like Nirvana were not yet national stars, {{but by the time the}} soundtrack was released, their song [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] had to be cut because it was too costly to buy the rights. Crowe had signed members of Pearl Jam, shortly before their burgeoning, nationwide success, to portray Dillon's fictional band 'Citizen Dick'. Crowe also appeared in this project, appropriately, as a rock journalist at a club.

[...] Preservationists expressed concerns that the new plans would preserve the outer shell of the building but gut or significantly alter the building's interior. [...] In particular, concerns were raised that the theatre's soaring interior and proscenium arch would be replaced with a dropped ceiling. The founder of the East Los Angeles Center for the Performing Arts proposed converting the theatre into a performing arts venue: [...] "It's an amazing theater.

60|$|From {{the tops}} of the hills the {{travelers}} caught their first glimpse of the wonderful cities of Twi. Two walls surrounded the cities, and in the walls were two gates just alike. Within the inclosures stood many houses, but all were built in pairs, from the poorest huts to the most splendid palaces. Every street was double, the pavements running side by side. There were two lamp-posts <b>on</b> <b>every</b> <b>corner,</b> and in the dim twilight that existed these lamp-posts were quite necessary. If there were trees or bushes anywhere, they invariably grew in pairs, and if a branch was broken on one it was sure to be broken on the other, and dead leaves fell from both trees at identically the same moment.|$|E

Suspicious of the Elgin marbles, {{and not to be}} done by cat-faced Egyptian giants with their hands upon their knees, Inspector Field, sagacious, vigilant, lamp in hand, throwing monstrous shadows on the walls and ceilings, passes through the spacious rooms. If a mummy trembled in an atom of its dusty covering, Inspector Field would say, 'Come out of that, Tom Green. I know you!' If the smallest 'Gonoph' about town were crouching {{at the bottom of a}} classic bath, Inspector Field would nose him with a finer scent than the ogre's, when adventurous Jack lay trembling in his kitchen copper. But all is quiet, and Inspector Field goes warily on, making little outward show of attending to anything in particular, just recognising the Ichthyosaurus as a familiar acquaintance, and wondering, perhaps, how the detectives did it in the days before the Flood.|$|E
