5|$|After {{being open}} for {{little more than}} a year, the school failed in February 1737, gaining Johnson a {{reputation}} as a failed schoolmaster. He slowly abandoned his desire to teach to focus more <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> his first major work, the historical tragedy Irene. The play did not earn him the money he had hoped for, though, until Garrick produced it in 1749.|$|E

5|$|Following McLane's recall to the United States in 1831 {{to serve}} as Secretary of Treasury, Irving stayed on as the legation's chargé d'affaires until the arrival of Martin Van Buren, President Andrew Jackson's nominee for British Minister.

5|$|In August 1866 Morris {{joined the}} Burne-Jones family on their holiday in Lymington, while in August 1867 both {{families}} holidayed together in Oxford. In August 1867 the Morrises holidayed in Southwold, Suffolk, {{while in the}} summer of 1869 Morris took his wife to Bad Ems in Rhineland-Palatinate, central Germany, where it was hoped that the local health waters would aid her ailments. While there, he enjoyed walks in the countryside and focused <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> poetry.|$|E
5|$|In May 2001, Narayan was hospitalised. A {{few hours}} before {{he was to be}} put on a ventilator, he was {{planning}} <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> his next novel, a story about a grandfather.

5|$|Activity began {{slowing down}} for the band by late 2000, with Keenan {{returning}} to Tool to finish the recording {{of what would be}} their next album, Lateralus. Keenan returned to A Perfect Circle to tour from January to March 2001, until returning to Tool again for the rest of 2001 to release and tour in support of Lateralus. Initial plans were for Howerdel to collaborate long-distance <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> new A Perfect Circle material with Keenan while he toured with Tool, by sending ideas back and forth to one another, though Keenan found it too difficult to balance both, eventually lessening his role while he focused on Tool. Efforts continued through mid-2002, with Howerdel primarily focusing <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> new material while sporadically working with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese. By June 2002, Van Leeuwen estimated that about 80% of the instrumental material was completed while they waited for Keenan's return. However, lineup changes and disagreements on the album's direction would lead to the album not being released for over a year. Both Lenchantin and VanLeeuwen had both been working on solo material during the band's downtime, and then moved on to join other bands. Lenchantin would leave to join Billy Corgan's new start-up band Zwan in April 2002, while Van Leeuwen began touring Queens of the Stone Age shortly after. Ex-Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White, formerly known as Twiggy Ramirez, replaced Lenchantin on bass in January 2003. Shortly after, VanLeeuwen permanently left the band, and long-time band collaborator Danny Lohner filled in temporarily as the second guitarist for wrapping up the album.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin's {{loneliness}} {{was relieved}} when he met 21-year-old actress Paulette Goddard in July 1932, and the pair began a successful relationship. He {{was not ready to}} commit to a film, however, and focused <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> a serial about his travels (published in Woman's Home Companion). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.|$|E
5|$|Early modern Europe saw the {{emergence}} {{for the first}} time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf, except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Embarking from Malta during July 1942, Brennan {{returned}} to the United Kingdom and was posted to No.52 Operational Training Unit as an instructor with the rank of acting flight lieutenant. During this period, Brennan and fellow No.249 Squadron pilot, Pilot Officer Raymond Hesselyn, collaborated with journalist Henry Bateson <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> Spitfires over Malta, a novel relating the experiences of Brennan and Hesselyn during their time on Malta. On 17 April 1943, Brennan was repatriated from the United Kingdom and {{returned to}} Australia.|$|E
5|$|Hartman met comedian Paul Reubens {{and the two}} became friends, often collaborating <b>on</b> <b>writing</b> and comedic material. Together {{they created}} the {{character}} Pee-wee Herman and developed The Pee-wee Herman Show, a stage performance which also aired on HBO in 1981. Hartman played Captain Carl on The Pee-wee Herman Show and returned in the role for the children's show Pee-wee's Playhouse. Reubens and Hartman made cameos in the 1980 film Cheech & Chong's Next Movie. Hartman co-wrote the script of the 1985 feature film Pee-wee's Big Adventure and had a cameo role as a reporter in the film. Although he had considered quitting acting {{at the age of}} 36 due to limited opportunities, the success of Pee-wee's Big Adventure brought new possibilities and changed his mind. After a creative falling-out with Reubens, Hartman left the Pee-Wee Herman project to pursue other roles.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been made {{concerning}} the difficulties which business mathematics students have in solving stated problems. Such {{studies have been}} made by analyzing the student's errors as they appear <b>on</b> <b>written</b> solutions to problems, and, as a result, many errors are overlooked. Errors in the thinking process, and failure to read the problem a sufficient number of times are responsible for many errors made by students. Such errors are not apparent <b>on</b> <b>written</b> solutions, but would be revealed through oral solutions as recorded on a wire recorder. The purpose of this study, then, is to analyze the errors revealed by a wire recorder, along with errors <b>on</b> <b>written</b> solutions, and to classify and tabulate the errors from both sources...|$|R
