5|$|Explanations for the {{transient}} lunar phenomena fall in four classes: <b>outgassing,</b> impact events, electrostatic phenomena, and unfavorable observation conditions.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, their {{volatile}} composition {{means that}} as they repeatedly approach the Sun, radiation gradually boils the volatiles off until the comet splits or develops an insulating crust that prevents further <b>outgassing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most lunar {{scientists}} will acknowledge that transient {{events such as}} <b>outgassing</b> and impact cratering do occur over geologic time: the controversy lies {{in the frequency of}} such events.|$|E
40|$|There was {{a thermal}} anomaly of the Landsat- 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) {{radiative}} cooler cold stage during the cooler <b>outgas</b> phase in flight. With the cooler {{door in the}} <b>outgas</b> position and the <b>outgas</b> heaters enabled, the cold stage temperature increased {{to a maximum of}} 323 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, which was warmer than the 316. 3 K upper set point of the <b>outgas</b> heater controller on the cold stage. Also, the <b>outgas</b> heater cycled off when the cold stage was warming up to 323 K. A corrective action was taken before the attitude of the spacecraft was changed during the first week in flight. One orbit before the attitude was changed, the <b>outgas</b> heaters were disabled to cool off the cold stage. The cold stage temperature increase was strongly dependent on the spacecraft roll and yaw. It provided evidence that direct solar radiation entered the gap between the cooler door and cooler shroud. There was a concern that the direct solar radiation could cause polymerization of hydrocarbons, which could contaminate the cooler and lead to a thermal short. After <b>outgas</b> with the cooler door in the <b>outgas</b> position for seven days, the cooler door was changed to the fully open position. With the cooler door fully open, the maximum cold stage temperature was 316. 3 K when the spacecraft was in the sunlight, and the duty cycle of the <b>outgas</b> heater in the eclipse was the same as that in the sunlight. It provided more evidence that direct solar radiation had entered the gap between the cooler door and cooler shroud. Cooler <b>outgas</b> continued for seven more days, with the cooler door fully open. The corrective actions had prevented overheating of the cold stage and cold focal plane array (CFPA), which could damage these two components. They also minimized the risk of contamination on the cold stage, which could lead to a thermal short...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} cloud {{was used}} to study the plasma dynamics within the <b>outgas</b> cloud associated with the Orbiter. It is shown that the polarization field is not symmetric {{about the direction of}} motion of the <b>outgas</b> cloud. It rotates in a way that can be predicted in simple cases by the ratio of the Hall and Pederson currents within the <b>outgas</b> cloud. The polarization field magnitude produced in the model was not large...|$|R
40|$|The {{contamination}} {{characters of}} selected {{materials used in}} space technology testing. Specific materials were subjected to a thermal vacuum environment, and the <b>outgases</b> were collected on a cold test mirror surface. Approximately one-half of {{the surface of the}} mirror was subjected to ultraviolet irradiation while the <b>outgases</b> were being deposited on the mirror. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the effect of ultraviolet irradiation on the contaminative character of <b>outgases</b> from selected materials. The degree of contamination was measured in terms of degradation of the optical properties of the test mirror and the amount of deposit per unit area on quartz crystal microbalances placed near the test mirror, and by means of quadrupole mass spectral measurements of <b>outgases</b> from the test samples...|$|R
5|$|Roughly {{six percent}} of the near-Earth asteroids {{are thought to be}} extinct nuclei of comets that no longer {{experience}} <b>outgassing,</b> including 14827 Hypnos and 3552 Don Quixote.|$|E

5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp's {{activity}} and <b>outgassing</b> were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets. Observations {{of the material}} streaming away from these jets allowed astronomers to measure the rotation period of the comet, which {{was found to be}} about 11 hours 46 minutes.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} is to understand how surfaces <b>outgas</b> and how <b>outgassed</b> substances subsequently condense on other surfaces. Preliminary tests produced calculated mass losses that {{were found to be}} in reasonable agreement with mass losses determined by weighing the sample before and after testing on analytical balances. However, using test materials with various molecular properties showed characteristic variations in the ratios of calculated total mass loss to experimental loss. These variations indicate that for some molecules energetic barriers to absorption and desorption can exist between <b>outgassed</b> molecules and the surfaces on which they condense...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of testing performed {{to measure the}} effects of material <b>outgas</b> products on the reflectances of ultraviolet-region mirrors. These tests were to provide data on changes of ultraviolet reflectances of first-surface mirrors which {{had been exposed to}} the <b>outgas</b> products of selected materials under specific time and thermal-vacuum conditions. The requirement for such data was based on the extreme sensitivity of the sophisticated optical instruments in the Skylab mission's Apollo Telescope Mount (ATM) to condensed <b>outgas</b> products from materials, and on the desire to insure that no serious hazard of contaminating these instruments existed...|$|R
50|$|Materials <b>outgas</b> {{by three}} mechanisms: release of absorbed gases, release of adsorbed gases, and {{evaporation}} {{of the material}} itself. The former can be reduced by a bakeout, the latter is an intrinsic property of the material. Some <b>outgassed</b> materials can deposit on other surfaces, contaminate the vacuum system and be difficult to get rid of.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of <b>outgassing,</b> comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it was {{announced}} that a population of comets had been discovered within the asteroid belt beyond the snow line, which may have provided a source of water for Earth's oceans. According to some models, there was insufficient <b>outgassing</b> of water during the Earth's formative period to form the oceans, requiring an external source such as a cometary bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for <b>outgassing</b> and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the <b>outgassing</b> from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus. The dry ice content of the comet was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E
5|$|Earth is {{estimated}} to have formed 4.54billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets. The moon formed roughly 20million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. <b>Outgassing</b> and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, {{most or all of}} which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources. The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} way, xenon isotopic ratios such as 129Xe/130Xe and 136Xe/130Xe are a {{powerful}} tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early <b>outgassing.</b> For example, the atmosphere of Mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of Earth (0.08parts per million) but Mars shows a greater abundance of 129Xe than the Earth or the Sun. Since this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess 129Xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from New Mexico is believed to be from the decay of mantle-derived gases from soon after Earth's formation.|$|E
40|$|Solid phase microextraction has {{permitted}} the efficient {{collection and analysis}} of {{a broad range of}} volatile and semivolatile compounds <b>outgassed</b> from materials. In 1998, we implemented a microextraction protocol at Mason and Hanger, Pantex Plant, for the analysis of weapons and compatibility test units. The chemical information that was obtained from this work is interpreted by determining the source and <b>outgas</b> mechanism for each compound in the weapon signature, which is a task only accomplished by analysis of material standards...|$|R

40|$|To {{prevent the}} use of {{spacecraft}} material that would <b>outgas</b> objectionable or nauseating odors, an odor test was developed. This test provided a means whereby candidate spacecraft materials were subjected to a particular environment and the <b>outgassed</b> products were evaluated by an odor panel. This panel was comprised of individuals with acute olfactory senses. The test results of the odor panel provided design engineers with data regarding potential material-odor problems. The odor-test procedure, panel-member selection, and odor scoring methods are described and typical test results are presented...|$|R
5|$|One {{attempt to}} {{overcome}} the above problems with transient phenomena reports was made during the Clementine mission by a network of amateur astronomers. Several events were reported, of which four of these were photographed both beforehand and afterward by the spacecraft. However, careful analysis of these images shows no discernible differences at these sites. This does not necessarily imply that these reports were a result of observational error, as {{it is possible that}} <b>outgassing</b> events on the lunar surface might not leave a visible marker, but neither is it encouraging for the hypothesis that these were authentic lunar phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} global carbon budgets gives {{one example of}} the linkage between {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic <b>outgassing,</b> the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E
5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called <b>outgassing.</b> This {{produces}} a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E

40|$|The {{potentially}} detrimental effects of <b>outgassed</b> hydrogen on device reliability have been substantiated {{in the trade}} press {{over the past several}} years. Non-specific to silicon or gallium arsenide technology, its negative impact is universal and can range from hydride formation with ensuing material deformation to oxide reduction followed by moisture-related failure mechanisms. In keeping with the microelectronics industry’s move toward “building-in reliability, ” this article focuses on identifying one of the sources of <b>outgassed</b> hydrogen in hermetically sealed devices and offers some prospective alternatives to processing and assembly to aid in its prevention...|$|R
40|$|Predictions for {{the total}} {{inventory}} of <b>outgassed</b> volatiles on Mars can be developed by studying volatiles in meteorites, terrestrial rocks, and the atmospheres of Venus, the moon, and the earth.

The recent discovery of a high abundance of argon in the Martian atmosphere appears to indicate that Mars has <b>outgassed</b> as completely as the earth, but present uncertainties and lacunae in the essential data set permit several other interpretations...|$|R
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Ariel by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is concentrated mainly on its trailing hemisphere. Ariel shows the strongest spectroscopic evidence for CO2 of any Uranian satellite, and was the first Uranian satellite on which this compound was discovered. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials {{under the influence of the}} energetic charged particles coming from Uranus's magnetosphere or solar ultraviolet radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the <b>outgassing</b> of primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Ariel's interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to past geological activity on this moon.|$|E
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Titania by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide, which is concentrated mainly on the trailing hemisphere.

5|$|The outer {{surfaces}} of cometary nuclei {{have a very}} low albedo, making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0% of the light that falls on it; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent. The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds. Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds, leaving behind larger organic compounds that {{tend to be very}} dark, like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces causes them to absorb the heat that drives their <b>outgassing</b> processes.|$|E
40|$|The {{contamination}} {{character of}} selected {{materials used in}} space technology testing is presented. Many of these materials contain components that become volatile in a space environment. Most previous data were limited to weight loss or vapor pressure. However, these parameters are not necessarily a direct measure of the contamination character of these materials. Selected materials were exposed to a thermal-vacuum environment, {{and the degree of}} contamination was measured by collecting the <b>outgases</b> from these materials on a cold test mirror surface. The degradation of reflectivity of the mirror was measured over a spectral range from 1100 A to 2. 5 microns. Half the mirror's surface was also exposed to UV irradiation to determine its effects on the contaminative character of the depositing <b>outgases.</b> The amount of deposit per unit area was measured by microbalances mounted near the mirror; the sensor of one microbalance was UV irradiated. A quadrupole mass spectrometer was used to determine the composition of the <b>outgases...</b>|$|R
