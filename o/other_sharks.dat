5|$|Sharks {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Selachimorpha in the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes. The Elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the Chondrichthyes also include Chimaeras. It is currently thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group: some sharks are {{more closely related to}} rays than they are to some <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} <b>other</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{have an extra}} sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which enables them to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E
5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>sharks</b> feed on squid or fish, {{which they}} swallow whole. The viper dogfish has teeth it can point {{outwards}} to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact. The great white {{and other large}} predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals. Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes, and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth-studded rostra.|$|E

5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its buccal cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with <b>other</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. <b>Other</b> <b>sharks</b> examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and <b>other</b> <b>sharks,</b> in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy fishing {{pressure}} {{within its}} range, the cloudy catshark remains common, {{perhaps because it}} may be more biologically productive than most <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> As a result, it has been assessed as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Cloudy catsharks from a number of locations off Japan {{have been found to be}} contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDEs), which they acquire from their food. One likely source of these pollutants is the use of the pesticide DDT by developing nations in southern Asia.|$|E

50|$|The fish {{is named}} for the glow or {{iridescence}} exhibited in juveniles, {{as well as the}} shark-like appearance of this and <b>other</b> <b>shark</b> catfish. It is also known as Siamese shark or sutchi catfish by aquarium hobbyists.|$|R
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates that megalodon preyed upon many cetacean species, such as dolphins, small whales, cetotheres, squalodontids, sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals. In addition to this, they also targeted seals, sirenians, and large sea turtles. However, the shark was also an opportunist and piscivorous, {{and it would have}} also gone after smaller fish and <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> Many whale bones have been found with deep gashes most likely made by their teeth. Various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them.|$|E
5|$|Galapagos {{sharks are}} active predators often {{encountered}} in large groups. They feed mainly on bottom-dwelling bony fishes and cephalopods; larger individuals {{have a much}} more varied diet, consuming <b>other</b> <b>sharks,</b> marine iguanas, sea lions, and even garbage. As in other requiem sharks, reproduction is viviparous, with females bearing litters of 416 pups every 2 to 3 years. The juveniles tend to remain in shallow water to avoid predation by the adults. Galapagos sharks are bold and have behaved aggressively towards humans, and are thus regarded as dangerous. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as near threatened, as it has a slow reproductive rate and there is heavy fishing pressure across its range.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} (if not the most) {{abundant}} near-shore sharks within its range, the milk shark feeds mainly on small benthic and schooling bony fishes. Occasionally squid, octopus, cuttlefish, crabs, shrimp, and gastropods are also taken. In Shark Bay, the most important prey are silversides, herring, smelt-whitings, and wrasses; {{this is also the}} only local shark species that preys on the Waigeo seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis), found in seagrass beds avoided by <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> In the Gulf of Carpentaria, it feeds mainly on halfbeaks, herring, and mullets, and is also a major predator of penaeid prawns. Smaller sharks eat proportionately more cephalopods and crustaceans, switching to fish as they grow older.|$|E

5|$|C. longimanus most {{distinguishing}} {{characteristics are}} its long, wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger than most <b>other</b> <b>shark</b> species, and are conspicuously rounded. The shark's nose is rounded and its eyes are circular, with nictitating membranes.|$|R
5|$|Seldom observed, the {{frilled shark}} may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake. The long, {{extremely}} flexible jaws {{enable it to}} swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth {{make it difficult for}} the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, leavened by bony fishes and <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where they survive primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.|$|E
5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the sand tiger shark than to <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> However, this is unlikely since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand tiger shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E
5|$|Though the pigeye shark {{will take}} prey from {{anywhere}} in the water column, it tends to hunt close to the sea floor. An apex predator, it feeds mainly on teleost fishes such as croakers, flatfishes, and cutlassfishes, {{and to a lesser extent}} on cartilaginous fishes, cephalopods, and decapod crustaceans. It has also been recorded eating gastropods, sea snakes, dolphins, and whale carrion. <b>Other</b> <b>sharks</b> and rays figure much more prominently in the diets of South African pigeye sharks than those from other regions; the types consumed include requiem sharks, catsharks, angel sharks, guitarfishes, stingrays, and eagle rays.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} and versatile deepwater predator, the short, robust jaws of the kitefin shark {{give it an}} enormously strong bite. It feeds mainly on bony fishes (including deepwater smelts, viperfishes, scaly dragonfishes, barracudinas, greeneyes, lanternfishes, bristlemouths, cod and other gadids, grenadiers, deepwater scorpionfishes, bonito, snake mackerels, deepwater cardinalfishes, and sea toads), but also takes {{a wide variety of}} other animals, including skates, smaller sharks (Galeus, Squalus, Etmopterus and Centrophorus), squid and octopus, crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, shrimp and lobsters), polychaete worms, and siphonophores. Like the related cookiecutter shark, the kitefin shark is also capable of excising chunks of flesh from animals larger than itself, including <b>other</b> <b>sharks</b> and whales. The presence of fast-swimming fishes in its diet suggests the kitefin shark may scavenge, or have some other means of capturing faster prey. In the Mediterranean, bony fishes are the most important food year-round, with the second-most important prey being sharks in the winter and spring, crustaceans in the summer, and cephalopods in the fall. Captured males {{are more likely to have}} full stomachs than females for unknown reasons.|$|E
5|$|Among sharks, the porbeagle's {{capacity}} for elevating body temperature {{is second only}} to the salmon shark's. Its red muscles are located deep within the body, adjacent to the spine, and its lateral rete is composed of over 4,000 small arteries arranged in bands. It {{has one of the highest}} core temperatures within its family, 8–10°C (14–18°F) warmer than that of the surrounding water. Being warm-bodied may allow this shark to maintain higher cruising speeds, hunt in deep water for extended periods of time, and/or enter higher latitudes during winter to exploit food resources not available to <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> The orbital retia of the porbeagle can raise the temperature of its brain and eyes by 3–6°C (5–11°F), and likely serve to buffer those sensitive organs against the large temperature shifts that accompany changes in depth; potential benefits of this include increased visual acuity and reduced response times.|$|E
5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take <b>other</b> <b>sharks</b> and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the horizontal plane. The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD in United States and Europe in 2009.

5|$|Epaulette {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger fishes such as <b>other</b> <b>sharks.</b> Its {{coloration}} provides protective camouflage, while its epaulette is speculated {{to be an}} eyespot for distracting or deterring predators. Epaulette sharks are almost all parasitized by the praniza (parasitic) larval stage of gnathiid isopods. The larvae feed on blood and mostly attach to the skin around the cloaca and the claspers, though they are also found inside the mouth and on the gills. These parasites cause little damage and are not believed to adversely affect {{the health of the}} shark. Other parasites of this species include a species of myxosporean in the genus Kudoa, which infests the skeletal muscles, the hemogregarine protozoan Haemogregarina hemiscyllii, which infects the blood, the ostracod Sheina orri, which attaches to the gills, and the nematode Proleptus australis, which infests the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Rather slow-swimming, the pyjama shark {{spends most}} of the day resting in caves or crevices or amongst kelp, {{emerging}} at night to actively forage for food. Many individuals may congregate at a single spot, particularly in summer. This species falls prey to larger sharks, {{and is one of the}} cartilaginous fish most frequently consumed by the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). When threatened, it often curls into a circle with its tail covering its head, in a similar fashion to the shysharks (Haploblepharus). Its eggs are fed upon by the whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, which can pierce the outer covering to extract the yolk within. Like <b>other</b> <b>sharks,</b> the pyjama shark maintains osmotic balance with the environment by regulating its internal concentration of urea and other nitrogenous wastes. Experiments have shown that the shark's capacity for osmoregulation is dependent on how well it has fed.|$|E
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than <b>other</b> <b>sharks</b> and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the water drops below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
