2500|$|The {{production}} of facial expressions, however, is not solely limited to interpersonal situations. Since humans are inherently social beings, they often imagine themselves {{in social situations}} {{even when they are}} alone. This phenomenon occurs in a variety of different contexts: treating oneself as a social interactant (talking to oneself), imagining others are present (either who are currently existent or have died), envisioning future social interactions, and personifying animals or inanimate objects (talking to pets). Solitary facial expressions are generated for an imagined other. According to role and impression- management theories, a perceived audience, whether real or imaginary, causes one to assume a role that is consistent with their audience. For example, a young girl may smile to herself in the mirror while imagining herself talking to a boy from class, but may grimace while imagining herself responding to her mother's scolding. Thus, [...] "solitary faces occur for the same reasons as public ones, if only because when we are alone we create social interactions in <b>our</b> <b>imaginations.</b> They suggest the possibility that sociality may {{play a major role in}} the mediation of solitary faces". There are developmental differences in solitary facial expression, beginning with instinctive expressions in infancy and developing into more complex ones as a child's concept of sociality and emotion matures.|$|E
40|$|Contemporary {{philosophical}} {{discussion on}} the nature of the imagination has been influenced by recent empirical work in cognitive science. Our imaginative and emotional engagement with works of fiction has been explained by appealing to the similarities between our ordinary cognitive functioning and the workings of <b>our</b> <b>imagination.</b> Believing and imagining, it is argued, are governed by a “single code. ” I argue against this claim, and suggest that <b>our</b> <b>imagination</b> – and in particular <b>our</b> literary <b>imagination</b> – in many respects functions very differently from ordinary cognition...|$|R

Chennai online stated that [...] "The entire album gives an upbeat electro sense and wings to <b>our</b> <b>imaginations.</b> The music is convinced to grow on you, if not an instant hit." [...] A review by Music Aloud said, [...] "While the soundtrack of Enthiran has enough fodder to delight a connoisseur, {{it remains to be}} seen how much its sophistication will appeal to the masses, who are after all Rajinikanth's primary target." [...] Behindwoods reviewed the music saying, [...] "Yes, it exasperates you when you listen for the first time. But as you listen again, you realize that though Rahman gives this album a crisp metallic touch in keeping with the theme of the story, he still remains faithful to his Carnatic roots in a touching way. Watch how cleverly he varies the feel of the normal duets and robo-based duets. The lyrics are interesting too. If the listener shakes off his conditioned thinking while listening to this album, he is in for a treat." [...] Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff commented that, [...] "Enthiran is, in fact, a perfect superstar album. Where the collection does manage to veer from the usual, Rahman has managed to add his own quirky, creative notes to the songs." ...|$|E
