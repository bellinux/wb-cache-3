5|$|Hammond was {{selected}} for the M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1932–33. Known as the Bodyline series, it became notorious for the controversial English tactic of bowling short on the line of leg stump, making the ball rise towards the batsman's body to create deflections that could be caught by leg-side fielders. Hammond, {{one of the first}} players selected, was part of the selection committee on tour, and the M.C.C. captain, Douglas Jardine, may have discussed tactics with him on the <b>outward</b> <b>journey.</b> Hammond disapproved of Bodyline bowling, believing it to be dangerous, although he understood some of the reasons for its use. He kept his feelings hidden during the tour, preferring to go along with his captain {{and the rest of the}} team. It was not until 1946 that he openly voiced his opinion.|$|E
5|$|With no {{prospect}} of Tony's money, Beaver loses interest in Brenda, who is left adrift and in poverty. Meanwhile, Tony has met an explorer, Dr. Messinger, and joins him on an expedition {{in search of}} a supposed lost city in the Amazon rainforest. On the <b>outward</b> <b>journey,</b> Tony engages in a shipboard romance with Thérèse de Vitré, a young girl whose Roman Catholicism causes her to shun him when he tells her he has a wife. In Brazil, Messinger proves an incompetent organiser; he cannot control the native guides, who abandon him and Tony {{in the depths of the}} jungle. Tony falls ill, and Messinger leaves in their only canoe to find help, but is swept over a waterfall and killed.|$|E
5|$|After the shipwreck, Grill {{remained}} in Canton as resident supercargo for seven years. As such {{he was the}} company's representative in Canton, contacting Chinese merchants as well as buying goods and cargo for the ships. He was supercargo {{for the arrival of}} three more ships of the SIOC: the Stockholms Slott (<b>outward</b> <b>journey)</b> in 1762, the Stockholms Slott (resident supercargo in Canton) in 1765 and the Cron Prins Gustaf (journey home) 1768. One of his tasks in Canton was {{to make sure that the}} Swedish factory at the Thirteen Factories was in good order and maintained. The Swedes rented factories or houses from the mandarins at other locations as well, but the one on 13:e Faktorigatan (the 13th Factory street) operated as their main building. Grills records of the Swedish factory are detailed and provide good insight into life in Canton at that time.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} approach, popularised by deep wreck divers in the American Northeast, {{is referred}} to as [...] "progressive penetration". [...] Progressive penetration eschews the use of reels, but the diver makes several successive penetrations, each successively deeper than the last, memorising the layout for both the inward and <b>outward</b> <b>journeys.</b> The method is vulnerable to complete loss of visibility in a silt-out, and any disorientation in an unfamiliar area. As a diving technique, progressive penetration is not taught by any of the mainstream diver training agencies.|$|R

5|$|On 27 October 1912, Mawson {{outlined}} the summer sledging program. Mertz and Ninnis {{were assigned to}} Mawson's own party, which would use the dogs to push quickly {{to the east of}} the expedition's base in Commonwealth Bay, towards Victoria Land. The party departed Cape Denison on 10 November, heading first to Aladdin's Cave, and from there south-east towards a massive glacier encountered by Aurora on the <b>outward</b> <b>journey.</b> Mertz skied ahead, scouting and providing a lead for the dogs to chase; Mawson and Ninnis manoeuvred the two dog teams behind. They reached the glacier on 19 November; negotiating fields of crevasses, it was crossed in five days. The party made quick progress once on the plateau again, but they soon encountered another glacier, far larger than the first. Despite strong winds and poor light, Mertz, Mawson and Ninnis reached the far side on 30 November.|$|E
5|$|By then, MacLaren was in {{financial}} difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses {{were covered by}} the tour organisers but he received no money for playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; {{most of it was}} probably spent betting on horse races, and he sent Lancashire a request for further money. Just before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at number five, and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages. He performed more effectively in the lesser matches, and following some final tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week <b>outward</b> <b>journey</b> MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and the daughter of a horse racing official. They were married in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{sources for}} the sacred war are scant, and {{generally}} lacking in firm chronological information. Modern historians' dates for the war have therefore been hotly debated, with no clear consensus. It is generally accepted that the war lasted 10 years, and ended in summer 346 BC (one of the only firm dates), which yields a date of 356 BC {{for the beginning of}} the war, with Philomelos's seizure of Delphi. After Philomelos's defeat at Neon, the Thebans thought it safe to send the general Pammenes to Asia with 5000 hoplites; as has been discussed, Pammenes probably met with Philip at Maroneia in 355 BC, presumably on his <b>outward</b> <b>journey.</b> Buckler, the only historian to produce a systematic study of the sacred war, therefore places Neon in 355 BC, and suggests after the meeting with Pammenes, Philip went to begin the siege of Methone. Other historians have placed Neon in 354 BC, because Diodorus says that the battle took place while Philip besieged Methone which Diodorus (at one point) places in 354 BC. However, Diodorus's chronology for the sacred war is very confused—he dates the start and end of the war a year too late, variously says the war lasted 9, 10 or 11 years, and included the siege of Methone twice under different dates—and his dates cannot therefore be relied upon.|$|E

The artworks reflect Cherry Tenneson’s fascination with the prevalence of modernist signage in the city, such as the original Swiss influenced signs in the bus station; the railway station’s still-prevalent British Rail corporate identity signs; and the standardised motorway signage originally developed by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert for the M 6 Preston By-pass – the first motorway in the UK.

25|$|Although {{the scout}} ant is {{observed}} {{to lay a}} pheromone trail on the return journey to the nest, the other ants seem to be unable to follow this trail {{without the help of}} the scout. The scout ant therefore leads the raid from the front, with the other ants following in a column-like formation. Recruitment time varies between 60 and 300 seconds, with all castes taking part in a raid. During the <b>outward</b> <b>journey</b> towards the termites, all ants are laying a pheromone trail, making it much easier for them to find their way back to the nest later without having to rely on the scout ant.|$|E

25|$|A trial trip to Mapperley {{was made}} on 1 May on car 57.

The steepest gradient of the section was 1 in 11. Major Pringle, the Board of Trade inspector, duly inspected the approved route on 6 May and public service commenced a week later, on 13 May. This service operated via the Market Place to Trent Bridge every 12 minutes, alternating with a short working between Alexandra Park and Trent Bridge every 12 minutes. The fare between the Market Place and Mapperley was 2d., with intermediate 1d. stages.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effects of temporal consolidation (the intentional delay) of hospital laboratory samples / equipment for couriering to people and healthcare institutions worldwide, using a hill climbing genetic algorithm with integrated travelling salesman optimization function to determine the optimal configuration of vehicles in which to consolidate items, and the optimal route for each vehicle. Current hospital and courier service providers' practices centre on collecting items as and when they arrive for <b>outward</b> <b>journeys</b> at the hospital. Using data from a major London hospital this study evaluates 5 different consolidation scenarios, varying the length of time an item is delayed (ranging between 30 minutes to 10 hours). Findings indicate that consolidated approaches yielded reductions in vehicle numbers, between 116 and 258, compared to the current model of operation, but that the current model of operation is actually more environmentally efficient, generating 0. 45 to 0. 83 fewer metric tonnes of CO 2, than consolidated approaches...|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} year a new contract was drawn up to run {{for at least three}} years, or five years if the war continued. Under this a monthly service was to be maintained by a fleet of five vessels; Dummer was to receive £12,500 per annum, and was to be allowed to carry for his own profit 5 tons of freight on the <b>outward</b> <b>journeys,</b> and 10 tons on the homeward runs. In return he was to accept all risks to the ships and was responsible for replacements if they were lost or captured; further, he guaranteed that the Post Office would receive £8,000 per annum from the mail and passengers carried. For this new contract five new ships were built: Queen Anne, Prince George, Jamaica, Barbadoes and Antegoe. Each of these vessels was of 200 tons, armed with 20 guns, and with two decks; they were also fitted with 24 oars apiece to enable them to escape from attacking vessels in the calms, often met with in the Caribbean.|$|R

500|$|The size of {{the reserve}} depends upon the risks {{involved}} during the dive. A deep or decompression dive warrants a greater reserve than a shallow or a no stop dive. In recreational diving for example, {{it is recommended that}} the diver plans to surface with a reserve remaining in the cylinder of 500psi, 50 bar or 25% of the initial capacity, depending of the teaching of the diver training organisation. This is because recreational divers practicing within [...] "no-decompression" [...] limits can normally make a direct ascent in an emergency. On technical dives where a direct ascent is either impossible (due to overhead obstructions) or dangerous (due to the requirement to make decompression stops), divers plan larger margins of safety.
