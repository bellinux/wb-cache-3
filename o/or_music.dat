5|$|Tinnitus is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices <b>or</b> <b>music</b> are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Following the Iron Bowl, Alabama's bowl {{destination}} was unclear {{due to the}} SEC championship game, which determined the conference champion on December 5. Until then, speculation centered on Alabama potentially attending any of four games: the Peach Bowl, Independence Bowl, Sun Bowl, <b>or</b> <b>Music</b> City Bowl. By {{the time of the}} championship game, the Sun Bowl had been eliminated as an option. After Tennessee won the SEC championship game and a bid to the Fiesta Bowl, other teams were selected by the Peach Bowl and Independence Bowl, leaving Alabama to be selected for the inaugural Music City Bowl. The choice was made official on December 6, and Alabama began preparing for its matchup with Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|From {{a family}} with no {{background}} of ballet <b>or</b> <b>music,</b> MacMillan was determined {{from an early age}} to become a dancer. The director of Sadler's Wells Ballet, Ninette de Valois, accepted him as a student and then a member of her company. In the late 1940s, MacMillan built a successful career as a dancer, but, plagued by stage fright, he abandoned it while still in his twenties. After this he worked entirely as a choreographer; he created ten full-length ballets and more than fifty one-act pieces. In addition to his work for ballet companies he was active in television, musicals, non-musical drama, and opera.|$|E

5|$|In 17th-century Spain, {{painters}} rarely enjoyed high social status. Painting {{was regarded}} as a craft, not an art such as poetry <b>or</b> <b>music.</b> Nonetheless, Velázquez worked his way up through the ranks of the court of PhilipIV, and in February 1651 was appointed palace chamberlain (aposentador mayor del palacio). The post brought him status and material reward, but its duties made heavy demands on his time. During the remaining eight years of his life, he painted only a few works, mostly portraits of the royal family. When he painted Las Meninas, he had been with the royal household for 33 years.|$|E

Each quadrangle contains four connected halls that operate as separate units. In the Harshman Quadrangle, these units are identified as Anderson, Bromfield, Chapman, and Dunbar. In Kreischer, the halls are known as Ashley, Batchelder, Compton, and Darrow. Kreischer features a popular dining hall called The Sundial {{as well as an}} Outtakes store in Kreischer-Ashley.

5000|$|There is a host {{of music}} classifications for non-Western music, {{many of which are}} caught up in the {{argument}} over the definition of music. Among the largest of these is the division between classical <b>music</b> (<b>or</b> [...] "art" [...] music), and popular <b>music</b> (<b>or</b> commercial <b>music</b> - including non-Western styles of rock, country, and pop music-related styles).

Music and academic scholarships range in value between 5%–20% with one Kings Scholarship available for a 20% reduction in fees. These scholarships are awarded based on performance in subject specific exams or performances, and {{an interview with the}} headmaster for academic <b>or</b> <b>music</b> scholarships, or the presentation of a portfolio of work for the art scholarship. Until the start of the 2009/2010 academic year, the value of scholarships was substantially higher with the King's Scholarships worth 50% of the fees and a range of lower scholarships between 10–30%.|$|E
5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy <b>or</b> <b>music</b> and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour <b>or</b> <b>music</b> may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration is longer than that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.|$|E

5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. copyright laws at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders <b>or</b> <b>music</b> rolls for player pianos. Edison Records paid popular singers like Harry Macdonough to sing the songs and then sold the recordings without paying any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted papers with the U.S. State Department asking for an extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.|$|E

5|$|Though he {{was still}} engaged in {{creating}} children's television, such as the successful eighties shows Fraggle Rock and the animated Muppet Babies, Henson continued to explore darker, mature themes with the folk tale and mythology-oriented show The Storyteller (1988), which won an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Program. The next year, Henson returned to television with The Jim Henson Hour, which mixed lighthearted Muppet fare with riskier material. The show was critically well received and won Henson another Emmy for Outstanding Directing in a Variety <b>or</b> <b>Music</b> Program, but was canceled after 13 episodes due to low ratings. Henson blamed its failure on NBC's constant rescheduling.|$|E

5|$|Vainio's musical {{influences}} included Tapio Rautavaara, Georg Malmstén and Henry Theel. As a {{young man}} he trained to play music {{because he wanted to}} become a professional musician. He started writing lyrics for friends' bands, and his texts brought him some fame. Vainio was above all a lyricist; he wrote lyrics <b>or</b> <b>music</b> for over 2,400 published songs, the majority of which were recorded by others. Many of Vainio's lyrics were written for Toivo Kärki's compositions. He translated popular foreign songs into Finnish, work that he later abandoned since translators only received a fixed payment for their work rather than royalties.|$|E
5|$|While Drive {{is set in}} {{the present}} day, it carries a heavy 1980s {{atmosphere}} that is cautiously set from beginning to end and is underlined not only by the vehicles <b>or</b> <b>music</b> and clothes, but also by its architecture. The parts of the city seen in the Valley and by downtown Los Angeles are cheap stucco and mirrored glass, often leaving out more contemporary buildings. Drab background settings include the southern California commercial strip. As the Los Angeles Times pointed out, whenever gleaming buildings are shown, it is because they are being seen from a distance. Refn shot those scenes from a helicopter at night in Bunker Hill, Los Angeles.|$|E
