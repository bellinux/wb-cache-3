5|$|As he revised {{his older}} works for Putnam, Irving {{continued}} to write regularly, publishing biographies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> and poet Oliver Goldsmith in 1849 and the 1850 work about the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In 1855, he produced Wolfert's Roost, {{a collection of}} stories and essays he had originally written for The Knickerbocker and other publications, and began publishing at intervals a biography of his namesake, George Washington, a work which he expected to be his masterpiece. Five volumes of the biography were published between 1855 and 1859. Irving traveled regularly to Mount Vernon and Washington, D.C. for his research, and struck up friendships with Presidents Millard Fillmore and Franklin Pierce. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Yojimbo, Kurosawa found himself under {{pressure}} from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before Yojimbo, reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. Sanjuro {{was the first of}} three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> Shūgorō Yamamoto (the others would be Red Beard and Dodeskaden). It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than Yojimbo, though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing Yojimbos box office success and garnering positive reviews.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E

5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing nothing from the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer.</b> The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E

40|$|AUTHOR’S TEXT AS A RESOURCE FOR THE NATIONAL CORPUS AND THE WRITER’S LANGUAGE DICTIONARY Summary A {{dictionary}} of a writer’s {{language is}} a vocabulary that has been methodically collected, analyzed and commented upon and represents the language as used by a particular author. <b>The</b> existence <b>of</b> such dictionaries indicates <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific cultural environment, <b>the</b> stage <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> humanities and <b>the</b> capacity <b>of</b> computer resources. In <b>the</b> first stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project, <b>the</b> corpus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language is created by collecting all <b>the</b> necessary texts <b>of</b> a selected author in a digital form. In the second stage, linguistic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corpus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language is carried out using the existing and improved technologies (software and software tools). And, finally, in the third stage, on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corpus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language a dictionary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language is created according to set thematic, philological and stylistic intentions. The analysis is carried out on three levels: computational linguistic, philological and cultural semiotic. The computerized environment provides a precise quantitative characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> vocabulary (part <b>of</b> speech, word use, collocations etc.). From <b>the</b> philological point <b>of</b> view, vocabulary is analyzed with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> software tools that help identify and demonstrate <b>the</b> stylistic characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language, namely, <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> vocabulary and word use (e. g. metaphors, synonyms, similes etc.). Another benefit of computerized analysis {{is related to the}} intention to acquire a more complete and comprehensive idea about specific features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language style. </p...|$|R
