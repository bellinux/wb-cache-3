40|$|The aim of {{this review}} study is (a) to define the concept of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn (OTL) as a {{theoretical}} category, (b) to present selected research tools that are most commonly used for investigating <b>opportunities,</b> and (c) <b>to</b> compare differences in defining and using <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn as a theoretical category in the Czech Republic and in the U. S., where the concept originated. In {{the first part of}} the study, a specific historical development of defining <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn is presented. Initially, the <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn were viewed as a theoretical category comprising the coherence between content of teaching and content requirements of (standardized) tests or curricula. Later, the scope of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn expanded towards examining school-dependent variables and school-independent variables related to school performance of students. In the second part of the study <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn are operationalised, including examples of methods and techniques used for their investigation. On an example of selected research, the study shows that the concept of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn in the U. S. primarily covers complex research-based analyses of the relationship between teaching and learning. This contrasts with the use of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn as a theoretical concept in the Czech Republic, where <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn mainly represent a theoretical basis for conducting microanalyses of teaching...|$|R

After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to gain knowledge of the relationship between employees’ perceived <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> craft, their actual job crafting behavior and, in line with JD-R theory, subsequently their work engagement and performance. Although scholars have suggested that employees’ perceived <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> craft their job may predict their actual job crafting behavior, which may have consequences for their well-being and performance, no study has examined the relationships between these variables. We collected data among a heterogeneous group of Dutch employees (N = 2090). Participants of the study reported their perceived <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> craft, job crafting behavior, work engagement and performance. Results indicated that individuals who experience a high level of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> craft reported higher levels of job crafting behavior. In turn, perceived <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> craft and job crafting behavior related to higher levels of work engagement and subsequently performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice...|$|R

40|$|Professional {{development}} (PD) is key {{to improving}} mathematics teaching and learning in the middle grades. Many PD projects and initiatives have been undertaken across the United States. Yet, we {{know very little about}} what teachers learn in and through such PD, nor about what those who conduct the PD might be learning as well. This knowledge gap hinders efforts to design and deliver effective professional learning <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> mathematics teachers. This study addresses this gap by analyzing a selection of commonly used PD curriculum materials <b>to</b> ascertain the <b>opportunities</b> they provide for middle school mathematics teachers to learn ideas central to improving their instructional practice. Specifically it focuses on teachers’ <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn about: the mathematical topics of proportionality, rational numbers, and linear functions; using multiple representations of mathematical ideas; and using cognitively demanding mathematical tasks in instruction. Due to the important role that professional developers play in supporting teacher learning and their limited <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn to do so, this study also explores the ways the curriculum materials are designed to support the learning of professional developers – that is, {{the extent to which they}} are educative. The study employed a survey to identify the PD curriculum materials most frequently used with middle school mathematics teachers in NSF-MSP projects across the country. Two analytic frameworks were developed to analyze the learning <b>opportunities</b> provided <b>to</b> teachers and professional developers in the curriculum materials. The analysis of teachers’ learning opportunities revealed extensive <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn about proportionality, moderate <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn about rational numbers, and scarce <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn about linear functions; mixed <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn about using multiple representations, making strong connections between symbols, diagrams, and verbal descriptions, but little use of graphs; and mixed <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> learn about using cognitively demanding tasks in instruction, providing <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> reflect on the pedagogical issues associated with such use. The analysis of professional developers’ learning opportunities revealed wide variance in the extent to which the materials are educative, with some materials offering very few opportunities and others offering extensive learning opportunities. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
