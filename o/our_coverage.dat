Humble Bundle will continue to operate as a separate entity within IGN, {{and according to the}} company, there are no plans to change their current business approach in the short-term. Instead, they see [...] "a lot of opportunities" [...] for the customer bases of both companies, according to Humble Bundle founder John Graham. [...] Graham said that the acquisition by IGN enables them to continue to do the same sales and charity promotions [...] "faster and better" [...] with IGN's resources backing them. IGN's executive vice president Mitch Galbraith said that they felt Humble Bundle was a [...] "great fit" [...] for IGN, and would also help IGN to [...] "give something back" [...] by supporting its charitable drives. As IGN publishes news and reviews of video games, Galbraith responded to several concerns about conflicts of interest, saying that they [...] "will strike the right balance when it comes to <b>our</b> <b>coverage</b> of Humble Bundle and the games they sell" [...] {{as a result of the}} acquisition. Among steps to avoid conflicts, Galbraith said that they will keep a firm separation between the IGN editorial staff and Humble Bundle, and will implement policies to report disclosure of ownership when IGN reports on games featured on Humble Bundle's store or promotions.|$|E
