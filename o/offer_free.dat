5|$|AirTrain JFK is free {{within the}} {{terminal}} area {{and to the}} hotel and car rental shuttle buses at Federal Circle. Entering or leaving the system at the Jamaica or Howard Beach stations requires that a $5 fare be paid using a MetroCard. A $1 fee is charged for all new MetroCard purchases. Transferring to the Q3, Q10, or B15 from Terminal 5 requires an extra $2.75 fare, since the MTA does not <b>offer</b> <b>free</b> transfers from the AirTrain. Consequently, entering the subway at either Jamaica or Howard Beach costs $7.75, and entering the LIRR at Jamaica costs $14.25 during peak hours and $9 during off-peak with the LIRR CityTicket.|$|E
5|$|Grant's Civil Service Commission {{had limited}} success. Some cabinet members {{implemented}} a merit system that {{increased the number}} of qualified candidates and relied less on Congressional patronage. Delano, however, exempted his department from competitive examinations, and Congress refused to enact permanent Civil Service reform. Zachariah Chandler, who succeeded Delano in 1875, reformed the Interior Department and fired corrupt clerks in the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The same year, Grant fired Attorney General George Henry Williams after his wife was discovered to be involved in a bribery scandal, and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place. Grant suggested other reforms as well, including a proposal that states should <b>offer</b> <b>free</b> public schooling to all children; he also endorsed the Blaine Amendment, which would have forbidden government aid to schools with religious affiliations.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Kerala {{became the}} first state in India to <b>offer</b> <b>free</b> cancer {{treatment}} to the poor, via a program called Sukrutham. People in Kerala experience elevated incidence of cancers, liver and kidney diseases. In April 2016, the Economic Times reported that 250,000 residents undergo treatment for cancer. It also reported that approximately 150 to 200 liver transplants are conducted in the region's hospitals annually. Approximately 42,000 cancer cases are reported in the region annually. This {{is believed to be}} an underestimate due as private hospitals may not be reporting their figures. Long waiting lists for kidney donations has stimulated illegal trade in human kidneys, and prompted the establishment of the Kidney Federation of India which aims to support financially disadvantaged patients.|$|E

5|$|In the 2005 {{session of}} the General Assembly, Daniels and Republicans, with some Democratic support, {{successfully}} enacted a voter registration law that required voters to show a government issued photo ID before they could be permitted to vote. The law {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States, and many civil rights organizations, like the ACLU, opposed the bill saying it would unfairly impact minorities, poor, and elderly voters who may be unable to afford an ID or may be physically unable to apply for an ID. To partially address those concerns, the state passed another law authorizing state license branches to <b>offer</b> <b>free</b> state photo ID cards to individuals who did not already possess another type of state ID.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November 2008, Microsoft {{announced}} plans for a free consumer security product, codenamed Morro. This development marked a change in Microsoft's consumer AV marketing strategy: instead of offering a subscription-based security product {{with a host of}} other tools, such as backup and a personal firewall, Morro would <b>offer</b> <b>free</b> AV protection with a smaller impact on system resources. Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft, announced that Morro would not directly compete with other commercial AV software; rather it was focused on the 50 to 60 percent of PC users who did not have or would not pay for AV protection. By 17 June 2009, the official name of Morro was revealed: Microsoft Security Essentials.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to <b>offer</b> <b>free</b> medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A third part of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E

5|$|In June 1919, {{soon after}} the passage of Education Act 1918, the school {{successfully}} applied for grant-earning status and became partly state-funded. As a consequence, it became necessary to introduce a composite governing board (including public representatives) and to <b>offer</b> <b>free</b> places, equal to 25 percent of the normal number of admissions. In 1925, the school saw its first students enter the Oxbridge universities and changed its name to simply The Judd School. Evans retired in 1928 and was replaced by Welshman Cecil Lloyd Morgan who beat 164other applicants to a job which carried an annual salary of £650. He oversaw a change in the curriculum such that each form was divided into two streams, of which one took Latin, the other more vocational subjects. Morgan continued as many of the Judd customs as long as he could, including the tradition of donating £20 per year to send a Barnardo boy to Australia or Canada.|$|E
