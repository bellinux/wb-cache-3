40|$|The Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs has {{proposed}} {{to replace the}} currently implemented structure of legal unbundling of the energy distribution industry by ownership unbundling. In this study we analyse {{the costs and benefits}} of this proposal. We compare the proposal�to the current situation and to two alternative options that strengthen legal unbundling. We identify four mutually-related categories of benefits: better performance of networks, more efficient regulation, improved effectiveness of competition, and benefits of privatisation; and three categories of costs: <b>one-off</b> <b>transaction</b> costs, loss of economies of scope and the risk of less investment in generation. The analysis highlights that the benefits depend on the future development in small-scale generation and on allocation of the management of transmission networks. Mainly because of the uncertainty about the future role of small-scale generation and the uncertainty about the magnitude of the <b>one-off</b> <b>transaction</b> costs related to cross-border leases, the net welfare effect of ownership unbundling at the distribution level is ambiguous. We identify an alternative route for achieving some of the benefits considered. ...|$|E
40|$|Co-insurance is {{a concept}} defined by several people as {{simultaneously}} insurance in the amount deposited in advance warranty. In the present article we shall consider a risk averse agent with an initial wealth that supports a risk of loss. Supposing that for every euro paid as damages by the insurance policy, the insurer incurrs a <b>one-off</b> <b>transaction</b> costs. Obviously, more complex structures are also possible cost. If we add these transaction costs to the expected costs of damage in the first plan insurance payments must be equal. Level λ is often considered as an influential factor or source of profit and loss. So, if spending rises to 10 lei for every 100 lei of the damage, the insurer will add 10...|$|E

40|$|AbstractGrid {{operators}} increasingly have {{to collaborate}} with other actors in order to realize smart grid innovations. For routine maintenance, grid operators typically acquire technologies in <b>one-off</b> <b>transactions,</b> but the innovative nature of smart grid projects may require more collaborate relationships. This paper studies how a transactional versus relational approach to governing smart grid innovation projects affects incentives for other actors to collaborate. We analyse 34 cases of smart grid innovation projects based on extensive archival data as well as interviews. We find that projects relying on relational governance {{are more likely to}} provide incentives for collaboration. Especially non-financial incentives such as reputational benefits and shared intellectual property rights {{are more likely to be}} found in projects relying on relational governance. Policy makers that wish to stimulate smart grid innovation projects should consider stimulating long-term relationships between grid operators and third parties, because such relationships are more likely to produce incentives for collaboration...|$|R

Our empirical investigation establishes novel stylized facts on firm and destination characteristics associated with one-off exporting...|$|R
40|$|After many decades, {{macroeconomic}} {{effects of}} fiscal policy {{have returned to}} the centre of the economic policy debate. Both automatic fiscal stabilizers and discretionary fiscal stimuli have been used to support aggregate demand during the recent global economic crisis with a subsequent need for large-scale fiscal consolidations. In this context, a proper assessment of the size of automatic fiscal stabilizers and fiscal multipliers represents a key input for fiscal policymaking. This dissertation provides a quantitative analysis of the interactions between fiscal policy and real economy in the Czech Republic. The impact of real economy developments on public finances is assessed based on the methods of the OECD, the European Commission and the ESCB for the identification of general government structural balances, i. e. balances adjusted for effects of the economic cycle and net of one-off and other temporary transactions. I find that the underlying fiscal position, as approximated by the government structural balance, was mostly below the level stabilising the debt-to-GDP ratio since mid- 1990 s. An indistinct improvement in the structural balance can be identified in the period 2004 [...] 2007, which was subsequently reversed by the adverse structural impact of the world economic crisis. At the same time, dynamics of unadjusted fiscal balance was largely determined by <b>one-off</b> <b>transactions</b> in the past. The effects of fiscal policy on real economy are analysed using the structural VAR approach. I find that an increase in government spending has a temporary positive effect on output that peaks after one to two years with a multiplier of around 0. 6. Tax multiplier appears to be small and, in contrast to standard Keynesian assumptions, positive. Government spending is supportive to private consumption, contradicting the hypothesis of Ricardian equivalence, but it crowds out private investment in the short run. The results should be interpreted with caution, as the analysis is complicated by rapidly changing economic environment in the period of the economic transition, relatively short available time series and a large number of <b>one-off</b> fiscal <b>transactions...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this section}} we {{describe}} the financial effect of rail on its government and private owners. 7. 1 Government The government as owner could put cash into rail in ways that include direct cash subsidies for market services, equity inputs of various sorts, cash injections for special purposes (say a restructuring or to meet general losses). Equally it could remove cash from rail by way of company taxation, regular or special dividends, share repurchases or other <b>one-off</b> <b>transactions</b> (such as a sale). The government had traditionally subsidised passenger services and this continued through to 1988. From this date passenger-service subsidies have been provided by local government. The position is described in Figure 15. For {{the purpose of the}} welfare analysis we will treat these subsidies as the purchase of passenger services by central government and then local government. This treatment does not differ between pre and post privatisation. To the extent that the subsidy is an efficient response to an externality problem it would not enter the welfare calculation of privatisation. It would, however, be an important component of any analysis of the public interest in closing down rail commuter passenger services. Figure 15 provides a break down of the cash injections by government in rail. Direct cash inputs to rail were by way of passenger subsidies for both long distance and suburban rail services, take over of the 1990 debt plus injection of new equity and the ongoing subsidies from (local) government of suburban passenger services 33. The totals are expressed in 1997 $. It {{should be noted that the}} 1990 debt and equity input is net of the debt that existed in 1983 and therefore represents the net debt accumulated in the 1983 to 1990 period...|$|R
40|$|Reusing online {{resources}} {{has long}} been acknowledged as key to developing a sustainable approach to e-learning (e. g. Littlejohn (2003)). Indeed, {{it is difficult to}} envisage a productive future for e-learning that does not include sharing of resources. Opportunities to generate content online have escalated. Sharing, in the sense of publishing, comparing, collaborating and combining new resources, is increasingly common and frequently ‘open’. Described as ‘a learning object plus an open license’ (Wiley, 2009), open educational resources (OER) help resolve {{one of the most significant}} barriers to sharing – the rights issue. However, sharing of OER is a two-sided process. It requires use of the resources, for the sharing cycle to be completed. Otherwise we simply have intent to share, or ‘planning to share’ Leslie (2008) – the good intentions around reuse identified by McGill, et. al. (2008). OER is more than simply making shareable resources available in a technically reusable guise. It needs to facilitate productive sharing exchanges between participants who may not have met, supporting discovery, adaptation and reuse of resources across different contexts – whether as <b>one-off</b> <b>transactions,</b> or within on-going collaboration. In doing so it needs to engage with complex cultural change – not just in countering resistance to offering resources (Lee, 2008), but also in knowing why reusing resources would be desirable in an academic culture which places high value on originality. This session presents a model for predicting the reuse potential of OER projects within UK HE, and thus improving the chances of reuse occurring. The model is grounded in longitudinal research (2002 - 2009) based on resource reuse within the UK across a spectrum of sharing contexts, from courses and individual collections, to national and open repositories. It focuses on the influence and interaction of technology (including open licenses), motivation and resource utility on each side of the resource reuse transaction – the supply and the demand (or use) dimensions of resource sharing. Presented as a ‘dashboard’ style tool, the resource reuse prediction (RREP) model will help OER projects anticipate areas of resistance to reuse and suggests ways to address or minimize these. ...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach - Contends {{that information and}} communication technologies (ICT) have transformed business models, suggests that business flexibility now applies to external as well as internal aspects of business management, and argues that business relationships are a vital component of business success. Depicts dyadic, tri-adic and network relationships, maintains that supply decisions are now based on integration and alignment, additional to product characteristics, and emphasizes the linkages between, and inter-dependence of, companies in a value-chain. Illustrates a relationship typology that includes horizontal, supplier, intra-industry, miscellaneous, buyer and internal relationships, describing the characteristics, and giving examples of, each type. Maintains that value systems should be seen as collective, and not zero-sum, games, underlines the importance of ICT in value-chains, and gives benefits of agile relationships that include knowledge acquisition, synergistic gains, improved time-to-market, and costs and risk reduction. Graphs a continuum of agile relationship intensity that ranges from <b>one-off</b> market <b>transactions</b> to active collaborative activities, with axes of business performance gains and embeddedness with partners, and explains six factors supporting successful relationships, i. e. strategizing, core-competences, knowledge and skills, philosophy and commitment, process integration and alignment, and business transformation.

5000|$|This {{distribution}} channel {{involves more than}} one intermediary before the product gets {{into the hands of}} the consumer. This middleman, known as the agent, assists with the negotiation between the manufacturer and the seller. Agents come into play when the producers need to get their product into the market as quickly as possible. This happens mostly when the item is perishable and has to get to the market fresh before it starts to rot. At times, the agent will directly go to the retailer with the goods, or take an alternate route through the wholesaler who will go to a retailer and then finally to the consumer. A mutual cooperation normally occurs when parties, in particular, the last channel of marketing chain of distribution meet. Due to the fact that producers, agents, retailers/wholesalers and consumers of this channel aid each other and benefit from each other. Their cooperation generates a greater output in terms of further profitability, by discernment and exploring newer markets of sales and building a better business relationship. The participants of {{distribution channel}}s must have knowledge and experience not only for the effective maintenance of target segments but also to maintain the competitive advantage of the manufacturer. For example, an Agent who is able to vary prices for certain products can negotiate and or lower prices. This will assist him in sustain the comparative advantage, stay on top of its competitors and stay demanded on the market. A Broker works mainly to bring the seller and the buyer and to assist in the negotiation process. An intermediary like Broker is usually dependent on the commission of a sold product or production in terms of goods. In addition, therefore, a Broker is involved in <b>one-off</b> <b>transactions</b> and can not be an effective channel of distribution. However, he can maintain a competitive advantage over other firms in the form of a particular brand if he has obtained the right to exclusive representation of the manufacturer and can profit from it more. He acts on behalf of the seller (Producer/Manufacture) and has no rights to modify prices for products. In addition, having formed a channel of distribution it is important to remember that the exploitation and utilization of intermediaries in a business (not only wholesalers, retailers but also transport logistics) will lengthen the chain of distribution. A business will then need to consider which channel is more cost effective and productive in terms of time delivery, efficiency, pricing policy and where it stands among competitors; for example, overall feedback, higher rating, higher demand from customers etc. The best use and help of intermediaries can be applied to start-up businesses and perhaps an established business ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Research on {{livestock}} food {{systems in}} developing countries remains limited yet these systems are undergoing rapid and ongoing changes. Poultry meat in Nairobi is a good case study to investigate the changes that result from increasing demand for animal protein 1, in particular how different systems affect the supply of macro and micronutrients, livelihood improvement and food safety risks. The aim {{of the current study}} was to map the broiler and indigenous chicken meat value chains of Nairobi to provide a thorough context (milieu) for future food safety and socio-economic assessments of the wide poultry meat system. Methods: Focus groups and individual questionnaires were used to collect data from: - Broiler and indigenous farmers (in Dagoretti, reflecting peri-urban chains, and Kibera informal settlement, for urban chains); - Retailers in Viwandani, Korogocho (informal settlements), and Dagoretti; - Three larger broiler production companies; - Livestock production and public health officers, meat inspectors, city council, National Environment Management Authority, and a village chief. The following data were collected for each chain and entered in templates: - Categories of farms, retailers, products and consumers; production practices and performance; relative flows of birds and products, their sources and seasonality; market outlets; regulations enforcement and institutional context; interactions and involvement of people in the chains’ nodes; biosecurity measures. Analysis allowed detailed characterisation and graphical representation of the food system. Within the system the following “chain profiles” were identified: 1) peri-urban and 2) urban broilers; 3) peri-urban and 4) urban indigenous chickens; 5) large and 6) medium integrated companies; 7) live and 8) meat poultry markets; 9) main poultry chains in each sub-county; 10) characterisation of poultry retailer types. Each profile has a distinct set of flows, interactions, market potentials, risk practices, production and distribution characteristics, useful for food safety, food security and governance assessments. Findings and interpretation: Within the poultry meat food system the chains in urban areas had fewer intermediaries and smaller geographic span than those in peri-urban areas – overall they were “shorter”. The limited space in urban areas appeared to reduce flock size and hence increase <b>one-off</b> <b>transactions.</b> Use of brokers in peri-urban chains made transport of meat, rather than birds, more practical. Greatest homogeneity was seen in the chains with commercial broiler chickens (birds for meat production) with one large company supplying 60 % of Nairobi’s day-old chicks to small-scale farmers. A small number of larger companies supply broiler chicken meat to high-end retailers across Nairobi, yet there are many more small-scale broiler farmers who sell birds close to their farms, or in Nairobi markets. Indigenous breed chickens are kept in backyard farming systems and are kept for home or local consumption. Birds are also sourced from remote areas of Kenya. Different meat products reach different consumers, based on their value. The lowest value products are heads and legs from broilers of large-scale and peri-urban small farms, which are sold in informal settlements via roadside vendors. The description of the chicken meat food system provides the context for further food safety and food security analysis...|$|R
