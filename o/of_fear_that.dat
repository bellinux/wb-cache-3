5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is the ceiling, painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, {{the work on the}} ceiling proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once the ceiling was completed.|$|E
5|$|The other Great Powers {{immediately}} {{rejected the}} treaty out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> {{such a large}} country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the subsequent Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of Bulgarians outside the new country. This {{played a significant role}} in forming Bulgaria's militaristic approach to foreign affairs during the first half of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|For example, of the 15 dolphin {{carcasses}} {{found in}} the Japurá River in 2010–2011 surveys, 73% of the dolphins were killed for bait, disposed of, or abandoned in entangled gillnets. The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins, whether accidental or intentional, because {{a variety of factors}} make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses. Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses. More importantly, the local fishermen do not report these deaths out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> legal action will be taken against them, as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law, prohibiting any takes, harassments, and kills of the species.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E

5|$|In September 1968, Barthol {{left the}} band, {{just prior to}} their fourth album. His {{departure}} {{was due to the}} rest of the band's unwillingness to partake in the Festival for Life, an event established by the Youth International Party in Chicago that was intended to have the participation of several well-known musicians attract thousands of spectators for the 1968 Democratic National Convention. However, the city refused to issue any permits, and the band members, by majority vote, decided to withdraw out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> their equipment would be damaged. After the festival resulted in riots and violent clashes between demonstrators and the police, Barthol's conviction that Country Joe and the Fish should have held a larger role precipitated his departure from the group and move to England.|$|E
5|$|Krabs' rival {{and former}} best friend Plankton {{operates}} the Chum Bucket, a failing restaurant {{across the street}} from the Krusty Krab. A major plot point throughout the series is Plankton's futile attempts to steal the Krabby Patty formula with the help of his computer sidekick Karen, under the assumption that they would be able to replicate the burgers and put the Krusty Krab out of business. To avoid this, Krabs goes to extreme lengths to prevent Plankton from obtaining the recipe; he even refuses to allow him to buy a Krabby Patty legitimately out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Plankton might use Karen to reverse-engineer the formula. Krabs also makes it his duty to ensure that the Chum Bucket never has any business whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Many noblemen joined Charles of Naples who marched towards Buda. Mary and {{her mother}} {{received}} him ceremoniously before he reached Buda, and he entered the capital in the two queens' company in early December 1385. Mary renounced the crown without resistance {{in the middle of}} December out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Charles would kill her. Charles first adopted the title governor, but the Diet elected him king. Charles was crowned king of Hungary in Székesfehérvár on 31December. According to the contemporaneous Lorenzo de Monacis, Mary {{and her mother}}, who attended Charles's coronation, visited Louis the Great's tomb during the ceremony where they burst into tears because of their ill fate.|$|E

50|$|The Palestro-class ironclad {{floating}} batteries {{were four}} floating batteries {{built for the}} French Navy in 1859-62 to replace the Crimean War-built vessels because <b>of</b> <b>fears</b> <b>that</b> the 1855 ships would deteriorate {{because they had been}} built hurriedly with poor wood.|$|R
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her views {{as a unique}} and final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another distinction (that people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E
5|$|The last {{remaining}} ruler, the 8-year-old emperor Emperor Huaizong of Song, committed suicide, along with Prime Minister Lu Xiufu and 800 {{members of the}} royal clan. On Kublai's orders, carried out by his commander Bayan, the rest of the former imperial family of Song were unharmed; the deposed Emperor Gong was demoted, being given the title 'Duke of Ying', but was eventually exiled to Tibet where he took up a monastic life. The former emperor would eventually be forced to commit suicide under the orders of Kublai's great-great grandson, Gegeen Khan, out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Emperor Gong would stage a coup to restore his reign. Other members of the Song Imperial Family continued to live in the Yuan dynasty, including Zhao Mengfu and Zhao Yong.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} had proceeded despite opposition from her parents, who worried about Pound's meager income, earned from contributions to literary magazines and probably less than £300 a year. Dorothy's annual income was £50, aided by £150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> {{she was getting}} older with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.|$|E

5|$|By 2011, Serbian diplomats {{made several}} {{requests}} to the EU, asking it to pressure Croatia {{to resolve the}} dispute before Croatia's accession to the union out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> it might follow the Slovene example and stall Serbian accession similar to the impasse between Croatia and Slovenia over their border disputes and the subsequent blockade of the Croatian EU accession negotiation process. The request was denied by the EU. Croatian President Ivo Josipović said that the dispute was the most contentious issue of Croatia–Serbia relations but added {{that it should not}} be difficult to resolve. In 2012, Josipović stated that Croatia should not block Serbia's EU accession over the issue and suggested that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration, which is considered to be an acceptable solution by both countries. In 2014, the Croatian ambassador to Serbia reiterated Josipović's stance from 2012. On the other hand, Zoran Milanović, the Prime Minister of Croatia, said that the resolution of the border dispute would be Croatia's condition placed before Serbia in its EU accession negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{concerns}} over a possible Axis invasion, {{orders for the}} general mobilisation of the Royal Yugoslav Army were not issued by the government until 3 April 1941, out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> this would offend Adolf Hitler and precipitate war. When the invasion commenced on 6 April, the 4th Army was only partially mobilised, and this weakness was exacerbated by fifth column activities within its major units and higher headquarters. Revolts of Croat soldiers broke out in all three divisions {{in the first few}} days, causing significant disruption to mobilisation and deployment. The town of Bjelovar was taken over by rebel troops. Widespread desertions of Croat troops, many of whom turned on their Serb comrades, made control even more difficult. German activity in the 4th Army sector in the first four days included limited objective attacks to seize crossings over the Mura and Drava rivers, along with air attacks by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Kaganovich {{arrived in}} Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev {{indicates}} he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> his loss of position {{was the first}} step towards downfall and demise. However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was {{able to get out of}} bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia. Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries. By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev's protégé.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{refused to}} abandon the area completely out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> such an action would make them appear weak. While they planned a response, Indians raided the San Saba horse herd, stealing all of the horses and pack mules and killing 20soldiers. In October 1759, Spain sent the San Sabá commander, Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla, on an expedition north to the Red River to avenge the attack. The tribes were forewarned and led Parrilla's army to a fortified Wichita village, surrounded by a stockade and a moat, where natives brandished French guns and waved a French flag. After a skirmish in which 52Spaniards were killed, wounded, or deserted, the Spanish retreated. The San Sabá presidio was replaced with a limestone fortress and a moat, but the Comanches and their allies remained close and killed any soldiers who ventured out. By 1769, Spain abandoned the fort.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Yucatán Peninsula, {{airports}} and ports were closed, while regularly scheduled bus routes were canceled. About 180locations {{were prepared to}} serve as a shelter if large scale evacuations were necessary. In Punta Allen and Punta Herrero, authorities ordered the evacuation of about 100families. Dozens of oil and gas wells in the Bay of Campeche owned by Pemex were evacuated, while Shell Oil Company evacuated some people from an oil platform farther north. Approximately 6,500people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Tampico and flood prone locations in San Luis Potosi. The General Francisco Javier Mina International Airport closed {{for most of the day}} on August23. A total of 37ports along the Gulf Coast of Mexico were closed.

5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E
