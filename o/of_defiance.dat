5|$|Additionally, several hardships {{struck the}} band in 2014. In May, bassist David Ellefson lost a brother to cancer, {{following}} which, the band cancelled {{a number of}} scheduled shows. On October 4, Mustaine's Alzheimer's-afflicted mother-in-law went missing from a campground. Her remains were discovered on November 26. Furthermore, drummer Shawn Drover and guitarist Chris Broderick announced their resignations from the band that November. The pair would later emerge in a new band, Act <b>of</b> <b>Defiance.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} oil {{study for the}} {{defeated}} warrior (York Art Gallery), Etty gave the character a more defiant appearance than seen in the finished version. In this preliminary sketch he is not on his knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.|$|E
5|$|Kikuyu girls {{cut each}} other's vulvas in the 1950s {{as a symbol}} <b>of</b> <b>defiance,</b> {{in the context of}} the {{campaign}} against female genital mutilation in colonial Kenya. The movement came to be known as Ngaitana ("I will circumcise myself"), because to avoid naming their friends the girls said they had cut themselves. Historian Lynn Thomas described the episode as significant in the history of FGM because it made clear that its victims were also its perpetrators.|$|E
5|$|The Victory Tests {{started in}} May 1945 between the Australian Services and England {{in celebration of}} the allied victory in Europe. In {{previous}} seasons, the English cricket administrator and former captain Pelham Warner had organised matches between the RAAF and various English military teams as an expression <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> against Nazi air raids, and the Victory Tests were a continuation of this, although the matches were only three days long {{and did not have}} Test status.|$|E
50|$|The Defiance Plateau is {{the central}} area of an uplifted region. To the north/northeast are the Lukachukai Mountains, part <b>of</b> the <b>Defiance</b> Plateau border; they form a {{southeast}} section of Chinle Valley's border. South of the Lukachukais {{is the rest of}} the east border <b>of</b> the <b>Defiance</b> Plateau, the Chuska Mountains; the Chuskas trend northwest in the north; at the plateaus east, the Chuskas trend more southerly, and attached at the south is Manuelito Plateau, in New Mexico, the east border of the south-flowing Black Creek at the southeast perimeter region <b>of</b> the <b>Defiance</b> Plateau.|$|R

5|$|Wheelwright was {{initially}} given until March {{to leave the}} colony, but when ordered not to preach during the interim, he refused, and was then given two weeks to depart the jurisdiction. When asked to give security for his peaceful departure, he declined, but later realized the futility <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> after spending a night in custody. When directed not to preach during his two weeks of preparation, he again refused, {{and this time the}} court determined that such an injunction was not worth pursuing.|$|E
5|$|Determined to {{make one}} last show <b>of</b> <b>defiance,</b> Maxwell ordered the marines to wade towards the proas at low tide and open fire on them. This {{achieved}} no hits, but did persuade the Dayaks to move further offshore, and they departed entirely when the Ternate was spotted. The following day the survivors embarked on board Ternate, Maxwell having lost not one man on either the shipwreck or the island. At Batavia the crew were reunited with Amherst and his party, who had sent Ternate to search for them and subsequently chartered the East Indiaman Caesar {{for the remainder of}} the journey to Britain.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{inclement weather}} also {{hampered}} the Americans' advance, and until May 15 the recapturing forces were unsure {{of whether the}} Japanese had held their position or retreated. When the fog lifted on that day, {{it became clear that}} the Japanese had retreated further west. However, when the American forces gave chase, they were immediately slowed by an accidental air strike upon them by an American aircraft. By May 29, the Japanese forces numbered only 700–1,000, and these troops attempted to run through the advancing American forces as a last show <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> against the recapturing forces. By May 30, the Americans had recaptured Attu, and although a few small pockets of Japanese troops remained on the island, the Battle of Attu had essentially concluded.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Moore {{worked with}} her husband {{for the third time}} in the comedy Trust the Man, and starred in the true story of a 1950s housewife, The Prize Winner <b>of</b> <b>Defiance,</b> Ohio. Her first release of 2006 was Freedomland, a mystery co-starring Samuel L. Jackson. The {{response}} was overwhelmingly negative but her follow-up, Alfonso Cuarón's Children of Men (2006), was highly acclaimed. Moore had a supporting role in the dystopian drama, playing the leader of an activist group. It is listed on Rotten Tomatoes as one of the best reviewed films of her career, and was named by Peter Travers as the second best film of the decade.|$|E
5|$|In the Italian capital, Terlecki {{continued}} {{to defy the}} establishment. The players were under strict instructions not to associate with the Vatican while in Rome, but Terlecki arranged for them to meet Pope John Paul II, who was himself Polish. Seeing this as a second act <b>of</b> <b>defiance,</b> the PZPN promptly sent Terlecki, Młynarczyk, Boniek and Żmuda home, escorted by General Marian Ryba of the Polish Army, who was also the football association president. Lech Poznań's Piotr Mowlik replaced Młynarczyk for the match against Malta, which Poland won 2–0.|$|E
5|$|Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe is Argaven Harge's cousin. Tibe {{becomes the}} prime {{minister}} of Karhide when Estraven is exiled {{at the beginning of the}} novel, and becomes the regent for a brief while when Argaven is pregnant. In contrast to Estraven, he seems intent on starting a war with Orgoreyn over the Sinnoth Valley dispute; as well as taking aggressive actions at the border, he regularly makes belligerent speeches on the radio. He is strongly opposed to Ai's mission. He orders Estraven to be killed at the border at the end of the novel, as a last act <b>of</b> <b>defiance,</b> knowing that Estraven and Ai's presence in Karhide means his own downfall; he resigns immediately after Estraven's death.|$|E

5|$|The {{unexpected}} defeat stunned Gaddafi, {{who then}} reacted on January 4 by recalling to service {{all of the}} army reservists. In an act <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> towards France, he also ordered the bombing of Arada, well south of the 16th parallel. France retaliated with a new airstrike on Ouadi Doum and destroyed their radar system, effectively blinding the Libyan Air Force in Chad for several months. Gaddafi attempted to contain the FANT threat by rushing several new battalions into Chad (especially to Faya-Largeau and Ouadi Doum), including units of the elite Revolutionary Guard. This brought the amount of Libyan forces {{in the country to}} a total of 11,000 by March.|$|E
5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to her surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and {{it has been suggested that}} he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in the astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward gestures of friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E
5|$|In 920 Sitric left Dublin for Northumbria, {{with his}} kinsman Gofraid ua Ímair {{succeeding}} him as king. That same year {{he led a}} raid on Davenport, Cheshire, perhaps as an act <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> against Edward the Elder, King of the Anglo-Saxons. In 921 Ragnall ua Ímair died, with Sitric succeeding him as King of Northumbria. Though there are no written accounts of conflict, numismatic evidence suggests there was a Viking reconquest of {{a large part of}} Mercia in the following few years. An agreement of some sort between the Vikings of Northumbria and the Anglo-Saxons was achieved in 926 when Sitric married a sister of Æthelstan, perhaps Edith of Polesworth. Sitric also converted to Christianity, though this did not last long and he soon reverted to paganism. He died in 927 and was succeeded by his kinsman Gofraid ua Ímair. Sitric's son Gofraid later reigned as King of Dublin, his son Aralt as King of Limerick, and his son Amlaíb Cuarán as king of both Dublin and Northumbria.|$|E

5|$|Like {{most of his}} noble relatives, John {{opposed the}} tyrannical regime of Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1182–85), and {{had been forced to}} sign written pledge of loyalty to the emperor. Nevertheless, on 11 September 1185, when his nephew Isaac Angelos killed Andronikos I's chief henchman, Stephen Hagiochristophorites, and sought {{sanctuary}} in the Hagia Sophia cathedral, John and his eldest son Isaac rushed to his side, fearing the Emperor's retribution. By the next day, a popular uprising provoked by Isaac Angelos' act <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> had brought down the regime of Andronikos I, but Isaac Angelos hesitated to be crowned emperor. According to Niketas Choniates and Theodore Skoutariotes, John then bared his own head and offered his own bald head to be crowned, but the assembled people violently opposed this, refusing to be ruled by a man so old after the equally elderly Andronikos I, and Isaac Angelos was crowned.|$|E
5|$|On 29November, {{the crew}} {{assembled}} {{to consider the}} proposal {{that some of the}} slaves should be thrown overboard. James Kelsall later claimed that he had disagreed with the plan at first but it was soon unanimously agreed. On 29November, 54women and children were thrown through cabin windows into the sea. On 1December, 42male slaves were thrown overboard, and 36more followed in the next few days. Another ten, in a display <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> at the inhumanity of the slavers, jumped into the sea. Having heard the shrieks of the victims as they were thrown into the water, one slave requested that the remaining Africans be denied all food and drink rather than be thrown into the sea. The crew ignored this request. In total, 132 Africans were killed by the time the ship reached the Caribbean. The account of the King's Bench trial reports that one slave managed to climb back onto the ship.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Division {{arrived in}} Greece in late March and early April 1941, where they joined with a New Zealand and British force. On 6 April, the Germans began their {{invasion}} of Greece, sending {{a total of}} 27 divisions. After arriving in Greece, the Australians were transported north towards the Yugoslav border, where they took up defensive positions around the Florina Valley. During the fighting around Vevi that followed, troops from the 2/4th and 2/8th Infantry Battalions and the 2/3rd Field Regiment, from Brigadier George Vasey's 19th Brigade, fought against the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Despite their efforts, the Allied force, together with Greek units, was unable to halt the rapid German advance down central Greece towards Athens. The Allies were outflanked by the Germans, and by 27 April they were driven off the Greek mainland, with a final act <b>of</b> <b>defiance</b> being made around Porto Rafti. The division's casualties in Greece amounted to 320 killed, 494 wounded and 2,030 captured.|$|E
