5|$|After {{the first}} volume's release, a two-day Tokyo Mew Mew festival was held during the Golden Week holiday—a week-long span in late April and early May during which four public {{holidays}} occur—to promote the series. Events included a Tokyo Mew Mew art gallery {{and the release}} of new merchandise. Ikumi, the series' artist, created a special poster for the event, featuring all twelve characters. She also cosplayed as characters from the series, as Minto Aizawa <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> and Retasu Midorikawa on the other.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor Who campfire trailer is a forty-second {{television}} trailer {{which promoted}} the fourth {{series of the}} British science fiction television series Doctor Who. Filmed <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> in a studio, it stars David Tennant and Catherine Tate as the fourth series lead actors: the Tenth Doctor and his companion Donna Noble. The trailer was produced alongside three thematically similar but separate teaser trailers. The teaser trailers premiered in cinemas and on BBC One on 22 March 2008, and the full trailer premiered on BBC Online on 29 March 2008.|$|E

The South Staffordshire Battalion was split between the lifts <b>on</b> <b>day</b> <b>one</b> and <b>day</b> two; most of the unit arrived <b>on</b> <b>day</b> <b>one,</b> with the remaining balance arriving with the second lift.

5|$|The European Cup final {{had never}} before been played in Russia, making this match the easternmost final in the tournament's history; however, the Luzhniki Stadium had {{previously}} played host to the 1999 UEFA Cup Final, in which Italian club Parma beat French side Marseille 3–0. Because of the difference in time zones, the match kicked off at 22:45 Moscow Time, making it the first Champions League final to start <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> and finish in the next.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Ove Arup and Partners {{engineering}} {{undertook a}} feasibility study for a bridge downstream from the Monnow bridge, but the scheme was not progressed at that time. Both the County and Town Councils remained {{committed to the}} construction of a new crossing to support the economic development of the town, and in 2003 local authority funding of £1.3M was secured and construction commenced. The new bridge opened on 15 March 2004 for local traffic, allowing the old bridge to become pedestrianised. The closure to traffic also enabled a significant repair programme to be undertaken, in part funded by the Welsh Government and the European Union. After further conservation and repair, the gatehouse was formally re-opened in 2014, allowing public access <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> per week.|$|E
5|$|In early 1872, Macdonald {{submitted}} the treaty for ratification, and {{it passed the}} Commons with a majority of 66. The general election was held through late August and early September (future Canadian elections would be conducted, {{for the most part}}, <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>day).</b> Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially effective in the era when votes were publicly declared; in future elections the secret ballot would be used. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8. The Liberals (as the Grits were coming to be known) did better than the Conservatives in Ontario, forcing the government to rely on the votes of Western and Maritime MPs who did not fully support the party.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are {{occurring}} in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> changing {{the location of the}} basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors were standing on the edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E
