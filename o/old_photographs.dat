5|$|In the mid-1990s, the old shop house {{buildings}} were torn down, resulting in street peddlers displaying their wares on canvas sheets along the empty {{roads in the}} area. The peddlers did not pay rent, but the Singapore government forbade them from selling brand-new items. To {{keep up with the}} times, some of the peddlers put up their wares to sell on websites and eBay, especially those hard to sell items such as <b>old</b> <b>photographs,</b> badges, medals and other collector's items. The market remained until its final closure by the authorities on 10 July 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Goodison Park when built was a dense area full of terraced housing, and Goodison Avenue behind the Park End stand was no different. Oddly housing was built {{right into the}} stand itself (as shown on <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> of Goodison and in programmes). The club had {{previously}} owned many of the houses {{on the road and}} rented them to players. One of the players to live there, Dixie Dean later had a statue erected in his honour near the Park End on Walton Lane.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{attempted to}} recreate {{as many of}} historical venues within the game. For example, to fulfill Joe Perry's request that they recreate Max's Kansas City in New York, the developers used <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> and YouTube videos of the club during the 1970s, to a highly accurate degree, as claimed by those that had attended the club during that period. Within these venues, set decorations are inspired from Aerosmith album covers. Five that were confirmed are Pump, Toys in the Attic, Just Push Play, Get Your Wings, and Nine Lives.|$|E

5|$|The tree {{previously}} {{dominated the}} valley's farmed and grazed land, {{due to its}} height and full foliage, and was visible from a long distance, as is shown in <b>old</b> <b>photographs.</b> However, much of the surrounding land has now {{been taken over by}} forest, and Pi de les Tres Branques now has many other trees in its vicinity, which, together with its current skeletal form, make it much less visible than before.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main newspaper, the Echo also produces a number of regular supplements and articles of specialist interest each week. These include sport and business supplements each Monday, a Down Your Way local news supplement on Tuesdays, jobs, junior football and nostalgia features on Wednesdays, an entertainment supplement, cars guide and nostalgia stories on Thursdays and a property pull-out on Fridays. The Saturday edition includes a leisure pull-out, featuring fashion, entertainment and restaurant reviews, while a local history nostalgia supplement, Retro, is published once a month. Nostalgia calendars, featuring <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> of Sunderland and Seaham, are also produced.|$|E
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think. He sees <b>old</b> <b>photographs,</b> including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E

5|$|The company {{adapted the}} old {{gas station and}} café to act as the community's chamber of {{commerce}} and visitor center while preserving the building's architectural features and historical authenticity. <b>Old</b> <b>photographs</b> and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They peeled away decades of paint layers and fabric to find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, {{they had all been}} taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off, making it difficult to determine what color the lights originally were.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{then moved}} to Vaiden, Mississippi to film scenes set in the Carroll County Courthouse, where several courtroom scenes, as well as scenes set in Sheriff Ray Stuckey's office were filmed. The production moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, where the crew filmed a funeral procession. On April 11, 1988, the crew filmed a scene set in the Cedar Hill Cemetery. From April 15 to April 16, the production moved to the Mississippi River valley to depict the FBI and United States Navy's search for the three civil rights workers. The art department recreated a Choctaw Indian Village on the location, based on <b>old</b> <b>photographs.</b> On April 23, the crew filmed a scene depicting a Citizens' Councils rally with 750 extras. On April 25, the crew returned to Jackson, Mississippi, where an unused building was to recreate a diner that was found in Alabama during location scouting. A day later, Hackman and Dafoe filmed their opening scene, in which the characters Anderson and Ward drive to Jessup County, Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|While {{plans were}} {{under way to}} secure funding for the {{restoration}} of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the more}} modern buildings, {{including}} Senate House and the newer parts of the HH Wills Physics Laboratory, were designed by Ralph Brentnall after funds from the University Grants Committee. He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realise that is an extension to the original building. Brentnall oversaw the rebuilding of the Great Hall of the Wills Memorial Building after it was partly destroyed during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. The buildings of St Michael's Hill were rebuilt using hundreds of <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> to recreate the original houses. The flats at Goldney Hall were designed by Michael Grice and received an award from the Civic Trust for their design. Bristol University owns {{some of the best}} examples of Georgian architecture in the city, the best examples being Royal Fort House, Clifton Hill House and Goldney Hall despite some additions. The Victoria Rooms which house the Music Department were designed by Charles Dyer and is seen as a good example of a Greek revival movement in British architecture. The tympanum of the building depicts a scene from The Advent of Morning designed by Jabez Tyley. Its major feature was a large organ which has since been destroyed by fire.|$|E
25|$|The new Frauenkirche was reconstructed {{over seven}} years by architects using 3D {{computer}} technology to analyse <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> and every piece of rubble that had been kept and was formally consecrated on 30 October 2005, in a service attended by some 1,800 guests, including Germany's president, Horst Köhler; previous and current chancellors, Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel; and the Duke of Kent.|$|E
25|$|The new {{building}} was consecrated in early 1916, using the bell {{from the old}} church. Since then {{there have been few}} changes other than the remodeling of the parsonage. The columbarium was added to the nave in the 1950s and the basement was remodeled at some point. <b>Old</b> <b>photographs</b> also show all roofs having the same clay tiles as the tower.|$|E

25|$|The Small synagogue or Beit Medrash of 1782–86 is a well-built, -story, hip-roofed building. It has a women's prayer room {{above the}} vestibule. The windows were {{replaced}} and some alterations made after {{the devastation of}} the First World War. The building bears a plaque commemorating these repairs. The elaborate, polychrome folk paintings on the synagogue walls are reproduced from surviving plaster fragments and <b>old</b> <b>photographs.</b>|$|E
25|$|A spiral {{staircase}} {{leads to a}} viewing platform {{at the top of}} the monument, which is occasionally opened to the public. <b>Old</b> <b>photographs</b> indicate that the monument was originally on a traffic island and was surrounded by railings. These railings are no longer present, and the area around the monument is now pedestrianised and is home to many shops, some independent and some up-scale designer boutiques.|$|E
25|$|<b>Old</b> <b>photographs</b> {{reveal that}} {{early in the}} 19th century, part of {{the front of the}} Birthplace was faced with brick. This was an {{economical}} alternative to the common practice of replacing timber-framed buildings and rebuilding in brick in 18th century England. Referring to an engraving of 1769 as well as taking into account surviving architectural evidence, a reconstruction carried out by the Trust between 1857 and 1864 has restored the outside of the building to its 16th century state.|$|E

25|$|In 1984 a research-driven {{restoration}} was begun. The {{period of}} the building's construction was adopted, using <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> and engravings as sources, and paint analysis to replicate original colors, the interior spaces were returned closely to their 1875 appearance. Walls were repainted rose madder and the original Cummings and Sears' stencil patterns were recreated. The cupola was reopened, once more admitting light to the Sanctuary below. Polychrome stenciling repeated the original palette of ochre, bay leaf green, warm gray, and persimmon with metallic gold.|$|E
25|$|The Torah Ark is {{particularly}} fine. It is a 2004 {{restoration of the}} Torah Ark built in 1936, itself reproducing from <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> the wooden Torah Ark lost to fire in 1934. It is noted for the fine carvings, including carvings of musical instruments, that commemorate the Temple of Solomon. The Ark is three stories high, with windows on {{the second and third}} stories. Elaborate carved arks of this kind were not unusual in Polish synagogues; the Wlodawa Ark was regarded as a particularly fine example, but it is unusual mostly because it survives.|$|E
25|$|The artwork for {{the album}} was {{initially}} going to be created by an outsider artist, but {{after a series of}} disagreements with the label, Corgan was forced to step in at the last minute. The album booklet, composed of <b>old</b> <b>photographs</b> of both strangers and Corgan's family members with lyrics handwritten on top, was assembled by Corgan and his wife the day after their wedding. Corgan was not satisfied with the results. The first pressing of the CD contained a 20-page booklet, with a separate page devoted to each song's lyrics and accompanying photograph; later pressings contained a four-panel fold-out liner with thumbnails of each picture. In 1999, Virgin Records reissued the album with the original 20-page booklet.|$|E
