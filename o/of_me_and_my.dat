5|$|The record shows, {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E

500|$|Julian Lennon {{discovered}} that [...] "Hey Jude" [...] {{had been written}} for him almost 20 years after McCartney composed the song. He recalled of his and McCartney's relationship: [...] "Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going {{and there seems to}} be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> dad." [...] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time: [...] "He has a few photographs of his father, but not very much else. He is collecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like." ...|$|E

2500|$|On December 9, 2011, Ford {{signed a}} {{contract}} with the San Antonio Spurs. On March 12, 2012, after playing 14 games, he announced on Twitter that he would retire. He suffered from a stinger after being elbowed in his back by Baron Davis during a game against the New York Knicks on March 7, 2012: [...] "If it's anybody else, it's just a regular play. But because <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> condition a simple elbow in the back has a different outcome than hitting someone else in the back." [...] On March 15, 2012, Ford, Richard Jefferson and a 2012 first-round pick were traded to the Golden State Warriors. Ford was then waived by the Warriors.|$|E
2500|$|A notable stylistic {{technique}} {{used in the}} adaptation is the multiple addresses direct to camera. For example, Henry's [...] "I know not what to say, my title's weak" [...] (1.1.135), [...] "All will revolt from me, and turn to him" [...] (1.1.152), [...] "And I with grief and sorrow to the court" [...] (1.1.211), and [...] "Revenged may she be on that hateful Duke,/Whose haughty spirit, wing'd with desire,/Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle/Tire on the flesh <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> son" [...] (1.1.267–270); Exeter's [...] "And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all" [...] (1.1.274); the entirety of York's soliloquy in Act 1, Scene 4; Warwick's pause to get his breath during the Battle of Barnet (2.3.1–5); all of Act 2, Scene 5 (including dialogue from Henry, {{the father and the}} son) up to the entry of Prince Edward at line 125; all of Henry's monologue in Act 3, Scene 1, prior to his arrest (ll.13–54); Richard's entire soliloquy in Act 3, Scene 2 (ll.124–195); Margaret's [...] "Ay, now begins a second storm to rise,/For this is he that moves both wind and tide" [...] (3.3.47–48); Warwick's soliloquy {{at the end of the}} Act 3, Scene 3 (ll.257–268); Richard's [...] "I hear, yet say not much, but think the more" [...] (4.1.85) and [...] "Not I, my thoughts aim at a further matter:/I stay not for love of Edward but the crown" [...] (141.124–125); Warwick's [...] "O unbid spite, is sportful Edward come" [...] (5.1.18); the entirety of Richard's soliloquy in Act 5, Scene 6, after killing Henry (ll.61–93) and Richard's [...] "To say the truth, so Judas kissed his master/And cried 'All hail', whenas he meant all harm" [...] (5.7.33–34).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{recurring}} motif is animal imagery, particularly, bird imagery. The first {{example is}} in Act 1, Scene 1, when Warwick says [...] " [...] dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells" [...] (l.47), {{a reference to}} falconry. Again in the opening scene, Henry claims that York will, [...] "like an empty eagle/Tire on the flesh <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> son" [...] (ll.269–270). Later, as York describes his failed attempts to win the recently concluded battle, he muses to himself, [...] "We botched again, as I have often seen a swan/With bootless labour swim against the tide" [...] (1.4.19–20). Subsequently, as Clifford tells York he will soon die, York declares [...] "My ashes, as the Phoenix', may bring forth/A bird that will revenge upon you all" [...] (1.4.35–36), to which Clifford replies [...] "So cowards fight when they can fly no further,/So doves peck the falcon's piercing talons" [...] (1.4.40–41). After the news of York's death has reached them, Richard encourages Edward to take York's place; [...] "If thou be that princely eagle's bird" [...] (2.1.91). Later, Warwick points out that Henry has been compelled to rescind his oath to yield the throne to the House of York; [...] "Clifford and the Lord Northumberland/And of their feather many more proud birds,/Have wrought the easy-melting King like wax" [...] (2.1.169–171). When Clifford is urging Henry to protect the Prince's birthright, he attempts to illustrate to Henry that {{doing the right thing}} for his children should be a natural course of action; [...] "Doves will peck in safeguard of their brood" [...] (2.2.18). During the debate about the rightful king, Edward refers to Clifford as [...] "that fatal screech owl/That nothing sung but death to us and ours" [...] (2.6.55–56). Bird imagery continues to be used contemptuously in France, where Margaret says of Edward and Warwick, [...] "both of you are birds of selfsame feather" [...] (3.3.161). Prior to the Battle of Barnet, as Somerset attempts to rally the troops, he says [...] "And he that will not fight for such a hope,/Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,/If he arise, be mocked and wondered at" [...] (5.4.55–57). When Richard visits Henry in the tower, Henry defends his suspicion of Richard's intentions; [...] "The bird that hath been lim'd in a bush,/With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush" [...] (5.6.13–14). Birds also play an important part in Henry's prophecy of Richard's future evil reign, as he points out the many ill omens accompanying Richard's birth; [...] "The owl shrieked at thy birth, an evil sign,/The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time,/Dogs howled and hideous tempest shook down trees,/The raven rooked her on the chimney's top,/And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung" [...] (5.6.44–48).|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} Ada {{came down to}} see <b>me.</b> Grieved <b>and</b> shocked as she was, the dear girl had thought <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sorrow--greater even than hers--and so had driven down in her brougham to see me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{said the}} girl, softly but heartily. [...] "I {{am sure you}} need not trouble {{yourself}} any further. It was so awkward <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>my</b> shoe heels are horridly common-sense; I can't blame them at all." ...|$|E
