5|$|About half-past <b>one</b> <b>o'clock</b> on the morning, an {{explosion}} {{took place in}} Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but one destroyed. The accident occurred {{at the time of}} calling course, or when one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and mangled.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' last {{concert was}} at Candlestick Park, San Francisco, on 29 August 1966, but Evans {{continued}} {{to work for them}} in the studio, and to run errands. After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of <b>one</b> <b>o'clock,</b> Evans was standing under the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.|$|E

25|$|The ball, {{constructed}} {{of wood and}} covered in zinc, and weighing , is raised just before 1pm, and at precisely 1pm, is dropped from atop the mast. Later, in 1861, the <b>One</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Gun was established at Edinburgh Castle to provide an audible signal when fog obscured the time ball. The time ball was operated for over 150 years, until it was damaged by a storm in 2007. In 2009, {{as part of the}} restoration of the monument, the time ball was removed, and the mechanism repaired. The time ball was brought back into service on 24 September 2009. The mechanism is now operated manually, based on the firing of the <b>One</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Gun.|$|E
25|$|The station's {{founding}} executives George and Alfred Black {{used their}} theatrical background {{to produce a}} lot of light entertainment programming on Tyne Tees in the early years. One {{of the best known}} was The <b>One</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Show, a 40-minute variety show broadcast on weekdays. After 1,098 editions and more than five years on air, the final show was broadcast in March 1964. Some editions of The <b>One</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Show were produced by David Croft, who would go on to co-write many BBC situation comedies. For Tyne Tees, Croft also directed and produced the Ned's Shed and Mary Goes to Market admags, as well as producing his first sitcom, Under New Management, set in a derelict pub in the North of England.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the telegraph may be gathered from two facts. In 1855, {{the death of the}} Emperor Nicholas at St. Petersburg, about <b>one</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the afternoon, was announced in the House of Lords a few hours later. The result of The Oaks of 1890 was received in New York fifteen seconds after the horses passed the winning-post.|$|E

25|$|Preparations {{to perform}} a final assault on the fort began on 20 October; siege ladders were distributed, and {{officers}} were told where they would strike the fort. Finally, on 22 October, Peter decided to perform the assault. At <b>one</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning, a fire {{broke out in the}} fort. Local hunters and men from the Preobrazhensky Regiment, among others, waited at the ready in landing boats, two miles away from the fort. At half-past two, mortar shots were fired, which was the signal to commence the attack.|$|E
25|$|In {{country music}} Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican, and Bob Wills {{combined}} elements of swing and blues {{to create a}} western swing. Mullican left the Cliff Bruner band to pursue solo career that included many songs that maintained a swing structure. Artists like Willie Nelson and Asleep at the Wheel have continued the swing elements of country music. Asleep at the Wheel has also recorded the Count Basie tunes <b>One</b> <b>O'Clock</b> Jump, Jumpin' at the Woodside, and Song of the Wanderer using a steel guitar as a stand-in for a horn section. Nat King Cole followed Sinatra into pop music, bringing with him a similar combination of swing and ballads. Like Mullican, he was important in bringing piano to the fore of popular music.|$|E
25|$|About <b>one</b> <b>o'clock,</b> {{the massive}} Confederate {{artillery}} barrage {{in support of}} the upcoming assault on Cemetery Ridge began. Jenkins' men renewed the attack, but soon ran out of ammunition and fell back. Resupplied, they again pressed the attack. Outnumbered, the Union cavalry fell back, firing as they went. Custer sent most of his Fifth Michigan cavalry ahead on foot, forcing Jenkins' men to fall back. Jenkins' men were reinforced by about 150 sharpshooters from General Fitzhugh Lee's brigade and, shortly after, Stuart ordered a mounted charge by the Ninth Virginia Cavalry and the Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry. Now it was Custer's men who were running out of ammunition. The Fifth Michigan was forced back and the battle was reduced to vicious, hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

25|$|Just before 8am on 28 November 2003 an {{electrical}} fault caused some equipment to overheat, which set off fire alarms. Although {{there was no}} fire, the fault caused widespread power cuts and prevented backup generators from providing alternative power. All output was affected with services transferred across London to alternative studios. The <b>One</b> <b>O'Clock</b> News and BBC News 24 broadcast {{for much of the}} day from the BBC's Millbank Studios, and the Today programme and Five Live's Breakfast morning radio shows fell off air for 15 minutes. The Millbank Studios are a fall-back for news operations in the event of TVC failure, and are continually recording the last hour of the BBC News Channel output (sans in-vision clock) for this purpose. This power cut came on the week prior to the relaunch of News 24, which was postponed for another week to ensure that all problems had been remedied.|$|E

25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing wood chips about the house and putting dirt or cow manure in the milk cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He must go on St John's Day between noon and <b>one</b> <b>o'clock,</b> into the forest. When he finds an anthill with a bird on it, he must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can then transfer the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E

Still far from land, and with no help nearby, Luce ordered that the ship's lifeboats be prepared for launching, In accordance with the governing maritime regulations, Arctic carried six steel-constructed boats, one of which had departed with Gourlay. [...] The five remaining boats could safely hold 150 persons, well under half of those on board but with more than enough places to hold all the women and children. Under the charge of the ship's quartermaster, {{women and children were}} placed in the port guard boat, but as this orderly process proceeded, a group of male passengers and crew members rushed forward to claim the remaining places, and the boat was filled.

The Athens Banner described the team's arrival for a game with Georgia: [...] "The Commodores arrived here at <b>one</b> <b>o'clock</b> Friday afternoon, and were whisked directly to the Georgian Hotel. Curious hundreds of Bulldog supporters shuddered at the procession of Vandy giants as they strolled down the sidewalks, led by Huge Tot McCullough, with spry Froggy Miers and clever Doc Kuhn bringing up the rear."

According to Mills, [...] " [...] we could prove to [...] that we needed something to get the shot done, then we'd have it."
