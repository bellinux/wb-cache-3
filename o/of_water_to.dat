5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's {{habitable}} zone, its gravitational influence would disrupt {{the orbit of}} planets in the outer part of the habitable zone. In addition, it may have disrupted the formation of terrestrial planets and reduced the delivery <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris {{are likely to be}} small and dry.|$|E
5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well understood, mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale.

5|$|Initially, sauropods {{were thought}} to be mainly aquatic, inhabiting lush peat swamps and being captive to the {{buoyancy}} <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> support their giant body weights. In 1984, Cooper pointed out that Vulcanodon, the most primitive sauropod known at that time, lived in a desert like environment and therefore must have been terrestrial. This indicated that the large body size of sauropods, as already seen in Vulcanodon, had not evolved as an adaptation to an aquatic life style.|$|E

5|$|All of Florida's {{abundant}} {{fresh water}} {{is the result of}} precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called evapotranspiration that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in aquifers. A surficial aquifer consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> percolate down to recharge the layer below. The Floridan Aquifer, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible {{in the northern part of}} Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from St. Petersburg north to Jacksonville and Tallahassee.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>to</b> survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes unless there are wet depressions present, and from hillsides {{unless there is a}} seepage area. The fertility of the soil is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E
