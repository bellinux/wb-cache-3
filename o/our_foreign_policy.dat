In the spring of 2004, and again in 2005, he publicly called on Blair to stand down in favour of Gordon Brown.

2500|$|In March 2015, Steve Cohen {{boycotted the}} speech of the Prime Minister of Israel to Congress, writing: [...] "While Americans and members of Congress may {{disagree}} on anything, even foreign policy, providing a forum of such immense prestige and power to the leader of another country who is opposing our nation’s foreign policy is [...] It endangers the negotiations, insults the good faith of the other nations involved in the negotiations and emboldens Iran who may well view this schism in our government {{as an opportunity for}} advantage.

Tony Judt, writing in the New York Times, asked rhetorically, [...] "Does the Israel Lobby affect <b>our</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> choices? Of coursethat is one of its goals.

2500|$|The {{doctrine}} is most explicitly stated in a December 8, 2010, surprise appearance talk that Clinton {{made at the}} TEDWoman Conference in Washington, D.C.:So the United States has made empowering women and girls a cornerstone of <b>our</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> because women's equality {{is not just a}} moral issue, it's not just a humanitarian issue, {{it is not just a}} fairness issue; it is a security issue. It is a prosperity issue and it is a peace issue ... Give women equal rights, and entire nations are more stable and secure. Deny women equal rights, and the instability of nations is almost certain. The subjugation of women is, therefore, a threat to the common security of our world and to the national security of our country.The principle was incorporated into the inaugural Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review that was conducted and published by the State Department during 2009–10, which mentioned women and girls over 130times and which said [...] "The protection and empowerment of women and girls is key to the foreign policy and security of the United States." ...|$|E

The Brief argues that instead of making an exception for India, Australia should work to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation system and engage India in that process.

40|$|Scholars, social activists, {{and policy}} makers often regard the United States 2 ̆ 7 <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> {{as it relates to}} human rights and its {{domestic}} policy with respect to race as distinct areas, separated by the nation 2 ̆ 7 s border. Although this border exists geographically, through the assertion of jurisdiction, and in the recognition of citizenship, is there really a border between <b>our</b> <b>foreign</b> and domestic <b>policy</b> in these matters? The U.

60|$|The Press is {{the second}} great factor to which critics of {{capitalism}} point when they wish to prove that capitalism {{is the source of}} modern war. Since the running of a big newspaper requires a large capital, the proprietors of important organs necessarily belong to the capitalist class, {{and it will be a}} rare and exceptional event if they do not sympathize with their own class in opinion and outlook. They are able to decide what news the great mass of newspaper readers shall be allowed to have. They can actually falsify the news, or, without going so far as that, they can carefully select it, giving such items as will stimulate the passions which they desire to stimulate, and suppressing such items as would provide the antidote. In this way the picture of the world in the mind of the average newspaper reader is made to be not a true picture, but in the main that which suits the interests of capitalists. This is true in many directions, but above all in what con- cerns the relations between nations. The mass of the population of a country can be led to love or hate any other country at the will of the newspaper proprietors, which is often, directly or indirectly, influenced by the will of the great financiers. So long as enmity between England and Russia was desired, our newspapers were full of the cruel treatment meted out to Russian political prisoners, the oppression of Finland and Russian Poland, and other such topics. As soon as <b>our</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> changed, these items disappeared from the more important newspapers, and we heard instead of the misdeeds of Germany. Most men are not sufficiently critical to be on their guard against such influences, and until they are, the power of the Press will remain.|$|E
6000|$|I {{need not}} here {{go through the}} long list of topics. As an attack upon ministers Mr. Gladstone made out the upshot to be finance in confusion, {{legislation}} in arrear, honour compromised by breach of public law, Russia aggrandized and yet estranged, Turkey befriended, as they say, but sinking every year, Europe restless and disturbed; in Africa the memory of enormous bloodshed in Zululand, and the invasion of a free people in the Transvaal; Afghanistan broken; India thrown back. He disclaimed all fellowship with those who believe that the present state of society permits us to make any vow of universal peace, and of renouncing in all cases the policy of war. He enumerated the six principles that he thought to be the right principles for us: to foster the strength of the empire by just laws and by economy; to seek to preserve the world’s peace; to strive to the uttermost to cultivate and maintain the principle of concert in Europe; to avoid needless and entangling engagements; to see that <b>our</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> shall be inspired by such love of freedom as had marked Canning, Palmerston, Russell; to acknowledge the equal right of all nations. He denounced “the policy of denying to others the rights that we claim ourselves” as untrue, arrogant, and dangerous. The revival of the analogy of imperial Rome for the guidance of British policy he held up as fundamentally unsound and practically ruinous. For have not modern times established a sisterhood of nations, equal, independent, each of them built up under the legitimate defence which public law affords to every nation living within its own borders, and seeking to perform its own affairs? He insisted that we should ever “remember the rights of the savage, as we call him.” “Remember,” he exclaimed, “that the sanctity of life in the hill villages of Afghanistan, among the winter snows, is as inviolable in the eye of Almighty God as can be your own. Remember that He who has united you as human beings in the same flesh and blood, has bound you by the law of mutual love; that that mutual love is not limited by the shores of this island, is not limited by the boundaries of Christian civilisation; that it passes over the whole surface of the earth, and embraces the meanest along with the greatest in its unmeasured scope.” ...|$|E

40|$|Status-seeking is an {{important}} aspect of the <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of a number of small states, but one that has been rarely studied. This book aims to contribute to our understanding not only of status-seeking, by coming at that question from a new angle, that of a small state, but also to <b>our</b> understanding of <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> by discussing the importance of status for <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> overall. If status is a hierarchy, then it is important to focus not just on the highest-ranking powers, but also those at lower levels. As the distribution of power is becoming more diffuse, the role of small and medium powers becomes more significant than it was during the Cold war. The book chapters go beyond familiar explications of "soft power" or conflict resolution to highlight new aspects of Norway’s <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> including contributions to national defense, global warming, and management of Arctic resources. This book will be of interest to students and scholars in areas including US <b>Foreign</b> <b>Policy,</b> International Relations and European Politics...|$|R
