40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{critically}} review the potential role of aceclofenac in the treatment of inflammatory pain and chronic <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorder,</b> based on its activity on the mediators of inflammation, its effect on cartilage remodeling and on the results of clinical studies comparing aceclofenac with other NSAIDs in these disorders. Aceclofenac has an outstanding anti-inflammatory profile, involving besides a classical inhibition of prostaglandins E 2, a decrease in the expression of several cytokines including interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. It also inhibits activated oxygen species production and influences cells adhesion. Aceclofenac and its main metabolite, 4 -hydroxyaceclofenac, has positive effects on cartilage anabolism combined with modulating effect of matrix catabolism. Clinically, aceclofenac has been consistently shown to have a similar efficacy than that of widely marketed NSAIDs and a tolerance profile at least as good, if not better than the profile observed for other NSAIDs in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. As of today, no head to head comparison between aceclofenac and coxibs have been performed, nor for efficacy neither for tolerance. The specific profile of aceclofenac makes this NSAID an interesting candidate for long-term treatment of chronic rheumatic disorders as well as for treatment of acute inflammatory episodes.

40|$|High {{concentrations}} of fulvic acid and selenium deficiency {{are the main}} causative factors of Kashin-Beck disease, an endemic, chronic and degenerative <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorder</b> found in China. In the search for an animal model of this disease, mice were exposed to these pathogenetic conditions for two generations and the collagen types from skin, bone and cartilage were analysed. The growth of the treated mice was slightly retarded, {{and the rate of}} reproduction was lower in animals maintained on a fulvic acid-supplemented and/or selenium-deficient diet. Irregular bone formation was seen by radiography and morphometry. Biochemical analysis indicated that lysine residues in collagen I from bone and in collagen II from cartilage were overmodified. The values of Hyl/(Hyl+Lys) in bone collagen alpha 1 (I) chains from treated mice were about 0. 434 - 0. 484, i. e. substantially higher than that of the control (0. 277). The values of this parameter for collagen II were 0. 482 for control and 0. 546 - 0. 566 for treated mice. The melting temperature of collagen I from bones of treated mice was 1 degrees C lower than that of control collagen, indicating decreased thermal stability. The breakage point of the tibiae of treated mice occurred at a lower preload force than for controls, suggesting that the overmodified and thermally less stable collagen molecules are causally related to a lower mechanical strength of bones...|$|E

On both occasions, the same questionnaire was completed during a home interview. <b>Osteoarticular</b> <b>disorders</b> were evaluated by the presence of pain, with or without restricted joint movement, for at least six months before interview. The heavy physical work factors were those reported by the subject at the first interview, and only subjects who stated that they had been exposed to these factors for more than 10 years were considered as exposed persons. For those who were seen twice, the frequency of osteoarticular pain increased during the five years between the two interviews, from 52 % to 65 % in the men and 72 % to 82 % in the women. Among both sexes, these frequencies were significantly higher in those who stated that in the past they had to carry heavy weights and work in tiring positions. The increases in frequency of pain during the five year study period were also related to these occupational factors.

BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Kashin-Beck {{disease is a}} {{degenerative}} <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorder</b> that is endemic to certain areas of Tibet, where selenium deficiency is also endemic. Because selenium is involved in thyroid hormone metabolism, we studied the relation among the serum selenium concentration, thyroid function, and Kashin-Beck disease in 575 subjects 5 to 15 years of age in 12 villages around Lhasa, Tibet, including 1 control village in which no subject had Kashin-Beck disease. Clinical, radiologic, and biochemical data were collected. RESULTS: Among the 575 subjects, 280 (49 percent) had Kashin-Beck disease, 267 (46 percent) had goiter, and 7 (1 percent) had cretinism. Of the 557 subjects in whom urinary iodine was measured, 66 percent had a urinary iodine concentration of less than 2 microg per deciliter (157 nmol per liter; normal, 5 to 25 microg per deciliter [394 to 1968 nmol per liter]). The mean urinary iodine concentration was lower in subjects with Kashin-Beck disease than in control subjects (1. 2 vs. 1. 8 microg per deciliter [94 vs. 142 nmol per liter], P< 0. 001) and hypothyroidism was more frequent (23 percent vs. 4 percent, P= 0. 01). Severe selenium deficiency was documented in all villages; 38 percent of subjects had serum concentrations of less than 5 ng per milliliter (64 nmol per liter; normal, 60 to 105 ng per milliliter [762 to 1334 nmol per liter]). When age and sex were controlled for in a multivariate analysis, low urinary iodine, high serum thyrotropin, and low serum thyroxine-binding globulin values were {{associated with an increased}} risk of Kashin-Beck disease, but a low serum selenium concentration was not. CONCLUSIONS: In areas where severe selenium deficiency is endemic, iodine deficiency is a risk factor for Kashin-Beck disease...|$|E
40|$|Comparative Medicine - OneHealth and Comparative Medicine Poster SessionHyperthermia is {{used for}} the {{treatment}} of a number of diseases, including muscle injuries, inflammations, tendinitis, and <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorder.</b> More recently, hyperthermia has been used as an adjuvant in cancer treatment. Only two studies have shown that hyperthermia leads to hypertrophy in in-vitro models of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Functional, biochemical and molecular mechanisms of hyperthermia-induced hypertrophy in muscles remain largely undiscovered. We investigated the effects of mild heat shock (HS) on C 2 C 12 skeletal, HL- 1 cardiac and AR- 75 smooth muscle cells. Mild HS (20 min 43 ºC) induced increases in the cell area in all muscle cells tested. C 2 C 12 cells are a well-accepted model of skeletal muscle fibers, and were selected for complementary studies. First, to biochemically confirm an increase in protein synthesis we measured and found an increase of ~ 6 % in total protein content 24 hrs after HS. Second, we examined potential modifications in calcium (Ca) homeostasis regulation by measuring intracellular Ca. We detected a lower resting level of intracellular Ca and smaller and longer caffeine-induced Ca transients in C 2 C 12 muscle cells 24 hrs after HS. Next, to search for molecular mechanisms involved with HS-induced hypertrophy and calcium homeostasis modifications, mRNA from C 2 C 12 muscle cells was analyzed at different time points after HS (0, 1, 2, and 24 hrs). We used an ABI Step One Plus RT 2 PCR Array System and a custom-built 96 gene array. We report {{for the first time that}} the expression of key heat-shock, hypertrophy/ metabolic, and Ca+ 2 signaling genes were altered after HS. Hsp 70 and Hsp 72 genes were highly expressed (211 - 1829 fold change) after HS. Also, Myh 7 (MHC-I), Myh 6, Srf, Ppp 3 r 1 and Pck 1 were up-regulated by 2 - 6 fold change compared with control cells [...] Furthermore, a reduction in the expression of RyR and Trdn genes was observed (2 - 3. 6 fold change) with an associated increase in the expression of IP 3 R genes (2 - 4 fold change). These results indicate that hyperthermia modulates not only heat-shock related and hypertrophy genes, but also genes involved with metabolism, apoptosis repression, calcium homeostasis and signaling, and cell homeostasis. Our studies offer an initial exploration of the functional, biochemical and molecular mechanisms that may help explain the beneficially adaptive effects of hyperthermia on muscle function. Our studies shall also prove useful for the refinement of a specific device (EM-Stim) to be employed for the treatment of muscle and bone diseases (See poster by Hatem et al). Importantly, our studies have potential translational applications. By learning how to more precisely use hyperthermia to control specific genes that can improve or treat muscle injuries, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular diseases, the ensuing benefits shall be unmistakable. Our short and long-term goals are: i) optimize our protocols; ii) test HS in animal models; iii) manipulate expression of promising genes of interest in vitro and in in-vivo animal models; iv) initiate clinical studies to fully translate from the bench to the bed-side...|$|E

40|$|Interleukin 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) is a {{pleiotropic}} pro-inflammatory cytokine {{that plays}} a key role in mediating cartilage degradation in <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorders</b> such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). At the cellular level, IL- 1 beta activates matrix degrading enzymes, down-regulates expression of matrix components and induces chondrocyte apoptosis. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is an anti-inflammatory phytochemical agent that has recently been shown to antagonize the pro-inflammatory effects of cytokines in chondrocytes and other cells. To test the hypothesis that curcumin also protects chondrocytes from morphological alterations induced by IL- 1 beta, we investigated its in vitro effects on apoptotic signalling proteins and key cartilage-specific matrix components in IL- 1 beta-stimulated chondrocytes. Human articular chondrocytes were pre-treated with 10 ng/mI IL- 1 beta alone for 30 min before being co-treated with IL- 1 beta and 50 microM curcumin for 5, 15 or 30 min, respectively. The ultrastructural morphology of chondrocytes was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. The production of collagen type II, the adhesion and signal transduction receptor beta 1 -integrin, the apoptosis marker activated caspase- 3 was analysed by immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy and Western blotting. Transmission electron microscopy of chondrocytes stimulated with IL- 1 beta revealed early degenerative changes which were relieved by curcumin co-treatment. The suppression of collagen type II and beta 1 -integrin synthesis by IL- 1 beta was inhibited by curcumin. Additionally, curcumin antagonized IL- 1 beta-induced caspase- 3 activation in a time-dependent manner. This study clearly demonstrates that curcumin exerts anti-apoptotic and anti-catabolic effects on IL- 1 beta-stimulated articular chondrocytes. Therefore curcumin may have novel therapeutic potential as an adjunct nutraceutical chondroprotective agent for treating OA and related <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Musculoskeletal {{conditions}} {{are a major}} burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and social care systems throughout the world, with indirect costs having a predominant economic impact. Aging is a major contributing factor to the development and progression of arthritic and musculoskeletal diseases.

The term 'chondrosenescence' has recently been introduced to define the age-dependent deterioration of chondrocyte function and how it undermines cartilage function in OA. An important component of chondrosenescence is the age-related deregulation of subcellular signaling pathways in chondrocytes. This mini-review discusses the role of age-related alterations in chondrocyte signaling pathways. We focus our attention on two major areas: age-dependent alterations in transforming growth factor-beta signaling and changes in protein kinase and phosphoprotein phosphatase activities in aging chondrocytes.

Since expression of VEGFR- 3 (Flt- 4) in chondrocytes {{has not yet been}} investigated, we studied the distribution of VEGFR- 3 in osteoarthritic cartilage samples by immunohistochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Furthermore, we looked for functional colocalization of VEGFR- 3 with the signal transduction receptor beta(1) -integrin. Superficial osteoarthritic chondrocytes exhibited VEGFR- 3 expression in the cytoplasm and on the cell membrane. Using western blotting we could demonstrate that interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) stimulates the expression of VEGFR- 3 in chondrocytes in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. By coimmunoprecipitation assay we found a functional complex between the beta(1) -integrin and VEGFR- 3 in IL- 1 beta-stimulated chondrocytes indicating that activated VEGFR- 3 may interact with beta(1) -integrin and associated subcellular pathways in osteoarthritic chondrocytes. Taken together with results of previous studies showing that beta(1) -integrins were also associated with other surface receptors and proteins in chondrocytes that cause cartilage destruction in arthritis (for example, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor and matrix metalloproteinases), we can hypothesize that signal transduction by these receptor complexes via beta(1) -integrins may {{play a crucial role in}} pathogenesis of <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorders.</b> Further work needs to be done to elucidate downstream signaling events activated by these receptors...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{review the}} epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, treatment, pathogenesis, and {{genetics}} of the syndrome known under the acronym of SAPHO for Synovitis, Acne, Pustulosis, Hyperostosis, and Osteitis to heighten awareness of this entity. MethodsWe conducted a Medline search using SAPHO syndrome, chronic recurrent multifocal osteitis/osteomyelitis, and related terms as keywords and extracted further relevant articles from the retrieved references. ResultsThe SAHPO acronym identifies a syndrome encompassing {{a variety of}} <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorders</b> that are frequently accompanied by dermatoses characterized by neutrophilic pseudoabscesses, but can also occur in isolation. SAPHO syndrome is rare, although probably underrecognized because its diagnosis may be challenging because of the wide variability in its musculoskeletal and cutaneous manifestations. This is especially true when atypical sites are involved and when specific skin lesions are absent. There are no standardized treatment protocols available. Current treatments are empirical and {{have the objective of}} providing relief from the at times debilitating pain associated with SAPHO syndrome. They include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics as first-line agents. Systemic corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, biologicals targeting tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin- 1, and bisphosphonates have all been beneficial in some patients, but ineffective in others. This suggests that the pathogenesis of SAPHO syndrome is multifactorial, but this aspect remains poorly explored, although bacteria and immunological dysfunction are hypothesized to play a role. ConclusionsThe early recognition, diagnosis, and prompt treatment of SAPHO syndrome can prevent the unnecessary use of long-term antibiotics or invasive procedures, while rapidly alleviating pain in a majority of affected patients...|$|R
40|$|Defects of {{load-bearing}} connective tissues such as articular cartilage, often {{result from}} trauma, degenerative or age-related disease. Osteoarthritis (OA) presents a major clinical challenge to clinicians {{due to the}} limited inherent repair capacity of articular cartilage. Articular cartilage defects are increasingly common among the elderly population causing pain, reduced joint function and significant disability among affected patients. The poor capacity for self-repair of chondral defects {{has resulted in the}} development of a large variety of treatment approaches including Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation (ACT), microfracture and mosaicplasty methods. In ACT, a cartilage biopsy is taken from the patient and articular chondrocytes are isolated. The cells are then expanded after several passages in vitro and used to fill the cartilage defect. Since its introduction, ACT has become a widely applied surgical method with good to excellent clinical outcomes. More recently, classical ACT has been combined with tissue engineering and implantable scaffolds for improved results. However, there are still major problems associated with the ACT technique which relate mainly to chondrocyte de-differentiation during the expansion phase in monolayer culture and the poor integration of the implants into the surrounding cartilage tissue. Novel approaches using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an alternative cell source to patient derived chondrocytes are currently on trial. MSCs have shown significant potential for chondrogenesis in animal models.

Immunohistochemistry was employed semi-quantitatively to compare the expression of AQP 1 in human chondrocytes derived from normal, OA and RA joints. PCR, cloning and sequencing confirmed the presence of AQP 1 transcripts in chondrocytes. Normal human tissue microarrays including samples of kidney, choroid plexus and pancreas were used as positive controls for AQP 1 expression. In most tissues AQP 1 was expressed along endothelial barriers. In the kidney AQP 1 was present in the glomerular capillary endothelium, proximal tubule and descending thin limbs. AQP 1 was also localized to pancreatic ducts and acini and the apical membrane domain of the choroid plexus. Immunohistochemistry showed that AQP 1 is expressed in synovial micro-vessels, synoviocytes and predominantly in chondrocytes located in the deep zone of articular cartilage. Image analysis of normal, OA and RA cartilage suggested that AQP 1 may be upregulated in RA. This is the first report of AQP 1 mRNA and protein expression in articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes.

The effects of curcumin were studied in cultures of human articular chondrocytes treated with IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha for up to 72 h. Expression of collagen type II, integrin beta 1, cyclo-oxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) was monitored by western blotting. The effects of curcumin on the expression, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of protein components of the NF-kappaB system were studied by western blotting and immunofluorescence, respectively. Treatment of chondrocytes with curcumin suppressed IL- 1 beta-induced NF-kappaB activation via inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p 65 phosphorylation and p 65 nuclear translocation. Curcumin inhibited the IL- 1 beta-induced stimulation of up-stream protein kinase B Akt. These events correlated with down-regulation of NF-kappaB targets including COX- 2 and MMP- 9. Similar results were obtained in chondrocytes stimulated with TNF-alpha. Curcumin also reversed the IL- 1 beta-induced down-regulation of collagen type II and beta 1 -integrin receptor expression. These results indicate that curcumin has nutritional potential as a naturally occurring anti-inflammatory agent for treating OA through suppression of NF-kappaB mediated IL- 1 beta/TNF-alpha catabolic signalling pathways in chondrocytes...|$|R
40|$|Context: Recently, {{stem cell}} {{research}} has gained great public interest and different cell-based clinical trials have started in Iran. The objective {{of this study was}} to provide an overview of clinical cell transplantation researches in Iran, which has assumed a leadership role in the Middle East. Evidence Acquisitions: To evaluate the state of clinical cell transplantation researches in Iran, we conducted a literature review on December 1, 2011 using PubMed, IranMedex, US NIH registry for clinical trials and Iranian registry of clinical trials (IRCT). We used “Cell”, “Cells”, “Cell Transplantation”, and "Iran” as keywords to identify stem cell related research articles or projects. Publications were then examined manually to exclude those that did not use stem cells in a clinical setting or did not report original research. Hard copy of all related articles were used to extract the following data: the year of publication, journal’s name, number of authors, cell type, processing method, subject, and study design. Results: Twenty one articles and 33 registered trials were related to clinical application of cellular products. Except for 6 articles, the others were multicenteral. The main subject of articles was cardiovascular diseases (23. 52 %) and for registered clinical trials this was <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorders</b> (24. 24 %). Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) and mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) were the most frequent cell types in these trials. From 12 completed trials only 4 have been reported in medical journals. Conclusions: By comparison with basic {{stem cell research}}, the current status of cell transplantation trials in Iran is not optimal. Joined multicenteral research, establishment of national regulations, sharing of facility and staff, international collaborations and bridging the gap between basic and clinical research may improve quality and quantity of clinical cell transplantation research in Iran...|$|R
40|$|Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an {{abundant}} class of small single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules ranging from 18 to 24 nucleotides. They negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play key roles in many biological processes, including skeletal development and cartilage maturation. In addition, miRNAs involvement in osteoarticular diseases {{has been proved}} {{and some of them}} were identified as suitable biomarkers for pathological conditions. Equine osteochondrosis (OC) {{is one of the most}} prevalent juvenile <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorders</b> in horses and represents a major concern for animal welfare and economic reasons. Its etiology and pathology remain controversial and biological pathways as well as molecular mechanisms involved in the physiopathology are still unclear. This study aims to investigate the potential role of miRNAs in equine osteochondrosis (OC) physiopathology. Short-read NGS technology (SOLID (TM), Life Technologies) was used to establish a comprehensive repertoire of miRNA expressed in either equine cartilage or subchondral bone. Undamaged cartilage and subchondral bone samples from healthy (healthy samples) and OC-affected (predisposed samples) 10 -month Anglo-Arabian foals were analysed. Samples were also subjected or not to an experimental mechanical loading to evaluate the role of miRNAs in the regulation of mechano-transduction pathways. Predicted targets of annotated miRNAs were identified using miRmap. Results: Epiphyseal cartilage and subchondral bone miRNome were defined, including about 300 new miRNAs. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between bone and cartilage from healthy and OC foals, as well as after an experimental mechanical loading. In cartilage, functional annotation of their predicted targets suggests a role in the maintenance of cartilage integrity through the control of cell cycle and differentiation, energy production and metabolism as well as extracellular matrix structure and dynamics. In bone, miRNA predicited targets were associated with osteoblasts and osteoclasts differentiation, though the regulation of energy production, vesicle transport and some growth factor signaling pathways. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest a role of miRNAs in equine OC physiopathology and in the cellular response to biomechanical stress in cartilage and bone. In silico target prediction and functional enrichment analysis provides new insight into OC molecular physiopathology...|$|R
40|$|Background : Although {{physical}} activity (PA) is {{key in the}} management of type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM) and hypertension, it is difficult to implement in practice. [br/]Methods : Cross-sectional, observational study. Participating physicians were asked to recruit two active and four inactive patients, screened with the Ricci-Gagnon (RG) self-questionnaire (active if score ≥ 16). Patients subsequently completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. The objective was to assess the achievement of individualized glycated hemoglobin and blood pressure goals (< 140 / 90 mmHg) in the active vs inactive cohort, to explore the correlates for meeting both targets by multivariate analysis, and to examine the barriers and motivations to engage in PA. Results : About 1, 766 patients were analyzed. Active (n= 628) vs inactive (n= 1, 138) patients were more often male, younger, less obese, had shorter durations of diabetes, fewer complications and other health issues, such as <b>osteoarticular</b> <b>disorders</b> (P< 0. 001 for all). Their diabetes and hypertension control was better and obtained despite a lower treatment burden. The biggest difference in PA between the active vs inactive patients was the percentage who declared engaging in regular leisure-type PA (97. 9 % vs 9. 6 %), also reflected in the percentage with vigorous activities in International Physical Activity Questionnaire (59. 5 % vs 9. 6 %). Target control was achieved by 33 % of active and 19 % of inactive patients (P< 0. 001). Active patients, those with fewer barriers to PA, with lower treatment burden, and with an active physician, were more likely to reach targets. The physician’s role emerged in the motivations (reassurance on health issues, training on hypoglycemia risk, and prescription/monitoring of the PA by the physician). A negative self-image was the highest ranked barrier for the inactive patients, followed by lack of support and medical concerns. Conclusion : Physicians should consider PA prescription as seriously as any drug prescription, and take into account motivations and barriers to PA to tailor advice to patients’ specific needs and reduce their perceived constraints...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Complex {{regional}} pain syndrome type I or algoneurodystrophy (AND) {{includes a}} series of complex <b>osteoarticular</b> and vasomotor <b>disorders</b> of {{the upper and lower}} limbs. In addition to drug therapy, physical kinetic rehabilitation therapy may increase {{the quality of life of}} these patients and reduce sequelae. Pulsed short waves are considered to provide the most adequate energy for the favorable influence of the pathophysiological substrate of AND. The local application (on the affected area) of the treatment is justified by the local action of pulsed short waves, which induce microshocks in the crystalline bone structures (particularly collagen), with the production of negative electrical charges that will result in an increased osteoblast activity and the storage of calcium salts in the bone. Also, a possible role in the energy metabolism of osteoblasts is not excluded...|$|R
40|$|Background] As the {{population}} ages, {{the prevalence of}} multimorbidity also increases, with consequences to several health outcomes such as disability {{and quality of life}} (QoL). This study aimed at analyzing the relationships between chronic conditions, disability, and QoL of older adults with multimorbidity in Spain. [Method] Data on older adults aged 65 years or more, with at least two chronic health conditions were drawn from three cohort studies. Sample size was 705, 443, and 4995, respectively. For each cohort, the impact of the following chronic health conditions was analyzed: asthma, cancer, cardiac, diabetes, hypertension, mental health <b>disorders,</b> <b>osteoarticular</b> conditions, and stroke. Disability and QoL measures varied according to the survey. [Results] In older adults with multimorbidity, the most prevalent conditions were osteoarticular (59. 08 – 67. 80 %) and hypertension (50. 64 – 60. 03 %). The presence of disability was significantly associated to having osteoarticular (OR range: 1. 53 to 2. 646), diabetes (OR: 1. 86 to 1. 71), or mental health disorders (OR: 2. 19 to 3. 36) in most cohorts. Disability (OR: 1. 67 to 7. 67), osteoarticular conditions (OR: 3. 37 to 5. 10), and mental health disorders (OR: 1. 83 to 4. 27) showed the highest effects on lower QoL than {{the population}}. [Conclusion] The presence of disability and diverse chronic conditions has a negative effect on QoL of older adults affected by multimorbidity in Spain. Public health and primary care interventions focusing on the integrated care of older adults with multimorbidity might give special attention to mental health and osteoarticular conditions.
