Banksy unveiled {{at least one}} work of art daily, documenting it on both a dedicated website and an Instagram account. The majority of the works were stencil graffiti and chiefly political, a distinctive characteristic of Banksy. <b>Other</b> <b>pieces</b> and multimedia exhibits toyed with dark humor and satire.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over <b>other</b> <b>pieces.</b> A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception).

5|$|These Sermons are curious; {{and curious}} for such reason as would make other works despicable. They {{were written in}} a {{careless}} hurrying manner; and were the offspring of necessity, not of choice: so that one will see the original force of the Dean's genius more in these compositions, that were the legitimate sons of duty, than in <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> that were natural sons of love.|$|E
5|$|Variants of the M3 {{should not}} be {{confused}} with other 37mm guns in the U.S. service. Those <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> included the M1916 infantry gun of French design (these were later used extensively as subcaliber devices for heavy artillery.), M1 antiaircraft autocannon, M4/M9/M10 aircraft-mounted autocannons, M12/M13/M14/M15 subcaliber guns.|$|E

5|$|As {{well as the}} {{chandelier}} earrings, and 60 <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> of jewellery, Mrs Greville left the Queen Mother a set of pear-drop earrings that she had bought from Cartier in 1938. The pear-shaped drop diamonds each weigh about 20carats (4g). Diana, Princess of Wales, borrowed them in 1983 to wear on her first official visit to Australia. At a state banquet, she wore the earrings with a tiara from her family's own collection. The Greville Pear-drop Earrings passed to the Queen upon her mother's death in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} rover and its {{bridging}} kits, Jetman {{has access to}} three <b>other</b> <b>pieces</b> of equipment, {{all of which can}} be carried on the bonnet of the rover, albeit one at a time. Bombs must be used to destroy alien bases when they are encountered, which can only be accomplished when Jetman is flying above them. Another piece of equipment is a cannon that may be mounted onto the rear side of the moon rover. The final piece of equipment is a pair of teleporters which can be used to instantaneously transport the player to the teleporter's twin, thus allowing rapid transport around the moon.|$|E

5000|$|A {{piece is}} {{captured}} when the opponent brackets it orthogonally {{between two of}} the opponent's pieces, or between an opponent piece and a corner (but not side) square. The Dux is captured like any <b>other</b> <b>piece.</b> A piece that makes a capture gains an immediate second move.|$|R
5000|$|Another common {{criterion}} is envy-freeness (EF). In an envy-free cake-cutting, each person receives {{a piece that}} he values {{at least as much}} as every <b>other</b> <b>piece.</b> In symbols: ...|$|R
