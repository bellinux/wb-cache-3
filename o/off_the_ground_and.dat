5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While they go through the area on their own, Gary is lifted <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> shaken like a rag doll by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E
5|$|The barren desert {{surface of}} Ceti Alpha V was {{simulated}} on stage 8, the largest sound stage at Paramount's studio. The set was elevated 25 feet <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> covered in wooden mats, over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped. A cyclorama was painted and {{wrapped around the}} set, while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm. The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike. The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated, and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air. Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots, masks, and coveralls as protection from flying sand.|$|E

5|$|The second Avrocar had logged about 75 {{flight hours}} {{at the end of}} the flight testing. Judged by its performance, the Avrocar was an abject failure: it couldn't lift itself safely more than a few feet <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> its bulbous design {{limiting}} high-speed performance accompanied by unbearable heat and screaming exhaust noise, made it impractical for the military. Although considered a technical failure, its design would be prophetic: it was a rubber skirt shy of being one of the world's first hovercraft, the Saunders Roe SR.N1 also taking off in 1959. Nevertheless, company designer John Frost applied for a number of patents in Canada, the UK and the U.S. that established the pivotal role that the Avrocar and related Avro experimental vehicles made in the VTOL world.|$|E
5|$|Clark, Chloe, and Pete {{arrive at}} the dance, and say their goodbyes to Whitney before he leaves for training. The weather begins to deteriorate, and a storm picks up, as Lana takes Whitney to the bus stop. Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole) decide {{to head to the}} storm cellar to seek cover from the storm, and they {{discover}} Nixon just as the octagonal disk activates the ship. Nixon attempts to escape with the videotape, and Jonathan chases out into the storm after him. The ship levitates <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> flies out of the storm cellar. Lana says goodbye to Whitney and drives home. On her way, storm winds force her off the road, right next to three tornadoes that have touched down. The students at the dance are alerted to the tornados that have been sighted, and Clark races off to make sure Lana is all right. The three tornadoes merge into one large tornado and move in Lana's direction. Clark arrives just as Lana, in the truck, is sucked into the tornado's vortex; Clark speeds into the tornado to rescue her.|$|E
5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is a sacred}} bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, {{like those of the}} golden eagle, are central to many {{religious}} and spiritual customs among Native Americans. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many pow wow dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the Navajo Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The Lakota, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The Pawnee considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> because they fiercely protect their young. The Choctaw considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.|$|E

5|$|Two {{species of}} birds in the park {{are in danger of}} disappearing. The range of the Cape Sable seaside sparrow is {{restricted}} to Everglades National Park and the Big Cypress Swamp. In 1981 6,656 Cape Sable seaside sparrows were reported in park boundaries, but surveys over 10 years documented a decline to an estimated 2,624 birds by 2002. Attempts to return natural levels of water to the park have been controversial; Cape Sable seaside sparrows nest about a foot <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> rising water levels may harm future populations, as well as threaten the endangered snail kite. The Everglades snail kite eats apple snails almost exclusively, and the Everglades is the only location in the United States where this bird of prey exists. There is some evidence that the population may be increasing, but loss of habitat and food sources keep the estimated number of these birds at several hundred.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Rey Mysterio versus Eddie Guerrero in a singles match. Two {{months prior to}} Judgment Day, at WrestleMania 21, Rey Mysterio defeated Eddie Guerrero. In the weeks that followed, Guerrero and Mysterio were challenged by MNM (Joey Mercury, Johnny Nitro, and Melina) to defend the WWE Tag Team Championship, which Guerrero and Mysterio accepted. MNM defeated Guerrero and Mysterio to win the WWE Tag Team title after Guerrero walked {{out in the middle}} of the match. On the April 28 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero and Mysterio were given a rematch for the Tag Team championship. During the match, however, Mysterio accidentally performed a flying body press on Guerrero which led to Guerrero abandoning Mysterio, but returned as the fans urged Guerrero to come back. MNM retained the belt after pinning Mysterio for the win. The following week, Teddy Long booked a Street Fight match, a match without disqualifications and where scoring conditions can occur anywhere, between Mysterio and Guerrero's nephew, Chavo Guerrero. Mysterio came out as the winner of the match. After the match, Mercury and Nitro attacked Mysterio, which prompted Guerrero to come out and clear the ring. Guerrero, however, attacked Mysterio. The assault led to Guerrero lifting Mysterio <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> driving Mysterio's back on the ring steps. This angle saw Guerrero turn into a villain. As a result, the following week, Long promoted a match between Guerrero and Mysterio at Judgment Day.|$|E
5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty people in one of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and fire hydrants was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed the firefighters to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher up <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. The firefighters received assistance several hours after the fire started by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of the firefighters were treated for hypothermia after treading through the cold temperatures of the flood water. The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E

25|$|During the 1910s {{and early}} 1920s {{a number of}} {{researchers}} discovered that shorter wavelength signals were reflected off what would later be known as the ionosphere. This allowed the signal to hop over very long distances by reflecting multiple times <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> ionosphere. This greatly extended range, allowing lower power transmitters to be used for very long-range communications. By 1923 a number of amateur radio operators (hams) demonstrated excellent performance at 100m and started routine trans-Atlantic communications the next year. This led to a number of new frequency bands being defined in this shortwave region, as short as 10m (which is very long by today's standards). By 1930 these frequencies were in widespread use for many purposes.|$|E

25|$|EF3 (T6-T7) {{damage is}} a serious risk to life and limb and {{the point at which}} a tornado {{statistically}} becomes significantly more destructive and deadly. Few parts of affected buildings are left standing; well-built structures lose all outer and some inner walls. Unanchored homes are swept away, and homes with poor anchoring may collapse entirely. Small vehicles and similarly sized objects are lifted <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> tossed as projectiles. Wooded areas will suffer almost total loss of vegetation, and some tree debarking may occur.

25|$|Episode 32 of MythBusters {{investigates the}} urban legend of an {{affordable}} jet pack or rocket pack {{that can be}} built from plans purchased on the Internet. Extensive modifications {{were made by the}} MythBusters team due to vagueness in the plans and because of the infeasibility of the specified engine mounting system. The jet pack produced by the MythBusters had two ducted fans powered by ultralight-type piston engines. (Fans complained that the use of piston engines destroyed the whole idea of the pack's being truly based on jets, by which, presumably, they meant self-contained gas turbines.) They found it was not powerful enough to lift a person <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>and</b> was expensive to build. The plans specified a Rotax 503 ultralight engine, but they intended to use the more powerful and lighter Rotax 583 engine before a similar lighter unnamed engine was substituted.|$|E
25|$|When falling, skiers in {{this class}} with above the knee amputations are taught {{to try to prevent}} the stump of their leg from hitting the snow as it can cause more damage to that leg than the one that is not {{partially}} missing.

Skiers are taught to turn using their leg instead of their ski poles. Skiers {{in this class}} can use the outrigger to assist in maintaining their balance as they turn on the hill. A skier with an above the knee amputation may have a better ability to complete turns on the opposite of their amputation. In getting on ski lifts, skiers with above the knee amputations in this classification should lift their outriggers <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>and</b> point them forward.|$|E
50|$|The Rheinbote was a four-stage {{solid fuel}} rocket. The slender body {{measured}} in at 11.4 m tall and could carry {{a relatively small}} payload over a distance of approximately 200 km.
