5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors <b>of</b> <b>economists,</b> investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed {{as a consequence of the}} global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|By the mid 1950s, {{the vast}} {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>economists</b> had ceased debating Keynesianism and accepted the synthesis view; however, room for disagreement remained. The synthesis attributed problems with market clearing to sticky prices that failed to adjust to changes in supply and demand. Another group of Keynesians focused on disequilibrium economics and tried to reconcile the concept of equilibrium with the absence of market clearing.|$|E
5|$|Because of his {{involvement}} with the Pinochet government, there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976. Friedman was accused of supporting the military dictatorship in Chile because of the relation <b>of</b> <b>economists</b> of the University of Chicago to Pinochet, and a controversial seven-day trip he took to Chile during March 1975 (less {{than two years after}} the coup that deposed President Salvador Allende). Friedman answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship, but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation, and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, while in Chile.|$|E

5|$|In December 2014, the Hellenic Parliament did {{not approve}} the new President with the supermajority required, and so a snap {{election}} was called {{for the end of}} January 2015. A few days before the 2015 election took place, Tsakalotos was quizzed on Syriza's economic policies by a number <b>of</b> <b>economists,</b> debt campaigners and investment analysts at the London School of Economics. Tsakalotos said there was a need for fiscal space, meaning 6–7billion Euros a year to spend on an expansionary fiscal policy. He also said that they would cancel the austerity budgets already agreed with the European Union (EU) and International Monetary Fund (IMF), pay back the loans from the IMF and focus on rescheduling and writing off the loans from the EU.|$|E
5|$|The Austrian School of {{economics}} began with Carl Menger's 1871 Principles of Economics. Menger's followers formed a distinct group <b>of</b> <b>economists</b> until around the World War II when {{the distinction between}} Austrian economics and other schools of thought had largely broken down. The Austrian tradition survived as a distinct school, however, through the works of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Present-day Austrians are distinguished by their interest in earlier Austrian works and abstention from standard empirical methodology including econometrics. Austrians also focus on market processes instead of equilibrium. Mainstream economists are generally critical of its methodology.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} <b>of</b> <b>economists</b> {{that followed}} Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical microeconomics {{to form the}} neoclassical synthesis. Although Keynesian theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the Phillips curve to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some Keynesian ideas, such as {{the importance of the}} demand for money, but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized Keynesian models that did not work under rational expectations. Lucas also argued that Keynesian empirical models would not be as stable as models based on microeconomic foundations.|$|E

5|$|The modern {{discussion}} of tulip mania {{began with the}} book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay; he proposed that crowds of people often behave irrationally, and tulip mania was, along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company scheme, one of his primary examples. His account was largely sourced from a 1797 work by Johann Beckmann titled A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins. In fact, Beckmann's account, and thus Mackay's by derivation, was primarily sourced to three anonymous pamphlets published in 1637 with an anti-speculative agenda. Mackay's vivid book was popular among generations <b>of</b> <b>economists</b> and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of tulip mania as a speculative bubble remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of his account.|$|E
