50|$|Ordinary plates {{have black}} text {{on a white}} background. They consist of three letters first, a space and three digits after. This space was {{formerly}} used for a taxation sticker. Above it {{the vehicle identification number}} is printed and above the last digit the date of plate manufacture is printed. All vehicles must legally carry both a front and a rear plate except for motorcycles, trailers (rear only), tractors and other <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery</b> (front only). The registration number is tied to the vehicles VIN and remains unchanged, even after change of ownership, until the vehicle is scrapped or exported. So it is possible to decommission a registered vehicle for any length of time. A decommissioned registered vehicle does not require road tax or a valid insurance. The registration plate remains on the vehicle while decommissioned. Registration numbers of scrapped, exported and de-registered vehicles are put in quarantine before they are re-used with new registered vehicles.|$|E

The pad specified in standards for measurement of vibration on seats is a proven and accepted technology for conventional and suspension seats found in, for example, cars, trucks and <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery.</b> However, the pad is not suitable for measurements on motorcycles. The posture on motorcycle seats introduces some degree of uncertainty as to where to locate the pad and riders complain that the pad is uncomfortable.

40|$|Nearly {{all modern}} <b>off-road</b> {{agricultural}} <b>machinery</b> are powered by petroleum, primarily diesel fuel. Equipment manufacturers work to improve fuel efficiency of their equipment to provide better value to their customers. Benefits of reducing petroleum use include lower operating costs, improved operational efficiency, improved energy security, and environmental benefits. Agricultural tractor testing focuses primarily on characterizing maximum performance {{but there is}} a need for advanced test procedures to better measure fuel efficiency for load cases representative of in-field operations. This would help farmers make better equipment purchasing and utilization decisions and help manufacturers quantify efficiency improvements; ultimately driving continued progress toward better efficiency. This research explored historic diesel fuel use for <b>off-road</b> agricultural <b>machinery,</b> current trends in improving diesel efficiency, and potential to better assess fuel efficiency with advanced test procedures. Additional work evaluated the accuracy of machine-reported data that has the potential to be used for creating advanced test procedures. Results showed that machine-reported engine speed is a good predictor of actual engine speed but there was statistically significant difference between measured torque and torque calculated from machine reported parameters. Tools for collection and analysis of in-field machine data were also explored and an application was developed as proof-of-concept for SAE J 1939 data logging and real-time analysis. Each of the software and hardware tools explored demonstrated advantages for individual use cases and provided practical options for J 1939 field data collection. Chapter one is composed of information from a report titled Agricultural Industry Advanced Vehicle Technology: Benchmark Study for Reduction in Petroleum Use that was prepared for the United States Department of Energy and published by Idaho National Laboratory.

40|$|In {{the road}} {{construction}} sector, {{a number of}} measures and alternatives have been proposed to reduce the {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} (GHG). While these measures can result in a notable abatement of this impact, when analyzed independently and in absolute terms, they are not equally relevant within a common context, such as a complete road transport infrastructure project. In this work, we analyze a broad range of scenarios for emission reduction combining plausible options given the current state of technology and involving those elements of road construction and maintenance with major contributions to the total balance of emissions. The selection of scenarios goes beyond the usual perspectives focused on pavements and materials, and includes other factors dealing with machinery, transport distance, energy sources, land-use change, as well as combined scenarios intended to find optimal alternatives. This has been achieved using the tool CO 2 NSTRUCT, which considers a life-cycle assessment approach for road transport infrastructure in evaluating GHG emission, thus providing an adequately comprehensive context for comparing relative contributions. This common reference enables to accomplish the ranking of the possible solutions. Results indicate that strategies involving the use of construction materials with lower emissions in their production process and recycled materials are the most effective, followed by those using lower-pollutant sources of energy in both <b>off-road</b> and transport <b>machinery</b> and lighting. This research also shows that the process of selection of suitable options should consider not only the construction stage but also the maintenance stage spanning road service life. Furthermore, the study demonstrates the importance of performing these analyses within a reference framework, enabling the identification of more efficient strategies amongst the universe of alternative solutions to mitigate GHG emissions.

40|$|The health {{problems}} encountered by operators of off-road vehicles demonstrate {{that a lot}} of effort still has to be put into the design of effective seat and cabin suspensions. Owing to the nonlinear nature of the suspensions and the use of in situ measurements for the optimization, classical local optimization techniques are prone to getting stuck in local minima. Therefore this paper develops a method for optimizing nonlinear suspension systems based on in situ measurements, using the global optimization technique DIRECT to avoid local minima. Evaluation of the comfort improvement of the suspension was carried out using the objective comfort parameters used in standards. As a test case, the optimization of a hydropneumatic element that can serve as part of a cabin suspension for <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery</b> was performed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|As {{in the car}} {{industry}} for quite some time, dynamic simulation of complete vehicles is being practiced {{more and more in}} the development of <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery.</b> However, specific questions arise due not only to company structure and size, but especially to the type of product. Tightly coupled, non-linear subsystems of different domains make prediction and optimisation of the complete system's dynamic behaviour a challenge. Furthermore, the demand for versatile machines leads to sometimes contradictory target requirements and can turn the design process into a hunt for the least painful compromise. This can be avoided by profound system knowledge, assisted by simulationdriven product development. This paper gives an overview of joint research into this issue by Volvo Wheel Loaders and Linkping University on that matter, and lists the results of a related literature review. Rather than giving detailed answers, the problem space for ongoing and future research is examined and possible solutions are sketched...|$|E
40|$|All on- and {{off-road}} vehicles {{are exposed to}} vibrations caused by unevenness of road or soil profile, moving elements within the machine or implements. A higher prevalence of low back pain is found in drivers of <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery</b> than in other drivers. In this study, {{significantly higher levels of}} low-frequency vibrations are found in the cabin of a combine, driving at high speed (20 km/h) on a concrete surface, compared to driving slower on field road. Comfort values indicate that injury can result from long-term driving on the field as well as on a concrete road. As seats with suspension systems are the main transmission paths of vibration towards the spine of the driver, their vibration attenuating characteristics {{play an important role in}} comfort assessment. The resonant frequency of seats with passive suspension system, used in agricultural machinery, lies in the low-frequency range most excited in agricultural machinery. A seat with air suspension is found to attenuate better frequencies above 4 Hz and provide more comfort to the driver than a seat with a mechanical suspension. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{the field}} of mobile {{agricultural}} and <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery,</b> {{there is a growing}} interest to examine the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle under construction with a view to improve passenger comfort and machine performance. As many of these machine constructors are small sized, specialised companies are required to execute vibration tests and to evaluate vibration levels. Because most of these machines are heavy constructions with exceptional proportions, it is obvious to perform vibration tests on the factory floor by means of a low power mobile excitation device such as an electro-hydraulic shaker. This paper shows that an air spring, parallel to the actuator of an electro-hydraulic shaker, results in considerable power savings. The behaviour of the shaker is discussed at its resonance frequencies. For small band excitation signals, extra power savings can be achieved by tuning the spring stiffness and by using the air spring at constant pressure. Experiments on a one degree of freedom vertical shaker show good agreement with the theory and demonstrate that the different mode shapes of an agricultural tractor can be sufficiently excited with a nominal hydraulic power of 500 W.

40|$|Whole-body {{vibration}} exposure {{has been found}} to negatively influence health, comfort and performance. Performance measures are affected by the task and situation investigated, so it is difficult to make detailed recommendations based on fundamental research. There is little knowledge on performance during {{vibration exposure}} combined with additional occupational hazards such as bent or twisted postures. In addition, little information is available on the effective use of armrests during performance related tasks. Many off-road machines have suspension seats with armrest-mounted controls, yet {{there is a lack of}} literature establishing if armrest support provides benefits for <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery</b> operators under combined environmental stressors. This paper reports a study investigating the influence of sitting in different working postures on the reaction time and perceived workload of subjects exposed to seated whole-body vibration. Twenty-one subjects were exposed to 1 - 20 Hz random multi-axis vibration. Posture combined with whole-body vibration exposure had a large influence on the ability to perform the task. The combined environmental stressors significantly degraded performance: not only did reaction times become compromised, the participants ’ workload also increased. The most severe decrement in performance and workload was experienced while seated in a twisted posture with no armrest support. It is concluded that armrest-mounted controls can reduce the workload and improve performance. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews {{information}} on emission inventories of particulate matter (PM) in Europe. A {{large body of}} scientific literature is available to cover many different aspects. Studies focus on specific sources or source sectors (road transport as well as <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery,</b> domestic heating, industry, agriculture, and natural sources), among which especially road transport emissions are clearly best established. Emission inventories comprising all sources are available for specific European regions, often pointing out regional differences, {{but also for the}} entire continent. Still these inventories often are not able to satisfy the needs. Due to PM specific circumstances such as the large number of sources, very different release pathways and differences of the individual particles in terms of chemical composition or size, {{it is very difficult to}} to appropriately handle measurement conditions to arrive at adequate emission factors, especially when emission points cannot be defined clearly. Information on fugitive emissions (caused by wind shear, material transfer processes or other mechanical forces from non-point sources) is sparse, except for road traffic emissions where recent data seems to converge. The problem of data gaps concerns activities in industry (quarries), agriculture, but also natural particles like sea salt and wind-blown dust. Comparing complete inventories to independent efforts in assessing emissions, e. g. atmospheric measurements combined with source apportionment, allows to better understand and quantify the reliability of inventory data. Methodological improvements and harmonization currently under way in Europe will focus efforts and allow for more reliable PM inventories in the near future...|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} model estimates (10 × 10 km 2) of tropospheric NO 2 column amounts {{from the}} Comprehensive Air Quality Model (CAMx) for the Balkan Peninsula are compared with OMI/Aura measurements (13 × 24 km 2 at nadir) {{for the year}} April 2009 to March 2010. The Balkan area contributes significantly to the NO 2 burden in European air and so numerous urban, industrial and rural regions are studied aiming to investigate the consistency of both satellite retrievals and model predictions at high spatial resolution. It has already been shown that OMI can detect the tropospheric column of NO 2 over polluted Balkan cities due to its fine horizontal resolution and instrument sensitivity (Zyrichidou et al., 2009). In this study the improved OMI DOMINO v 2. 0 satellite retrievals showed that over South-Eastern Europe the monthly mean NO 2 tropospheric column density fluctuated between 2. 0 and 5. 7 ± 1. 1 × 1015 molecules/cm 2 over urban areas, 1. 6 – 5. 0 ± 0. 7 × 1015 molecules/cm 2 over large industrial complexes and 1. 1 – 2. 2 ± 0. 4 × 1015 molecules/cm 2 over rural areas for the year studied. The Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions (CAMx) version 4. 40 is a publicly available open-source computer modeling system for the integrated assessment of gaseous and particulate air pollution. The anthropogenic emissions used in CAMx for the Greek domain being studied were compiled employing bottom-up approaches (road transport sector, <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery,</b> etc.) {{as well as other}} national registries and international databases. The rest of the Balkan domain has natural and anthropogenic emissions based on the TNO emission inventory of 2003. The high-resolution CAMx simulations reveal consistent spatial and temporal patterns with the OMI/Aura data. The annual spatial correlation coefficient between OMI and CAMx computed in this high spatial resolution analysis is of the order of 0. 6, somewhat improved over those estimated in Zyrichidou et al. (2009) (R ˜ 0. 5). However, in such a validation study it is important {{to take into account the}} averaging kernel (AK) information in order to achieve the creation of comparable data sets. Minor differences are found for area-averaged model columns with and without applying the kernel, which shows that the impact of limiting the effect of the a priori profile on the comparison is on average small. The main aim of the paper, which was to evaluate OMI retrieved and high resolution simulated tropospheric NO 2 column densities over South-Eastern Europe and to assess the use of the averaging kernels, is achieved and the two data sources are being employed further in an inverse emission inventory creation study (Zyrichidou et al., in preparation) ...|$|E
40|$|Particulate Matter (PM) in {{the ambient}} air {{can lead to}} health effects and even to {{premature}} mortality. This result {{has been found in}} a score of epidemiological studies, but its cause is not yet clear. It is certain, however, that these effects are so serious and so extensive that further action is warranted. In the scientific literature ambient aerosols are known as PM, short for Particulate Matter. Depending on the diameter or size of the particles, they are termed PM 10 (for particles with diameters of up to approximately 10 micrometres) or PM 2. 5 (for those less than 2. 5 micrometres in diameter). One micrometre is a thousandth of a millimetre. Humans inhale particles smaller than 10 micrometres, which end up deep in our airways. Recent studies have presented well-founded assumptions concerning the biological mechanisms involved and the groups of people that are probably more susceptible to PM. Particulate Matter is a generic term for a complex mixture of large and small airborne particles. However, the causal factors within this complex mixture are difficult to disentangle and have not yet been identified. The second Section of this report looks at the different types of PM, their atmospheric behaviour and the methods of measuring them. The health effects associated with PM are also presented. Section 3 discusses the most recent epidemiological, toxicological and human clinical findings and their mutual relationships. On the basis of epidemiological studies {{it has been estimated that}} in the Netherlands some 1, 700 to 3, 000 people per year die prematurely as a result of inhaling ambient PM. These figures reflect only the effects of acute exposure to air pollution. If the long-term effects of chronic exposure are taken into account, premature mortality could affect 10, 000 - 15, 000 people a year in the Netherlands. These last estimates for chronic exposure are more uncertain, because chronic effect studies are much fewer in number. The estimate of the chronic effects was based on foreign studies, which are not completely comparable with the Dutch situation. Section 4 gives an overview of the most recent information relating to sources of PM and emissions in the Netherlands, while the last Section presents a critical evaluation of the current and future EU standards. It is recommended that PM 10 be retained as a standard for the time being, as it covers the effects of both fine and coarse particles. In view of the emerging evidence implicating fine particles in health effects, it is recommended that a standard for fine PM and/or a source-related fraction be developed as well. Even with PM concentrations well below European Union (EU) standards, people's health will still be affected because no threshold has been found for the occurrence of health effects. PM is a complex mixture containing fractions that are to a greater or lesser extent health-relevant. This differentiation in potency has profound implications for an efficient and effective reduction of health impacts through PM emission abatement. PM abatement can be justified by the precautionary principle. Further source- oriented actions could focus on reduction of the total PM 10 aerosol mass or, first of all, on those PM fractions that are expected to be more health-relevant. This last option is preferred. These fractions are probably transport-related (diesel soot) and, more generally, combustion- related primary PM emissions. Abatement should therefore focus on these sources. In this respect, the abatement of uncontrolled shipping emissions has been identified as one of the more cost-effective control options. Abatement of other combustion sources such as industrial combustion, wood burning in fireplaces, and <b>off-road</b> <b>machinery</b> are also possible, but less cost-effective. The European Union has decided on two standards for PM, a daily and an annual average value. The current EU standards for daily and annual average values are not equivalent, as was originally intended. In the Netherlands the following options are equivalent to the EU annual standard of 40 ug/m 3 : a daily level of 50 ug/m 3 with 80 exceedances (while the EU allows 35 exceedances) or a daily level of 100 ug/m 3 with 7 permitted exceedances per year. For practical reasons a daily standard of 100 ug/m 3 is preferred. Although the EU has proposed two standards for PM, there are several arguments that only one standard would suffice - annual mean concentrations being the best choice. However, for reasons of communication to the public daily standards may be appropriate. Compliance with the annual average EU standard seems feasible for PM 10 in the Netherlands in 2005, although local exceedances at 'hot spots' cannot be ruled out. Compliance in 2010 with the indicative annual average EU standard of 20 ug/m 3 is not feasible, even at high cost. Expectations are that there will still be 36 - 40 exceedances per year of the EU daily standard of 50 ug/m 3 even after all planned abatement measures (Current Legislation of Emissions (CLE)) have been taken in 2010. Therefore, compliance with the current EU daily standards for 2005 and 2010 does not seem feasible in the Netherlands and adverse health effects will continue to occur...|$|E
