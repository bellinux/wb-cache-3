5|$|The {{art critic}} Hugh Davies has {{suggested}} that of the three figures, that on the left most closely resembles a human form, and that it might represent a mourner at the cross. Seated on a table-like structure, this limbless creature has an elongated neck, heavily rounded shoulders, and a thick mop <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> Like its affiliate objects, the left-hand figure is portrayed with layers of white and grey paint.|$|E
5|$|A further {{internal}} diagonal {{passes through}} the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible {{than those of the}} dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.|$|E
25|$|Alan George Hurst (born 15 July 1950 at Altona, Victoria) is {{a former}} Australian cricketer who played in twelve Tests and eight ODIs between 1975 and 1979. A muscular, broad-shouldered man with a shock <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and a big moustache, Alan Hurst fit the {{archetype}} of Australian fast bowler, 1970s style.|$|E

25|$|This dance {{has evolved}} into several {{variations}} to tell stories of other combat such as David vs. Goliath, but the most common alternative relates to the Conquest of Mexico called Dance of the Marquis, Tastoanes or Comanches. In general, those playing the Spanish wear masks, while those playing the indigenous do not. Cortes is usually portrayed with abundant masses <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> and beard due to the historical descriptions of the first Europeans seen by the indigenous.|$|E
25|$|The figure {{behind the}} daughter, Clotilde Sorolla, also wears a white dress, her hips accented {{by a white}} belt. Thus both the breasts and the {{buttocks}} have clearer contours than the daughter's. Clothilde's dress has cropped sleeves, and she carries a jacket, also made of white fabric, on her left forearm {{in front of her}} abdomen. In her left hand she holds an open white parasol, which is angled to the ground on the left side. Under Clotilde's dress are two elegant white women's shoes with small heels. On her head Clotilde wears a straw hat, which is also decorated with purple colored flowers. In addition, a greenish-transparent veil is draped over the entire hat, and falls forward over her face and is blown backward almost horizontally in the wind. Clotilde has bent her right arm upward and her hand lies on the veil. This creates the impression that she must adjust it due to the wind veil or even hold it in place. Of the head of Clotilde little can be seen. Large parts of face, depicted in profile, are in shadow and only the chin is in brighter sunlight. Also, the wide sweeping hat obscures the hair almost completely. Just behind a pearl earring is a bit <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> While the young face of the daughter Maria is looks directly into the sun, the face of the mother is hidden by the shadow of the hat. The clothes and accessories show the two women to be members of the upper class spending their free time in the summer with mild temperatures and light winds.|$|E
500|$|Margaretta Eagar, a governess for {{the daughters}} of Tsar Nicholas II, {{described}} Elisabeth as [...] "a sweet and pretty child, with wide grey-blue eyes and a profusion <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> She was much like her mother, not only in face, but also in manner." [...] The four-year-old Elisabeth wanted a baby sister and tried to persuade her aunt and uncle to let her parents adopt one of her paternal first cousins, Tatiana or Maria. Her parents had only one other child together, a stillborn son, in 1900.|$|E
5000|$|Unrelated {{patterns}} may {{be confused}} with Bend-Or spots. Some roan horses have patches <b>of</b> <b>darker</b> <b>hairs</b> called [...] "corn marks" [...] or [...] "corn spots." [...] While these resemble Bend-Or spots, they are linked to solid-colored hair growing in over minor cuts or scratches to the skin, and thus the underlying genetic cause appears to be unrelated. Another pattern seen primarily in some gray horses is dappling, the presence <b>of</b> <b>darker</b> <b>hairs</b> in round shapes against a lighter hair coat. However, dapples are an intermediate stage of the graying process, and will only last a few years.|$|R
50|$|Males {{and females}} range in body length from 6 to 13.5 mm. In males, the {{first pair of}} legs is elongated, and they bear a row <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hairs</b> above the frontal eyes. Their chelicerae are also more robust.|$|R

60|$|In {{obedience}} to the priest's direction he sauntered to her side laughing. Then, still laughing, with his hand he separated the tresses <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> as though {{to look at the}} beauty of her side face, and bent down as if to kiss her.|$|E

60|$|But {{he waited}} for the dread of these days to pass; he saw the joy coming. He saw the lovely, creamy, cool little ear of the baby, a bit <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> rubbed to a bronze floss, like bronze-dust. And he waited, for the child to become his, to look at him and answer him.|$|E
60|$|The storm now let up a bit, and Ralph {{was able}} to {{take a good look at}} the fellow beside him. He was a tall, strong-looking chap, with sharp black eyes, and a heavy head <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> He wore a long mustache, and there was a slight scar {{directly}} in the center of his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Archie Moffam, nee Lucille Brewster, {{was small}} and slender. She had a little {{animated}} face, set in a cloud <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> She was so altogether perfect that Archie had frequently found himself compelled to take the marriage-certificate out of his inside pocket and study it furtively, to make himself realise that this miracle of good fortune had actually happened to him.|$|E
50|$|P. pilligaensis is a {{small brown}} mouse with grey-brown upper parts, the head and back greyer, grading through russet flanks to white underparts. The feet are pale pink on top with white hairs. The head-body length is 73-80 mm and the tail about the same length or {{slightly}} less. The tail is pale pink with a distinct brown line along the top and a small tuft <b>of</b> <b>darker</b> <b>hairs</b> on the end. The ear length is 15-18 mm {{and the weight of}} the animal is 10-14 g.|$|R

5000|$|Roan horses often develop patches <b>of</b> solid (<b>dark)</b> <b>hair</b> on the roan {{sections}} {{of their bodies}} wherever there has been any scratch or damage to underlying skin, even if only slight. These are sometimes called [...] "corn marks" [...] or [...] "corn spots." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{cold and}} awful {{quietness}} fell on Sheila's heart. She stared fixedly at the tuft <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> the only visible {{sign of her}} husband, on the pillow. Then, taking up the basin of cold cornflour, she left the room. In {{a quarter of an}} hour she reappeared carrying a tray, with ham and eggs and coffee and honey invitingly displayed. She laid it down.|$|E
60|$|Then of {{a sudden}} Hadden felt {{something}} cold {{at the back of}} his neck, and the next instant the Bee had sprung from him, holding between her thumb and finger a curl <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> which she had cut from his head. The action was so instantaneous that he had neither time to avoid nor to resent it, but stood still staring at her stupidly.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they were}} {{arranging}} {{him for his}} last rest, they found upon his bosom a small, plain miniature case, opening with a spring. It was the miniature of a noble and beautiful female face; and on the reverse, under a crystal, a lock <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> They laid them back on the lifeless breast,--dust to dust,--poor mournful relics of early dreams, which once made that cold heart beat so warmly! ...|$|E
60|$|A long heave from {{strong arms}} and the {{senseless}} form of Beatrice was on the gunwale. Then they pulled up Geoffrey beside her, for they could not loose her desperate grip <b>of</b> his <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> and together rolled them into the boat.|$|R
60|$|It is as {{the face}} of a woman, shaded by a {{quantity}} <b>of</b> rich <b>dark</b> <b>hair.</b> It is the earnest face of a woman who is young and handsome. But all is over with me on earth, and this must be an Angel.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper part}} and flanks {{of the animal}} are {{typically}} ochraceous or buff, but in some subspecies may be brownish-red or have a heavy overlay <b>of</b> <b>darker</b> <b>hairs</b> that render the animal almost blackish in color. A clearly visible line runs along the flanks, while the underparts are generally paler, being whitish or pale grey. The area around the shoulders often bears a patch of fur with a slightly ochre or salmon color. There is also a narrow ring <b>of</b> <b>darker</b> fur around the eyes, emphasising their appearance. The tail has a similar color to the body, being buff or ochre above, and paler on the underside.|$|R
6000|$|The pink domino {{had listened}} to this rapid speech with averted head, and, when it ended, started up, saying eagerly, [...] "You are mistaken, sir, I am not Dolly;" [...] but as she spoke her words were belied, for the hasty {{movement}} displaced her mask, and Mr. Bopp saw Dolly's eyes, a lock <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair,</b> {{and a pair of}} burning cheeks, before the screen was readjusted. With redoubled earnestness he held her back, whispering,-- ...|$|E
60|$|A {{door was}} opened before him, and he entered Edna's salon. For {{a moment he}} stopped in the doorway. He {{did not see the}} woman he had come to meet. He saw before him a lady handsomely and richly dressed in a Parisian morning costume--a lady with waving masses <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> above a lovely face, a lady with a {{beautiful}} white hand, which was half raised as he appeared in the doorway.|$|E
60|$|Then a wave {{of warmth}} came over him as he thought how near he now stood to the bright-eyed vivacious girl with the broad {{forehead}} and pile <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>hair</b> above it; {{the girl with the}} kindling glance, daringly soft at times--something like that of the girls he had seen in engravings from paintings of the Spanish school. She was here--actually in this Close--in one of the houses confronting this very west façade.|$|E
5000|$|Articles {{link the}} {{development}} of some forms of cancer (including leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, bladder cancer, blood cancer, and multiple myeloma) with use of hair color.

50|$|The Forrest's mouse {{is a small}} mouse {{weighing}} between 15-25g, but recorded to 30g. Short, thick tail that is distinctly {{less than}} (60-70%) of the combined head and body length.

Upperparts are a thick, lustrous and short fur of pale yellow brown or greyish fawn, with a pencilling <b>of</b> <b>darker</b> <b>hairs,</b> and small white patches behind the ears. There is a strong demarcation to white under the lower jaw, chin and feet, with the sparsely haired tail grey above and pale grey below, and the ears rounded and pinkish-grey.|$|R
