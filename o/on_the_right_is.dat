5|$|It is now {{agreed that}} spiders (Araneae) are {{monophyletic}} (i.e., {{members of a}} group of organisms that form a clade, consisting of a last common ancestor and all of its descendants). There has been debate about what their closest evolutionary relatives are, and how all of these evolved from the ancestral chelicerates, which were marine animals. The cladogram <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> based on J. W. Shultz' analysis (2007). Other views include proposals that: scorpions are more closely related to the extinct marine scorpion-like eurypterids than to spiders; spiders and Amblypygi are a monophyletic group. The appearance of several multi-way branchings in the tree on the right shows that there are still uncertainties about relationships between the groups involved.|$|E
5|$|The {{arms were}} {{confirmed}} by the College of Arms on 19 June 1948, {{and at the same}} time the crest (a mermaid supporting an anchor and holding a cannonball) was granted. Following local government reorganisation in 1974, the 1948 arms were transferred to Poole Borough Council. In 1976, the council received the grant of supporters for the coat of arms. The supporters refer to important charters given to the town; to the left is a gold lion holding a long sword representing William Longespee who in 1248 granted the town's first charter; <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> a dragon derived from the Royal Arms of Elizabeth I who granted Poole county corporate status in 1568. The Latin motto – Ad Morem Villae De Poole, means: According to the Custom of the Town of Poole, and derives from the Great Charter of 1568.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{a module}} {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} algebraic structures used in abstract algebra. A module over a ring is a generalization of the notion of vector space over a field, wherein the corresponding scalars are the elements of an arbitrary given ring (with identity) and a multiplication (on the left and/or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>right)</b> <b>is</b> defined between elements of the ring and elements of the module.|$|E
25|$|Enumerative {{geometry}} studies a {{class of}} geometric objects called algebraic varieties which are defined by the vanishing of polynomials.

A celebrated result of nineteenth-century mathematicians Arthur Cayley and George Salmon states that there are exactly 27 straight lines that lie entirely on such a surface.|$|E

Nevertheless, when there are many identical atoms decaying (right boxes), the law of large numbers {{suggests that it is}} a very good approximation to say that half of the atoms remain after one half-life.|$|E
