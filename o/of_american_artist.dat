500|$|Wild Pilgrimage is {{the third}} wordless novel <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>artist</b> Lynd Ward (1905–1985), {{published}} in 1932. [...] It was executed in 108 monochromatic wood engravings, printed alternately in black ink when representing reality and orange to represent the protagonist's fantasies. [...] The story tells of a factory worker who abandons his workplace to seek a free life; on his travels he witnesses a lynching, assaults a farmer's wife, educates himself with a hermit, and upon returning to the factory leads an unsuccessful workers' revolt. [...] The protagonist finds himself battling opposing dualities such as freedom versus responsibility, the individual versus society, and love versus death.|$|E
500|$|In {{the present}} time, the court orders Lisa {{to shut down}} SpringFace, and Lisa agrees to do this. The people of Springfield throw away their {{smartphones}} and computers soon after the website is closed. When Lisa looks outside her window, she sees Sherri and Terri {{and a bunch of}} their friends playing Marco Polo, and they invite Lisa to join them. Patty and Selma are then seen competing in a rowing race against the Winklevoss twins at the London 2012 Olympics, with Patty and Selma winning. This is followed by a short entitled [...] "A Simpsons 'Show's Too Short' Story", animated in the dark, grim style <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>artist</b> Edward Gorey. It tells the story of how Bart was a troublemaker from the day he was born, and shows him and Milhouse wrapping Springfield Elementary School in toilet paper.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Perfectionist {{received}} polarized {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon O'Brien from AllMusic summarised it as [...] "formulaic and gimmicky", and {{observed that the}} music was secondary to Kills' attempts of establishing a mature image. AltSounds staff member Jack Stevin deemed it [...] "disappointing" [...] and unfocused, writing that Kills was not {{in control of the}} album and that she had an [...] "air of pretension around" [...] her. Stevin additionally said that Kills was stronger as a [...] "visual artist". Darryl Sterdan of Canoe.ca rated Perfectionist with three out of five points. Comparing it to the music of Lady Gaga, Kesha and Robyn, he opined, [...] "Guess that's why it's not called Innovator." [...] Writing for Consequence of Sound, Alex Young noted that Kills expressed herself better as a musician through music videos, and surmised that [...] "not all the songs on Perfectionist hit their mark". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner described it as [...] "finely tailored" [...] and [...] "exciting", and gave it four stars out of five. musicOMH writer Blair Kelly characterised the album as imperfect, [...] "uninspired, unoriginal and obvious" [...] while negatively comparing it to the works <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>artist</b> Lady Gaga.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1999 Reef {{released}} {{their third}} album Rides, recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, the same studios used by The Beach Boys for Pet Sounds and Michael Jackson for Thriller. They swapped instruments on some tracks with Stringer and Greensmith playing guitar and Bessant singing on one song. Working again with Glow producer George Drakoulias, the band also enlisted {{the skills of}} David Campbell (father <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>artist</b> Beck) for the string arrangements. Rose Stone of Sly and the Family Stone fame features as a backing singer. Jack told NME magazine that the album was showing a more mature side to Reef {{but they were still}} having fun, using slide guitars, and trying to achieve a [...] "filmic" [...] feel to some tracks. [...] The album was very well received by critics, but commercially could not match the earlier success of its predecessor Glow.|$|E
2500|$|Cameron Adams from Herald Sun {{described}} the track as [...] "upbeat pop" [...] that hinted a [...] "dark and dirty electro feel." [...] Similarly, Cameron Matthews, writing for AOL Music, felt the composition showcased a [...] "club-bumping beat". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey labelled the track as [...] "disco-pop", whilst St Asaph {{described the}} tempo as [...] "energetic". Staff members at American music website Idolator compared the song's [...] "apocalyptic"-theme to the songs [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] by American recording artist Britney Spears, and [...] "2012 (It Ain't the End)" [...] by British singer Jay Sean; the review also said [...] "In any case, it's a nice {{return to the}} seductive minimalism that made 'Can't Get You Out of My Head' such disco-ball dynamite. Similarly, Melina Newman from HitFix compared the composition and tempo to the early work <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>artist</b> Madonna, commenting, [...] "The dance tune has an early Madonna flair to it with a catchy, fuzzy synth beat line holding much of it together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Don't Say a Word", was {{described}} as [...] "gorgeously electronic" [...] while [...] "morphing through synthscapes". [...] "My Blood" [...] was written and produced by Goulding and Eliot and {{was described}} as echoing the vocals of Adele. [...] "Anything Could Happen" [...] is an electro ballad written and produced by Goulding and Eliot, containing [...] "spurting synths and a sky-kissing chorus". The fourth track [...] "Only You" [...] {{was referred to as}} [...] "somewhere in between, thunderous and electrifying but bereft of the kind of earworms that would make it compulsively replayable". The title track [...] "Halcyon" [...] was co-written and co-produced by Goulding and is an electronic song. The seventh track [...] "Joy" [...] was co-written by Goulding and {{was described as}} a [...] "string-laden affair that showcases her helium-powered pipes". The next song, a cover version <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>artist</b> Active Child's 2011 song [...] "Hanging On", contains dubstep, downtempo and dream pop influences. [...] "Explosions" [...] starts with a choir and ambient drums; after the chorus, the piano drops and the production surges to a roar. The 10th song on the album, [...] "I Know You Care", was co-written by Goulding and Justin Parker. Lyrically the song speaks of [...] "her trying to convince someone—us, her lover, herself—that they have something worth salvaging". [...] "Atlantis" [...] is lyrically [...] "a quintessential break-up song, balancing moving on, with the helplessness of love and love lost". [...] "Dead in the Water" [...] is the final song on the album, besides the bonus track [...] "I Need Your Love", a collaboration with Scottish musician Calvin Harris.|$|E
