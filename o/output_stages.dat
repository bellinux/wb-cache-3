25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the <b>output</b> <b>stages,</b> Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E
2500|$|Power {{amplifier}} circuits (<b>output</b> <b>stages)</b> {{are classified}} as A, B, AB and C for analog designs—and class D and E for switching designs. The power amplifier classes {{are based on the}} proportion of each input cycle (conduction angle) during which an amplifying device passes current. The image of the conduction angle derives from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. If the device is always on, the conducting angle is 360°. If it is on for only half of each cycle, the angle is 180°. The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier power efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|Early tubes used a {{metal or}} glass {{envelope}} atop an insulating bakelite base. In 1938 a technique {{was developed to}} use an all-glass construction with the pins fused in the glass base of the envelope. This {{was used in the}} design of a much smaller tube outline, known as the miniature tube, having 7 or 9 pins. Making tubes smaller reduced the voltage where they could safely operate, and also reduced the power dissipation of the filament. Miniature tubes became predominant in consumer applications such as radio receivers and hi-fi amplifiers. However the larger older styles continued to be used especially as higher power rectifiers, in higher power audio <b>output</b> <b>stages</b> and as transmitting tubes.Subminiature tubes with a size roughly that of half a cigarette were used in hearing-aid amplifiers. These tubes did not have pins plugging into a socket but were soldered in place. The [...] "acorn tube" [...] (named due to its shape) was also very small, as was the metal-cased RCA nuvistor from 1959, {{about the size of a}} thimble. The nuvistor was developed to compete with the early transistors and operated at higher frequencies than those early transistors could. The small size supported especially high-frequency operation; nuvistors were used in UHF television tuners and some HiFi FM radio tuners (Sansui 500A) until replaced by high-frequency capable transistors.|$|E
