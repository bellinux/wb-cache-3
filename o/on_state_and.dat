5|$|The North Ward is {{surrounded}} by Branch Brook Park. Its neighborhoods include Broadway, Mount Pleasant, Upper Roseville and the affluent Forest Hill section. Forest Hill contains the Forest Hill Historic District, which is registered <b>on</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> national historic registers, and contains many older mansions and colonial homes. A row of residential towers with security guards and secure parking line Mt. Prospect Avenue in the Forest Hill neighborhood. The North Ward has lost geographic area in recent times; its southern boundary is now significantly further north than the traditional boundary near Interstate 280. The North Ward historically had a large Italian population; demographics have transitioned to Latino in recent decades, though the ward as a whole remains ethnically diverse.|$|E

40|$|Observations are {{reported}} of Hercules X- 1 {{in the energy}} range 13 - 180 keV which covered two complete 35 d cycles of high <b>and</b> low <b>states</b> of the X-ray intensity during 1978.

The results are interpreted {{in the context of}} precessing tilted accretion disk-periodic mass transfer models. Since the line of sight to Her X- 1 lies nearer the plane of the disk rim during low <b>ON</b> <b>states</b> than during high <b>ON</b> <b>states,</b> the observed X-ray intensity during low <b>ON</b> <b>states</b> may be more susceptible to changes in the disk structure...|$|R

500|$|Economists {{from the}} University of Tennessee {{concluded}} {{that while there}} would be many desirable macroeconomic effects, adoption of a national retail sales tax would also have serious effects <b>on</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> local government finances. Economist Bruce Bartlett stated that if the states did not conform to the FairTax, they would have massive confusion and complication {{as to what is}} taxed by the state and what is taxed by the federal government. In addition, sales taxes have long exempted all but a few services because of the enormous difficulty in taxing intangibles—Bartlett suggests that the state may not have sufficient incentive to enforce the tax. University of Michigan economist Joel Slemrod argues that states would face significant issues in enforcing the tax. [...] "Even at an average rate of around five percent, state sales taxes are difficult to administer." [...] University of Virginia School of Law professor George Yin states that the FairTax could have evasion issues with export and import transactions. The President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform reported that if the federal government were to cease taxing income, states might choose to shift their revenue-raising to income. Absent the Internal Revenue Service, it would be more difficult for the states to maintain viable income tax systems.|$|E
