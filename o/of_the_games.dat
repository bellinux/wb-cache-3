5|$|Avery Brundage, as {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interests as he felt that the Olympic movement should be completely separate from financial influence. The 1960 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of corporate sponsorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Games.</b> Despite Brundage's strenuous resistance the commercialisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> continued during the 1960s, and revenue generated by corporate sponsorship swelled the IOC's coffers. By the Grenoble Games, Brundage had become so concerned about the direction of the Winter Olympic Games towards commercialisation that, if it could not be corrected, he felt the Winter Olympics should be abolished. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant that the IOC was unable to gain a share of the financial windfall that was coming to host cities, and had no control over the structuring of sponsorship deals. When Brundage retired the IOC had $2million in assets; eight years later its accounts had swelled to $45million. This was due to a shift in ideology among IOC members, towards expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights.|$|E

5|$|Kent Hughes broke Olympic {{tradition}} in two significant ways. He decided to charge for television and newsreel footage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> where previously footage was provided free of charge. Secondly, following a suggestion from John Ian Wing, a 17-year-old apprentice carpenter from Melbourne, Kent Hughes instigated the now familiar closing ceremony {{tradition of the}} athletes of different nations parading together, instead of with their national teams, {{as a symbol of}} world unity. Kent Hughes's plan to charge for television and newsreel footage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> was strongly opposed in many circles, including the media, who believed that the Games were news and as such should be free, while Australian government authorities thought that providing free television coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Games</b> would lead to greater tourism opportunities. Brundage made no public comment on television rights for the Games but grasped the financial possibilities of charging for rights, devising a television rights fees policy following the Games, whereby television stations were forced to negotiate for televised rights for all future Games. This policy is believed to have netted the IOC over $12 billion since its inception at the 1960 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Little {{documentary}} evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details {{and concentrate on}} the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account {{in the form of}} his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> as an illustration of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.|$|E
50|$|A large aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was its online mode, {{with online}} races {{supporting}} up to 8 players.
