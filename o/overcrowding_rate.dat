40|$|Background. The {{incidence}} of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) incidence varies between and within countries. The origins of this variation are disputed, but they involve both genetic and non-genetic influences. To explore {{the role of}} environmental factors in the aetiology of IDDM we have examined the incidence in small geographical areas and related it to variables derived from national censuses. Methods. This is an ecological analysis of incidence data from a register of children with IDDM covering the counties of West Yorkshire, North Yorkshire and Humberside {{in the north of}} England. All children aged â�¤ 16, diagnosed with IDDM between 1978 and 1990 were eligible for inclusion. Spatial variation in incidence between electoral wards was investigated using Poisson regression, in relation to socioeconomic status, population density, urban-rural status and measures of geographical isolation. Ward child populations varied in size from 84 to 7197 (mean = 1545). Results. Rates were significantly lower in wards of high population density and with many <b>overcrowded</b> houses. The <b>rate</b> ratio for areas in the upper half of the childhood density distribution was 0. 88 (95 confidence interval (CI) : 0. 78 - 0. 99) and for the two upper tertiles of household <b>overcrowding</b> the <b>rate</b> ratios were 0. 84 (95 CI: 0. 74 - 0. 95) and 0. 68 (95 CI: 0. 58 - 0. 79) respectively. Conclusions. The {{incidence of}} childhood IDDM was associated with environmental factors including population density and overcrowded homes. A possible inference from these data is that patterns of infection are involved in the occurrence of IDDM. Analytical epidemiological studies will be needed to investigate these ideas further...|$|R

50|$|According to Eurostat, in 2011, 17.1% of EU {{population}} {{lived in}} overcrowded households by the above definition, {{with the number}} varying strongly between countries: the <b>overcrowding</b> <b>rate</b> stood at 43.1% in 12 newest member states compared to only 10.1% in 15 oldest members. Within the EU post-communist states, {{the extent to which}} the commodification of housing has improved occupancy standards appeared to be modest. For instance, during 2005-2010 the percentage of overcrowded population in Romania and Latvia remained the highest in the EU (55%). Conversely, the Czech Republic showed the best performance in 2010, with overcrowding falling from 33% to 22% over the period, becoming lower than in Italy and Greece. In the remaining EU post-communist states, overcrowding fell moderately over the period, accounting for 35-49% in 2010. Lifecycle has remained a powerful determinant of overcrowding. Eastern Europeans aged under 18 are on average 2.5 times more likely to experience overcrowding than those aged over 65. Affordability problems of young adults, who had to delay home leaving, contributed to unrelenting overcrowding, but so did the legacy of a housing stock composed of many small dwellings. In the EU post-communist states, between 51-87% of dwellings had no more than three rooms.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the authors perform an exten- sive {{analysis}} of the housing situation in Romania {{in relation to other}} EU countries. The following indicators, and others, are examined: the number of dwellings per 1000 inhabitants, the average number of rooms per dwelling, <b>overcrowding,</b> the degradation <b>rate</b> of housing, the rate of util- ities. The type of ownership of the buildings is also analyzed. The implications of the fact that Romania {{has one of the highest}} percentages of private homes in Europe are also discussed. In order to highlight these issues and others (which have been the subject of the authors’ previous studies), in the present work, the dynamics of housing construction in Romania are studied over a long period – namely the period between 1950 - 2011 – with the aim of highlighting the pres- ent position of Romania compared to other EU countries in terms of housing. The analysis leads to the conclusion that on most housing indicators Romania occupies lower ranks compared to oth- er EU countries.   </div...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that bed occupancy (BO) <b>rates,</b> <b>overcrowding</b> and understaffing influence {{the spread of}} hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). In this article, a systematic {{review of the literature}} is presented, summarizing the evidence on the adverse effects of high BO <b>rates</b> and <b>overcrowding</b> in hospitals on the incidence of HAIs. A Pubmed database search identified 179 references, of which 44 were considered to be potentially relevant for full-text review. The majority (62. 9 %) focused on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-associated infection or colonization. Only 12 studies were found that provided a statistical analysis of the impact of BO on HAI rates. The median BO rate of the analysed studies was 81. 2 %. The majority of studies (75 %) indicated that BO rates and understaffing directly influence the incidence of HAIs. Only three studies showed no significant association between BO rates and the incidence of HAIs. Interestingly, only one of the included studies detected a seasonal trend in the BO rate. The present review shows an association between BO rates and the spread of HAIs in various settings. Because the evidence on this topic is limited, we conclude that further research is needed in order to analyse the rationale of a threshold BO rate, because keeping beds empty is comparatively costly...|$|R

40|$|Cross Laminated Timber is an {{innovative}} product, {{which has not}} gained popularity within the Polish construction sector. Concrete and steel remain the most popular construction materials in Poland. There {{is a shortage of}} dwellings in Poland and the <b>overcrowding</b> <b>rate</b> is high in comparison to other European Union countries. Moreover, the demand for office space and luxury housing is increasing in Poland. The National Dwelling Program introduced by the Polish Government in 2016 supports the idea to only use innovative solutions and materials which have a low impact on the environment. Moreover, a new European directive will force the construction sector to develop their processes in order to deliver zero-energy level building constructions. Therefore, the construction sector must adapt their offerings to the changing environment and improve their processes. In addition, consumers {{need to be aware of}} the environmental impact of their choices. The theoretical framework by Aaker (2001) was used to study how attractive the Polish Market is to prospective investors. Kotler’s (1973) theory about marketing management identified the demand for CLT in Poland and basing on the framework we could identify various marketing strategies to perform. Using Porter’s theory (2008) we were able to identify hat the competitive level of CLT in Poland is. Rogers’s theory of innovation explained the complexity of the innovation development process. SWOT and PESTEL analyses delivered the necessary overview on the macro and micro environment in Poland. NABC method presented the most effective way to persuade potential investors to allocate money in CLT in Poland. The secondary data used consists of literature, articles, internet sources and other publications. According to the results, demand for CLT is increasing both in Europe and globally. However, in accordance with the theory above, the demand for CLT in Poland appears to be latent and, as a consequence, development marketing needs to be performed. Based on the results, transportation costs may decrease the cost competitiveness of CLT and therefore investment in a CLT manufacturing plant in Poland needs to be taken into account. Moreover, the costs of raw materials are much lower here in comparison to other European countries. An increased number of permits for new construction projects between 2014 and 2015 shows the boost in construction activities, which is linked to demand for construction materials. Transferring the knowledge about the CLT innovation and its possible applications is required, due to the possible resistance from THE community against wood-based materials. Innovative building solutions as well as energy-efficient buildings can apply for funding through various public funds. However, adverse factors for doing business in Poland are present. Political and social group support can increase the speed and success of the innovation-development process for CLT...|$|E
5000|$|Southern California's {{romance with}} the {{automobile}} owes {{in large part}} to resentment of the Southern Pacific Railroad's tight control over the region's commerce in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During his successful campaign for governor in 1910, anti-Southern Pacific candidate Hiram Johnson traveled the state by car (no small feat at that time). In the minds of Southlanders, this associated the automobile with clean, progressive government, {{in stark contrast to the}} railroads' control over the corrupt governments of the Midwest and Northeast. While the Southern Pacific-owned Pacific Electric Railway's famous Red Car streetcar lines were the axis of urbanization in Los Angeles during its period of spectacular growth in the 1910s and 1920s, they were unprofitable and increasingly unattractive compared to automobiles. As cars became cheaper and began to fill the region's roads in the 1920s, Pacific Electric lost ridership. Traffic congestion soon threatened to choke off the region's development altogether. At the same time, a number of influential urban planners were advocating the construction of a network of what one widely read book dubbed [...] "Magic Motorways", as the backbone of suburban development. These [...] "greenbelt" [...] advocates called for decentralized, automobile-oriented development as a means of remedying both urban <b>overcrowding</b> and declining <b>rates</b> of home ownership.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{neglected}} disease with a nearly forgotten name {{is making a}} comeback following a global control programme that almost eradicated it {{more than forty years}} ago. Until the 1970 s the prevalence of non-venereal treponematosis, including yaws, was greatly reduced after worldwide mass treatment. In 2005, cases were again reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A deterministic model is formulated to investigate the impact of poverty on yaws eradication. Threshold parameters are determined and stabilities analysed. The reproductive number was also used {{to assess the impact of}} birth rate in resource-constrained families on the dynamics of yaws. The model was shown to be globally stable whenever the associated reproductive number is less than a unity. Using the Lyapunov function it was proved that whenever the associated reproductive number is greater than a unity an endemic equilibrium exists and is globally asymptotically stable. Results from this theoretical study suggests that if the population of children in the community is dominated by those from resource-constrained families, then yaws eradication will remain difficulty to attain. Thus, more needs to be done in addressing issues such as high fertility <b>rate,</b> <b>overcrowding,</b> poor sanitation, etc. and poverty in general so that yaws epidemic which was successfully controlled several decades ago will cease to reemerge and can easily be eradicated...|$|R
50|$|George Leslie {{was born}} in 1842, two years after his parents arrived in America from England. Early into his childhood, his father moved the family from their home of New York City to Cincinnati, Ohio. Leslie’s father started his own brewery there, and the {{business}} made their family wealthy. Following the move to Cincinnati, Leslie began his education towards becoming an architect in local schools. While in school, he came of age to be drafted into the Civil War, and Leslie’s father paid three-hundred dollars so {{he did not have}} to go. Despite their family’s high social standing, he was criticized for not going to war and upholding his community’s expectations. Putting the criticism behind him, Leslie went on to get a degree in architecture, and graduated at the top of his class at the University of Cincinnati. After graduating, he ran his own architectural firm in Cincinnati. Both of his parents died in 1867, which made him sell the family home, brewery, and his architectural firm, then he headed east to New York City. When Leslie arrived in New York City, he was met by the repercussions of the Civil War. The city was <b>overcrowded,</b> and the <b>rate</b> of crime was high. The corrupted politicians and police left the city to the many gangs that occupied it. Not long after his arrival, Leslie fell into the criminal lifestyle of the gangs. Due to his architectural skills, he quickly went to the top of the ranks in the criminal world.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to describe the distribution of tuberculosis (TB) mortality by area in the municipality of São Paulo, Brazil, from 1994 to 1998, and to evaluate its statistical association with several population characteristics. We surveyed TB deaths grouped by residential area, at the district level, and we calculated the rates for these areas standardized by gender and age groups. We applied simultaneous autoregressive [...] SAR regression analysis (autocorrelated errors model) in order to fit a "stepwise" model correlating TB deaths with the variables of interest. Significant associations were found between TB mortality rates and AIDS mortality <b>rates,</b> <b>overcrowding</b> at the household level, social development (expressed by a socioeconomic index), and rates of foreign immigration and immigration from other Brazilian States. Regression analysis allowed us to estimate the frequency of TB deaths virtually attributable to co-infection with HIV at 22. 37 % (95 % confidence interval: 12. 15 - 41. 17 %). TB death rates and utilization of public health services were not statistically associated, suggesting a reduced effectiveness of programs directed at control of the disease. The correlation between TB death rates and deprivation, measured by the socioeconomic index, indicates higher mortality in underprivileged areas. The significance of the association between housing overcrowding and TB deaths, in contrast to the absence of association with district-level overcrowding, indicates that prolonged contact is needed for disease transmission. Although the influx of foreigners and national migrants to the city diminished after the 1980 Â s, immigration rates have been significantly correlated with TB mortality, suggesting greater vulnerability of these population segments to the disease.

50|$|The Union of South Africa {{had allowed}} social custom and law {{to govern the}} {{consideration}} of multiracial affairs and of the allocation, in racial terms, of access to economic, social, and political status. Most white South Africans, regardless of their own differences, accepted the prevailing pattern. Nevertheless, by 1948 it remained apparent that there were occasional gaps in the social structure, whether legislated or otherwise, concerning the rights and opportunities of nonwhites. The rapid economic development of World War II attracted black migrant workers in large numbers to chief industrial centres, where they compensated for the wartime shortage of white labour. However, this escalated rate of black urbanisation went unrecognised by the South African government, which failed to accommodate the influx with parallel expansion in housing or social services. <b>Overcrowding,</b> spiking crime <b>rates,</b> and disillusionment resulted; urban blacks came to support {{a new generation of}} leaders influenced by the principles of self-determination and popular freedoms enshrined in such statements as the Atlantic Charter. Whites reacted negatively to the changes, allowing the Herenigde Nasionale Party (or simply National Party) to convince {{a large segment of the}} voting bloc that the impotence of the United Party in curtailing the evolving position of nonwhites indicated that the organisation had fallen under the influence of Western liberals. Many Afrikaners, whites chiefly of Dutch descent but with early infusions of Germans and French Huguenots who were soon assimilated, also resented what they perceived as disempowerment by an underpaid black workforce and the superior economic power and prosperity of white English speakers. In addition, Jan Smuts, as a strong advocate of the United Nations, lost domestic support when South Africa was criticised for its colour bar and continued mandate of South West Africa by other UN member states.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{reasonable}} {{advances in}} public policies for {{housing in the}} last two decades, Brazil 2 ̆ 7 s current housing deficit is 5. 6 million housing units. In São Paulo, Brazil 2 ̆ 7 s largest city, an estimated one fifth of the population of 17. 5 million is currently living in inadequate housing conditions, like the 2 ̆ 2 favelas 2 ̆ 2 (Shanty Towns) (IBGE). The favelas 2 ̆ 7 houses are made from scrap materials such as wood and metal sheeting, they do not have services such as sanitation, water or electricity, and the settlements are usually very <b>overcrowded.</b> The gigantic <b>rate</b> of illegal occupation of urban land has lead to disastrous consequences not only to {{the people who live in}} them, but to society as a whole, and to environment sustainability. At most countries, including Brazil, social housing has little to do with diversity and uniqueness of living. Social housing is influenced by functionalism and the economic cost effectiveness of the production process. Unfortunately, new urban areas are still being built using the same traditional ideas, which results largely in a very functionalistic approach of repetitiveness. One unit is repeated into a row of identical blocks. This concept is still used in most of the new Brazilian urban areas. As a result those areas become monotonous and repetitive, lacking identity and uniqueness. This Thesis objective is to expose the negative impacts of the present social housing mass production model, and then to analyze the possibilities of a coherent alternative to housing based on identity, sense of community and uniqueness present at the favelas, which could consistently improve the dwellings and the built environment. The main idea is to find inspiration on the Brazilian favelas to develop a new concept for social housing. In spite of all the physical, environmental, economic and social problems, favelas are an example of coherent housing production processes where dwellers autonomously decide about the design, building and use of their dwellings. They also are usually linked to a strong sense of community no longer found elsewhere. The pattern of these large areas shows an uncontrolled growth of residential units, which leads to a vast, seemingly chaotic, but yet very structured way of living. (Vanderfeesten) The analysis of this pattern of structures is a very strong foundation to develop a modular system of building blocks. The main idea is to create an urban housing environment consisting of modular blocks to provide a 2 ̆ 2 favela-based 2 ̆ 2 pattern. Multiple modules typologies will be designed in order to correspond to each family 2 ̆ 7 s needs. The arrangement of the modules will result in open walkways, small streets, larger open areas and a vast amount of balconies, roof terraces, parks, and gardens. As a result there is a great opportunity for social interaction. The main goal is to design a housing neighborhood where each house is unique in its structural composition, providing a way of living in which social interaction is promoted while maintaining each individuals identity through the uniqueness of each unit...|$|R
