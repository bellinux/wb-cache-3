40|$|Abstract approved: Aerial {{photography}} {{provides a}} method of analyzing dispersion of wastes that are discharged into the ocean. This method is more comprehensive than conventional boat sampling in dispersion studies. The photographic technique permits waste concentrations to be measured throughout the plume in one instant; thereby allowing the diffusion analysis {{to be based on}} a nonsteady state model rather than the normally assumed steady state model. Field studies were conducted on the waste plume from an ocean <b>outfall.</b> Waste <b>concentrations</b> were measured by conventional boat sampling while aerial photography was taken of the area, Com-puterized procedures were developed for computing the water cur-rents, waste concentrations and diffusion coefficients from the photography. Comparisons of waste concentrations indicated that the discrepancies are due primarily to changing and shifting of the waste field in this dynamic environment...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of total, {{filterable}} and DGT-labile {{concentrations of}} nine metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni and Zn) {{have been made}} at five sites up to 4. 2 km from a deep sea tailings outfall operated by Lihir Gold Ltd. at Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea. At each site, pairs of DGT units (one containing a 0. 4 mm {{and the other a}} 0. 8 mm diffusive gel layer) were deployed at three depths (50 – 70; 105 – 130; 135 – 155 m) for 4 – 7 days. Comparison of predicted water column DGT-labile metal concentrations in field deployments showed the 0. 8 mm DGT units were relatively enriched in metals, with the effect being greatest closer to the outfall for Pb and Mn and least for Fe, Cr, Ni and Zn. The most likely explanation for this is that in addition to simple ion diffusion, kinetic factors associated with ageing or desorption processes govern release of metals from iron and aluminium oxyhydroxide colloids which diffuse through the gels. The thicker gels have a longer residence time over which metals can be released for adsorption. This model explains why enrichment is most pronounced near the outfall; more distant sites have lower colloid concentrations because of the longer time for coagulation to increase particle sizes to the extent they cannot enter the gels. Total and filterable metal (FM) concentrations were frequently below the limits of detection (LOD) achievable by conventional ICP-AES (1 – 52 gL − 1) and this limited their usefulness for assessing environmental risk and for metal speciation determination. Because of its pre-concentration step DGT gave metal concentrations above their LODs and these decreased exponentially with distance from the <b>outfall.</b> <b>Concentrations</b> of DGT–labile metal fell below Australian water quality guidelines for protection of 99 % of marine organisms within 0. 13 km of the outfall for Cd, Cr and Ni and below that for protection of 95 % of marine organisms within 0. 4, 0. 7 and 3. 6 km for lead, zinc and copper, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The Ottawa River has {{received}} nuclear reactor effluent from Chalk River Laboratories (CRL) {{for more than}} 60 years, including releases from a NRX accident in 1952. Recent interest in {{the potential impact of}} these historical releases and the possible need for remediation of a small region immediately downstream from the release point has led to comprehensive studies to assess risk to people and wildlife. In this paper, the results of an extensive survey of gamma-emitting anthropogenic radionuclides in Ottawa River sediment in the vicinity of CRL are presented. Anthropogenic radionuclides detected in Ottawa River sediment include 60 Co, 94 Nb, 137 Cs, 152 Eu, 154 Eu, 155 Eu and 241 Am. Concentrations of all anthropogenic radionuclides decline rapidly with distance downstream of the process <b>outfall,</b> reaching stable <b>concentrations</b> about 2 km downstream. All of these radionuclides are found at some sites within 2 km upstream of the process outfall suggesting limited upstream transport and sedimentation. Comparison of anthropogenic radionuclides with several representative primordial radionuclides shows that with the exception of sites at the process outfall and within 2 km downstream of the process <b>outfall,</b> primordial radionuclide <b>concentrations</b> greatly exceed CRL derived anthropogenic radionuclide concentrations. Thus, over 60 years of radionuclide releases from operations at CRL have had little impact on radionuclide concentrations in Ottawa River sediment, except at a few sites immediately adjacent to the process outfall...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus (P) inputs to sewage {{treatment}} works (STW) {{come from a}} variety of sources and filtration of treated wastewater prior to discharge into receiving waters is a common practice. This means P in treated wastewaters may be present in forms that are potentially more bioavailable and mobile. We conducted a 2 -year study to determine P species up and downstream of two STW outfalls into two tributaries of the River Thames. Downstream of the <b>outfalls,</b> P <b>concentrations</b> in both rivers were frequently greater by an order of magnitude for all species of P. A high proportion of total P (TP) in the downstream waters was determined as dissolved, which was largely comprised of soluble reactive P (SRP) - considered as the most bioavailable P species. Furthermore no significant difference in SRP was found in receiving waters passed through 0. 45 and 0. 10 μm filters. This means that P from STWs occurs in < 0. 1 μm fraction size, which will not readily settle to the channel bed and is more easily assimilated by biota. This distinguishes STW inputs from agricultural runoff where a high proportion of P occurs as particulate P which is both less bioavailable and more likely to settle to the channel bed. This implies that STWs derived P is likely to have a greater adverse impact on the receiving river than agricultural runoff...|$|R

However, research showing that various intrinsic and extrinsic factors can influence metal accumulation, raises doubts about the basis for using seaweeds in biomonitoring programmes. The thallus of brown seaweeds of the order Laminariales (kelps) is morphologically complex but there is limited information about the variation in metal accumulation between the different parts, which might result in erroneous conclusions being drawn if not accounted for in the biomonitoring protocol. To assess patterns of individual metals in the differentiated parts of the thallus (blade, stipe, holdfast), concentrations {{of a wide range}} of essential and non-essential metals (Fe, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn, Pb, Cd, Ni and Al) were measured in the kelp Lessonia trabeculata. Seaweeds were collected from three sampling stations located at 5, 30 and 60 m from an illegal sewage outfall close to Ventanas, Chile and from a pristine location at Faro Curaumilla. For the majority of metals the highest concentrations in bottom sediment and seaweed samples were found at the site closest to the <b>outfall,</b> with <b>concentrations</b> decreasing with distance from the outfall and at control stations; the exception was Cd, concentrations of which were higher at control stations.

40|$|A {{monitoring}} program was initiated for two sewage outfalls (OA and OB) with different land uses (mainly residential versus institutional) {{over the course}} of a year. Eleven CSO events resulting from fall and summer precipitations and a mixture of snowmelt and precipitation in late winter and early spring were monitored. Median concentrations measured in CSOs were 1. 5 × 106 Escherichia coli/ 100 mL, 136. 0 mg/L of Total Suspended Solids (TSS), 4599. 0 ng/L of caffeine (CAF), 158. 9 ng/L of carbamazepine (CBZ), in outfall OA and 5. 1 × 104 E. coli/ 100 mL, 167. 0 mg TSS/L, 300. 8 ng CAF/L, 4. 1 ng CBZ/L, in <b>outfall</b> OB. <b>Concentration</b> dynamics in CSOs were mostly related to the dilution by stormwater and the time of day of the onset of overflows. Snowmelt was identified as a critical period with regards to the protection of drinking water sources given the high contaminant concentrations and long duration of events in addition to a lack of restrictions on overflows during this period. Correlations among measured parameters reflected the origins and transport pathways of the contaminants, with E. coli being correlated with CBZ. TSS were not correlated with E. coli because E. coli was found to be mostly associated with raw sewage whereas TSS were additionally from the resuspension of in-sewer deposits and surface runoff. In receiving waters, E. coli remained the best indicator of fecal contamination in strongly diluted water samples as compared to WWMPs because WWMPs can be diluted to below their detection limits. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|A broad based {{approach}} {{has been used to}} assess the impact of discharges to rivers from surface water sewers, with the primary objective of determining whether such discharges have a measurable impact on water quality. Three parameters, each reflecting the effects of intermittent pollution, were included in a field work programme of biological and chemical sampling and analysis which covered 47 sewer outfall sites. These parameters were the numbers and types of benthic macroinvertebrates upstream and downstream of the <b>outfalls,</b> the <b>concentrations</b> of metals in sediments, and the concentrations of metals in algae upstream and downstream of the outfalls. Information on the sewered catchments was collected from Local Authorities and by observation of the time of sampling, and includes catchment areas, land uses, evidence of connection to the foul system, and receiving water quality classification. The methods used for site selection, sampling, laboratory analysis and data analysis are fully described, and the survey results presented. Statistical and graphical analysis of the biological data, with the aid of BMWP scores, showed that there was a small but persistent fall in water quality downstream of the studied outfalls. Further analysis including the catchment information indicated that initial water quality, sewered catchment size, receiving stream size, and catchment land use were important factors in determining the impact. Finally, the survey results were used to produce guidelines for the estimation of surface water sewer discharge impacts from knowledge of the catchment characteristics, so that planning authorities can consider water quality when new drainage systems are designed...|$|R

The CSO occurred at the Clichy outfall (Paris agglomeration, France) in summer 2008 as a result of the most intense rainfall of the year. In 6 h, 578, 705 m(3) of sewage and 124 t of suspended matter (SM) were discharged into the Seine River. The CSO contained 1. 5 × 10 (6) E. coli and 4. 0 × 10 (5) intestinal enterococci per 100 mL on average, and 77 % of the E. coli were attached to SM. It was estimated that 89 % of the CSO discharge was contributed by surface water runoff, and that resuspension of sewer sediment contributed to ∼ 75 % of the SM, 10 - 70 % of the E. coli and 40 - 80 % of the intestinal enterococci. Directly downstream from the CSO <b>outfall,</b> FIB <b>concentrations</b> in the impacted water mass of the Seine River (2. 9 × 10 (5) E. coli and 7. 6 × 10 (4) intestinal enterococci per 100 mL) exceeded by two orders of magnitude the usual dry weather concentrations. After 13 - 14 h of transit, these concentrations had decreased by 66 % for E. coli and 79 % for intestinal enterococci. This decline was well accounted for by our estimations of dilution, decay resulting from mortality or loss of culturability and sedimentation of the attached fraction of FIB.

Although, not a new phenomenon, concern exists on the increasing persistence, scale, and toxicity of these blooms. There is evidence, in recent years, of the transfer of these toxins from inland to marine waters through freshwater outflow. However, the true impact of these blooms in marine habitats has been overlooked. In the present work, we describe the detection of Planktothrix agardhii, which is a common microcystin producer, in the Portuguese marine coastal waters nearby a river outfall in an area used for shellfish harvesting and recreational activities. P. agardhii was first observed in November of 2016 in seawater samples {{that are in the}} scope of the national shellfish monitoring system. This occurrence was followed closely between November and December of 2016 by a weekly sampling of mussels and water from the sea pier and adjacent river mouth with salinity ranging from 35 to 3. High cell densities were found in the water from both sea pier and river <b>outfall,</b> reaching <b>concentrations</b> of 4, 960, 608 cells·L− 1 and 6810. 3 × 106 cells·L− 1 respectively. Cultures were also established with success from the environment and microplate salinity growth assays showed that the isolates grew at salinity 10. HPLC-PDA analysis of total microcystin content in mussel tissue, water biomass, and P. agardhii cultures did not retrieve a positive result. In addition, microcystin related genes were not detected in the water nor cultures. So, the P. agardhii present in the environment was probably a non-toxic strain. This is, to our knowledge, the first report on a P. agardhii bloom reaching the sea and points to the relevance to also monitoring freshwater harmful phytoplankton and related toxins in seafood harvesting and recreational coastal areas, particularly under the influence of river plumes...|$|R

Best Management Practices, or BMPs, can help diminish these contaminants in many ways, such as settling small particles (turbidity) out of the water.

40|$|Synthetic musks are {{incorporated}} extensively in {{personal care products}} to improve their scent, increase their fragrance stability, and prolong their shelf-life. As a consequence, these persistent musks are being released at a considerable rate by wastewater treatment plants and are frequently detected in surface water, bottom sediment, air, and aquatic biota near urban areas. In addition to their hydrophobicity, two synthetic musks, Galaxolide (HHCB) and Tonalide (AHTN), were reported to cause endocrine disruption in fish species. Although most of the toxic effects in past studies were observed at high doses, HHCB and AHTN were shown to bioaccumulate very differently depending on the aquatic species tested. As bioaccumulation and fate of contaminants are important considerations when regulating persistent chemicals, an improved understanding of the bioaccumulation potential of these chemicals is needed. In this thesis, {{an assessment of the}} presence, bioconcentration and fate of HHCB and AHTH was provided in an area exposed to the effluent of the Gold Bar wastewater treatment plant in the North Saskatchewan River (Edmonton). HHCB and AHTN were quantified in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed downstream of the effluent, with an adapted method for analysis of musks in fish, using PAHs as recovery standards. Method development and recoveries are summarized. Highest bioconcentration factors were 24, 500 and 22, 300 for HHCB and AHTN respectively, and were observed 1 km downstream of the outfall.

Among the clear signs of eutrophication are the heavy visible blooms, which became regular events, at intermittent periods during the warm seasons. The causative organisms progressed differently, the dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium catenatum, is well known toxic species. The Environmental Impact Assessment model (EIA) was applied to Mex Bay. It is a three-dimensional water quality and flow model, based on the three interacted dimensional: longitude, latitude and depth, calculations {{of time and space}} variations. The model deals with processes that affecting the water quality. It was initiated with measured field data and load input. The model was used to simulate phytoplankton biomass transport and ambient nutrient concentrations (nitrate, phosphate & ammonia).

Combined sewer overflow (CSO) effluents are {{the primary source of}} fecal contamination of the river. An analysis of river flowrates was conducted using historical data and predicted flows from a future climate scenario. A spatio-temporal analysis of water quality trends with regard to fecal contamination was performed and the effects of changing flowrates on the dilution of fecal contaminants were analyzed. Along the river, there was a significant spatial trend for increasing fecal pollution downstream of CSO <b>outfalls.</b> Escherichia coli <b>concentrations</b> (upper 95 th percentile) increased linearly from 2002 to 2012 at one drinking water treatment plant intake. Two critical periods in the current climate were identified for the drinking water intakes considering both potential contaminant loads and flowrates: local spring snowmelt that precedes river peak flow and extra-tropical storm events that occur during low flows. Regionally, climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the impacts of hydrological conditions on water quality in the studied basin. Based on climate projections, it is expected that spring snowmelt will occur earlier and extreme spring flowrates will increase and low flows will generally decrease. High and low flows are major factors related to the potential degradation of water quality of the river. However, the observed degradation of water quality over the past 10. years suggests that urban development and population growth may have played a greater role than climate. However, climate change impacts will likely be observed over a longer period. Source water protection plans should consider climate change impacts on the dilution of contaminants in addition to local land uses changes in order to maintain or improve water quality.

Na dÃcada de 70, Fortaleza teve um salto de crescimento urbano, desordenado, na sua Ãrea costeira, com uma sÃria de construÃÃes que afetaram de maneira direta a sua linha de costa, tais como o antigo e atual porto de Fortaleza. Assim, este estudo teve por objetivo avaliar a influÃncia das atividades antrÃpicas sobre a emissÃo de metais e sobre a distribuiÃÃo e partiÃÃo geoquÃmica destes metais contidos nos sedimentos da regiÃo costeira da RMF. Analisados os teores de Hg, Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, Al e Fe, nos sedimentos costeiros coletados em duas campanhas, nos perÃodos de chuva e seca, nÃo foi encontrada diferenÃa estatÃstica entre resultados obtidos relativos Ãs diferentes campanhas, exceto para o Fe.

TambÃm foi observado que o runoff urbano Ã importante emissor de Cd e Pb, tendo em vista as elevadas concentraÃÃes encontradas prÃximas Ã linha de costa. A distribuiÃÃo dos metais mostrou que hÃ dois importantes fatores determinantes do comportamento destes metais em sedimentos costeiros da RMF. O primeiro fator estÃ relacionado aos carreadores geoquÃmicos que predominantemente influenciam o comportamento do cobre, do chumbo e do zinco. O segundo fator estÃ relacionado Ã proximidade e/ou intensidade das Ãreas fontes e dominou o comportamento do Hg e do Cd. The {{coastal zone}} of CearÃ State {{corresponds}} to only 14. 38 % of the Stateâs territory but harbors about 48. 9 % {{of its total}} population. The Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza (RMF), the Stateâs Capital population density at the coastal zone reaches 598 inhab/km 2, and 6. 814 inhab/km 2 when only the city of Fortaleza itself is considered. During the 1970 âs, Fortaleza witnessed an accelerated and unplanned urban growth along its coastal zone including engineering works, which affected the coastline itself, including the Fortaleza Harbor and may have increased pollutants emissions to the coastal region. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the influence of these antropogenic developments on the emissions of trace metals and their distribution and geochemical partitioning in bottom sediments collected along the RMF coastal region. In two field campaigns, {{in the rain and}} dry season, the concentrations of Hg, Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, Fe and Al, were measured in bottom sediments of the coastal zone. There {{was no significant difference between}} the two campaigns for all trace metals, except for Fe. Measured concentrations varied between 0. 72 to 17. 54 ng. g- 1 for Hg; 0. 32 to 4. 64 &# 956;g. g- 1 for Cu; 0. 13 to 0. 77 &# 956;g. g- 1 for Cd; 3. 29 to 13. 00 &# 956;g. g- 1 for Pb; 1. 81 to 18. 64 &# 956;g. g- 1 for Zn; 0. 78 to 9. 12 mg. g- 1 for Al, 0. 76 to 9. 27 mg. g- 1 (rain season) and 1. 28 to 13. 92 mg. g- 1 (dry season) for Fe. All trace metals concentrations presented significant positive correlation with the major geochemical carries analyzed, i. e. organic matter content, Aluminum and Iron, except for carbonates, carbonates are not efficient carriers of metals in these metals. Although the oceanic water mass acts as a large diluter of contaminants, areas of higher trace metal concentrations were observed close to the shoreline, at the area of influence of the Fortaleza Harbor and near the outlet of a submarine wastewater <b>outfall.</b> <b>Concentrations</b> decrease in an E-W direction following the littoral drift. The submarine wastewater outfall of Fortaleza showed an important point source of Hg, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb. Although absolute concentrations of these trace metals were, in general, low. The higher concentrations along the shoreline suggest that urban runoff is also a significant source of trace metals, in particular of Cd and Pb. The spatial distribution of trace metals concentrations showed two important factors determining the behavior of trace metals in the bottom sediments of the RMF. The first factor is related to the concentrations of the geochemical carriers, which influence the behavior of Cu, Pb and Zn.

40|$|Dissolved {{organic matter}} (DOM) in the aquatic {{environment}} originates from living and decaying organisms and anthropogenic sources. DOM plays {{a significant role}} in the availability of dissolved nutrients, sequestration of metals from the environment, and optical properties in aquatic ecosystems, all of which affect aquatic organisms. For example, DOM can change water clarity, introduce stresses from oxygen demand, and ultimately impair aquatic ecosystems. Within urban water systems, significant fluxes of anthropogenic DOM can be contributed to receiving waters with stormwater runoff; however, little is known about the amount, quality, and timing of these contributions. This research is aimed at testing new methods for quantifying the spatial and temporal patterns in the DOM pool within urban waters conveyances that receive stormwater runoff. Tested methods for detecting DOM within the urban water conveyance include in situ fluorescent DOM (fDOM) sensors, excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) analysis. Preliminary results from a season of stromwater sampling efforts within the Northwest Field Canal in Logan City show temporal changes in DOM concentrations, with elevated <b>concentrations</b> from stormwater <b>outfalls</b> that elevate <b>concentrations</b> in the canal during stormwater runoff events. Results also indicate spatial variability of source characteristics within the DOM pool, with stormwater inflows elevating the fraction of allochthonous DOM within the canal. To further characterize spatial and temporal patterns, in situ fluorescence monitoring will be conducted this year at target excitation-emission pairs, paired with the use of a mobile water quality monitoring vessel. The use of targeted excitation-emission sensors will enable the collection high temporal resolution fluorescence data as a surrogate for DOM concentrations that will be used to further characterize the DOM pool. The mobile sensing vessel will provide high spatial resolution data along sections of the canal to capture behavior that would otherwise be unobserved at permanent in situ monitoring sites. This technique is especially advantageous since the DOM pool can change rapidly depending on the chemical composition. Data obtained through these methods will lead to an enhanced understanding of how DOM is processed within aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, these efforts will assist in quantifying the degree to which spatial and temporal variability of DOM in the conveyance is driven by slow changes over the summer growing season versus sudden inputs from stormwater discharges. This research will contribute to the understanding and management of water resources as water flows through an urban environment. More precisely, quantifying the characteristics and spatial and temporal patterns of DOM will lead to greater understanding of the contributions from input sources and the effects DOM has on urban receiving waters...|$|R
