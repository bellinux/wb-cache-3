40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>outworker</b> {{exploitation}} is one which has periodically come under public focus and scrutiny. This is due to, in part, the concerted effort made by {{organisations such as}} Fair Wear and others (most notably the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia) to highlight <b>outworker</b> pay and conditions. Over the years, protests organised by Fair Wear outside retail chains have brought media attention to an area of industry which is rapidly expanding. Outworkers have also {{been the subject of}} many recent reports and inquiries, the majority of which conclude that some exploitation does occur (although {{the nature and extent of}} the poor working conditions are disputed).

40|$|Campaigns {{in support}} of home-based {{clothing}} workers (or ‘outworkers’ as they are more commonly known in Australia) deploy powerful images of the exploitative underside of fashion. The migrant woman huddled over her machine has become the quintessential image of campaigns directed against this exploitation. This article engages critically with the politics of such image-making. By examining how frames simultaneously shrink and magnify the image produced it raises questions about what these images exclude or expel and whether and how this matters. It also offers an alternative frame of the female immigrant <b>outworker</b> – an up-close portrait of Hien, a Vietnamese woman who works at home sewing clothes in her suburban shed. The article introduces Hien through a condensed collection of her self-narratives, {{before moving on to}} consider how a trade union and community-based movement against <b>outworker</b> exploitation mobilised images of suffering and injured Vietnamese women to promote its cause. It asks how these images speak for and represent women like Hien and suggests that their political ‘success’ relies to some extent on the women being ‘unseen’ and made to ‘unspeak’. Finally, through the metaphor of space, it proffers an expanded dimension to the already framed images invoking Hien’s shed as a space that both produces and disciplines her: ultimately, a ‘transitional space’ between the external and internal worlds that shape and constrain her...|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of retailers structure their businesses using {{the supply chain}} outsourcing model. Pursuant to this model retailers outsource production to suppliers who then outsource the actual clothing manufacturing work to factories and/or outworkers. The supply chain model is an extremely profitable business model for corporations. These retailers, rather than being involved with both manufacturing and marketing, devote all their attention to marketing and designing new products. For all intents and purposes, they are hollow corporations, focusing entirely upon marketing. Even though retailers {{are not involved in}} the manufacturing process, this does not mean they have no influence over this process. Weller has observed that the buyer driven model is not suitable for all retailers. The buyer driven model is however appropriate for major Australian retailers such as Coles Myer, Woolworths or Australian Discount Retail Pty Ltd. These large retail groups have sufficient market power to exercise substantial control over suppliers of clothing products and over traders who interact with outworkers. Nossa, Quinlan and Johnstone refer to these corporate groups at the top of supply chains as effective business controllers. Research has continually demonstrated that outworkers are vulnerable and operate in unsafe working conditions. Marshall J in Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia v Southern Cross Clothing Pty Ltd explained: Outworkers in the clothing industry in Australia {{are some of the most}} exploited people in the Australian workforce. They perform garment making work often at absurdly low rates in locations outside their employer's premises. This frequently occurs in the homes of outworkers. In order to address the plight of outworkers legislative reforms have been introduced to extend industrial protection to outworkers in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. In a previous paper the author has focused on how these duties operate to impose OHS duties over the trader who directly supplies the <b>outworker</b> with work. This article will analyse if OHS duties can be pushed higher in the supply chain to vest over the parties who outsource work in the first place and often control the overall supply chain: retailers. Nossar, Quinlan and Johnstone argue that an 'overarching deficiency [of the current regulatory framework] has been the absence of any relevant formal legal obligations upon the major retailers, who effectively control the Australian clothing supply chains. This has provided an economic context in which the different parties competing further down the supply chains can only survive commercially by reducing their costs, most notably the costs of complying with formal legal obligations. ' This article will analyse the OHS duties of retailers in four parts. First this paper will consider how deemed employment laws which require traders to manage outworkers’ workplace safety may be able to be extended up supply chains to vest over retailers. Secondly this paper will analyse how employers’ OHS duties for non-employees may create OHS duties for retailers to ensure outworkers safety. It appears that imposing OHS duties across several corporate relationships and across geographical locations may diminish the capacity of retailers to manage outworkers. The third part of this paper will demonstrate how the OHS duties only require parties to take all reasonably practicable steps to ensure safety. Finally this paper will analyze the capacity of retailers to utilize hold harmless clauses to avoid OHS duties. Hold harmless clauses have been subject to recent judicial and legislative attention in the principal/contractor relationship. The precedents established in the principal/contractor relationship on hold harmless clauses are applicable for all relationships, and this may include the retail/outworker relationship. As the relationship between retailers and other participants in supply chains is governed predominantly by common law contracts, hold harmless clauses may have significant potential to determine the scope of a retailer's responsibility for the OHS of outworkers in a supply chain. More importantly, if allowed to operate widely, hold harmless clauses have the potential to act as a significant limitation on the reach of OHS laws to a growing population of vulnerable workers. ...|$|E

The lesser roles, such as the <b>outworkers,</b> would be filled from those who offered their skills and labour at the hiring fair (held on Lady Day each year). These workers would be hired and paid on a quarterly basis. The most important servant would have been the Steward. He would’ve been educated and fluent in Welsh and English with a strong knowledge of the law and good insight into the local tenantry.

5000|$|The {{persons to}} whom the {{benefits}} of the act applied were added to by the act by Truck of 1887, which repealed the complicated list of trades Acts contained in the principal act and substituted the simpler definition of the Employers and Workmen Act 1875. Thus the Acts 1831 to 1887, and also the Act of 1896, apply to all workers (men, women and children) engaged in manual labour, except domestic servants; they apply not only in mines, factories and workshops, but, to quote the published Home Office Memorandum on the acts, [...] "in all places where workpeople are engaged in manual labour under a contract with an employer, whether or no the employer be an owner or agent or a parent, or be himself a workman; and therefore a workman who employs ... and pays others under him must also observe the Truck Acts." [...] The law thus in certain circumstances covers <b>outworkers</b> for a contractor or sub-contractor. A decision of the High Court at Dublin in 1900 (Squire v. Sweeney) strengthened the inspectors in investigation of offences committed amongst <b>outworkers</b> by supporting the contention that inquiry and exercise of all the powers of an. inspector could legally take place in parts of an employer's premises other than those in which the work is given out. It defined for Ireland, in a narrower sense than had hitherto been understood and acted upon by the Factory Department, the classes of <b>outworkers</b> protected, by deciding that only such as were under a contract personally to execute the work were covered.|$|R
