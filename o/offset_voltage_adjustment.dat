40|$|Abstract—When {{mismatches}} {{are present}} in a dynamic com-parator, due to internal positive feedback and transient response, it is always challenging to analytically predict the input-referred random <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> since the operating points of transistors are time varying. In this paper, a novel balanced method is proposed to facilitate the evaluation of operating points of transistors in a dynamic comparator. Thus, it becomes possible to obtain an explicit expression for <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> in dynamic comparators. We include two types of mismatches in the model: 1) static <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> from the mismatch in C and threshold voltage and 2) dynamic <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> due to the mismatch in the par-asitic capacitances. From the analytical models, designers can obtain an intuition about the main contributors to offset and also fully explore the tradeoffs in dynamic comparator design, such as <b>offset</b> <b>voltage,</b> area and speed. To validate the balanced method, two topologies of dynamic comparator implemented in 0. 25 - m and 40 -nm CMOS technology are applied as examples. Input-referred <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> are first derived analytically based on SPICE Level 1 model, whose values are compared with more accurate Monte Carlo transient simulations using a sophisticated BSIM 3 model. A good agreement between those two verifies {{the effectiveness of the}} balanced method. To illustrate its potential, the explicit expressions of <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> were applied to guide the optimization of “Lewis-Gray ” structure.

40|$|Dynamic {{comparators}} and voltage {{references are}} among the most widely used fundamental building blocks for various types of circuits and systems, such as data converters, PLLs, switching regulators, memories, and CPUs. As thermal constraints quickly emerged as a dominant performance limiter, on-die temperature sensors will be critical to the reliable operation of future integrated circuits. This dissertation investigates characteristics of these three enabling circuits and design strategies for improving their performances. One of the most critical specifications of a dynamic comparator is its input referred <b>offset</b> <b>voltage,</b> which is pivotal to achieving overall system performance requirements of many mixed-signal circuits and systems. Unlike <b>offset</b> <b>voltages</b> in other circuits such as amplifiers, the <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> in a dynamic comparator is extremely challenging to analyze and predict analytically due to its dependence on transient response and due to internal positive feedback and time-varying operating points in the comparator. In this work, a novel balanced method is proposed to facilitate the evaluation of time-varying operating points of transistors in a dynamic comparator. Two types of offsets are studied in the model: (1) static <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> caused by mismatches in mobilities, transistor sizes, and threshold voltages, and (2) dynamic <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> caused by mismatches in parasitic capacitors or loading capacitors. To validate the proposed method, dynamic comparators in two prevalent topologies are implemented in 0. 25 μm and 40 nm CMOS technologies.

40|$|Abstract—A novel bias-switching {{scheme for}} a high-efficiency power {{amplifier}} is proposed. Two voltage levels for the drain bias of the RF power amplifier are generated {{using a combination}} of a class E dc/ac inverter and a class E rectifier with <b>offset</b> <b>voltage.</b> When signal peaks occur, the output of the class E dc/ac inverter is rectified and the rectified dc is added to the <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> by the class E rectifier, which boosts the drain bias of the RF power ampli-fier. Except during peaks, the drain bias of the RF power amplifier is connected to the <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> directly. Since the efficiency when there are no peaks is very high due to the direct connection between the <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> and drain bias, the overall efficiency of the RF power amplifier can be improved dramatically in high peak-to-av-erage power ratio (PAPR) systems. The measured results show that the drain bias of the RF power amplifier is boosted up to approx-imately 1. 8 times the <b>offset</b> <b>voltage</b> when the RF peaks generate.
