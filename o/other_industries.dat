5|$|In 1880, {{the leading}} {{industries}} of St. Louis included brewing, flour milling, slaughtering, paper making, machining, and tobacco processing. <b>Other</b> <b>industries</b> including {{the manufacture of}} paint, bricks, and iron. During the 1880s, the city grew in population by 29 percent, from 350,518 to 451,770, making it the country's fourth largest city; it also ranked fourth as measured by value of its manufactured products, and more than 6,148 factories existed in 1890. However, during the 1890s, manufacturing growth slowed dramatically. The Panic of 1893 and subsequent depression and the overproduction of grain made St. Louis mills considerably less productive and valuable. Flour milling was halved and most <b>other</b> <b>industries</b> suffered similar declines.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, the {{nationwide}} prohibition of alcohol in 1919 brought heavy losses to the St. Louis brewing industry. <b>Other</b> <b>industries,</b> such as light manufacturing of clothing, automobile manufacturing, and chemical production, filled {{much of the}} gap, and St. Louis's economy was relatively diversified and healthy during the 1920s.|$|E

5|$|Midsomer Norton {{traditionally}} hosted <b>other</b> <b>industries</b> {{and became}} a major manufacturing centre for printing and packaging. Some 2,000 people (27% of total employment) work in this industry locally. Following the decline of mining, these companies expanded on local trading estates and in Welton. The sites of the disused collieries in the area have subsequently been developed for light industry.|$|E

Traditional industries {{continue to operate}} in Nablus, such as the production of soap, olive oil, and handicrafts. <b>Other</b> <b>industries</b> include furniture production, tile production, stone quarrying, textile manufacturing and leather tanning.

5|$|Though oil has {{historically}} dominated the state's economy, a {{collapse in the}} energy industry during the 1980s led {{to the loss of}} nearly 90,000 energy-related jobs between 1980 and 2000, severely damaging the local economy. Oil accounted for 35 billion dollars in Oklahoma's economy in 2007, and employment in the state's oil industry was outpaced by five <b>other</b> <b>industries</b> in 2007. , the state's unemployment rate is 4.4%.|$|E

The gas storage facility in the north-eastern corner of the town was once a gasworks and another significant employer.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture has {{historically}} been {{a key component of}} the South Dakota economy. Although <b>other</b> <b>industries</b> have expanded rapidly in recent decades, agricultural production is still very important to the state's economy, especially in rural areas. The five most valuable agricultural products in South Dakota are cattle, corn (maize), soybeans, wheat, and hogs. Agriculture-related industries such as meat packing and ethanol production also have a considerable economic impact on the state. South Dakota {{is one of the largest}} producers of ethanol in the nation.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller {{than it had been}} in the mid 19th century. <b>Other</b> <b>industries</b> such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and dairying continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of the {{population}} and settlements in the county continued during the Tudor and more recent periods. Agriculture and coal mining expanded until the 18th century, although <b>other</b> <b>industries</b> declined during the industrial revolution. In modern times {{the population}} has grown, particularly in the seaside towns, notably Weston-super-Mare. Agriculture continues to be a major business, if no longer a major employer because of mechanisation. Light industries are based in towns such as Bridgwater and Yeovil. The towns of Taunton and Shepton Mallet manufacture cider, although the acreage of apple orchards is less than it once was.|$|E

The area just north of JR Gifu Station contains a variety of small clothing stores catering to many types of consumers. Furthermore, the city's main downtown covered shopping arcade, Yanagase, features many clothing, shoe, and accessory shops that carry both domestic and overseas goods. Over the past decade, though, as Gifu's fashion industry has declined steeply, the city has begun developing <b>other</b> <b>industries</b> to support the local economy.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, slave labor was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and <b>other</b> <b>industries.</b> The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery {{and its role}} in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved. This division contributed {{to the start of the}} American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In medieval times, {{the wool}} trade was {{important}} in the town's economy, although this declined in the 18th century {{to be replaced by}} <b>other</b> <b>industries</b> such as brewing; the town continues to be a major centre for the production of cider.
