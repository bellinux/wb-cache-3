The {{purpose of this study was}} to non-invasively examine and compare the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) response of maximum and sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> in older men. Twenty-four healthy men aged 70 – 80 yr were recruited for the study. Participants completed a 1 repetition maximum (RM) <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> and four days later a sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> on an incline squat. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and HR were measured by plethysmography during and immediately after the <b>strength</b> <b>tests.</b> SBP, DBP and HR were (P < 0. 001) higher during the 1 RM and sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> compared to resting values. Twenty seconds post 1 RM, SBP and HR were higher than resting values. Twenty seconds post sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> SBP and DBP were lower (P < 0. 02) and HR (P < 0. 001) was higher than resting values. SBP, DBP and HR were higher (P < 0. 001) during sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> compared to 1 RM testing. Twenty seconds post testing, SBP and DBP were lower (P < 0. 001) and HR was higher (P < 0. 001) for the sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> compared to the 1 RM. The results of our study demonstrate that sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> resulted in greater changes in BP and HR compared to 1 RM <b>strength</b> <b>testing.</b> The lower cardiovascular stress experienced during the 1 RM shows that this may be a safer method of testing compared to sub-maximum <b>strength</b> <b>testing</b> in men aged 70 – 80 yr...|$|R

Portland cement was partially replaced by 5 %, 6 %, 7 %, 8 %, 9 %, 10 % of GGBS and Fly ash by 20 %, 40 %, 60 % respectively. The water to cementations materials ratio was maintained at 0. 45 for all mixes. The strength characteristics of the concrete were evaluated by conducting Compressive <b>strength</b> <b>test,</b> Splitting Tensile <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> and Flexural <b>strength</b> <b>test.</b> The compression <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> were conducted for 7 days and 28 days of curing and split tensile <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> and flexural <b>strength</b> <b>test</b> were conducted for 28 days of curing on a M 25 grade concrete.

The test results proved that the compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength of concrete mixtures containing GGBS and Fly ash increases as the amount of GGBS and Fly ash increase. After an optimum point, at around 9 % of GGBS and 40 % of Fly ash of the total binder content, the further addition of GGBS and fly ash does not improve the compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength...|$|R

However, decision-making is largely subjective and scientific evidence which reduces this subjectivity is required. To evaluate whether isometric <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> were valid {{for the purposes of}} classifying wheelchair racers and whether cluster analysis of the strength measures produced a valid classification structure. Thirty-two international level, male wheelchair racers from classes T 51 - 54 completed six isometric <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> evaluating elbow extensors, shoulder flexors, trunk flexors and forearm pronators and two wheelchair performance tests-Top-Speed (0 - 15 [*]m) and Top-Speed (absolute). <b>Strength</b> <b>tests</b> significantly correlated with wheelchair performance were included in a cluster analysis and the validity of the resulting clusters was assessed. All six <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> correlated with performance (r= 0. 54 - 0. 88). Cluster analysis yielded four clusters with reasonable overall structure (mean silhouette coefficient= 0. 58) and large intercluster strength differences. Six athletes (19 %) were allocated to clusters that did not align with their current class. While the mean wheelchair racing performance of the resulting clusters was unequivocally hierarchical, the mean performance of current classes was not, with no difference between current classes T 53 and T 54. Cluster analysis of isometric <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> produced classes comprising athletes who experienced a similar degree of activity limitation.

Ten subjects were included in {{a comparison of the}} Handyscale (digital dynamometer) and the mechanical spring balance for concurrent validity, resulting in intraclass correlation coefficient values ranging from 0. 96 to 0. 99. For intraobserver and interobserver reliability, 2 observers tested 20 subjects with the Handyscale and retested them after 2 weeks. Regardless of technique during testing, this resulted in almost perfect agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0. 89 – 0. 98).

Unfortunately, physical <b>strength</b> <b>tests</b> on pebbles, i. e., point-load tests, can only be conducted under one specific stable loading configuration.

Breakage load, equivalent to that measured in unidirectional physical tests, was determined from the results of the stress analysis by a maximum tensile stress-based failure criterion. Using this assumption, allows the determination of breakage load for a range of different kind of synthetic loading configurations and its comparison with the natural breakage load distribution of the physical <b>strength</b> <b>tests.</b> The results of numerical modelling indicated that the configuration that required the least breakage load corresponded with the minor principal axis of the ellipsoidal pebbles.
