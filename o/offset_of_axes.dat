The birefringent walk-off {{effect of the}} pulsed pump light in the PM-DSF provides {{an effective way to}} suppress the vector scattering processes of spontaneous four wave mixing. A 90 degree <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> fiber polarization <b>axes</b> is introduced at the midpoint of the fiber to realize the quantum superposition of the two correlated photon states generated by the two scalar processes on different fiber polarization axes, leading to polarization entanglement generation. Experiments of the indistinguishable property on single side and two-photon interference in two non-orthogonal polarization bases are demonstrated.

The Improved Lunar Ephemeris is used to calculate solar perturbations, and a linear integration of all effects arising from lunar gravitational harmonics through the fourth degree is performed. Aside from unobservable constant <b>offsets</b> <b>of</b> the principal <b>axes,</b> the main effects of the higher harmonics on longitude are: 10 -sec six-yearly (argument omega), 1. 2 -sec three-yearly, 0. 5 -sec annual, and 0. 1 -sec monthly; on pole direction they are on the order of 0. 5 -sec six-yearly and 1. 0 -sec monthly.

40|$|Abstract — Humanoid robots {{are complex}} {{sensorimotor}} systems where {{the existence of}} internal models are of utmost importance both for control purposes and for predicting {{the changes in the}} world arising from the system’s own actions. This so-called expected perception relies on the existence of accurate internal models of the robot’s sensorimotor chains. We assume that the kinematic model is known in advance but that the absolute <b>offsets</b> <b>of</b> the different <b>axes</b> cannot be directly retrieved from encoders. We propose a method to estimate such parameters, the zero position of the joints of a humanoid robotic head, by relying on proprioceptive sensors such as relative encoders and inertial sensing as well as visual input. We show that our method can estimate the correct <b>offsets</b> <b>of</b> the different joints (i. e. absolute positioning) in a continuous, online manner. Not only the method is robust to noise but it can as well cope with and adjust to abrupt changes in the parameters. Experiments with three different robotic heads are presented and illustrate the performance of the methodology as well as the advantages of using such an approach.

40|$|Static {{pictures}} of emotional facial expressions {{have been found}} to activate brain structures involved in the processing of emotional stimuli. However, in everyday live, emotional expressions are changing rapidly, and the processing of the onset vs the <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> the very same emotional expression might rely on different brain networks, presumably leading to different behavioral and physiological reactions (e. g. approach or avoidance). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, this was examined by presenting video clips depicting onsets and <b>offsets</b> <b>of</b> happy and angry facial expressions. Subjective valence and threat ratings clearly depended on the direction of change. Blood oxygen level dependent responses indicate both reward- and threat-related activations for the <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> angry expressions. Comparing onsets and offsets, angry offsets were associated with stronger ventral striatum activation than angry onsets. Additionally, the <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> happy and the onset of angry expressions showed strong common activity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally, the left amygdala and the left insula, whereas the onset of happy and the <b>offset</b> <b>of</b> angry expressions induced significant activation in the left dorsal striatum.
