5|$|At the Diet of March 1467, two {{traditional}} {{taxes were}} renamed; the chamber's profit was thereafter collected as tax {{of the royal}} treasury and the thirtieth as the Crown's customs. Because of this change, all previous tax exemptions became void, increasing state revenues. Matthias set about centralizing the administration of royal revenues. He entrusted {{the administration of the}} Crown's customs to John Ernuszt, a converted Jewish merchant. Within two years, Ernuszt was responsible for the collection of all <b>ordinary</b> <b>and</b> extraordinary taxes, and the management of the salt mines.|$|E

5|$|García Márquez {{started as}} a journalist, and wrote many {{acclaimed}} non-fiction works and short stories, but {{is best known for}} his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975), and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise <b>ordinary</b> <b>and</b> realistic situations. Some of his works are set in the fictional village of Macondo (mainly inspired by his birthplace, Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude.|$|E

The heralds, including both <b>ordinary</b> <b>and</b> extraordinary officers, form the front {{part of the}} Royal Procession, preceding the Sovereign and other Great Officers of State. The procession starts {{at the bottom of}} the Victoria Tower, then up the Norman Porch to the Robing Chamber. Once the Sovereign has put on the Imperial State Crown, the heralds lead the monarch once again through the Royal Gallery into the House of Lords, where they remain with him or her during his or her speech and accompany the monarch until he or she leaves the Palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure waving to the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with <b>ordinary</b> <b>and</b> unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} German and Belgian civil law systems and {{customary}} law. The judiciary is independent of the executive branch, although the President and the Senate {{are involved in the}} appointment of Supreme Court judges. Human Rights Watch have praised the Rwandan government for progress made in the delivery of justice including the abolition of the death penalty, but also allege interference in the judicial system by members of the government, such as the politically motivated appointment of judges, misuse of prosecutorial power, and pressure on judges to make particular decisions. The constitution provides for two types of courts: <b>ordinary</b> <b>and</b> specialised. Ordinary courts are the Supreme Court, the High Court, and regional courts, while specialised courts are military courts and a system of commercial courts created in 2011 to expedite commercial litigations. Between 2004 and 2012, a system of Gacaca courts was in operation. Gacaca, a Rwandan traditional court operated by villages and communities, was revived to expedite the trials of genocide suspects. The court succeeded in clearing the backlog of genocide cases, but was criticised by human rights groups as not meeting legal fair standard.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{demonstrate}} the significance of ordinary prayer {{for the study of}} ordinary theology, as conceived by Astley (2002), and to make an original contribution to research in this field. For this purpose, in part one, the thesis begins by establishing the relationship between <b>ordinary</b> theology <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> prayer, followed by a review and evaluation of empirical studies relevant to ordinary prayer. These studies are organised according to five themes: who prays, when people pray, the subjective effects of prayer, the objective effects of prayer, and the content of prayer. Part one concludes with a consideration of the significance of the empirical prayer studies for the understanding of <b>ordinary</b> theology <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> theologians, <b>and</b> demonstrates their practical importance to the Church. Based on the evidence gathered thus far, a new methodology is proposed, which supports the detailed study of ordinary prayer content found in prayer requests left in churches. The new methodology involves the development of an analytical framework designed to explore the content of ordinary prayer through the three components of reference, intention, and objective. In part two, the analytical framework is employed in five case studies: two case studies test the general framework through the analysis of two different sets of prayer requests; one case study uses the general framework to explore <b>ordinary</b> prayer <b>and</b> implicit religion; and two case studies use modifications of the intention component of the framework in order to provide focused studies relating to <b>ordinary</b> prayer <b>and</b> health and well-being <b>and</b> to <b>ordinary</b> prayer <b>and</b> the activity of God in the world. The thesis concludes with an evaluative summary of the contribution of ordinary prayer to ordinary theology in general and the contribution of the new methodology to the study of <b>ordinary</b> prayer <b>and</b> <b>ordinary</b> theology in particular.
