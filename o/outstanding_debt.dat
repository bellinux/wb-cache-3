5|$|The {{bill for}} the plane {{remained}} unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten the <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt.</b> Mawson wrote to Vickers director Sir Trevor Dawson in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed. The next expedition to take a plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 Quest Expedition, but the Avro Baby remained grounded owing to missing parts. Not until 16November 1928—when Hubert Wilkins and Carl Ben Eielson flew for 20minutes around Deception Island, {{just over a year}} before Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd's first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to have the government write off the <b>outstanding</b> <b>debt,</b> inject additional cash into the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E
