60|$|The Arangi was a labour-recruit {{ship that}} carried the new-caught, cannibal blacks from remote islands to labour on the new {{plantations}} where white men turned dank and pestilential swamp and jungle into rich and stately cocoanut groves. The Arangi's two masts were of <b>Oregon</b> <b>cedar,</b> so scraped and hot-paraffined that they shone like tan opals {{in the glare of}} sun. Her excessive sail plan enabled her to sail like a witch, and, on occasion, gave Captain Van Horn, his white mate, and his fifteen black boat's crew {{as much as they could}} handle. She was sixty feet over all, and the cross beams of her crown deck had not been weakened by deck-houses. The only breaks--and no beams had been cut for them--were the main cabin skylight and companionway, the booby hatch for'ard over the tiny forecastle, and the small hatch aft that let down into the store-room.|$|E

U.S. Route 30, {{which carries}} the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway along its length {{through the city}} has several local highway exits from U.S. Route 30 that connect {{travelers}} to Mansfield from Portland, <b>Oregon,</b> <b>Cedar</b> Rapids, Iowa, Fort Wayne, Indiana and points west, and from Atlantic City, New Jersey, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Canton, Ohio and points east.|$|E

Every year between 15 and 20 go there, where working short hours they keep in good condition by swimming and boating, and are in splendid shape to hit into hard football practice in the early Fall." ...|$|E
50|$|As of December 2015, {{the company}} had six shops {{in the city of}} Portland proper, and in that month it opened its first {{suburban}} shop in <b>Oregon,</b> located in <b>Cedar</b> Mill, an unincorporated area that is within the Portland metropolitan area.|$|R
50|$|Mountain hemlock is {{tolerant}} of shade {{and other forms}} of competition. It is more tolerant than all its associates except Pacific silver fir, western hemlock, and Alaska cedar. Mountain hemlock is considered a minor climax species on most of its habitats; however, it pioneers on glacial moraines in British Columbia and Alaska. Pacific silver fir is a major climax species in many communities of the mountain hemlock forest in British Columbia and Washington and northern <b>Oregon.</b> Alaska <b>cedar,</b> western redcedar, and western hemlock are climax associates on some sites. Mountain hemlock is more commonly the major climax species in the mountain hemlock zone south of central Oregon where Pacific silver fir does not occur.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Several popular {{cultural}} movements emphasizing indigenous spirituality {{have arisen}} in the United States and Europe {{within the past}} thirty years. Spiritual discourses attributed to Native Americans, among other groups, are borrowed by Euro-Americans in search of alternatives to dominant ideologies. In such a circumstance, Native Americans {{become part of a}} constructed and colonized homogenous category of indigenous people, considered by Euro-Americans as naturally close to the earth and essentially spiritual. The so-called New Age movement has, within it, several sub-movements, which are particularly noted for their emphasis on perceived Native American spiritualism. The Red Cedar Circle, made up primarily of white Americans, focuses on the Si. si. wiss Medicine of the Pacific Northwest Coast, and can be described as falling under the definitional heading of the New Age. The suppression and transformation of the heterogeneous reality of indigenous societies by the imaginings of the Euro-American dominant, has many ethical implications, as does cultural appropriation in a situation of major power differentials. Native communities are becoming increasingly outspoken in their opposition to the practice of Indian, or pseudo-Indian, religions by non-Natives. Many consider such practices to be morally suspect. Both Native and non-Native social critics feel that New Age practitioners involved in appropriated and popularized versions of indigenous religions, are interpreting and using aspects of traditionally subjugated cultures to meet their own needs. What may appear to be a harmless search for enlightenment by Europeans and Euro-Americans might have very real negative consequences for actual Native American lives. This study is based on participant observation of the Corvallis, <b>Oregon</b> Red <b>Cedar</b> Circle, and interviews with its members from June of 1991 to April of 1994. Analysis of data from New Age literature was also conducted, as well as an historical overview of the 'Nobel Savage' myth in Western cultures. Interviews with members of the local Native American community were carried out for feedback on how a given population of Native Americans perceives the Euro-American practice of Native spirituality. The data supports the supposition that cultural borrowing, or appropriation, is both a cause of, and a reaction to, the instability of cultural identity in late twentieth-century America...|$|R
