5|$|Virus-related {{cutaneous}} {{conditions are}} caused by two main groups of viruses–DNA and RNA types–both of which are <b>obligatory</b> intracellular parasites.|$|E
5|$|Mkhedruli, in the 11th to 17th centuries {{also came}} to employ digraphs {{to the point that}} they were <b>obligatory,</b> {{requiring}} adhesion to a complex system.|$|E
5|$|Phase I: The {{army was}} derived from <b>obligatory</b> annual {{military}} service levied on the citizenry, {{as part of their}} duty to the state. During this period, the Roman army would wage seasonal campaigns against largely local adversaries.|$|E
5|$|Potassium {{homeostasis}} {{denotes the}} maintenance of the total body potassium content, plasma potassium level, and the ratio of the intracellular to extracellular potassium concentrations within narrow limits, in the face of pulsatile intake (meals), <b>obligatory</b> renal excretion, and shifts between intracellular and extracellular compartments.|$|E
5|$|Prof Carstairs Cumming Douglas FRSE {{physician}} and hygienist {{was born in}} Kirkcaldy. He was largely {{the man responsible for}} introducing the <b>obligatory</b> use of Carbolic soap throughout Scottish schools in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Wagiman is a morphologically rich {{language}} and {{each part of}} speech has {{its own set of}} associated bound morphemes, some of which are <b>obligatory,</b> while others are optional.|$|E
5|$|A {{complete}} Khmer sentence {{consists of}} four basic elements which include an optional topic, an optional subject, an <b>obligatory</b> predicate and various adverbials and particles. The topic and subject are noun phrases, predicates are verb phrases and another noun phrase acting as an object or verbal attribute often follows the predicate.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{members should}} {{participate}} yearly in a spiritual retreat; a three-week seminar every year is <b>obligatory</b> for numeraries, and a one-week seminar for supernumeraries. Also members {{are expected to}} make a day-trip pilgrimage where they recite 3 5-decade rosaries on the month of May in honor of Mary.|$|E
5|$|After qualifying, {{the race}} {{stewards}} {{decided not to}} give a penalty to Magnussen for crossing the pit light, since it had only changed to red 0.55 seconds before he crossed the pit exit line. Kvyat escaped penalty as well after his car failed the <b>obligatory</b> front floor deflection test. As the team pointed out, the irregularity {{was the result of}} an impact on track, allowing him to keep eighth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|Classifying {{particles}} are used after numerals, {{but are not}} always <b>obligatory</b> {{as they are in}} Thai or Chinese, for example, and are often dropped in colloquial speech. Khmer nouns are divided into two groups: mass nouns, those which take classifiers, and specific nouns, which do not. The overwhelming majority are mass nouns.|$|E
5|$|Governmental Regulation No. 493/2002 Coll. {{divides the}} listed {{illnesses}} and handicaps into four groups, covering various issues from psychological and psychiatrical to eyesight and hearing (for example, the applicant {{must be able}} to hear casual speech over distance of 6 meters to be cleared for the E category). Generally, the regulation is more permissive {{when it comes to the}} license categories A and B, and more strict with view to the other categories, listing which illnesses and handicaps may curtail or outright prevent positive clearance by the general practitioner. The outcome of the medical examination may be either full clearance, denial, or conditional clearance that lists <b>obligatory</b> health accessories (glasses, hearing aid, etc.) or sets <b>obligatory</b> escort when armed (e.g. B – sport shooters with minor psychological issues, or with addiction habits cured more than three years prior to the health check).|$|E
5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, which is why in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the <b>obligatory</b> and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the {{government}} attempted {{to solve the}} manpower shortage problem by instituting <b>obligatory</b> military service. Men of eighteen to forty years of age were to be conscripted for two years. Opposition to conscription and to the campaigns against guerrilla groups resulted in widespread evasion of military service. As a result, during the late 1980s {{the government}} normally met manpower requirements by impressing men into military service.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the revolt}} {{inspired}} social reforms. In 1898 two measures of social legislation were {{passed by the}} minister of the treasury of Di Rudini’s cabinet, Luigi Luzzatti. The industrial workmen’s compensation scheme from 1883 was made <b>obligatory</b> with the employer bearing all costs; and a voluntary fund for contributory disability and old age pensions was created.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} or the {{following}} day, the pilgrims re-visit the Sacred Mosque in Mecca for another tawaf, known as Tawaf al-Ifadah, {{an essential part of}} Hajj. It symbolizes being in a hurry to respond to God and show love for Him, an <b>obligatory</b> part of the Hajj. The night of the 10th is spent back at Mina.|$|E
5|$|Verbalisation {{involves}} re-analysing {{the entire}} coverb - including its suffix -ma, which serves merely {{to indicate that}} it is unmarked for aspect - as a verb root, and then to apply the usual <b>obligatory</b> verbal inflection affixes for person, number and tense. As there is no discrete morpheme {{that serves as a}} 'verbaliser', the process is one of conversion.|$|E
5|$|While {{the status}} of the perfect markers as aspect is not very controversial, some {{scholars}} have claimed that Greenlandic has a basic temporal distinction between future and non-future. Especially, the suffix -ssa and handful of other suffixes have been claimed to be <b>obligatory</b> future markers. However, at least for literary Greenlandic, these suffixes have been shown to have other semantics {{that can be used to}} refer to the future via the strategies just described.|$|E
5|$|Applicant (license holder) must {{be cleared}} by his general {{practitioner}} as being fit to possess, carry {{and use a}} firearm. The health check includes probes into the applicant's anamnesis (i.e. medical history) and a complete physical screening (including eyesight, hearing, balance). The doctor may request examination by a specialist in case he deems it necessary to exclude illnesses or handicaps stated in the respective governmental regulation. Specialist medical examination is <b>obligatory</b> in case of illnesses and handicaps that restrict the ability to drive a car.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the <b>obligatory</b> tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Obligatory</b> {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|Opened {{as part of}} {{an attempt}} to {{encourage}} holiday traffic on the line, the halt primarily served golfers at the nearby Royal Cromer Golf Club. The station facilities were very basic, consisting of no more than a single wooden platform, which cost £170 to build, two wooden benches and running in board together with the <b>obligatory</b> oil lamps. No shelter was provided for passengers and the platform was constructed of sleepers and supported by wooden trestles.|$|E
5|$|PDISs are {{intermediate}} {{stops at}} a depth above the depth at which the leading compartment for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to offgassing and below {{the depth of the}} first <b>obligatory</b> decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that depth is low enough to ensure that the tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading compartment is generally not the fastest compartment except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an intermediate stop.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{also found}} fault with Symeon for revering his spiritual father, Symeon the Studite. At that time, formal {{recognition}} of saints was seldom practiced and not <b>obligatory,</b> so revered monks were informally recognized and honored by monasteries {{and by their}} disciples. Every year the younger Symeon arranged a celebration honoring his teacher, which included an icon of Symeon the Studite and a service to him. Stephen rebuked Symeon for honoring his teacher as a saint, because in his opinion the Studite was not worth of any honor. The conflict between the two lasted for six years.|$|E
5|$|The Caledonian Union, {{one of the}} {{political}} parties within the pro-independence FLNKS group had, in 2010, appealed for a national committee to evaluate progress and prepare New Caledonia for the change in leadership before the planned referendum in 2014. In this appeal, the UC also argued that, according to the Nouméa Accord, it was <b>obligatory</b> for the French government to train and build the capacity of Kanaks {{to be able to}} take over the government in 2014 and urged them to respond swiftly.|$|E
5|$|The Pont du Gard {{has been}} a tourist {{attraction}} for centuries. The outstanding quality of the bridge's masonry led to it becoming an <b>obligatory</b> stop for French journeymen masons on their traditional tour around the country (see Compagnons du Tour de France), {{many of whom have}} left their names on the stonework. From the 18th century onwards, particularly after the construction of the new road bridge, it became a famous staging-post for travellers on the Grand Tour and became increasingly renowned as an object of historical importance and French national pride.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} dive bombing became so popular among the {{leadership}} of the Luftwaffe that it became almost <b>obligatory</b> in new aircraft designs. Later bomber models like the Junkers Ju 88 and the Dornier Do 217 were equipped for dive bombing. The Heinkel He 177 strategic bomber was initially supposed to have dive bombing capabilities, a requirement that contributed to the failure of the design, with the requirement not rescinded until September 1942 by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring.|$|E
5|$|The verbal prefix {{contains}} {{information about}} the person and number of the subject, sometimes also the person and number of the object, as well as <b>obligatory</b> {{information about the}} tense of the clause. Furthermore, a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding tense and aspect. While {{only a small number}} of tense and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in the verbal prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} an <b>obligatory</b> {{religious}} duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of their race, colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his Parliamentary {{seat in the}} landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, was in his seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an <b>obligatory</b> seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{and context}} in infants’ {{linguistic}} environment shape their vocabulary development. English learners {{have been found}} to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners. This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of ostensive labelling as well as noun-friendly activities such as picture book reading. Adult speech provides children with grammatical input. Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier, which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages. In Cantonese, classifiers are <b>obligatory</b> and specific in more situations than in Mandarin. This accounts for the research found on Mandarin-speaking children outperforming Cantonese-speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary.|$|E
5|$|Every runic {{inscription}} {{is shown}} with its ID code {{that is used}} in scholarly literature {{to refer to the}} inscription, and it is only <b>obligatory</b> to give the first two parts of it. The first part is one or two letters that represent the area where the runic inscription appears, e.g. U for Uppland, Sö for Södermanland and DR for Denmark. The second part represents the order in which the inscription is presented in official national publications (e.g. Sveriges runinskrifter). Thus U 73 means that the runestone was the 73rd runic inscription in Uppland that was documented in Sveriges runinskrifter. If the inscription was documented later than the official publication, it is listed according to the publication where it was first described, e.g. Sö Fv1954;20, where Sö represents Södermanland, Fv stands for the annual publication Fornvännen, 1954 is the year of the issue of Fornvännen and 20 is the page in the publication.|$|E
5|$|In April 1964, with {{financial}} {{help from his}} half-sister Ella Little-Collins, MalcolmX flew to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as {{the start of his}} Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca <b>obligatory</b> for every Muslim who is able to do so. He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak Arabic caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned. He had received Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam's book The Eternal Message of Muhammad with his visa approval, and he contacted the author. Azzam's son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning MalcolmX learned that Prince Faisal had designated him as a state guest. Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, MalcolmX had an audience with the prince.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally <b>obligatory</b> that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that we}} can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Madagascar could accuse {{one another}} of various crimes, {{including}} theft, Christianity and especially witchcraft, {{for which the}} ordeal of tangena was routinely <b>obligatory.</b> On average, an estimated 20 to 50 {{percent of those who}} underwent the ordeal died. In the 1820s, the tangena ordeal caused about 1,000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3,000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861. In 1838, it was estimated that as many as 100,000 people in Imerina {{died as a result of}} the tangena ordeal, constituting roughly 20 percent of the population. Although outlawed in 1863, the ordeal continued to be practiced secretly in Imerina and openly in other parts of the island.|$|E
5|$|The fatwa {{reaffirmed the}} {{obligation}} of Spanish Muslims to perform the ritual prayers (salat), the ritual charity (zakat), and the ritual ablution (ghusl), {{even if they could}} not be performed in the correct form. It described {{the obligation of}} the ritual prayersnormally performed by standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting in a prescribed sequenceeven if done only by making slight movements. The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an <b>obligatory</b> five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The power {{struggle}} in the Presidium was not resolved by the elimination of Beria. Malenkov's power was in the central state apparatus, which he sought to extend through reorganizing the government, giving it additional power {{at the expense of}} the Party. He also sought public support by lowering retail prices and lowering the level of bond sales to citizens, which had long been effectively <b>obligatory.</b> Khrushchev, on the other hand, with his power base in the Party, sought to both strengthen the Party and his position within it. While, under the Soviet system, the Party was to be preeminent, it had been greatly drained of power by Stalin, who had given much of that power to himself and to the Politburo (later, to the Presidium). Khrushchev saw that with the Presidium in conflict, the Party and its Central Committee might again become powerful. Khrushchev carefully cultivated high Party officials, and was able to appoint supporters as local Party bosses, who then took seats on the Central Committee.|$|E
