25|$|In Spain, {{a version}} of the kepi (actually a low shako), the ros, is used by the Guardia Real (Royal Guard) for {{ceremonial}} functions. The Spanish 1887 regulation kepi or Teresiana was made of black <b>oilcloth</b> with a tortoise shell visor. This type of headdress was retained by the Civil Guard as its regulation kepi, worn on non-ceremonial occasions for normal police duties, until it was abolished under the 2011 revised regulations and replaced by a baseball cap.|$|E
500|$|It was in Indianapolis that Ruth Hoskins {{learned the}} game, {{and took it}} back to Atlantic City. After she arrived, Hoskins made a new board with Atlantic City street names and railroads, and taught it {{to a group of}} local Quakers. It has been argued that their {{greatest}} contribution to the game was to reinstate the original Lizzie Magie rule of [...] "buying properties at their listed price" [...] rather than auctioning them, as the Quakers did not believe in auctions. Another source states that the Quakers simply [...] "didn't like the noise of the auctioneering." [...] Among the group taught the game by Hoskins were Eugene Raiford and his wife, who took a copy of the game with Atlantic City street names to Philadelphia. Due to the Raifords' unfamiliarity with streets and properties in Philadelphia, the Atlantic City-themed version was the one taught to Charles Todd, who in turn taught Esther Darrow, wife of Charles Darrow. After learning the game, Darrow then began to distribute the game himself as Monopoly and never spoke to the Todds again. Darrow initially made the sets of the Monopoly game by hand {{with the help of his}} first son, William Darrow, and his wife. Their new sets retained Charles Todd's misspelling of [...] "Marvin Gardens" [...] and the renaming of the Shore Fast Line the Short Line. Charles Darrow drew the designs with a drafting pen on round pieces of <b>oilcloth,</b> and then his son and his wife helped fill in the spaces with colors and make the title deed cards and the Chance cards and Community Chest cards. After the demand for the game increased, Darrow contacted a printing company, Patterson and White, which printed the designs of the property spaces on square carton boards. Darrow's game board designs included elements later made famous in the version eventually produced by Parker Brothers, including black locomotives on the railroad spaces, the car on [...] "Free Parking", the red arrow for [...] "Go", the faucet on [...] "Water Works", the light bulb on [...] "Electric Company", and the question marks on the [...] "Chance" [...] spaces, though many of the actual icons were created by a hired graphic artist. While Darrow received a copyright on his game in 1933, its specimens have disappeared from the files of the United States Copyright Office, though proof of its registration remains.|$|E
50|$|Formerly a {{confectionery}} and bakery shop rented by Mr Thomas Trehearne, {{the property}} was owned by the Castle estate. The property {{also served as a}} chemist's shop, and later Dick's boot store. On 1 May 1898 Mr Harris Jones took the lease of the property for 21 years as a draper, hosier, glover and dressmaker, he also sold <b>oilcloths,</b> linoleum and other floor coverings. The shop and house were put up for sale in the 1913 by the castle estate along with the Castle Hotel and the Myddleton Arms, which were purchased by Mr William Owen. His lease expired in 1919 with Mr Jones transferring to what is now Gayla House, where he converted the ground floor from residential to retail premises in 1923. The premises are now owned by HSBC Bank.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to provide a}} resource for individuals doing historic restoration and preservation of buildings built between 1850 and 1900 in Oregon. The research attempted to determine the styles, patterns, and colors of wallpaper that were used, who applied the wallpaper, the methods of application, and the sources of the wallpaper. Data collection instruments were developed to record information about styles, patterns, and methods of application from photographs of Oregon interiors taken before 1900; information about styles, patterns, and colors from illustrated advertisements and existing examples of wallpaper; information about services offered and products carried by individuals or companies who were associated with wallpaper as advertised in non-illustrated advertisements; and how long individuals or companies associated with wallpaper were in business. The sources consulted were selected issues of the Portland Oregonian between 1851 - 1900, Portland City Directory between 1863 - 1900, the West Shore magazine from 1876 - 1891; and mail-order catalogs for Montgomery Ward and Company (1895) and Sears and Roebuck Company (1897 and 1902), photographs in the residence files of the Oregon Historical Society, and existing examples of wallpaper. The most popular styles were the Arts and Crafts style and the Transitional style. The most popular patterns were the floral pattern and the arabesque/scroll pattern. There were not enough photographs or examples illustrating color to draw a conclusion about the most frequently used colors, although greens, browns, and creams were the most frequently listed in the mail-order catalogs advertisements. The wallpaper was applied by painters until 1885, when paperhanging began to be a more specialized occupation. Before the 1880 's, wallpaper was sold by stores which dealt in carpets, furniture, and <b>oilcloths,</b> but during the late 1880 's, it began to be sold almost exclusively by the paint dealers. The method of application most frequently seen in the photographs was one pattern from floor to ceiling, followed closely by one pattern from floor to frieze, with a coordinating pattern on the frieze. The wallpaper was obtained by ship as early as 1851 from San Francisco or New York. After introduction of the railroad in 1883, it began to arrive by rail either directly to the dealer or to the home owner after ordering from a mail-order catalog...|$|R
2500|$|While similar, {{the heavy}} metal and Goth fashion trend of black <b>oilcloth</b> dusters are usually (incorrectly) {{referred}} to as trench coats. Early media reports of the 1999 Columbine High School massacre initially associated the perpetrators (Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold) {{with members of the}} [...] "Trenchcoat Mafia," [...] a group of outcasts who allegedly wore conspicuous black Australian <b>oilcloth</b> dusters. In the copycat W. R. Myers High School shooting days later, it was rumored the shooter had worn a trench coat. In the wake of these incidents, many public schools in the US forbade students from wearing trench coats, {{on the grounds that they}} could be used to conceal weapons.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the winter}} of 1863–64, supply {{shortages}} in the South had become acute: new recruits were arriving each month from Alabama without {{much more than the}} civilian clothes they were wearing, a [...] "Confederate tin canteen and white cotton cloth haversack, [...] home-woven wool blanket or cotton bed quilt." [...] These soldiers were quick to exchange those things for [...] "a Yankee U.S. blanket, an <b>oilcloth</b> haversack and cloth-covered canteen," [...] usually by removing them from the battlefield.|$|E
2500|$|Both of {{the main}} entrances into Wheatland open onto a 'T'-shaped hallway. The main portion of the hall is [...] long and [...] wide, while the cross-hall is [...] It is covered with an <b>oilcloth</b> {{flooring}} that was decorated with [...] "geometric squares to imitate tile"painting one material to resemble another, more expensive one that was popular in the Victorian era.

6000|$|... "Yes; Mr Rubb is {{a partner}} in my brother's house, and sells <b>oilcloth,</b> and things of that sort, and is not by any means aristocratic. I know what you mean." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} unjust, has it not?" [...] said he, piteously, {{thinking}} of his injuries. [...] "So much of it has gone in that <b>oilcloth</b> business, and all for nothing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{is neither}} here nor there. It was an {{instructive}} experience, and you little know the treasures of passion that may lie concealed {{in the heart}} of a young <b>oilcloth</b> manufacturer.' ...|$|E
60|$|Through {{the open}} door a narrow passage led to a narrow {{staircase}} covered with <b>oilcloth.</b> She raised her bicycle and wheeled it in. A Jewish-looking youth emerging from the shop accosted her.|$|E
6000|$|Now M. Funck-Brentano says, to {{minimise}} {{the importance}} of Dauger, 'he was shut up like so much luggage in a chair hermetically closed with <b>oilcloth,</b> carried by eight Piedmontese in relays of four.' ...|$|E
60|$|A MINUTE {{afterwards}} Hunca Munca, his wife, put {{her head}} out, too; and when she {{saw that there was}} no one in the nursery, she ventured out on the <b>oilcloth</b> under the coal-box.|$|E
60|$|Annie {{was about}} to reply when the door opened, and the captain looked in. He wore a sou'-wester, and was clad in <b>oilcloth</b> {{garments}} from head to foot, which shone like black satin with the dripping spray.|$|E
60|$|On {{the corner}} was a flaring banner announcing {{that here was}} located the Famous California Chop Suey Restaurant. Behind the small dirty windows ten or fifteen men were eating at half a dozen tables covered with <b>oilcloth.</b>|$|E
60|$|An apple-core crunched {{under her}} foot as {{she drew a}} chair to the table. On the frayed <b>oilcloth,</b> a supper waited. She {{attempted}} the cold beans, thick with grease, but gave them up, and buttered a slice of bread.|$|E
6000|$|... "And let’s ’ope {{you go on}} as you’ve begun," [...] {{said that}} gratified lady. [...] "There’s {{something}} in old Purnip after all. I’ve been worrying you for months for that <b>oilcloth.</b> Are you {{going to help me}} wash up? Mr. Purnip would." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} Castro brought {{in his first}} surprise—a delicious soup—a jovial and {{friendly}} party was gathered around the <b>oilcloth</b> board. Even the paper napkins could not dampen {{the joy of the}} occasion, or detract from the exquisite flavor of the broth.|$|E
6000|$|... "So that's {{the celebrated}} St. Albans, is it?" [...] said 'Manda Grier, {{when they got}} in the street. [...] "Don't know 's I really ever {{expected}} to see the inside 'f it. You notice the kind of <b>oilcloth</b> they had on that upper entry, S'tira?" ...|$|E
60|$|Pamela {{followed}} her guide into a parlour, redolent of stale cigar smoke, with <b>oilcloth</b> {{on the floor}} and varnished walls, an abode even more horrible than Hassan's lair. Joseph closed the door carefully behind him, and made no apology for his dishabille. He simply faced Pamela.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear {{there will}} be a call before long, Nancy, for the {{services}} of the new lifeboat," [...] said Captain Boyns, rising and taking down an <b>oilcloth</b> coat and sou'-wester, which he began to put on leisurely; [...] "I'll go down to the beach and see what's doin' at the Cove." ...|$|E
60|$|And he cast {{down upon}} the floor a paper that I {{instantly}} recognised--none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three red crosses, that I had found in the <b>oilcloth</b> {{at the bottom of}} the captain's chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I could fancy.|$|E
60|$|At last Mrs. Ledwich {{glanced at}} the mistress's watch, in its {{pasteboard}} tower, in Gothic architecture, and insisted on proceeding to business. So they all sat down round a circular table, with a very fine red, blue, and black <b>oilcloth,</b> whose pattern was inseparably connected, in Ethel's mind, with absurdity, tedium, and annoyance.|$|E
60|$|The shadows {{slipped in}} arabesques over the dust-gray floor and scampered as bravely among the rafters {{as though they}} were in such a tale as men told in believing days. Rustics in smocks drank ale from tankards; and in a corner was snoring an ear-ringed peddler with his beetle-black head propped on an <b>oilcloth</b> pack.|$|E
6000|$|... "A table {{covered with}} a dark <b>oilcloth</b> took up all {{the middle of the}} little room. There was a wicker cradle on the floor, a kettle {{spouting}} steam on the hob, and some child's linen lay drying on the fender. The room was warm, but the door opens right into the garden, as you noticed perhaps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose it}} might, miss; it be sharp {{sometimes}} outside. Why, there is <b>oilcloth</b> {{all over the}} floor, and a mat to wipe one's feet {{at the bottom of}} the ladder, and a rug by the side of the bed! I never did see such things. Bill must have gone clean off his chump. Well, I am blessed!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe. I {{suppose you}} have a notion I should be {{getting out of the}} way of that dirt," [...] said Captain MacWhirr, {{speaking}} with the utmost simplicity of manner and tone, and fixing the <b>oilcloth</b> on the floor with a heavy stare. Thus he noticed neither Jukes' discomfiture nor the mixture of vexation and astonished respect on his face.|$|E
60|$|He was in {{the hall}} now,--a miserable, untidy place with a broken-down mirror and {{hat-rack}} as sole furniture, {{and covered with a}} much soiled <b>oilcloth.</b> The stairs were right ahead of him, and Deane looked up. He looked into a woman's face as she leaned over the well of the banisters, looking down. Almost immediately she drew away and came down.|$|E
60|$|And {{here you}} are well quit, for once, of restoration. No one cares for this {{sculpture}}; and if Florence would only thus put all her old sculpture and painting under her feet, and simply use them for gravestones and <b>oilcloth,</b> she would be more merciful to them than she is now. Here, at least, what little is left is true.|$|E
60|$|During the {{laughter}} that followed this enthusiastic epigram Arthur ushered the party into the quaint Spanish restaurant. The room {{was clean and}} neat, {{despite the fact that}} the floor was strewn with sawdust and the tables covered with white <b>oilcloth.</b> An anxious-eyed, dapper little man with a foreign face and manner greeted them effusively and asked in broken English their commands.|$|E
60|$|The {{merchant}} {{closed the}} door, and Douglas Stone {{walked down the}} narrow passage, glancing about him in some surprise as he did so. There was no <b>oilcloth,</b> no mat, no hat-rack. Deep grey dust and heavy festoons of cobwebs met his eyes everywhere. Following the old woman up the winding stair, his firm footfall echoed harshly through the silent house. There was no carpet.|$|E
60|$|Wrayson {{took up the}} {{envelope}} and shook out its contents before her. There was a letter addressed simply to Agnes, and a small packet wrapped in brown <b>oilcloth</b> and secured with dark-green ribbon. Sydney Barnes' hand stole out, but Wrayson was too quick for him. He changed his position, so as to interpose his person between the packet and any one in the room.|$|E
