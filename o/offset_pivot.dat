40|$|LecturePg. 27 - 38 With {{performance}} considerations {{driving the}} design of rotating equipment, operating speeds and journal loads have increased greatly in recent years, often exceeding generally accepted design limits. In order for tilting pad journal bearings to operate at load and speed levels that exceed these limits, newer innovative designs are necessary. This paper concerns {{the development and implementation}} of a reduced temperature tilting pad journal bearing design that features spray-bar blockers and by-pass cooling. The sequence of design improvements began with evacuated housings with directed lubrication, then progressed to <b>offset</b> <b>pivoted</b> pads, spray-bar blockers, and then finally to behind-the-pad by-pass cooling. Many design application examples are discussed illustrating the progression of innovations leading to the final reduced temperature bearing configuration. Actual application unit loads and surface speeds start at around 350 psi at 250 ft/sec, progressing to about 495 psi at 285 ft/sec and ending up at approximately 770 psi at 350 ft/sec and 470 psi at 420 ft/sec...|$|R
40|$|In {{tilting pad}} bearing design process, the {{selection}} of the proper configuration type of either a Load-Between-Pad (LBP) or Load-On-Pad (LOP) as well as preload and <b>pivot</b> <b>offset</b> conditions is to be carefully considered. Also the bearing needs to be designed in order to be suited for the rotor-bearing system and operating condition. In this paper, it is observed that the static and dynamic characteristics of a five pad {{tilting pad bearing}} for the LBP and LOP configurations are influenced by the variation of preload and <b>pivot</b> <b>offset.</b> In this context, rotor dynamic analysis of the 5 MW industrial gas turbine supported by the tilting pad bearing at the front and roller bearing at the rear is carried out based on the dynamic coefficients of the tilting pad bearing investigated. The result shows that two rigid body critical modes experience various changes according to the influence of the tilting pad bearing uniquely applied to one side of this machine. Mainly, the second critical speed, the rigid body mode of conical shape with high whirling in the tilting pad bearing, is significantly changed by preload and <b>pivot</b> <b>offset</b> regardless of the LBP and LOP configurations. And the first critical mode, the rigid body mode of conical shape with high whirling in the roller bearing, is sensitively affected by preload applied to the LOP configuration and by its asymmetric dynamic properties...|$|R

The prior mechanism, of a ball-locking design, can fail when vibrations cause balls to fall out. The load-bearing pin is an outer tube with a handle at one end (hereafter denoted the near end). Within the outer tube is a spring-loaded inner tube that includes a handle at its near end and a pivoting tab at its far end. The pin is inserted through holes in the objects to be retained and the inner tube is pushed against an <b>offset</b> <b>pivot</b> inside the outer tube to make the tab rotate outward so that it protrudes past the outer diameter of the outer tube, and the spring load maintains this configuration so that the pin cannot be withdrawn through the holes. Pushing the handles together against the spring load moves the locking tab out far enough that the tab becomes free to rotate inward. Then releasing the inner-tube handle causes the tab to be pulled into a resting position inside the outer tube. The pin can then be pulled out through the holes...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 107 The use of {{long shaft}} {{vertical}} pumps is {{common practice in}} the nuclear waste processing industry. Unfortunately, when such pumps employ plain cylindrical journal bearings, they tend to suffer from rotordynamic instability problems due to the inherent lightly-loaded condition that the vertical orientation places on the bearings. This paper describes {{a case study in}} which the authors utilized rotordynamic analysis and experimental vibration analysis to diagnose such a problem and designed replacement tilting-pad bearings to solve the problem. The subject pumps are 45 foot long vertical pumps used for mixing nuclear waste in one million gallon tanks. Each pumping system consists of an induction motor driven by a variable frequency drive, a segmented pump shaft with a centrifugal impeller at the bottom, and a pipe column that surrounds the pump shaft and is suspended into the tank. The column is filled with water that serves as the lubricant for the eight plain cylindrical journal bearings that support the pump shaft. Unfortunately, these pumps have been plagued with vibration related problems, such as bearing and seal failures, ever since they were commissioned. In order to evaluate the problem, the pump shaft and column were instrumented with vibration transducers, and vibration testing was performed. This testing revealed that subsynchronous whirling, at approximately one-half the running speed, was the primary culprit responsible for the failures. In an effort to understand the cause of the observed vibrations, a two-level rotordynamic model of the pump shafting and column was constructed. This rotordynamic model, like those for many vertical pumps, was far from routine. The rotordynamic analysis, which is described in detail, then successfully confirmed that the problem was subsynchronous whirling due to rotordynamic instability. This analysis was then used to guide the design of tilting-pad bearings employing <b>offset</b> <b>pivots</b> and geometric preload to replace the original plain cylindrical bearings and, thereby, resolve the instability problem. The plain cylindrical bearings were removed from a pump, tilting-pad bearings were installed, and subsequent testing verified the predicted vibration reduction. Accordingly, the application of tilting-pad bearings, whose design is described in detail, was conclusively shown to be an effective solution for this specific problem...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 31 - 42 Analysis, design, and {{optimization}} of {{high performance}} journal and thrust bearings {{in a high}} speed integrally geared compressor are described. The high speed and relatively small bearing size stretches the applicable limits of conventional style tilt pad bearings. The variation in the load magnitude, {{as is the case}} with most gear loaded bearings, requires careful analysis of the stability and unbalance response characteristics. An optimized new flexible pivot bearing was used in this application to provide stable operation throughout the wide ranges of load and inlet temperature. The bearing incorporated a directed lubrication feature to reduce the hot oil carry over which is known to be a major contributor to high bearing temperatures in high speed applications. The precision inherent in the manufacturing process used to produce this style of bearing allowed further optimization of the preload and pivot offset. The use of an <b>offset</b> <b>pivot</b> configuration demonstrated lower sensitivity to bearing clearance variation. The necessity for high rotational speeds in integrally geared compressors increases the frictional power losses in the journal and thrust bearings. The parasitic losses constitute a significant percentage of the overall bearing power losses. Bearing designs that were utilized to reduce both the frictional and parasitic losses in the thrust bearings are discussed. The new thrust bearings were designed to provide an optimum crown-to-film thickness ratio allowing the bearing to carry the design thrust load with fewer pads. The analytical results for the conventional and deflection journal and thrust bearings are presented and compared to the test data. The new bearing resulted in lower steady state vibrations. At surge conditions, the synchronous and subsynchronous vibrations were about 25 percent of the conventional tilt pad bearing. The frictional and parasitic power losses with the new thrust bearing were about 20 percent lower than those of the conventional bearings. The temperature rise was also lower which indicated that the inlet temperature can be further increased with the new bearing allowing a wider operating temperature range and lower frictional losses...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 223 - 242 The {{hydrodynamic}} {{thrust bearing}} load capacity-speed envelope {{is divided into}} three major regions by speed. Each region has its own set of limiting physical phenomenon that must be included in the analysis and presents a design challenge. For instance, the high speed region has high lubricant shear rates possibly including turbulence that change pad thermal crowning and local babbitt temperature and pressure, thus limiting the bearing performance in terms of load and speed. Various design tools are used to set the bearing geometry such that the phenomenon limits are not exceeded, and an appropriate design safety factor is present. Several applications are presented that illustrate how the various design modifications such as pivot type, pivot radial and circumferential offset, pad spacing, and pad thickness may be varied to design a thrust bearing for a specific region. Three dimensional finite element models for the fluid film generate film thickness, pressure and temperature distributions, which when coupled with a pad finite element model for thermal conduction, convection, thermal deflection, and elastic deflection show thrust bearing pad performance. Turbulence is included along with hot oil carryover from the previous pad. Methods are shown that reduce vibratory motion by using the squeeze film damping attributes of double thrust bearings. The benefits of <b>offset</b> <b>pivot,</b> chrome copper pads, and controlled lubrication in a load-speed region are reviewed so that the user has an appreciation of how each feature is affecting his thrust bearing's performance.

In order to improve imaging of the lamina cribrosa in the ONH with high lateral resolution and sensitivity, we implemented a complex conjugate artifact-free Fourier domain OCT (Fd-OCT) acquisition scheme with a reference arm-based phase shifting method. This allowed positioning of the lamina cribrosa structures near the zero path length difference where AO-OCT imaging achieves highest sensitivity. Implementation of our complex conjugate artifact removal (CCR) method required constant phase shifts between consecutive axial scans (A-scans), generated by continuous beam path-length changes from <b>offsetting</b> the <b>pivot</b> point of the scanning mirror placed in the reference arm.

In our previous work, we showed that the geometric errors in five-axis controlled machine tools with a tilting rotary table influence the accuracy of machined cone frustum, and it depends on the location, apex angle, tilt angle or diameter of the cone frustum. It indicates that the geometric errors might be identified with the profiles of cone frustum. In this paper, we suggest a method to identify the geometric errors of linear and rotational axes in five-axis controlled machine tools with a tilting rotary table, which uses the multiple trajectories of the conic motion measured by double ball bar device.

40|$|Nonlinear response, bifurcations and {{stability}} of rotor-fluid film bearing systems are studied using various numerical investigation schemes such as autonomous/non-autonomous shooting, arc-length continuation, direct numerical integrations, Poincar? sections, Lyapunov exponents, etc. Two types of hydrodynamic bearings, a floating ring bearing (FRB) and a tilting pad journal bearing (TPJB), are employed in this study. The nonlinear characteristic of each bearing is analyzed as supports of a rigid rotor system {{as well as a}} flexible rotor system. Depending on the existence of the unbalance force on the rotor/disks, autonomous (free vibration) and non-autonomous responses (mass unbalanced excitation) are both identified, and the nonlinear reaction force produced on the lubricant layer is obtained using the finite element method. In addition to isoviscosity lubricants, thermo-hydrodynamic lubricant model is developed to investigate thermal effects on rotordynamic bifurcations; in the procedure, a variable viscosity Reynolds equation and the energy equation are solved simultaneously. For computation efficiency in the analytical bifurcation study, an advanced shooting algorithm, which is combined with the deflation theory and the parallel computing strategy, is proposed for both the autonomous and the non-autonomous cases. In the study with flexible rotors, the finite element based beam models are employed and the model reduction technique such as Component Mode Synthesis is utilized to condense the system degree of freedom. This dissertation consists of four main discussions regarding: 1) nonlinear response and bifurcations of a rigid rotor supported by FRBs; 2) effects of a thermo-hydrodynamic (THD) FRB model on rotordynamic bifurcations; 3) nonlinear response and bifurcations of a rigid rotor supported by TPJBs; 4) extension of study to general, complex, multi-mass rotor beam models. In case 1), multiple coexistent solutions and bifurcation scenarios are identified, and those are depended on the ratio of floating ring length to diameter (L/D). Numerical illustrations regarding jumps between two stable limit cycles and quenching large vibrations are demonstrated, and chaos is investigated with the aid of Lyanpunov exponent. In case 2), the Hopf bifurcation onset is strongly dependent on thermal conditions, and the saddle node bifurcation points are significantly shifted compared to the isothermal model. In addition, the unbalanced responses stability and bifurcation onsets are highly reliant on the lubricant supply temperature. In case 3), loci of bifurcations are identified, and heavily loaded bearings and/or high unbalance force may induce consecutive transference of response in forms of synchronous to sub-synchronous, quasi-periodic responses and chaotic motions. The periodic doubling bifurcations, saddle node bifurcations and corresponding local stability are reliably determined by selections of pad preload, <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> and lubricant viscosity sets. In case 4), two industrial applications such as a turbocharger supported by FRBs and an eight-stage centrifugal compressor supported by TPJBs are numerically analyzed. The turbocharger shows that torus appears with Neimark-Sacker bifurcation events and the motions are dominant in the high speed ranges (> 60, 000 rpm).

Recently, stable solitons were predicted {{in the form of}} semi-vortices (composites built of coupled fundamental and vortical components) in the 2 D system combining the SOC and contact attractive interactions. Replacing the latter by the anisotropic long-range DDI, we demonstrate that, for a fixed norm of the soliton, the system supports a continuous family of stable spatially asymmetric vortex solitons (AVSs), parameterized by an <b>offset</b> of the <b>pivot</b> of the vortical component relative to its fundamental counterpart. The offset is limited by a certain maximum value, while the energy of the AVS practically does not depend on the offset. At small values of the norm, the vortex solitons are subject to a weak oscillatory instability. In the present system, with the Galilean invariance broken by the SOC, the composite solitons are set in motion by a kick whose strength exceeds a certain depinning value. The kicked solitons feature a negative effective mass, drifting along a spiral trajectory opposite to the direction of the kick.

However, the quality of an image-based 3 D model depends on the planning of the photogrammetric surveys. This means that the geometric configuration of the multi-view camera network and the control data have to be designed in accordance with the required accuracy, resolution and completeness. From a practical application point of view, a proper planning (of both photos and control data) of the photogrammetric survey especially for terrestrial acquisition, is not always ensured due to limited accessibility of the target object and the presence of occlusions. To solve these problems, we propose a different image acquisition strategy and we test different geo-referencing scenarios to deal with the practical issues of a terrestrial photogrammetric survey. The proposed photogrammetric survey procedure is based on the acquisition of a sequence of images in panorama mode by rotating the camera on a standard tripod. The <b>offset</b> of the <b>pivot</b> point from the projection center prevents the stitching of these images into a panorama. We demonstrate how to still take advantage of this capturing mode.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the dynamic and static forced {{performance of a}} flexure-pivot tilting-pad bearing load between pad (LBP) configuration for different rotor speeds and bearing unit loadings. The bearing has the following design parameters: 4 pads with pad arc angle 72 o and 50 % <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> pad axial length 0. 0762 m (3 in), pad radial clearance 0. 254 mm (0. 010 in), bearing radial clearance 0. 1905 mm (0. 0075 in), preload 0. 25 and shaft nominal diameter of 0. 11684 m (4. 600 in). The dynamic coefficients and the static performance parameters of the FPB have been compared with the theoretical predictions using the isothermal analysis from the rotordynamic software suite XLTRC 2 -XLTFPBrg. The bearing shows a small attitude angle, about 10 o, which indicates small crosscoupling stiffnesses. The pad temperatures increase in the circumferential direction of rotation with speed and load. The pads maximum temperature was measured near the trailing edge. The dependency of the stiffness and damping coefficients on the excitation frequency has been studied. The frequency dependency in the dynamic coefficients was removed by introducing an added mass coefficient to the bearing model. The direct added mass coefficients were around 32 kg. The direct stiffness and damping coefficients increase with load, while increasing and decreasing with rotor speed, respectively. A small whirl frequency ratio (WFR) was found of about 0. 15, and it decreases with load and increases with speed. A comparison between the dynamic stiffnesses using a Reynolds equation and the bulk-flow Navier-Stokes models with the experimental dynamic stiffnesses shows that the Reynolds model (even for laminar flows) is not adequate, and that the bulk-flow model {{should be used for}} rotordynamic coefficients prediction. The bulk-flow model in general predicts well the static performance parameters and the direct dynamic coefficients, and underpredicts the cross-coupled coefficients (overpredicts the stability) ...|$|R

A similar work performed on the same bearing at lower loads ranging from 0 - 1 MPa (0 - 150 psi) by Al-Ghasem was tested, whereas the current work investigates effects in the load range between 1 - 2. 2 MPa (150 - 320 psi). The bearing design parameters include: 4 pads with pad arc angle 72 ???? and 50 % <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> pad axial length 0. 0762 m (3 in), pad radial clearance 0. 254 mm (0. 010 in), bearing radial clearance 190. 5 ????m (0. 0075 in), preload 0. 25, and shaft nominal diameter of 0. 11684 m (4. 600 in). An important {{distinction between the two}} sets of tests is the difference in experimental bearing radial clearance, which for this case measured 208 ????m (0. 00082 in), and for Al-Ghasem??????s was 165. 1 ????m (0. 0065 in). The rotordynamic coefficients are determined experimentally using a test rig equipped with motion and load sensors. The rig is modeled using Newton??????s laws, which is converted from the time to frequency domain using Fourier Transform to give complex dynamic stiffnesses. From the resulting complex dynamic stiffnesses the associated real and imaginary components are plotted as a function of excitation frequency and curve fitted via linear regression to give the rotordynamic coefficients. The primary objectives were to determine whether the real component of the complex dynamic stiffnesses could be better modeled with or without the mass coefficient and to contrast the rotordynamic coefficients with an analytical model. Only in the load range of 1 to 2. 2 MPa were the unloaded direct mass coefficients near or at 0, which would allow for a [K][C] model to be used.

First, compliant flexure pivot tilting pad gas bearings with pad radial compliance (CFTPBs) were introduced and designed for high-speed oil-free micro turbomachinery. The pad radial compliance was for accommodation of large rotor growth at high speeds. Parametric studies on <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> preload, and tilting stiffness were performed using non-linear orbit simulations and coast-down simulations for an optimum design. Second, coast-down tests for imbalance response {{and stability of}} typical rotor-bearing system with a rigid rotor and two CFTPBs designed from the above design studies were conducted over operating speeds up to 55 krpm. Prediction of synchronous rotordynamic responses was made in terms of critical speed for various imbalance modes by using a rotordynamic analysis software (XLTRC), combined with dynamic force coefficients from the perturbation analysis. For stability analyses, a generalized orbit simulation program was developed considering both the translational and angular rotor motions with two different bearings. Linear stability analyses for the conical vibration mode were also performed by using XLTRC and the perturbation analysis based on the Lund method. Predictions of whirl speed showed good agreement to the tests, but the estimated onset speed of instability appeared lower than the measured instability. Finally, a new thermo-hydrodynamic analysis model of a typical rotor-bearing system with CFTPBs was presented, accompanying linear perturbation analyses to investigate thermal effects on the rotordynamic performance. A numerical procedure was established for solving the generalized Reynolds equation, the 3 -D energy equation, and the associated boundary conditions at the pad inlet flow and solid walls (rotor and pad) simultaneously. Parametric studies were conducted on nominal clearance and external load. Nominal clearance showed significant influence on temperature fields, and external load had uneven thermal effects among pads. Case studies with heat flux and temperature boundary conditions on the rotor end surface were performed to simulate various working conditions of the bearing. Large rotor thermal growth due to the high rotor temperature showed noticeable influence on rotordynamic performance by increasing direct stiffness and damping coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Plans to {{shut down}} nuclear power plants in some European {{countries}} as well as increased electricity production by wind and solar power will increase the work load on hydroelectric power plants in the future. Also, due to the power grid regulations, hydroelectric power plants undergo more frequent start-ups and shut-downs. During such transient periods, a large amplitude shaft motion can occur, especially in the power plants with vertical shafts. Large shaft motion is not desirable because {{it can lead to}} a machine failure. Furthermore, performance limitations of conventional white metal or babbitted bearings call for the development of new bearing designs. An outstanding tribological performance can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to employ nonlinear analysis to provide further understanding of the compliant bearing dynamic response to synchronous shaft excitation. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a nonlinear approach. The numerical model was verified with an in-house developed code at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Results for the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry were compared with published data in dynamic conditions. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> tapers and pad inclination angles. Influence of the viscoelastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. It was also shown that the compliant liner provides lower maximum oil film pressure and thicker minimum oil film thickness in the bearing mid-plane in both static and dynamic operating conditions.

40|$|Test {{results that}} examine the {{influence}} of jacking-oil ports on a tilting pad journal (TPJ) bearing are presented. The static and dynamic characteristics before and after adding jacking-oil ports are compared. The test bearing is a four-pad, rocker-pivot, 57 % <b>pivot</b> <b>offset</b> TPJ bearing in load between pad configuration. This original bearing was modified to include jacking-oil ports on the two loaded pads and retested at the same operating conditions. The ports occupy 5 % of the pad?s surface area and have an approximate depth of 25 times the radial clearance. Pressurized jacking-oil was not used during testing; however, oil supply lines complete with check valves were added to emulate a typical industrial bearing assembly. This thesis compares both the static and dynamic bearing characteristics {{to determine the effects}} jacking-oil ports had. Rotordynamic coefficients are presented as dimensionless values, using a frequency-independent [K][C][M] model. The added jacking-oil ports caused a decrease in direct damping and increase in virtual-mass. Direct damping coefficients were reduced by an average of - 26 % in the loaded y-direction, and - 9 % in the orthogonal x-direction. The original bearing had all negative direct virtual-mass coefficients (stiffening with increasing frequency). The modified bearing had negative coefficients that were smaller in magnitude, and some virtual-mass coefficients that were positive. No significant changes were observed in any of the cross-coupled coefficients or the direct stiffness coefficients. The added jacking-oil ports has no significant impact on the static characteristics of the TPJ bearing. Static characteristics included the steady-state journal eccentricity, attitude angle, minimum film-thickens, and pad temperature. A predictive bearing code was modified to account for the jacking-oil port geometry but was unable to produce predictions matching the measured change in dynamic performance. Contrary to measurements, the code predicted frequency-dependent direct rotordynamic coefficients and no reduction in direct stiffness or damping for the bearing with jacking-oil ports. The influence of jacking-oil ports on a simple rotor-bearing system is presented. Rotordynamic predictions were made for a rigid rotor symmetrically supported by two TPJ bearings. Predictions showed that jacking-oil ports can significantly lower the first critical speed. This was attributed to the change in virtual-mass coefficients. There was only a small reduction in damping ratio predicted...|$|R
40|$|Static {{characteristics}} and rotordynamic coefficients were experimentally determined for a four-pad tilting-pad journal bearing with ball-in-socket pivots in loadbetween- pad configuration. A frequency-independent [M]-[C]-[K] model fit the measurements reasonably well, {{except for the}} cross-coupled damping coefficients. Test conditions included speeds from 4, 000 to 12, 000 rpm and unit loads from 0 to 1896 kPa (0 to 275 psi). The test bearing was manufactured by Rotating Machinery Technology (RMT), Inc. Though it has a nominal diameter of 101. 78 mm (4. 0070 in.), measurements indicated significant bearing crush with radial bearing clearances of 99. 6 ?m (3. 92 mils) and 54. 6 ?m (2. 15 mils) in the axes 45 ? counterclockwise and 45 ? clockwise from the loaded axis, respectively. The pad length is 101. 6 mm (4. 00 in.), giving L/D = 1. 00. The pad arc angle is 73 ?, and the <b>pivot</b> <b>offset</b> ratio is 65 %. The preloads of the loaded and unloaded pads are 0. 37 and 0. 58, respectively. A bulk-flow Navier-Stokes model was used for predictions, using adiabatic conditions for the bearing fluid. Because the model assumes constant nominal clearances at all pads, {{the average of the}} measured clearances was used as an estimate. Eccentricities and attitude angles were markedly under predicted while power loss was under predicted at low speeds and very well predicted at high speeds. The maximum detected pad temperature was 71 ?C (160 ?F) and the rise from inlet to maximum bearing temperature was over predicted by 10 - 40 %. Multiple-frequency force inputs were used to excite the bearing. Direct stiffness and damping coefficients were significantly over predicted, but addition of a simple stiffness-in-series model substantially improved the agreement between theory and experiment. Direct added masses were zero or negative at low speeds and increased with speed up to a maximum of about 50 kg; they were normally greater in the unloaded direction. Although significant cross-coupled stiffness terms were present, they always had the same sign. The bearing had zero whirl frequency ratio netting unconditional stability over all test conditions. Static stiffness in the y direction (obtained from steadystate loading) matched the rotordynamic stiffness Kyy (obtained from multiple-frequency excitation) reasonably at low loads but poorly at the maximum test load...|$|R
40|$|Static {{performance}} and rotordynamic coefficients are provided for a rocker-pivot, tilting-pad journal bearing with 50 and 60 percent offset pads in a load-between-pad configuration. The bearing uses leading-edge-groove lubrication {{and has the}} following characteristics: 5 -pads, 101. 6 mm (4. 0 in) nominal diameter,. 0814 -. 0837 mm (. 0032 -. 0033 in) radial bearing clearance,. 25 to. 27 preload, 60. 325 mm (2. 375 in) axial pad length. Operating conditions included loads from 0 to 3101 kPa (450 psi) and speeds from 7 to 16 krpm. Dynamic tests were conducted over a range of frequencies to obtain complex dynamic stiffness coefficients as functions of excitation frequency. For most test conditions, the direct real dynamic stiffnesses were well fitted with a quadratic function with respect to frequency. This curve fit allowed for the stiffness frequency dependency to be captured by including an added mass matrix [M] to a conventional [K][C] model, producing a frequency independent [K][C][M] model. The direct imaginary dynamic stiffness coefficients increased linearly with frequency, producing frequency independent direct damping coefficients. Compared to the 50 percent offset, the 60 percent offset configuration?s direct stiffness coefficients were larger at light unit loads. At high loads, the 50 percent offset configuration had a larger direct stiffness in the loaded direction. Negative direct added-mass coefficients were regularly obtained for both offsets, especially in the unloaded direction. Added-mass magnitudes were below 32 kg for all test cases. No appreciable difference was measured in direct damping coefficients for both <b>pivot</b> <b>offset.</b> A bulk-flow Navier-Stokes CFD code provided rotordynamic coefficient predictions. The following stiffness and damping prediction trends were observed for both 50 and 60 percent offsets. The direct stiffness coefficients were modeled well at light loads and became increasingly over-predicted with increasing unit load. Stiffness orthotropy was measured at zero and light load conditions that was not predicted. Direct damping predictions in the loaded direction increased significantly with unit load while the experimental direct damping coefficients remained constant with load. The direct damping coefficients were reasonably modeled only at the highest test speed of 16 krpm. Experimental cross-coupled stiffness coefficients were larger than predicted for both offsets, but were of the same sign and considerably smaller than the direct coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Micro-turbomachinery (MTM) {{implements}} gas bearings in compact {{units of}} enhanced mechanical reliability. Gas bearings, however, have little damping and {{are prone to}} wear during frequent rotor start-up and shut down conditions. Externally pressurized gas bearings provide a simple solution to overcome excessive drag and allowing rub-free operation during transient response events. Some commercial MTM currently implements gas foil bearings, a costly proprietary technology with few, if any, proven reliable predictive design models. The thrust {{of this research is}} to investigate conventional bearings of low cost, easy to manufacture (common materials) and easy to install and align. Flexure pivot tilting pad bearings offer little or no cross-coupled stiffnesses with enhanced rotordynamic stability. These bearings, modified for hydrostatic pressurization, demonstrated superior rotordynamic performance over other simple gas bearing configurations. The test rig comprises of a rigid rotor, 0. 825 kg and 28. 6 mm in diameter, supported on two hybrid flexure pivot hybrid gas bearings, each with four pads and 60 % <b>pivot</b> <b>offset</b> and 0. 6 mm feeding holes. Experimental results show that external pressurization stiffens the gas bearings, increasing the system critical speed while reducing the modal damping. Most importantly, the tests demonstrate that external pressurization is not needed for super critical speed operation. In practice, the supply pressure could be shut off at high speeds with substantial savings in operational efficiency. In addition, controlling the feed pressure while the rotor passes through its critical speeds can eliminate high amplitude motions because of the bearings? inherent little damping. In 2007, the test rig integrates an inexpensive automatic air pressure regulator to control the supply pressure into the gas bearings. The measured system dynamic response determines the regulator control scheme with a programmed schedule over a rotor speed region enclosing the system critical speeds. Rotor speed coast-down tests with controlled supply pressure into the bearings demonstrate the effective elimination of large rotor motion amplitudes while crossing the system critical speeds. The simple on-off supply pressure control, i. e. a sudden increase in pressure while approaching a critical speed, is the best since it changes abruptly the bearing stiffness coefficients and moves the system critical speed to a higher speed. A rotordynamic analysis, integrating bearing force coefficients predicted by an existing TRC computational model, forwards critical speeds in agreement with the test results. Predicted rotor synchronous responses for the cases with controlled supply show an excellent correlation with the measured responses. The experiments validate the predictive tools and demonstrate the controllable rotordynamic characteristics of the flexure pivot hybrid gas bearings...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{government}} regulations together with {{health and safety}} reasons, there are increasing demands on reducing hazardous polluting chemicals from fossil fuel power plants. Therefore, more efforts are imposed on using renewable resources such as water, wind, solar and tide to produce clean/green electricity. On top of that, there is another increasing demand from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to operate power plants with higher load while keep the power loss to the minimum. These requirements drive conventional fluid film bearings to its mechanical and temperature limits. This calls {{for the development of}} new bearing system designs. An outstanding tribological performance such as low start-up and break-away friction, excellent resistance to chemical attack and anti-seizure properties, can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, bearings with compliant liners may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to implement compliant liner on bearing surface, impose synchronous shaft excitation and investigate the effect of bearing design parameters on bearing dynamic response. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a FEM approach. The numerical model was compared with an in-house developed code based on the finite difference method (FDM) for a bearing operated at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Dynamic behaviour of the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry was compared with published data. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, radial clearance, <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> and pad inclination angles. Influence of the elastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. Misalignments in compliant tilting pad journal bearings were analysed for load between pivots and load on pivots with consideration of thermal effects. Significant improvements in bearing performance were obtained with compliant bearings compared to white metal bearings. Furthermore, different polymer materials (PTFE, UHMWPE, pure PEEK and PEEK composite) were characterized using Frequency Response Function (FRF). It was shown that as the excitation frequency increased the equivalent stiffness was more or less constant while equivalent damping decreased exponentially. PTFE had similar equivalent stiffness compared to PEEK. As for equivalent damping, PTFE had slightly higher damping compared to PEEK or UHMWPE. Oil film thickness, oil film temperature and loads on tilting pad journal bearing were measured on 10 MW Kaplan hydroelectric power machine. Test results were compared to FEM model. It was shown that stiffness of the supporting structure may be more important to machine performance than the stiffness of the bearing alone. QC 20150409 Swedish Hydropower Centr...|$|R
40|$|Static, dynamic, {{and thermal}} {{characteristics}} (measured and predicted) are presented for a 4 -pad, spherical-seat, TPJB with 0. 5 <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> 0. 6 L/D, 101. 6 mm nominal diameter, and 0. 3 preload in the LBP orientation. One bearing is tested four separate {{times in the}} following four different lubrication configurations: (1) flooded single-orifice (SO) at the bearing shell, (2) evacuated leading edge groove (LEG), (3) evacuated spray-bar blocker (SBB), and (4) evacuated spray-bar (SB). The LEG, SBB, and SB are all considered methods of ?directed lubrication?. These methods rely on lubrication injected directly to the pad/rotor interface. The same set of pads is used for every test to maintain clearance and preload; each method of lubrication is added as an assembly to the bearing. Test conditions include surface speeds and unit loads up to 85 m/s and 2. 9 MPa respectively. Static data includes measured bearing clearances prior to operation (cold) and immediately after operation (hot), rotor-bearing eccentricities and attitude angles, and {{a new approach to}} locating the hot center of a bearing. Dynamic data includes: (1) impedance values calculated from measured accelerations, displacements, and excitation forces; and (2) four sets (one set for each bearing configuration) of direct and cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients derived from measurements and fit to a frequency independent KCM model. Thermal data include measured temperatures from sixteen bearing thermocouples along with inlet, outlet, stator housing, and ambient thermocouples. Twelve of the bearing thermocouples are embedded in the babbitt layer of the pads while the remaining four are oriented at the leading and trailing edge of the loaded pads exposed to the lubricant. Bearing thermocouples provide a circumferential and axial temperature gradient. The pivot stiffness (pad and pivot in series) is measured and incorporated into predictions. Measured static, dynamic, and thermal values are compared to predictions from XL_TPJB, a computer code developed at the Texas A&M University Turbomachinery Lab for predicting bearing performance. Measurements show significant cross-coupled stiffness terms with opposite signs and magnitudes that are 20 - 50 % of the direct terms, a max axial temperature gradient of 9. 6 ?C, and attitude angles as high as 29 ?; all of these indicate that the tilt motion of the pad may be impeded by friction between the spherical pivot and the pad. Temperature measurements show directed lubrication, coupled with an evacuated bearing housing, reduces max bearing temperatures up to 13. 9 ?C for the LEG, 10. 2 ?C for the SBB, and 12. 8 ?C for the SB. Although the SB and SBB reduce the max bearing temperature as intended, they can also cause an increase in temperatures at the leading and trailing edges of the loaded pads. The LEG typically reduced temperatures at all locations. Compared to the base case of the flooded SO, directed lubrication reduces the max bearing temperature. Additionally, the dynamics of the system can also be significantly impacted. Using directed lubrication can reduce direct stiffness by up to 18 % for the LEG, 25 % for the SBB, and 20 % for the SB. Similarly, the direct damping can be reduced by up to 24 % for the LEG, 45 % for the SBB, and 34 % for the SB...|$|R
40|$|Measured and {{predicted}} static and dynamic characteristics are provided for a four-pad, rocker-pivot, tilting-pad journal bearing in the load-on-pad and load-between-pad orientations. The bearing has the following characteristics: 4 pads,. 57 pad <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> 0. 6 L/D ratio, 60. 33 mm (2. 375 in) pad axial length, 0. 08255 mm (0. 00325 in) radial clearance in the load-on-pad orientation, and 0. 1189 mm (0. 00468 in) radial clearance in the load-between-pad orientation. Tests {{were conducted on}} a floating test bearing design with unit loads ranging from 0 to 2903 kPa (421. 1 psi) and speeds from 6. 8 to 13. 2 krpm. For all rotor speeds, hot-clearance measurements were taken to show the reduction in bearing clearance due to thermal expansion of the shaft and pads during testing. As the testing conditions get hotter, the rotor, pads, and bearing expand, decreasing radial bearing clearance. Hot-clearance measurements showed a 16 - 25 % decrease in clearance compared to a clearance measurement at room temperature. For all test conditions, dynamic tests were performed over a range of excitation frequencies to obtain complex dynamic stiffness coefficients {{as a function of}} frequency. The direct real dynamic stiffness coefficients were then fitted with a quadratic function with respect to frequency. From the curve fit, the frequency dependence was captured by including a virtual-mass matrix [M] to produce a frequency independent [K][C][M] model. The direct dynamic stiffness coefficients for the load-on-pad orientation showed significant orthotropy, while the load-between-pad did not. The load-between-pad showed slight orthotropy as load increased. Experimental cross-coupled stiffness coefficients were measured in both load orientations, but were of the same sign and significantly less than direct stiffness coefficients. In both orientations the imaginary part of the measured dynamic stiffness increased linearly with increasing frequency, allowing for frequency independent direct damping coefficients. Rotordynamic coefficients presented were compared to predictions from two different Reynolds-based models. Both models showed the importance of taking into account pivot flexibility and different pad geometries (due to the reduction in bearing clearance during testing) in predicting rotordynamic coefficients. If either of these two inputs were incorrect, then predictions for the bearings impedance coefficients were very inaccurate. The main difference between prediction codes {{is that one of the}} codes incorporates pad flexibility in predicting the impedance coefficients for a tilting-pad journal bearing. To look at the effects that pad flexibility has on predicting the impedance coefficients, a series of predictions were created by changing the magnitude of the pad's bending stiffness. Increasing the bending stiffness used in predictions by a factor of 10 typically caused a 3 - 11 % increase in predicted Kxx and Kyy, and a 10 - 24 % increase in predicted Cxx and Cyy. In all cases, increasing the calculated bending stiffness from ten to a hundred times the calculated value caused slight if any change in Kxx, Kyy, Cxx, and Cyy. For a flexible pad an increase in bending stiffness can have a large effect on predictions; however, for a more rigid pad an increase in pad bending stiffness will have a much lesser effect. Results showed that the pad's structural bending stiffness can be an important factor in predicting impedance coefficients. Even though the pads tested in this thesis are extremely stiff, changes are still seen in predictions when the magnitude of the pad?s bending stiffness is increased, especially in Cxx, and Cyy. The code without pad flexibility predicted Kxx and Kyy much more accurately than the code with pad flexibility. The code with pad flexibility predicts Cxx more accurately, while the code without pad flexibility predicted Cyy more accurately. Regardless of prediction Code used, the Kxx and Kyy were over-predicted at low loads, but predicted more accurately as load increased. Cxx, and Cyy were modeled very well in the load-on-pad orientation, while slightly overpredicted in the load-between-pad orientation. For solid pads, like the ones tested here, both codes do a decent job at predicting impedance coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Measured and {{predicted}} static and dynamic load characteristics are provided for a three-pad, rocker-pivot, tilting-pad journal bearing in the load-between-pad orientation. The bearing has the following characteristics: 3 pads,. 50 pad <b>pivot</b> <b>offset,</b> 0. 6 L/D ratio, 60. 69 mm (2. 4 in) pad axial length, and 0. 0762 mm (0. 003 in) radial clearance. Three interchangeable pad configurations were tested with pad thicknesses of 8. 5 mm (0. 33 in), 10 mm (0. 39 in), and 11. 5 mm (. 45 in). Tests {{were performed on}} a test bearing floating about a rigid rotor design with unit loads ranging from 172 to 1, 724 kPa (25 to 250 psi) and speeds from 6 to 12 krpm. Cold and hot clearances were taken to measure the nominal and operating, respectively, radial bearing clearance. The cold clearance was taken at room temperature while the hot clearance was taken for each operating speed immediately after the rig was shut down. The hot bearing clearance shows a 23 ? 34 % decrease in radial bearing clearance. As the operating speed increased, the operating temperature in the bearing increased. The increase in operating temperatures caused the bearing and pads to expand and reduced the radial bearing clearance. Static load tests were performed once the test rig reached steady-state conditions. The maximum measured eccentricity ratio was over one for each pad configuration. As pad flexibility increased, the static eccentricity ratio decreased. The eccentricity ratio predictions agreed well with the measured results in the loaded direction. The measured attitude angles were as high as approximately 10 ?. The attitude angles remained fairly constant at low rotational speeds for tp = 8. 5 mm and tp = 10 mm and decreased as unit load increased for tp = 11. 5 mm. XL_TPJB? predicted attitude angles that had a smaller magnitude than the measured results for all rotational speed and unit load conditions and were negative. The temperatures did not vary greatly across pad configurations. The predictions agreed well with the measured values at low speeds and low unit loads. As the operating speed and unit load increased, the predictions were lower than the measured values. Pad flexibility was characterized as {{the change in the}} pad?s bending stiffness or the change in pad thickness. A finite-element model (FEM) was created in SolidWorks? to predict the structural bending stiffness of each pad configuration. Once the pivot was fixed in the FEM, a uniform pressure distribution was applied to the rotor-side surface of the pad. Results from the finite-element analysis (FEA) show an increase in pad flexibility as the thickness of the pad decreased. Dynamic load tests were performed for all nominal test conditions over a range of excitation frequencies to obtain complex dynamic-stiffness coefficients as a function of excitation frequency. The real and imaginary parts of dynamic-stiffness were fitted with quadratic and linear models, respectively, with respect to excitation frequency. A constant coefficient [K][C][M] model produced frequency-independent rotordynamic coefficients. For the load-between-pad configuration, the dynamic-stiffness coefficients show significant bearing orthotropy, especially as the unit load increased. In general, the dynamic-stiffness was larger in the non-loading direction {{than it was in the}} loading direction. Negative virtual mass coefficients were commonly obtained for all pad configuration. To examine the effect of pad flexibility on the rotordynamic coefficients, the measured results were compared across each pad configuration. The measured results show that the increase in pad flexibility decreased the direct damping coefficients by 12 - 20 % and, on average, decreased the cross-coupled damping coefficients by approximately 10 %. On average, the measured results show a slight increase in the stiffness coefficients as pad flexibility increased. The direct stiffness coefficients varied from an increase of 12 % at low unit loads and a decrease of 3 % at high unit loads. The cross-coupled stiffness coefficients change by 0 to 12 % as pad flexibility increased. In general, the direct virtual mass coefficients decreased by approximately 29 % as pad flexibility increased. The average change for the cross-coupled coefficients is an increase in Mxy and Myx by 2 % as pad flexibility increased. XL_TPJB? was used to predict the performance of the tilting-pad bearing tested in this work. XL_TPJB? accounts for pad and pivot flexibility. The predictions using XL_TPJB? agreed well with the measured values for direct stiffness coefficients. For a given pad set, the predictions agreed well with the measured results for one operating speed case and were either lower or higher than the measured results for the remaining speed cases for Cxx. The predicted values were generally higher than the measured values for Cyy at low unit loads and were lower than measured values at high unit loads. The measured values had a smaller magnitude than the predictions for the direct virtual-mass coefficients at lower speeds. At higher speeds, the predictions had a lower magnitude than the measured direct virtual-mass coefficients. All cross-coupled-coefficient predictions were nearly zero and, the measured values were typically non-zero and negative. A non-dimensional pad flexibility parameter ?flex was used to relate the pad flexibility of multiple bearings of different sizes. The parameter related the average deflection across the pad surface to the pad?s arc length. XL_TPJB? was used to predict the percent change in direct damping coefficients for a rigid pad, flexible pivot and flexible pad, flexible pivot for a surface speed of 54 m/s and a unit load of 783 kPa. The results show the pads tested in this thesis are extremely flexible compared to pads used in industry. Results show that the pad?s structural bending stiffness or flexibility is important when predicting the bearing?s dynamic performance. Damping is consistently over-predicting when excluding pad flexibility, and this could have a significant impact in predicting the bearing?s stability characteristics. In general, all codes should account for pad flexibility, as well as pivot flexibility, to properly predict the performance of a tilting-pad journal bearing...|$|R
