40|$|Escherichia coli {{possesses}} {{two major}} systems for inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake. The Pst system (pstSCAB) is inducible by low phosphate concentrations whereas the low-affinity transporter (pitA) {{has been described}} as constitutively expressed. <b>PitA</b> catalyses transport <b>of</b> metal [Mg(II), Ca(II) ]–phosphate complexes, and mutations in pitA confer Zn(II) resistance. Here we report that pitA transcription is not constitutive; activity of a single-copy pitA–lacZ transcriptional fusion (monolysogen) was maximal at high extracellular Zn(II) (150 ?M), in the absence of added Pi, and in a well-defined pitA mutant strain. Intracellular zinc levels were unaffected by adding Zn(II) to the medium for both the wild-type and mutant strains. However, in the wild-type strain, Mg levels (per gram of dry biomass) fell by eightfold in cells grown with added Zn(II) and by 20 -fold when Zn(II) and Pi were added to cultures. Mutation <b>of</b> <b>pitA</b> reduced the effects of external Zn(II) and phosphate levels on Mg pools, consistent with competition or inhibition by Zn(II) <b>of</b> <b>PitA.</b> The mechanism <b>of</b> <b>pitA</b> regulation by extracellular Zn(II) and Pi is unknown but appears not to involve Fur or other well-characterized regulators...|$|R

40|$|In this research, three {{alternative}} approaches to chemical preservatives {{to extend the}} mold free shelf-life and quality <b>of</b> <b>pita</b> bread were investigated namely: Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) involving gas packaging, oxygen absorbents technology and ethanol vapor generators, high pressures, and direct and indirect heating. Gas packaging using 60 %CO 2 (balance N 2) inhibited the growth of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium notatum from 3 d (pita bread packaged in air) to 35 d at ambient temperature. A longer extension in shelf-life (42 d) was possible using an Ageless oxygen absorbent or a Freshmax oxygen absorbent label in conjunction with gas packaging. Similar results were obtained with 2 G [...] 4 G sachets of Ethicap, and 100 [...] 200 S sachets of Negamold, a dual functional oxygen absorbent-ethanol vapor generator. High pressures (30 [...] 400 MPa) used to inhibit mold growth, resulted in delamination of the packaging film and textural changes to the pita bread. Other alternatives, such as direct heating and microwave processing had a minimal effect in increasing the shelf-life <b>of</b> <b>pita</b> bread. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Mycobacteria {{have been}} shown to contain an {{apparent}} redundancy of high-affinity phosphate uptake systems, with two to four copies of such systems encoded in all mycobacterial genomes sequenced to date. In addition, all mycobacteria also contain at least one gene encoding the low-affinity phosphate transporter, Pit. No information is available on a Pit system from a Gram-positive microorganism, and the importance of this system in a background of multiple other phosphate transporters is unclear. Results The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the physiological role <b>of</b> the <b>PitA</b> phosphate transporter in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Expression <b>of</b> <b>pitA</b> was found to be constitutive under a variety of growth conditions. An unmarked deletion mutant in <b>pitA</b> <b>of</b> M. smegmatis was created. The deletion did not affect in vitro growth or phosphate uptake of M. smegmatis. Expression of the high-affinity transporters, PstSCAB and PhnDCE, was increased in the pitA deletion strain. Conclusion PitA is the only low-affinity phosphate transport system annotated in the genome of M. smegmatis. The lack of phenotype <b>of</b> the <b>pitA</b> deletion strain shows that this system is dispensable for in vitro growth of this organism. However, increased expression of the remaining phosphate transporters in the mutant indicates a compensatory mechanism and implies that PitA is indeed used for the uptake of phosphate in M. smegmatis. </p...|$|R
