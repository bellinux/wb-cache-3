5|$|In early March 1704 Beatrix Laing {{approached}} Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old {{working in}} his father's smithy, {{to ask if he}} would make her some nails. Morton refused as he was already assigned an urgent task making nails for a merchant's ship in the harbour. Displeased, Laing left threatening revenge on him. The following day Morton noticed a bucket filled with water and burning coal outside Laing's house; he thought it was there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he began to have fits and convulsions, his stomach became distended and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> by fingernails where Morton said he had been pinched. He refused food and his breathing was laboured.|$|E
25|$|During Jesus' {{suffering}} in the Garden of Gethsemane prior to his crucifixion, blood exudes from every pore <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> The description of Jesus' sweat in Luke 22:44 is therefore not figurative.|$|E
25|$|Bumper boats: This {{ride was}} {{supposedly}} safer, but the engines often leaked gasoline, {{at least once}} requiring medical attention for one rider who got too much <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> Tall riders also often were unable to fit their legs on the small-sized boats, consequently resulting in them hanging off of {{the sides of the}} boats and being fractured during collisions.|$|E

60|$|He {{went away}} and some time {{afterwards}} Kit {{returned to his}} uncle's room. The shutters were pushed back from the balcony window and the strong light, reflected by the white wall, showed the thinness of Adam's figure and the deep lines <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> was a curious yellow color {{and his eyes were}} dull.|$|R
25|$|Wood's father, Edward Sr., {{worked for}} the U.S. Postal Service as a custodian, and his family {{relocated}} numerous times around the United States. Eventually, they settled in Poughkeepsie, New York, where Ed Wood Jr. was born in 1924. According to Wood's second wife, Kathy O'Hara, Wood's mother Lillian would dress him in girl's clothing {{when he was a}} child because she had always wanted a daughter. For the rest of his life, Wood crossdressed, infatuated with the feel of angora <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some circles, it is {{considered}} bad luck to depict a dragon facing downwards, as {{it is seen as}} disrespectful to place a dragon in such manner that it cannot ascend to the sky. Also, depictions of dragons in tattoos are prevalent as they are symbols of strength and power, especially criminal organisations where dragons hold a meaning all on their own. As such, it is believed that one must be fierce and strong enough, hence earning the right to wear the dragon <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> lest his luck be consumed by the dragons.|$|E
25|$|The {{retribution}} began immediately. Hugh Despenser {{the elder}} {{had been captured}} at Bristol, and despite some attempts by Isabella to protect him, was promptly executed by his Lancastrian enemies– his body was hacked to pieces and fed to the local dogs. The remainder of the former regime were brought to Isabella. Edmund Fitzalan, a key supporter of Edward II and who had received many of Mortimer's confiscated lands in 1322, was executed on 17 November. Hugh Despenser the younger was sentenced to be brutally executed on 24 November, and a huge crowd gathered in anticipation at seeing him die. They dragged him from his horse, stripped him, and scrawled Biblical verses against corruption and arrogance <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> He was then dragged into the city, presented to Queen Isabella, Roger Mortimer, and the Lancastrians. Despenser was then condemned to hang as a thief, be castrated, and then to be drawn and quartered as a traitor, his quarters to be dispersed throughout England. Simon of Reading, one of the Despensers' supporters, was hanged next to him, on charges of insulting Isabella. Once {{the core of the}} Despenser regime had been executed, Isabella and Mortimer began to show restraint. Lesser nobles were pardoned and the clerks {{at the heart of the}} government, mostly appointed by the Despensers and Stapleton, were confirmed in office. All that was left now was the question of Edward II, still officially Isabella's legal husband and lawful king.|$|E

50|$|Unfortunately, Geyser's {{experimentation}} with x-ray radiation <b>on</b> <b>his</b> direct <b>skin</b> forced the amputation {{of all the}} fingers, metacarpal bones, and one row of carpal bones <b>on</b> <b>his</b> left hand {{to stop the spread}} of cancer. He later lost his right hand to ulcers.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Anatomy of Desire" [...] is a {{short story}} by American writer John L'Heureux, first {{published}} in his book Desires, in 1981. It can also be read in American Gothic Tales edited by Joyce Carol Oates and Sudden Fiction edited by Richard Shapard. It {{is the story of}} a man with an unwavering need for more than just love: he wants to possess and be possessed. Determined to do so, he goes to an extreme only to learn there can only be desire: [...] "He walked around <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skinned</b> feet, leaving bloody footprints up and down the corridors, looking for someone to love him." ...|$|R
500|$|It was {{reported}} that Jordan Chandler claimed that Jackson was circumcised. Jackson's autopsy report reveals {{that he had not}} been circumcised and his foreskin appeared naturally intact and showed no signs of having been restored from a circumcision. Taraborrelli claims that Jordan correctly noted patchy colored skin on his buttocks, short pubic hair, and testicles marked pink and brown; however, initially investigators claimed Chandler said Jackson had splotches on his genitals a color [...] "similar to the color of his face" [...] rather than pink and brown. On February 10, 1993, Jackson had revealed to Oprah that he had a skin disorder that destroyed skin pigmentation and left blotches <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> and that make-up was used to even out his skin. The live interview was watched by 90 million viewers and after it aired, expert information on vitiligo was widely shared in the media. According to private investigator Anthony Pellicano who questioned Jordan in July 1993 after hearing Evan's taped phone call, Jordan denied that he ever saw Jackson's body but said he did lift his shirt once to show him the blotches <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> At the behest of a grand jury, investigators made a probe into Jackson's history, including familial interviews, to see if he had any surgeries or procedures done to alter his body's appearance as the jury felt {{there was a lack of}} a clear match with Jordan Chandler's description.|$|E
500|$|Encouraged by {{a fellow}} No. 4 Squadron veteran, Harry Cobby, Jones applied {{to join the}} new Australian Air Force on 22 March 1921 (the prefix [...] "Royal" [...] was added that August). His rank was flying officer, one below the {{equivalent}} of his AFC rank of captain. Another Australian pilot joining the fledgling Air Force was William (Bill) Bostock, a lieutenant in World War I. The pair became firm friends, Bostock acting {{as something of a}} mentor to the younger officer. Jones was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 July 1923. Nicknamed [...] "Jonah", he was also known as [...] "Yellow Jones" [...] in his early days with the RAAF, not through any perceived lack of moral fibre but {{as a result of the}} lingering effects <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> of jaundice, contracted while a soldier at Gallipoli.|$|E

60|$|But {{she could}} not reason her {{feelings}} so easily. She suffered, feeling herself in a false position. Her right hand, which she had laid so gently <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> fresh <b>skin,</b> ached now, {{as if it were}} really injured. She could not forgive Hadrian for the mistake: it made her dislike him deeply.|$|R

60|$|He {{was very}} pale, {{and when he}} was pale, the tan <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> looked sickly. He {{regarded}} me with his dark eyes, which were now full of misery and a child's big despair.|$|E

60|$|In the afternoon, the adventurers {{started with}} the boats going up to Merawi and, the next morning, arrived at the camp. The Dervish patches {{had been removed from}} their clothes, as soon as they arrived at Ambukol. Gregory could have {{borrowed}} a white suit there; but as the stain <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> although somewhat lighter than when first put on, was too dark, he declined the offer.|$|E
60|$|Marston {{could not}} see his watch and {{wondered}} how long it was to sunrise. It was unthinkable they should go on rowing {{in the heat of}} day; he was tired now and remembering the dark ripples alone sustained him. He thought they had nearly reached the spot where the surface was disturbed, but the fickle puffs of wind might have dropped. Stopping sculling for a few moments, he turned his head. His face was wet with sweat but he felt no coolness <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> It was very dark and ominously calm.|$|E
60|$|A transgression, a crime, {{entering}} a man's existence, eats {{it up like}} a malignant growth, consumes it like a fever. Nostromo had lost his peace; the genuineness of all his qualities was destroyed. He felt it himself, and often cursed the silver of San Tome. His courage, his magnificence, his leisure, his work, everything was as before, only everything was a sham. But the treasure was real. He clung to it with a more tenacious, mental grip. But he hated {{the feel of the}} ingots. Sometimes, after putting away a couple of them in his cabin--the fruit of a secret night expedition to the Great Isabel--he would look fixedly at his fingers, as if surprised they had left no stain <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Judgment of Cambyses is a {{well known}} exemplum iustitae, dating back to Herodotus’ Historiae, and very popular in the middle ages. The king condemns the corrupt judge Sisamnes to be flayed. <b>His</b> <b>skin</b> is draped <b>on</b> the bench. The new {{appointed}} judge Otanes, seated <b>on</b> <b>his</b> father’s <b>skin,</b> will always be aware to judge justly… The story’s most known representation is a diptych of Gerard David, today in the Bruges Groeningemuseum. This article draws attention to some other early modern paintings of the same story, all commissioned by magistrates near the Flemish coast: Bruges, Dunkirk and Nieuwpoort...|$|R
50|$|In 1969, {{at the age}} of 21, Mullin {{allowed his}} family to commit him to a mental hospital. Over the next few years, he entered various institutions, but {{discharged}} himself after only a short stay. He extinguished cigarettes <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own <b>skin,</b> attempted to enter the priesthood, and got evicted from an apartment after he repeatedly pounded on the floor, shouting at people who were not there.|$|R
60|$|The curtain {{was torn}} {{to one side}} and the Emperor stepped out into the room. We sprang to the salute, we three old soldiers, but it was all like a scene in a dream to us, and our eyes were as far out as Berthier's had been. Napoleon was dressed in his green-coated chasseur uniform, and he held his little, silver-headed switch in his hand. He looked at us each in turn, with a smile upon his face--that frightful smile in which neither eyes nor brow joined--and each in turn had, I believe, a pringling <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin,</b> for that was the effect which the Emperor's gaze had upon most of us. Then he walked across to Berthier and put his hand upon his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning he}} knelt {{in a hole}} below the track, holding a drill. He wore mittens, but {{the back of one}} was split and showed a raw bruise <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin.</b> It needs {{practise}} to hit the end of a drill squarely, and Charnock, who swung the big hammer, had missed. The worst was that the bruise would not heal while the temperature kept low. They were sinking a hole through frozen gravel that was worse to cut than rock, because the drill jambed in the crevices and would not turn. But for the frost, they need not have used the tool; a hole for the post they meant to put in could have been made with a shovel, without using expensive powder.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Travers made no reply. What she {{had said}} of his {{attitude}} was very true. He sulked at the enormous offensiveness of men, things, and events; of words and even of glances which he seemed to feel physically resting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> like a pain, like a degrading contact. He managed not to wince. But he sulked. His wife continued, [...] "And {{let me tell you}} that those clothes are fit for a princess--I mean they are of the quality, material and style custom prescribes for the highest in the land, a far-distant land where I am informed women rule as much as the men. In fact they were meant to be presented to an actual princess in due course. They were selected with the greatest care for that child Immada. Captain Lingard. [...] ." ...|$|E
5000|$|Roberts {{was known}} in the {{entertainment}} industry as a legendary alcoholic, with a history of eccentric behavior. She had a habit of imitating a Welsh Corgi when intoxicated and once, at a party thrown by Richard Harris, attacked actor Robert Mitchum on all fours, chewing his trousers and champing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bare <b>skin,</b> while he patted her on the head, saying [...] "there, there".|$|R
60|$|He {{smiled and}} slapped meaningly the only {{pocket of the}} {{sleeping}} jacket. It was not safe, certainly. But I produced a large old silk handkerchief of mine, and tying the three pieces of gold in a corner, pressed it on him. He was touched, I supposed, because he took it at last and tied it quickly round his waist under the jacket, <b>on</b> <b>his</b> bare <b>skin.</b>|$|R
40|$|This is a {{rare case}} report of {{osteosarcoma}} with lepromatous leprosy. A 15 year old male patient presented with swelling around the right knee joint. Imaging and biopsy were consistent with osteosarcoma. After his first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT), the patient developed fever, erythematous nodules, perichondritis of ear lobe, and thickened nerves. His slit-skin smear examination showed acid-fast bacilli in clumps, and a diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy was made. He was treated with anti-leprosy medications with steroids, and once his condition stabilized, his ACT was continued. <b>On</b> follow-up, <b>his</b> <b>skin</b> lesions completely recovered...|$|R
