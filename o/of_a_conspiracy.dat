5|$|Farewell Great Macedon (also {{known as}} Alexander the Great in the script's early stages) was a six-part story pitched for Season 1 and {{was written by}} Moris Farhi. In the story, the Doctor and his companions are framed for murder as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to kill Alexander the Great and must pass a number of trials, {{including}} walking on hot coals, to gain the trust of his bodyguard Ptolemy. The script was published by Nothing at the End of the Lane in October 2009. It was later adapted by Nigel Robinson for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in November 2010.|$|E
5|$|Gorman {{said that}} his Catholic {{grandmother}} had secretly married Albert Victor, and that his mother, as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful heir to the throne. He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth. In the original television series, the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further, and eventually published his research as the book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution in 1976.|$|E

5|$|In 1293, Qalawun's son an-Nasir Muhammad instituted Gaza as {{the capital}} of the {{province}} that bore its name, Mamlakat Ghazzah (the Governorship of Gaza). This province covered the coastal plain from Rafah in the south to just north of Caesarea, extending in the east to the western slopes of Samaria and the Hebron Hills; its major towns were Qaqun, Ludd, and Ramla. In 1294, an earthquake devastated Gaza, and five years later the Mongols again destroyed all that was restored by the Mamluks. That same year, Gaza was the center <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> against Sultan al-Adil Kitbugha, but the plot was detected and crushed before being carried out.|$|E
5|$|In 1380 Hongwu had the Chancellor Hu Weiyong {{executed}} upon suspicion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> plot {{to overthrow}} him; after that Hongwu abolished the Chancellery and assumed this role {{as chief executive}} and emperor, a precedent mostly followed throughout the Ming period. With a growing suspicion of his ministers and subjects, Hongwu established the Jinyiwei, a network of secret police drawn from his own palace guard. Some 100,000 people were executed {{in a series of}} purges during his rule.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes {{and two of}} the latter's {{business}} acquaintances—John le Mesurier and George Deakin—appeared before magistrates at Minehead, Somerset, in a committal {{hearing to}} determine whether they should stand trial. The court heard evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by The Sunday Telegraph for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the Old Bailey. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.|$|E

On {{the day of the}} assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius the next Roman emperor. Although the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule the empire until the fall of Nero in AD 68, Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line.|$|E
5|$|Of humble origin, {{he became}} Theodore's {{companion}} in childhood and {{was raised to}} high state office upon the latter's assumption of power. This caused great resentment from the aristocracy, which had monopolized high offices and opposed Theodore's policies. Shortly before Theodore's death in 1258, he was appointed regent of Theodore's under-age son John IV Laskaris (r. 1258–1261). He was assassinated {{only a few days}} later by soldiers, as the result <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> led by the nobles under the soon-to-be emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282).|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy,</b> they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864.

Curious at this deployment, Aqil had requested an explanation from the kaimakam of Acre, but received no response. Thus Aqil {{concluded that the}} deployment was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to upend his rule. In response, Aqil assembled his entire force of irregulars, amounting to some 300–400 men, and marched towards Shamdin's troops. Other Arab tribes volunteered their service, but Aqil declined their participation.|$|E
5|$|The 19th-century Louisiana {{historian}} Charles Gayarré also embellished {{the story}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> behind the Natchez revolt, composing {{in his book}} a lengthy speech by the Great Sun in which the leader exhorted his warriors to invite the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Yazoo {{to join in the}} attack on the French.

5|$|Al-Kamil proclaimed himself sultan in Cairo, {{while his}} brother al-Mu'azzam claimed the throne in Damascus. Al-Kamil {{attempted}} to retake Damietta, but was forced back by John of Brienne. After learning <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> against him, he fled, leaving the Egyptian army leaderless. Panic ensued, {{but with the}} help of al-Mu'azzam, al-Kamil regrouped his forces. By then, however, the Crusaders had seized his camp. The Ayyubids offered to negotiate for a withdrawal from Damietta, offering the restoration of Palestine to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, {{with the exception of the}} forts of Mont Real and Karak. This was refused by the leader of the Fifth Crusade, Pelagius of Albano, and in 1221, the Crusaders were driven out of the Nile Delta after the Ayyubid victory at Mansura.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sack, rumours reached the caliph that Theophilos was {{advancing}} to attack him. Mu'tasim set {{out with his}} army a day's march along {{the road in the}} direction of Dorylaion, but encountered no sign of a Byzantine attack. According to al-Tabari, Mu'tasim now pondered extending his campaign to attack Constantinople, when news reached him <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> headed by his nephew, al-Abbas ibn al-Ma'mun. Mu'tasim was forced to cut short his campaign and return quickly to his realm, leaving intact the fortresses around Amorium as well as Theophilos and his army in Dorylaion. Taking the direct route from Amorium to the Cilician Gates, both the caliph's army and its prisoners suffered in the march through the arid countryside of central Anatolia. Some captives were so exhausted that they could not move and were executed, whereupon others found the opportunity to escape. In retaliation, Mu'tasim, after separating the most prominent among them, executed the rest, some 6,000 in number.|$|E
5|$|In 1750 as {{a result}} of the Treaty of Madrid seven {{missions}} in present-day Rio Grande do Sul state in Brazil were transferred from Spanish to Portuguese control. The native Guaraní tribes were unhappy to see their lands turned over to Portugal (their enemy for over a century) and they rebelled against the decision, leading to the Guarani War. In Europe, where the Jesuits were under attack, they were accused of supporting the rebellion and perceived as defending the native peoples. In 1758, the Jesuits were accused <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to kill the king of Portugal, known as the Távora affair. All members of the Society of Jesus were evicted from Portuguese territories in 1759, and from French territories in 1764. In 1766 Jesuits were accused of causing Esquilache Riots in Madrid; consequently in February 1767, Charles III of Spain signed a royal decree with expulsion orders for all members of the Society of Jesus in Spanish territories.|$|E

5|$|Mainstream Christianity has {{typically}} {{rejected the}} ideas of the New Age. Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating conspiracy theories regarding the origin and purpose of the movement. The most successful such publication however was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel This Present Darkness, which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with feminism and secular education as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> to overthrow Christianity.|$|E
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was the tipping point, or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy</b> of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for {{its approach to}} the battle.

The only explanation that many people were willing to accept for the town's fall was {{that it had been}} given up as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>conspiracy.</b> The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E
