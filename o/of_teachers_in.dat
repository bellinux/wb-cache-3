5|$|The {{strategies}} of gay activists {{were once again}} split.

However, grassroots efforts by longtime activists such as Morris Kight, who went on a walk across the state to promote voting down the Briggs Initiative, were also effective.

However, when California law was revealed to state that anyone who gave more than $50 to the campaign would have to release his or her name, most of the donations came in at $49, including one by Rock Hudson.|$|E

25|$|The {{first school}} on the site was a schoolroom for 200 boys and 100 girls. It was founded in 1810 by local lawyer William Wilshere in a disused malthouse. This schoolroom was the first monitorial school for {{the sons of the}} poor in Hertfordshire. Teaching was based on Joseph Lancaster's methods of monitorial teaching. He {{developed}} a system in which large numbers of younger scholars could be taught by older scholars {{under the supervision of the}} master (for boys) or mistress (for girls). This method continued until the Revised Code of 1862 that brought in the Pupil Teacher method of teaching. The monitorial system was changed as it was the general consensus that having children teach other children, when they are not well educated themselves, proved to be problematic. The Pupil Teacher method involved an older scholar being given training and being paid to teach. The government hoped that this would increase the number <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> the future, using a system that could be described as an apprenticeship in teaching.|$|E
