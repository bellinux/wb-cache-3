5|$|Andrew Peck also {{considers}} the Slender Man {{to be an}} authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements <b>of</b> <b>oral,</b> written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity {{despite the lack of}} a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.|$|E
5|$|Details on {{reversing}} warfarin {{are provided}} in clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians.

When warfarin is being given and INR is in therapeutic range, simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1.5.|$|E

5|$|Preface to Plato had a {{profound}} impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then fairly new) <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek philology; the book also acknowledges the influence of literary theory, particularly structuralism. The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to Preface from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology.|$|E

5|$|A defrocked Romanian Orthodox priest with an {{unconventional}} lifestyle, Creangă made an early impact as an innovative educator and textbook author, while pursuing a short career in nationalist politics with the Free and Independent Faction.

Although viewed with reserve by many of his colleagues there, and primarily appreciated for his records <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> tradition, Creangă helped propagate the group's cultural guidelines in an accessible form. Later criticism has often described him, alongside Eminescu, Ion Luca Caragiale and Ioan Slavici, {{as one of the most}} accomplished representatives of Junimist literature.|$|E

5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via schools for the deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E
5|$|Administrative reforms {{during the}} 19th century {{included}} the replacement <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> examinations with written entrance tests, greater tolerance for religious dissent, {{and the establishment}} of four women's colleges. Privy Council decisions in the 20th century (e.g. the abolition of compulsory daily worship, dissociation of the Regius Professorship of Hebrew from clerical status, diversion of colleges' theological bequests to other purposes) loosened the link with traditional belief and practice. Furthermore, although the university's emphasis had historically been on classical knowledge, its curriculum expanded during the 19th century to include scientific and medical studies. Knowledge of Ancient Greek was required for admission until 1920, and Latin until 1960.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} {{may occur}} {{in association with}} several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type <b>of</b> <b>oral</b> ulceration is {{not considered to be}} true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces in addition to the mouth such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity of the oral ulceration.|$|E

The present study evaluates the clinico-pathological {{features}} of verrucous lesions <b>of</b> the <b>oral</b> cavity and analyzes the treatment outcomes. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study of 15 consecutive patients who presented with verrucous lesions <b>of</b> the <b>oral</b> cavity, during the 5 -year period from January 2006 to December 2010. Demographic, clinico-pathological features, treatment details, and outcomes were analyzed. Results: Fifteen patients with verrucous lesions <b>of</b> the <b>oral</b> cavity were treated with surgery as the primary modality. The mean age was 62. 8 years (range 35 - 85 years). Wide excision of the primary lesion with adequate mucosal and soft-tissue margins was carried out. Free-flap reconstruction was done in eight patients. All patients remain loco-regionally controlled with good functional speech and swallowing outcome. Conclusions: Verrucous lesions <b>of</b> the <b>oral</b> cavity are a distinct clinical entity with varied histopathology. A surgical excision with wide margins and appropriate reconstruction is necessary to optimize the disease and functional outcome...|$|R
