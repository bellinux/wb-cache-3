5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century most of the European {{settlements}} were related to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute has documented over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{wished to}} retire to Castile {{and live with}} her {{recently}} widowed sister Eleanor, near Charles, who had retired. She was afraid <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> Castile because, although her mentally unstable mother Joanna (who died aged 77 in April 1555) had been sovereign there, Mary had never lived in Castile. She was afraid that Eleanor's death would leave her alone in a country whose customs she did not know. In the end, she {{decided to move to}} Castile, while retaining the possibility of moving back to the Netherlands in case she could not adjust to the Castilian customs. Charles, Eleanor, and Mary sailed from Ghent on 15 September 1556.|$|E

5|$|The Denver Nuggets are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Denver, Colorado. They {{play in the}} Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Nuggets were founded as the Denver Rockets of the American Basketball Association (ABA) in 1967. In 1974, in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> the NBA, the franchise held a contest to choose a new trademarked name for the team, as Rockets was already in use by the Houston Rockets and the name Nuggets won. In 1976, the ABA folded, and the NBA decided to admit four ABA teams into the league, including the Nuggets, the San Antonio Spurs, the Indiana Pacers and the New York Nets.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the British force caught Tirpitz by surprise. While the {{aircraft}} had first been {{picked up by a}} German radar station shortly after they crossed the Norwegian coastline, the battleship was not immediately warned. At the time of the attack Tirpitz was preparing to sail for her high-speed trials, and her crew were busy unmooring the vessel. Her five protective destroyers had already departed for the trials area in Stjern Sound. The warning from the radar station arrived shortly before the British aircraft appeared over Kaafjord, and the battleship's crew were still in the process <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> their battle stations when the attack commenced; at this time not all of the watertight doors were closed and some damage-control stations were not fully manned.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{in favour of}} West Ham's bid was unanimous, although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue. Hopes <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and Leyton Orient, with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing {{less than a mile}} away from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and put them out of business. Both clubs' appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011. On 3 March 2011, West Ham's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and Mayor of London Boris Johnson.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Lee Flanagan (March 16, 1930– November 16, 2001) was an American jazz {{pianist and}} composer. He {{grew up in}} Detroit, {{initially}} influenced by such pianists as Art Tatum, Teddy Wilson, and Nat King Cole, {{and then by the}} newer bebop musicians. Within months <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> New York in 1956, he had recorded with Miles Davis and on Sonny Rollins' landmark Saxophone Colossus. Recordings under various leaders, including the historically important Giant Steps of John Coltrane, and The Incredible Jazz Guitar of Wes Montgomery, continued well into 1962, when he became vocalist Ella Fitzgerald's full-time accompanist. He worked with Fitzgerald for three years until 1965, and then in 1968 returned to be her pianist and musical director, this time for a decade.|$|E
5|$|Though it is Sweden's {{third most}} populous city, Malmö often missed the {{possibility}} to host larger concert and music events because it lacked a suitable indoor arena. When the City Tunnel project was initiated by Malmö Stad in the late 1990s, the city began to plan a new district in Hyllievång. This led to the decision to build Hyllie station in 2001, {{as a part of}} the tunnel project, to boost the development of the new district. The ice hockey club Malmö Redhawks, which was the proposed main tenant of the new arena, was initially uncertain of the new project and wanted to renovate its present home, the Malmö Isstadion, instead <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> an entirely new arena. However, the Redhawks were convinced when Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB contributed seven million kronor to help the club's financial situation.|$|E
5|$|Between 1904 and 1905, Hull City {{played their}} home {{games at the}} Boulevard. This ground was used by Hull on a {{contract}} which allowed them to use it when not used for Rugby League, {{at a cost of}} £100 per annum. Hull built their own ground, Anlaby Road, which was opened in 1906. With the threat of the rerouting of the railway line through the Anlaby Road ground, the club was convinced it needed to secure its future by owning its own ground. They negotiated the deal for land between Boothferry Road and North Road in 1929, which was financed by a £3,000 loan from the FA. Due to the club's financial difficulties, no work took place for three years, and development then stopped until 1939. In that year a proposal to build a new multi-purpose sports stadium on the site temporarily halted the club's plans to relocate, but when this plan failed the club resolved to continue with the stalled development of the site, in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> the new stadium in 1940. The outbreak of war, however, meant that the redevelopment again came to a halt, as the site was taken over by the Home Guard.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944 No.73 Wing was {{selected}} to support the US Army's Admiralty Islands campaign. The 1st Cavalry Division began {{to land on the}} islands on 29February, and the wing moved to Momote Airstrip on Los Negros Island in March 1944. No.79 Squadron became operational there with 24 aircraft on the 29th of the month. From Momote, the squadron flew ground attack sorties in support of US troops until Japanese resistance ceased. No Japanese aircraft were encountered throughout this operation. By the end of April, No.79 Squadron's main role was to escort Allied shipping, though flying was hampered by a shortage of spare parts. The squadron's commanding officer, Squadron Leader M.S. Bott, was killed in an accident on 16April. Shipping escort patrols continued in May, but difficulties maintaining the Spitfires reduced the squadron to just two operational aircraft with another 12 awaiting repair. Due to a shortage of aircraft the squadron's flying activities were limited to training sorties between August and October, and aircraft availability continued to be a problem until late November. On 9November, two Spitfires unsuccessfully attempted to intercept three Japanese A6M fighters which had raided Hyane Harbour; while the Japanese force had been tracked by Allied radar for 25 minutes prior to the attack, the Spitfires were scrambled only after the raiders had left the area. No.79 Squadron subsequently maintained a three-aircraft patrol over Los Negros during daylight hours until 22November. Two days later the squadron was released from operations ahead <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> Darwin in northern Australia to be re-equipped with more modern Mark VIII Spitfires.|$|E

25|$|This {{notion of}} slow cooling {{implemented}} in the Simulated Annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, the Simulated Annealing algorithms work as follows. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and then decides to move to it or {{to stay with the}} current solution based on either one of two probabilities between which it chooses {{on the basis of the}} fact that the new solution is better or worse than the current one. During the search, the temperature is progressively decreased from an initial positive value to zero and affects the two probabilities: at each step, the probability <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> a better new solution is either kept to 1 or is changed towards a positive value; instead, the probability <b>of</b> <b>moving</b> <b>to</b> a worse new solution is progressively changed towards zero.|$|E
