5|$|Due to the {{failures}} of the ratings agencies, European regulators obtained new powers to supervise ratings agencies. With the creation of the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards <b>or</b> <b>will</b> be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea came}} closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon {{received}} Premier League approval {{to relocate to}} Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.

5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour of organisms. Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations of organisms into new groups that cannot <b>or</b> <b>will</b> not interbreed.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Boris Chirikov and Vitaly Vecheslavov {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} 46 apparitions of Halley's Comet taken from historical records and computer simulations. These studies showed that its dynamics were chaotic and unpredictable on long timescales. Halley's projected lifetime could be as long as 10million years. More recent work suggests that Halley will evaporate, or split in two, {{within the next few}} tens of thousands of years, <b>or</b> <b>will</b> be ejected from the Solar System within a few hundred thousand years. Observations by D.W. Hughes suggest that Halley's nucleus has been reduced in mass by 80–90% over the last 2000–3000 revolutions.|$|E
5000|$|If a {{consistent}} reflexive reasoner of type 4 {{believes that he}} or she is stable, then he <b>or</b> she <b>will</b> become unstable.

5|$|Instead, the {{argument}} considers the entire collection (jumla) of contingent things, {{the sum total}} of every contingent thing that exists, has existed, <b>or</b> <b>will</b> exist. Avicenna argues that this aggregate, too, must obey the rule that applies to a single contingent thing; in other words, it must have something outside itself that causes it to exist. This cause has to be either contingent or necessary. It cannot be contingent, though, because if it were, it would already be included within the aggregate. Thus the only remaining possibility is that an external cause is necessary, and that cause must be a necessary existent.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Báthory's reign {{marks the}} end of szlachta's reform movement. The foreign king was skeptical of the Polish {{parliamentary}} system and had little appreciation for what the execution movement activists had been trying to accomplish. Batory's relations with Sienicki soon deteriorated, while other szlachta leaders had advanced within the nobility ranks, becoming senators or being otherwise preoccupied with their own careers. The reformers managed to move in 1578 in Poland and in 1581 in Lithuania the out-of-date appellate court system from the monarch's domain to the Crown and Lithuanian Tribunals run by the nobility. The cumbersome sejm and sejmiks system, the ad hoc confederations, and the lack of efficient mechanisms for the implementation of the laws escaped the reformers' attention <b>or</b> <b>will</b> to persevere. Many thought that the glorified nobility rule had approached perfection.|$|E

5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} early {{settlement}} period of Oregon Country. In 1841, pioneer Ewing Young died without an heir <b>or</b> <b>will</b> in the unorganized lands of what are now the states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. In February of that year, settlers met at Champoeg to discuss the creation of a government, including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young’s estate. Although the overall government plans fell through, the group of pioneers and mountain men did elect a Supreme Judge to exercise probate powers. The first judge was Dr. Ira L. Babcock, serving from February 18, 1841, to May 1, 1843.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the new line is to allow {{regional}} and express trains to run directly between Asker Station, Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station, without being slowed and delayed by commuter trains that make frequent stops at intermediate stations. The Asker Line will improve regularity, and capacity will increase from 12 to 26 trains per hour in each direction. Travel time from Asker to Skøyen Station will be reduced from 20 to 13 minutes. The line has received criticism for not being a true high-speed line, and for Lysaker Station not being in compliance with accessibility requirements. Similar parallel, high-speed lines have been <b>or</b> <b>will</b> be built northeast and southeast of Oslo.|$|E
5|$|The white-eyed river {{martin was}} seen in Thailand in 1972, 1977 and 1980, but not {{definitely}} since. There are unconfirmed sightings from Thailand in 1986 and Cambodia in 2004. It is classified as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). This designation means that a species' numbers have decreased, <b>or</b> <b>will</b> decrease, by 80% within three generations. This species may be extinct, but the IUCN will not categorise it as such until extensive targeted surveys have been conducted. Despite legal protection under Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) agreement, it was captured by locals along with other swallows for sale as food or for release by devout Buddhists. Following its discovery by ornithologists, trappers {{were reported to have}} caught as many as 120 and sold them to the director of the Nakhon Sawan Fisheries Station who was unable to keep them alive in captivity. The small population may therefore have become non-viable.|$|E

5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires burn more than , {{and the vast majority of}} fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, <b>or</b> <b>will</b> burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E
