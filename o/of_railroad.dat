5|$|Railroads {{have played}} an {{important}} role in South Dakota transportation since the mid-nineteenth century. Some 4,420miles (7,113km) <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> track were built in South Dakota during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but only 1,839miles (2,959km) <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> are currently operational.|$|E
5|$|The larvae <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> worms (Phrixothrix) have paired photic organs on each body segment, able to {{glow with}} green light; these {{are thought to}} have a {{defensive}} purpose.

5|$|Ellet's men {{returned}} to De Soto Point and constructed an artillery battery targeting an iron foundry recasting spent Union artillery shells. Construction was begun on June 19, which placed a 20-pounder Parrott rifle in a casemate <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> iron. The targeted foundry was destroyed on June 25 {{and the next}} day a second Parrott gun was added to the battery, which continued to harass the defenders until the garrison's surrender.|$|E
25|$|Another appeal <b>of</b> the <b>railroads</b> is the {{business}} side <b>of</b> <b>railroading.</b> Railroads were long central to economic growth and commerce, and still are to some extent. The history <b>of</b> <b>railroads</b> and railroaders (such as James J. Hill) is a fascination for some, whether they view them {{in a positive way}} as capitalist heroes or in a negative way as robber barons.|$|R

5|$|From 1975 until 1982, $606 {{million of}} local and {{national}} community development funds were invested throughout the city. In the 1990s, the city pushed for revitalization, uncovering the rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges), relocating a large section <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> underground, creating Waterplace Park and river walks along the rivers' banks, and constructing the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Alex and Ani City Center) and the 1.4 million ft² Providence Place Mall.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, a {{connecting}} {{track was}} opened through downtown Norwich, allowing trains from the Norwich and Worcester Railroad {{to connect to}} steamers at New London rather than Allyn's Point. Use of the connection stopped in November 1855, but was continuous after April 1859. After {{the completion of the}} New London & Stonington to Groton Wharf in 1858, ferry service ran from New London to Groton to allow through railroad service. The NH station was soon too small to handle large passenger loads, and the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Railroad</b> Commissioners was petitioned for a new station as early as 1859.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1877, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) {{announced}} it would reduce the wages of all workers by ten percent. One hundred miles would constitute a day's work, and crews would not receive allowances for time spent on delays at stations. Various meetings <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> employees followed, and a committee was formed to meet with officers of the railroad. They appealed to the vice president, Mr. King, but he declined to meet.|$|E

5|$|Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works was a 19th-century {{manufacturer}} <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> steam locomotives {{based in}} Paterson, in Passaic County, New Jersey, in the United States. It built {{more than six}} thousand steam locomotives for railroads around the world. Most railroads in 19th-century United States rostered at least one Rogers-built locomotive. The company's most famous product was a locomotive named The General, built in December 1855, {{which was one of}} the principals of the Great Locomotive Chase of the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Pioneer Zephyr is a {{diesel-powered}} railroad train formed <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> cars permanently articulated {{together with}} Jacobs bogies, {{built by the}} Budd Company in 1934 for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB), {{commonly known as the}} Burlington. The train featured extensive use of stainless steel, was originally named the Zephyr, and was meant as a promotional tool to advertise passenger rail service in the United States. The construction included innovations such as shotwelding (a specialized type of spot welding) to join the stainless steel, and articulation to reduce its weight.|$|E

According to a speech by President Ernesto Zedillo, Isis damaged the water systems in 173localities; it also damaged 154primary schools and nine high schools, minor in most cases, causing most schools to be closed for around a week. A total of 730miles (1175km) <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> track was damaged by mudslides or flooding, with one bridge entirely destroyed and another four damaged.|$|E
5|$|With the {{expansion}} <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> and industrial jobs in meatpacking, Omaha attracted many new immigrants and migrants. As the major city in Nebraska, it {{has historically been}} more racially and ethnically diverse {{than the rest of}} the state. At times rapid population change, overcrowded housing and job competition have aroused racial and ethnic tensions. Around the start of the 20th century, violence towards new immigrants in Omaha often erupted out of suspicions and fears.|$|E
5|$|From 1912 to 1917, {{the state}} {{acquired}} {{all of the}} 541separate properties that comprise the Eighth Ward east of the capitol. The Eighth Ward was situated between the capitol and a set <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> tracks, then owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Arnold Brunner was hired in 1916 to develop new accommodations for state government, which had already outgrown the capitol. He introduced his plan in 1920, which called, first, for the demolition of the Eighth Ward. Brunner planned two office buildings behind the capitol, the North and South Office Buildings, and these were separated by a courtyard he named the People's Court. The South Office Building was completed in 1921. The leveling of the Eighth Ward was finished in 1925.|$|E

5|$|In 1887, James W. Bryan vacated {{his seat}} in the Kentucky Senate to pursue the office of {{lieutenant}} governor. Goebel decided to seek election to the vacant seat representing the Covington area. His platform <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> regulation and championing labor causes, combined with the influence of Stevenson, his former partner, should have given Goebel an easy victory, {{but this was not}} to be. A third political party, the Union Labor party, had risen to power in the area with a platform similar to Goebel's. However, while Goebel had to stick close to his allies in the Democratic party, the Union Labor party courted the votes of both Democrats and Republicans, and made the election closedecided in Goebel's favor by a mere fifty-six votes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, four 12-year-old boys — Petey LaChance (Peter, with Richard Dreyfuss's voice in his head narrating the story), Quag Chambers (Quagmire), Joey Duchamp (Joe with Roy Scheider's voice in his head, who starts talking with Dreyfuss until Joe stops them), and Cleve Brown (Cleveland) — {{set out to find}} a dead body in the woods, {{following}} a set <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> tracks to find it. At the start of their trip, they try going through Old Man Pressman's (Stewie) junkyard, only to be chased out by Pressman and his dog Chopper (Brian). As they travel further down the tracks, they are chased across a bridge by a train, which ends up running over Joey's legs, as does another train that follows closely behind, which effectively cripples him. The others end up going {{all the way back to}} Pressman's junkyard to get him a wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over another set <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> tracks before heading northeastward from the community toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank farms to an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward {{from this point on}} NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E

5|$|One of Harrison's first acts as {{president}} was {{to implement a}} new training program for college graduates hired by the company. Rather than being placed in supervisory roles, they were given regular entry-level jobs in the engine shops and on the building and repairing <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> track, {{to give them an}} understanding of the basics of the railroad business. He also instituted a remedial education program for the regular workforce; they were trained in mathematics and other subjects to high school level, as well as in engine and machine-shop basics. The program was designed to help train new supervisors in the skills needed to oversee other workers.|$|E

5|$|The statue was {{donated to}} Rutgers by Dr. Fenton B. Turck {{to commemorate the}} university's Dutch heritage. Turck, with the {{assistance}} <b>of</b> <b>railroad</b> executive and Rutgers alumnus Leonor F.

It is a statue of William I, Prince of Orange (1533-1584), an early leader of the Dutch revolt against Habsburg Spain {{which led to the}} independence of the Netherlands in 1648. The statue has continued to be included in student life as the Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events, including graduation ceremonies, pep rallies, festivals, and protests. Occasionally, the statue is a target of vandalism in an ongoing historical rivalry between students of Rutgers and Princeton University. The statue was restored in 2006 in an effort funded by alumni donations.|$|E
