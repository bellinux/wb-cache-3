500|$|Despite the gentry's <b>overriding</b> <b>interest</b> in {{archaeology}} simply for reviving ancient state rituals, some of Shen's peers took {{a similar approach}} {{to the study of}} archaeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early epigraphy and archaeology. During the 11th century, Song scholars discovered the ancient shrine of Wu Liang (78–151 CE), a scholar of the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE); they produced rubbings of the carvings and bas-reliefs decorating the walls of his tomb so that they could be analyzed elsewhere. On the unreliability of historical works written after the fact, scholar-official Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129) stated [...] "...the inscriptions on stone and bronze are made at the time the events took place and can be trusted without reservation, and thus discrepancies may be discovered." [...] Historian R.C. Rudolph states that Zhao's emphasis on consulting contemporary sources for accurate dating is parallel with the concern of the German historian Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), and was in fact emphasized by many Song scholars. The Song scholar Hong Mai (1123–1202) heavily criticized what he called the court's [...] "ridiculous" [...] archaeological catalogue Bogutu compiled during the Huizong reign periods of Zheng He and Xuan He (1111–1125). Hong Mai obtained old vessels from the Han dynasty and compared them with the descriptions offered in the catalogue, which he found so inaccurate he stated he had to [...] "hold my sides with laughter." [...] Hong Mai pointed out that the erroneous material was the fault of Chancellor Cai Jing (1047–1126), who prohibited scholars from reading and consulting written histories.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, the {{critical}} question {{in this case is}} whether exempting respondents from the State's general criminal prohibition [...] "will unduly interfere with fulfillment of the governmental interest," [...] Justice O'Connor stated. [...] "Although the question is close, I would conclude that uniform application of Oregon's criminal prohibition is 'essential to accomplish,' its <b>overriding</b> <b>interest</b> in preventing the physical harm caused by the use of a Schedule I controlled substance." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schønberg and Craig have propounded {{the use of}} a [...] "balancing approach" [...] {{should the}} courts not choose to {{acknowledge}} the proportionality test. This would entail the balancing of [...] "the requirements of substantive fairness against any <b>overriding</b> <b>interest</b> relied upon for taking an action". However, they note that this approach is [...] "lacking in precision" [...] and does not state [...] "if judicial intervention presupposes a significant, serious or even extreme imbalance in the individual's expectation".|$|E
2500|$|Category (c): {{substantive}} legitimate expectation– promise {{having the}} character of a contract. If a lawful promise or practice has [...] "induced a legitimate expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply procedural", the court will decide [...] "whether to frustrate that expectation is so unfair that to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power". When the expectation is established to be legitimate, [...] "the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness against any <b>overriding</b> <b>interest</b> relied upon for the change of policy". Most cases of this type are likely to be [...] "cases where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation {{the character of}} a contract".|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{noted that}} [...] "adoption {{is not a}} right; it is a {{statutory}} privilege" [...] and that adoption is wholly {{a creature of the}} state. It then noted that in [...] "formulating its adoption policies and procedures, the State of Florida acts in the protective and provisional role of in loco parentis for those children who, because of various circumstances, have become wards of the state. Thus, adoption law is unlike criminal law, for example, where the paramount substantive concern is not intruding on individuals' liberty interests" [...] and that it is [...] "also distinct from such contexts as government-benefit eligibility schemes or access to a public forum, where equality of treatment is the primary concern." [...] The Court held that [...] "the state's <b>overriding</b> <b>interest</b> is {{the best interests of the}} children whom it is seeking to place with adoptive families", and [...] "the state can make classifications for adoption purposes that would be constitutionally suspect in many other arenas".|$|E

2500|$|Fair {{criticism}} was {{singled out as}} the only applicable defence available in the law of contempt. As the defamation defences of justification and fair comment were viewed as inappropriate in protecting the court from attacks, the High Court declined to recognise them as valid defences to scandalizing contempt. Adopting the reasoning in Attorney-General v. Chee Soon Juan, the Court held that the defences of justification and fair comment in the law of defamation were not available in the law of contempt because of the <b>overriding</b> <b>interest</b> in protecting the public's confidence {{in the administration of}} justice, particularly when accusations against a judge's impartiality are mounted. Allowing the defence of fair comment would expose the courts to any belief published in good faith and not for an ulterior motive, even though it may be unreasonable. Similarly, the defence of justification would give malicious parties an added opportunity to subject the dignity of the courts to more attacks. The Court also noted that in Hertzberg, the purposes of contempt and defamation law were distinguished: [...] "the law of contempt ... is concerned with the protection of the administration of justice and is grounded in public interest, while the law of defamation is concerned with the protection of a private individual's reputation".|$|E
2500|$|The appellants' lawyers, Willis S. Moore for {{the state}} and {{district}} attorneys, and George E. Chamberlain and Albert H. Putney, for the governor, argued that the state had an <b>overriding</b> <b>interest</b> to oversee and control the providers of education {{to the children of}} Oregon. One of them {{even went so far as}} to call Oregonian students [...] "the State's children". They contended that the State's interest in overseeing the education of citizens and future voters was so great that it overrode the parents' right to choose a provider of education for their child, and the right of the child to influence the parent in this decision. With respect to the appellees' claims that their loss of business infringed on Fourteenth Amendment rights, the appellants' lawyers countered that since appellees were corporations, not individuals, the Fourteenth Amendment did not directly apply to them. In addition, they asserted, the revenues of a corporation were not property, and thus did not fall under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, they argued that since the law was not scheduled to take effect until September of the following year, the suits were brought prematurely—to protect against a possible coming danger, not to rectify a current problem.|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} some {{academic}} debate over the effect on <b>overriding</b> <b>interests</b> of the Human Rights Act 1998.
