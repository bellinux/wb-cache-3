2500|$|The {{backlash}} included vocal critics, including disgruntled {{patients and}} consumer-advocacy groups, {{who argued that}} managed care plans were controlling costs by denying medically necessary services to patients, even in life-threatening situations, or by providing low-quality care. The volume of criticism led many states to pass laws mandating managed-care standards. Meanwhile, insurers responded to public demands and political pressure by beginning to offer other plan options with more comprehensive care networks—according to one analysis, between the years 1970 and 2005 the share of personal health expenditures paid directly out-of-pocket by U.S. consumers fell from about 40 percent to 15 percent. So although consumers faced rising health insurance premiums over the period, lower out-of-pocket costs likely [...] encouraged consumers to use more health care.

50|$|A valet {{is usually}} an {{employee}} of the establishment, or {{an employee of}} a third party valet service. When there is a fee, it is usually either a flat amount or a fee based on how long the car is parked. It is customary in the United States to tip the valet who actually parks the car. Valet parking is most often offered (and is most useful) in urban areas, where parking is scarce, though some upscale businesses offer valet parking as an <b>optional</b> <b>service,</b> even though self-parking may be readily available. For example, in wealthy suburban areas like California's Silicon Valley, some hospitals (like Stanford University Medical Center) offer valet parking for the convenience of patients and their visitors. On the other hand, where parking is not scarce, such as on the Las Vegas Strip, it is offered as a convenience to patrons. Some hospitals, like the Yale-affiliated Greenwich Hospital (Connecticut) on Connecticut's Golden Coast, have such limited space for parking that the emergency room is valet parking only, to fit as many cars in as possible.|$|E

We also consider two disciplines for servicing customers; in first discipline, customers receive second <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> (if it is requested) immediately after obligatory service, in second discipline, if second <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> is requested, have to leave service area after obligatory service completion to retrial orbit, {{and try to be}} serviced after a exponentially distributed time.

If there is no customer in the queue the server goes on multiple vacation. Service times are gernerally distributed and vacation time is exponentially distributed. The time dependent probability generating functions has been obtained {{in terms of their}} Laplace transforms and the corresponding steady state results are obtained explicitly.

40|$|Consider {{a single}} server retrial {{queueing}} system with second <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> under pre-emptive priority service {{in which two}} types of customers arrive in a Poisson process with arrival rate λ 1 for low priority customers and λ 2 for high priority customers. In this model the server provides two types of services (i. e) Essential Service and Second <b>Optional</b> <b>Service.</b> The essential service will be given first to both low priority and high priority customers. This second <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> will be extended to only high priority customers if they demand. The service times of essential service follow an exponential distribution with parameters µ 1 and µ 2 for both low and high priority customers respectively. The service time of second <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> for high priority customers follows an exponential distribution with parameter µ 3. The retrial is introduced for low priority customers only. Let K be {{the maximum number of}} waiting spaces for high priority customers in front of the service station. The high priorities customers will be governed by the Pre-emptive priority service. The access from orbit to the service facility is governed by the classical retrial policy. This model is solved by using Matrix geometric Technique. Numerical study have been done for Analysis of Mean number of low priority customers in the orbit (MNCO), Mean number of high priority customers in the queue(MPQL),Truncation level (OCUT),Probability of server free and Probabilities of server busy with low, high priority customers and second <b>optional</b> <b>service</b> with high priority customers for various values of λ 1, λ 2, µ 1, µ 2, µ 3, σ and k in elaborate manner and also various particular cases of this model have been discussed.
