40|$|A {{composite}} façade system {{concept was}} {{developed at the}} University of Michigan by Professor Harry Giles that considered the use of various transparent and composite materials in building construction. Particular aspects of this transparent composite façade system (TCFS) were investigated in this dissertation and involved the use of recyclable polymers and biofiber composites. This dissertation addresses research questions related to structural and environmental performance of the transparent composite façade system (TCFS) compared to a glass curtain wall system (GCWS). In order {{to better understand the}} context for the TCFS and establish performance evaluation methods, an extensive literature review was conducted focusing on material performance, structural performance requirements, life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques, composite panel principles, product surveys and building codes. Structural design criteria were established for the TCFS with respect to the strength and stiffness requirements of the International Building Code (IBC). A new testing frame was fabricated and installed at the architectural department of the University of Michigan to conduct static and impact tests in accordance with Safety Performance Specifications and Methods of Test (ANSI Z 97. 1). Initial static tests were carried out to measure bending stiffness of TCFS specimens in order to compare the results with theoretical predictions. Impact tests were also carried out to examine whether TCFS specimens conformed to the <b>safety</b> <b>glazing</b> criteria specified in ANSI Z 97. 1. In addition, a comparative LCA of a TCFS and a GCWS was performed on each system to assess their respective environmental implications. Structural testing results indicated that the bending stiffness according to simple beam theory is in agreement with measured stiffness under two-edge supported conditions. Impact tests demonstrated that TCFS specimens satisfy the Class B of the <b>safety</b> <b>glazing</b> requirements of ANSI Z 97. 1. Comparative LCA results showed that the total life cycle energy of the TCFS was estimated to be 93 % of that of the uncoated GCWS and the total emission of kg CO 2 equivalent for the TCFS was determined as 89 % of the uncoated GCWS. The impact associated with transportation and the end-of-life management was estimated to be insignificant in this study...|$|R
