5|$|Among several {{projects}} for memorials, Zvi Hecker designed the solemn Page Memorial (1996) with Micha Ullmann and Eyal Weizman. This site-specific memorial commemorates the Jewish community of Kreuzberg, and their Lindenstrasse synagogue {{which was designed}} in 1891 by architects Cremer & Wolffenstein. What was <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest religious buildings in Berlin, with a capacity of 1800; was ruined by the Nazis in the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. On the original floor plan, the benches of the synagogue were recreated in concrete, and where the bimah stood, trees are now planted. The designers conceived of the benches as sentences {{on the pages of}} the Talmud.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium, <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best stadiums in Triple-A baseball, {{began to}} be out shined by newer {{state-of-the-art}} ballparks being built in the late 1980s. The Reds let their player development contract (PDC) with the Sounds expire so they could place their Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis, which was closer to Cincinnati and was planning {{to build a new}} stadium. Nashville entered the offseason unsure of their next major league affiliate.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to commercial shark fisheries, dusky sharks are also caught as bycatch on longlines meant for tuna and swordfish (and usually kept for its valuable fins), and by recreational fishers. Large numbers of dusky sharks, mostly juveniles, are caught by sport fishers off South Africa and eastern Australia. This shark was <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important {{species in the}} Florida trophy shark tournaments, before the population collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. I try to improvise. What comes out is what I feel.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-two astronauts were {{assigned}} to fly missions in the Apollo program. Twenty-four of these left Earth’s orbit and flew around the Moon between December 1968 and December 1972 (three of them twice). Half of the 24 walked on its surface, though none of them returned to the Moon after landing <b>once.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moonwalkers was a trained geologist. Of the 32, Gus Grissom, Edward H. White, and Roger Chaffee were killed during a ground test in preparation for their Apollo 1 mission.|$|E

5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused industrial land, brick pits, and landfill areas. Though <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As {{most of the remaining}} populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated. Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades.|$|E
5|$|SOS Puffin is a {{conservation}} {{project at the}} Scottish Seabird Centre at North Berwick to save the puffins on islands in the Firth of Forth. Puffin numbers {{on the island of}} Craigleith, <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest colonies in Scotland with 28,000 pairs, have declined dramatically to just a few thousand due to the invasion of a large introduced plant, the tree mallow (Lavatera arborea). This has spread across the island in dense thickets and prevents the puffins from finding suitable sites for burrowing and breeding. The project has the support of over 700 volunteers and {{progress has been made in}} cutting back the plants, with puffins returning in greater numbers to breed. Another conservation measure undertaken by the Centre is to encourage motorists to check under their cars in late summer before driving off as young puffins, disorientated by the street lights, may land in the town and take shelter underneath the vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} was <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's most widely {{distributed}} mammals, living throughout {{the northern hemisphere}} north of 15°N latitude in North America and 12°N in India. However, deliberate human persecution has reduced the species' range to about one third, because of livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans. The species is now extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico {{and much of the}} United States. In modern times, the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas, particularly in Canada, Alaska and northern USA, Europe, and Asia from about 75°N to 12°N. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s, and have fostered recolonization and reintroduction in parts of its former range, due to legal protection, changes in land-use and rural human population shifts to cities. Competition with humans for livestock and game species, concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people, and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species. Despite these threats, because of the gray wolf's relatively widespread range and stable population, it is classified as least concern by the IUCN.|$|E

5|$|The route heads {{through some}} {{residential}} neighborhoods before entering a commercial area with strip malls and some high-rise buildings where White Flint Mall, <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D.C. metropolitan area's largest shopping malls, was {{located on the}} east side of the road. The road comes to an intersection with Old Georgetown Road as well as a grade-separated interchange at Montrose Parkway. The Metro Red Line draws farther east from MD355 before it crosses into Rockville, the county seat of Montgomery County. In Rockville, the road passes more commercial development with a railroad line paralleling the road a short distance to the east. The route intersects MD 911 (First Street) and the Wootton Parkway. MD355 intersects MD 660 (Dodge Street), which is a short connector to MD 28 (Veirs Mill Road) that the route intersects a short distance later.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s {{corruption}} in Texas {{at the state}} and county level was in decline, while pressure against vice across the state and across the nation was on the rise. Even San Antonio's famed Sporting District, <b>once</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation's largest red-light districts, was shut down in 1941. As state investigations of the Maceos' activities became more serious, Sam and Rose began plans to move their empire to Nevada. The Maceos became major investors in the Desert Inn, which was the largest and most elaborate casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip when it opened in 1950. Moe Dalitz (who opened the Desert Inn) and Sam Maceo had long been allies and business partners. The Las Vegas project's financing was largely facilitated by the Maceos and Moodys through ANICO (which loaned millions to known mob figures). Soon ANICO was one of the largest lenders to Las Vegas casinos. Sam and Rose Maceo transferred controlling interest of most of their Galveston empire to a new group dominated by the Fertitta family, with investments coming from business interests around the island. The Fertitta group never wielded the influence that the Maceos had (though a generation later Tilman and Frank Fertitta came to be major entertainment magnates themselves). Sam Maceo died in 1951 and Rose in 1954.|$|E
