40|$|Collective Dominance - Merger Control on <b>Oligopolistic</b> <b>Markets</b> This thesis {{discusses}} how the European Merger Control Regulation, 4064 / 89, {{is applied}} to different situations of collective dominance. The concept of collective dominance applies to three sets of legal provisions; the Articles 81 and 82 EC and the Merger Regulation. Comparisons are made between these provisions, although {{the focus is on}} merger appraisals in <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets.</b> Initially I explain the basic theories of <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets,</b> unilateral and co-ordinated effects as well as the outcome of collective dominance, that is tacit collusion and parallel behaviour. Furthermore, the thesis examines how far the concept of collective dominance can be stretched by studying relevant case law, such as the Kali & Salz- case and Gencor v. Commission. Finally, the criteria of collective dominance are discussed, where the decision in Airtors/First Choice serves {{as an example of the}} Commission's reasoning when assessing mergers on <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets.</b> Carina Olsso...|$|R

40|$|Relevance of the research. In {{the past}} 20 years the {{markets in the}} {{developed}} economies demonstrate a trend to concentrate economic agents and their consolidation to optimize economic processes, maximize efficient business performance, and pursue robust communication policy. The markets of raw and ready products, international and interregional services and works are shifting towards oligopolization. Therefore, {{it is important to}} analyze and characterize the ongoing significant changes in functioning of <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets</b> triggered by globalization, hyper-competition, new technological paradigms, development of innovations and consumer behavior trends in the modern economy. The main aim of the research is to outline the fundamental factors of influence upon changes in modern market performance, intensified competition under globalization and transition to the postindustrial economy summing up the studies in different research areas (strategic management, marketing, the theory of industrial organization, consumer behavior, innovations, etc.); to determine to what extent the oligopoliesstimulating factors encourage intensive competition between market participants and resist cartelization of oligopolistic markets; to describe the main characteristics of the new meaning of the competition model for innovative <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets</b> in comparison with the classical model of oligopoly; to identify a trend towards systemwide changes of the form and nature of competition on <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets</b> that requires a game-changing review of approaches to the principles of antimonopoly regulation at the modern stage; to systematize and highlight the new substantial content of the competition model on <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets</b> and the factors influencing intensified competition on <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets.</b> Research methods: systemic analysis, comparative and normative legal analysis. Results. The features of competitiveness within the frame of two models - classical oligopoly and oligopoly changing under the influence of new economic trends - occur in multilevel, poly-structured, inter-sectoral competition of business-systems formed by the market leaders. Cross-competition between participants of different systems creates the conditions for flexible market conduct. Conclusions. System-wide changes in the form and nature of competition on the <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets,</b> including the innovative ones, initiate the development of new institutional mechanisms and approaches to substante the principles and methods of antimonopoly regulation at the present stage...|$|R
50|$|There is {{no single}} model {{describing}} the operation of an <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market.</b> The variety {{and complexity of the}} models exist because you can have two to 10 firms competing on the basis of price, quantity, technological innovations, marketing, and reputation. Fortunately, there are a series of simplified models that attempt to describe market behavior by considering certain circumstances. Some of the better-known models are the dominant firm model, the Cournot-Nash model, the Bertrand model and the kinked demand model.|$|E
50|$|The NHS alleges various drugs {{companies}} {{exploited the}} <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market</b> conditions, forcing the NHS to pay inflated prices. NHS fraud investigators {{believe there was}} a conspiracy to limit the supply of 30 of its most commonly prescribed drugs, including a class of penicillin antibiotics and to a generic version of best-selling ulcer treatment Zantac. The NHS has so far filed claims in relation to just three drugs, seeking damages of more than £150m, while the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is conducting a parallel investigation into the price-fixing allegations limited to the supply of blood-thinning pill warfarin and penicillin-based antibiotics. Homes and offices of executives at six firms, including Ranbaxy, Generics UK, Norton Healthcare, Goldshield and Regent-GM were raided by the SFO in May 2002.|$|E
5000|$|The {{important}} {{cultural industries}} {{tend to have}} an <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market</b> structure. The market is dominated by a few major companies, {{with the rest of}} the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as [...] "gatekeepers" [...] for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from synergy and market power have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1840s, guano {{came to be}} prized as {{a source}} of {{saltpeter}} for gunpowder as well as an agricultural fertilizer. The United States began importing it in 1843 through New York. By the early 1850s, the U.K. imported over 200,000 tons a year, and U.S. imports totaled about 760,000 tons. The [...] "guano mania" [...] of the 1850s led to high prices in an <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market,</b> attempts of price control, fear of resource exhaustion, and eventually the enactment of the Guano Islands Act 1856 in August 1856. The Act enables U.S. citizens to take possession of unclaimed islands containing guano for the U.S., and empowering the President to send in armed military to intervene. This encouraged American entrepreneurs to search and exploit new deposits on tiny islands and reefs in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.|$|E
50|$|Burton's {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} Supreme Court jurisprudence {{came in the}} area of antitrust law. In American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781 (1946), Burton wrote for a near-unanimous court (Justice Rutledge, concurring) that the Sherman Antitrust Act barred the mere existence of combinations or conspiracies which created monopolistic or <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market</b> power, regardless of whether that power was actually used. Legal scholar Eugene V. Rostow declared Burton's decision would usher in a new era of swift, effective antitrust enforcement. But Burton's analysis cut both ways. In United States v. Columbia Steel Company, 334 U.S. 495 (1948), the same reasoning was used to allow U.S. Steel to buy out the much smaller Columbia Steel. Even though Columbia Steel was the largest steel manufacturer on the West Coast, Burton joined the majority in holding that the acquisition was not a violate of the Clayton Antitrust Act because Columbia Steel represented such a small percentage of overall American steel production. The Columbia Steel decision shocked antitrust advocates.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{implementation}} of Regulation 139/2004 and the turn towards a more effects-based approach to EU competition law, EU merger control was governed by EEC Regulation 4064/89. Under EEC Regulation 4064/89 (the 'old' regulation), a merger or concentration was prohibited if it would"create or strengthen a dominant position as a result of which effective competition would significantly impeded".The old substantive test is said to have encouraged two alternative interpretations of how to apply the test. The alternative interpretations suggest that, the presence of dominance alone is a sufficient condition to satisfy the dominance test and that as part of a two-tier test dominance is a necessary condition to satisfy before considering the dynamics of competition between the parties merging and the competitive characteristics of the market following the notification of a merger. The effective of the old [...] "dominance test" [...] increasingly began to be called into question with concerns regarding the issues of overenforcement and the false positives. The case of Airtours v Commission in 2002 served as the case that ultimately urged the Commission to recommend a change in EU merger regulation. The Commission prohibited the merger of Airtours and First Choice on the basis that it would create a collective dominant position in the market since there would be an incentive for the remaining firms in an <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market</b> to restrict market capacity, leading to higher prices and increased profits as a result of subsequent market conditions following the merger. The oligopolists need not always [...] "behave as if there were one or more explicit agreements between them." [...] The Commission believed it was [...] "sufficient that the merger makes it rational for the oligopolists...to act individually in ways which will substantially reduce competition between them." [...] In the case of Airtours v Commission, the Court of First Instance annulled the Commission's decision to prohibit the Airtours-First Choice merger {{on the grounds that the}} Commission's interpretation of collective dominance was not informed by the widely recognised indicator of anti-competitive behaviour in an <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market</b> - tacit collusion. The Airtours legal action created a significant level of uncertainty in EU merger law as a perceived gap had arisen with the law at the time - the gap of the non-collusive oligopoly.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model to examine regional, or geographical, {{allocation}} of defence spending in a nation, which is actuated by electoral motives of an incumbent government. We posit that the spatial impact of defence spending can be enormous as defence spending offers a host of local public goods to a regional economy and thereby determines the competitiveness of regional producers/firms in the national, or global, economy. Allocation of defence spending can thus impact on and drive regional inequality within a nation. In this sense, regional inequality is treated as an endogenous variable in our model. We explore how the politics of allocation of defence spending can create an equilibrium regional inequality in a stylized model. In a wider policy context, it is generally recognised that the efficacy of any public policies becomes problematic in <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets</b> as the conclusions of theoretical models are extremely sensitive to the assumed degree/nature of competition in <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets.</b> To overcome this general weakness of the literature, our major innovation is to make both the nature of competition and allocation of defence spending endogenous and, thereby, to provide a framework that explains both these elements. We establish that the structure of industry, conduct of rival firms, nature of competition in <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets</b> and regional inequality will largely depend on the proposed electoral equilibrium and, hence, will be extremely sensitive to voters' preferences and their characteristics. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new theory of the cartel party. My {{argument}} is straightforward. Assuming that parties are the political analog of firms, that party systems are the political analog of markets, that the shares of the electorate are the political analog of the market shares that firms control, Western European party systems share with <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets</b> some structural features. Yet, to know whether Western European party systems resemble <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets,</b> we need to know whether Western European party systems are non-competitive political markets exactly in the same way in which <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets</b> are not competitive. That is we need to know whether changes in (political) supply are competitive adaptations to changes in demand or not. Hence, to focus on supply is not enough. We need to look at changes in supply relative to changes in demand. Moreover, since voters’ perception of parties’ political offer to the electorate does not simply reflect some objective conditions but is instead mediated by subjective factors (preferences, expectations, ideas, and so on…) I further suggest that the perception of the cartel may not be determined by parties’ objectively oligopolistic practices, but it can simply be based on the perception of oligopolistic behavior, that is on the gap between the electorate’s demands and the market’s perceived supply...|$|R

5000|$|Components {{of a work}} of art, like raw stone, {{tubes of}} paint or {{unpainted}} canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an [...] "artistic capital". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market</b> structure).Three kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.|$|E

Tying may thus facilitate collusion. It may also allow the tying firm to alter market share allocation in a collusive <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market...</b>|$|E

In the recent years we could observe an increasing role played by the GC and the ECJ in shaping the legal framework in which mergers are assessed. In fact, the EU judiciary has not only extended the previously narrow scope of the original merger regulation but it has also contributed significantly towards increasing the legal certainty by elaborating a reliable set of legal criteria for the assessment of <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>markets,</b> which also reflected the economic theory.

40|$|An {{environmental}} agreement in an <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market</b> may violate the competition rules, {{as described in}} Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty. Ordinarily, some collusion among firms is necessary for an {{environmental agreement}} to be successful. This collusion may be acceptable when {{it relates to the}} development of technologies or processes, as opposed to the classic hypothesis of collusion regarding prices or the division of the market. One must also consider the goals of competition policy. Thus, factors such as tangible benefits to the consumer or a substantial technological advance (for example, an environmental agreement that brings firms together to conduct R&D) could outweigh potential anti-competitive effects of the agreement. Accordingly, while an environmental agreement can act as an entry barrier to a market, it can also lead to the development of new technologies. This paper presents the general aspects of competition law and policy and then discusses how competition law and policy can be applied to environmental agreements in an <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market.</b> This paper argues that while competition policy can sometimes be relaxed with regard to environmental agreements in a competitive market, it should remain strict when applied to agreements in an <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>market,</b> as this type of market structure so often leads to anti-competitive behaviour...|$|E
