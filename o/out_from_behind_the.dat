5|$|The velites {{were used}} against the Carthaginian {{elephants}} in the Battle of Zama. After their usual javelin throw, the velites took cover behind the maniples, and then launched a sortie, quickly coming <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> troops and attacking the elephants, before retreating again.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kirk, {{played by}} John Belushi, orders {{the ship to}} outrun the strange craft. Unable to do so, he orders phasers and photon torpedoes to destroy the craft. Unfortunately, all of the ship's {{equipment}} fails for no reason and the Enterprises systems break down. Suddenly, Dr. Leonard McCoy, played by Dan Aykroyd, runs onto the bridge saying that the aliens are on the ship. He says they did not beam aboard, but merely walked <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> curtains.|$|E
5|$|On August 19, 1953, a burned crewman {{talks to}} three {{government}} agents about his {{experience on the}} submarine Zeus Faber, completing the story told in the previous episode. He explains that he and other crew members were locked in with their captain, who was infected by the black oil. After being knocked <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> <b>the</b> black oil leaves the captain's body and exits via a grate into the sea. It is revealed that Bill Mulder and the Smoking Man {{are two of the}} agents who are interviewing the crewman.|$|E

5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 men was sent <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> third stone wall {{to see if}} the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave the order to retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E
5|$|The royalists {{under the}} command of Prince Mohamed's {{objective}} was to cut the Egyptians' line and force them to withdraw. They intended to take over the garrisons along this line and establish positions from which they could interdict the Egyptian movement. They had prepared the attack {{with the help of the}} Nahm tribe, who tricked the Egyptians into believing that they were their allies and would take care of the mountain pass known as Wadi Humaidat themselves. The royalist deal was that the Nahm would be entitled to loot the ambushed Egyptians. The Egyptians may have suspected something was up, as they sent a reconnaissance aircraft over the area a day before the attack. The royalists thus occupied two mountains known as Asfar and Ahmar and installed 75-mm guns and mortars overlooking the wadi. On April 15, the day after the last Egyptian convoy went through, the royalists launched a surprise attack. Both forces numbered at only a couple of thousands. The guns positioned on Asfar and Ahmar opened fire, and then the Nahm came <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> rocks. Finally, Prince Mohamed's troops followed. This time, the royalists' operation was fully coordinated by radio. Some of the Egyptians surrendered without resistance, others fled to Harah 800 yards to the north. Both sides brought reinforcements and the battle shifted between Harf and Hazm.|$|E
25|$|Upon the 5 a.m. sunrise, {{reportedly}} a train whistle {{was heard}} (Hirsch {{said it was}} a siren). Many believed this to be a signal for the rioters to launch an all-out assault on Greenwood. A white man stepped <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Frisco depot and was fatally shot by a sniper in Greenwood. Crowds of rioters poured from places of shelter, on foot and by car, into the streets of the black community. Five white men in a car led the charge, but were killed by a fusillade of gunfire before they had gone a block.|$|E

25|$|Boussart fought at the Battle of Eylau on 7 and 8 February 1807. Grouchy's 2,200-strong {{division}} {{joined in}} Murat's grand charge {{at a critical}} moment during the bloody contest. The dragoons first drove off the Russian cavalry menacing Louis Vincent Le Blond de Saint-Hilaire's infantry division. Then Murat led them in an attack that defeated the Russian cavalry in the center. By this time the 2nd Cuirassier Division had become isolated after carving a path through two lines of Russian infantry. Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessières now led the Guard cavalry to the rescue. After being rebuffed by the Russian second line, Grouchy's troopers joined the Horse Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard and smashed their way through. Finally, the French reserve cavalry had to cut its way <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Russian lines, losing between 1,000 and 1,500 troopers altogether.|$|E

500|$|Gillian Anderson's {{character}} Dana Scully {{would not}} be available, since the writing staff had decided before the episode was written that she would spend {{most of her time}} in the hospital. As the writing staff had a hard time coming up with a story, Spotnitz saw {{this as an opportunity to}} further evolve Doggett, the new character introduced at the beginning of the eighth season. In order to fill Anderson's void, two recurring groups of characters were brought in: Walter Skinner and The Lone Gunmen. Spotnitz noted that, [...] "we were eager to get Skinner <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> desk, and we were always looking for opportunities to get him out of that office and get him into the field." [...] Mitch Pileggi, who portrayed Walter Skinner, was pleased with the final product. He later complimented the work of Robert Patrick, who played Doggett, saying, [...] "It was a big hole when Mulder was gone, but I thought that Robert came in and did a wonderful job. He brought a really good energy to the set, and it was a lot of fun getting to know and work with him." [...] In addition, Spotnitz was also eager to use The Lone Gunmen in the episode, since this the episode would mark their first scene together with Doggett. [...] Robert Patrick called the episode his [...] "favorite episode," [...] because the writers saw a chance to really create a [...] "vulnerable" [...] moment for the his character, John Doggett.|$|E
50|$|The film opens as Sam Nicoletti (Robert De Niro) {{works in}} his office {{where he is a}} film editor (in the {{original}} movie Sam's Song he is working on a documentary about Nixon but here he is working on a porno film), little knowing there is an intruder.

5000|$|On each typical episode, {{a celebrity}} guest {{came on the}} show with a secret. The celebrity usually opened the episode by coming <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> curtain and saying [...] "my name is Name and I've Got a Secret!", though {{sometimes}} they would say [...] "and this is I've Got a Secret!". Early in the show's run, the celebrities would indeed have actual personal secrets similar to the other contestants. However, producer Allan Sherman later admitted that these celebrity [...] "secrets" [...] (such as Boris Karloff being afraid of mice) were frequently concocted by the show's staff, and the celebrities merely played along.|$|R

Rayner's accomplished playing soon became an crucial part of the group's sound (and also allowed Tim to step <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> keyboard) and he was the only member who remained with the band for its entire subsequent career. He was followed by Noel Crombie and Paul Crowther, while [...] Geoff Chunn and Rob Gillies departed.|$|E
25|$|After three {{floods in}} the 1960s, Waterloo and Cedar Falls spent years {{building}} levees and flood gates along the Cedar River {{and two of}} its tributaries. During the flood of 2008, water became trapped behind those levees and was kept from returning to the river.

2500|$|Whereas older {{instruments}} {{fitted with}} valve attachments usually had the tubing coiled rather tightly in the bell section (closed wrap [...] or traditional wrap), modern instruments usually have the tubing kept as free as possible of tight bends in the tubing (open wrap), {{resulting in a}} freer response with the valve attachment tubing engaged. While open-wrap tubing does offer a more open sound, the tubing sticks <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> bell and is more vulnerable to damage. For that reason, closed-wrap tubing remains more popular in trombones used in marching bands or other ensembles where the trombone may be more prone to damage.|$|E
2500|$|Del Toro got {{the idea}} of the faun from {{childhood}} experiences with [...] "lucid dreaming". He stated on The Charlie Rose Show that every midnight, he would wake up, and a faun would gradually step <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> grandfather's clock. Originally, the faun {{was supposed to be a}} classic half-man, half-goat faun fraught with beauty. But in the end, the faun was altered into a goat-faced creature almost completely made out of earth, moss, vines, and tree bark. He became a mysterious, semi-suspicious relic who gave both the impression of trustworthiness and many signs that warn someone to never confide in him at all.|$|E

[...] William Washington's cavalry came around from behind the opposite American left to hit the British on their right flank and rear. [...] Pickens' militia, having now re-formed, charged <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> hill—completing a 360-degree circle around the American position—to hit the 71st Highlander Scots on the British left flank and rear. [...] Howard ordered the Virginia militia, whose withdrawal had brought on the British ill-fated charge, to turn about and attack the Scots from the other direction.|$|E

2500|$|Unusual for a {{late night}} talk show, Late Night made {{frequent}} use of various costumed characters such as The Masturbating Bear, Robot on a Toilet, and Pimpbot5000. The humor in these sketches often derived from the crude construction of the characters' costumes {{as well as the}} absurdist nature of their conceptions. For example, Pimpbot5000 was a 1950s-style robot who dressed and acted in the manner of an exaggerated blaxploitation pimp, while The Masturbating Bear was a man in a bear costume wearing an oversized diaper who would inevitably begin to fondle himself to the tune of Aram Khachaturian's [...] "Sabre Dance" [...] when brought on stage. Many of these characters did little more in their appearances than walk across the stage or be wheeled <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> curtain, but some had extensive sketches on the show.|$|E

When Tiner was questioned about a change in his position to support navigation of the Red River and American aid to the Contras in Nicaragua, he said that the previous opposition to both proposals came from the Shreveport Journal editorial board, not himself: [...] "The Shreveport Journal is not running for Congress. ...
