50|$|Maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> {{potential}} can be metabolically {{costly for}} a cell {{because of its}} requirement for active pumping of ions to counteract losses due to leakage channels.

This elevated membrane potential allows the cells to respond very rapidly to visual inputs; the cost is that maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> potential may consume more than 20% of overall cellular ATP.|$|R

40|$|Measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> {{membrane}} potential <b>of</b> muscle fiber as <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> muscular action potential is expedient for analyzing <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> individual component of skeletal muscle fibers. Since Ling and Gerard (1949) devised the microelectrode method, {{it has been}} used mainly in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> fundamental medicine, but seldom in the clinical field. The author attempted to apply this method to the human skeletal muscle fibers to investigate their physiological and pathological conditions. By some improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> microelectrode technique for clinical application <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> {{membrane potential}}s <b>of</b> human skeletal muscle fibers were measured 2 ̆ 2 in situ 2 ̆ 2 and the following results were obtained. 1. <b>The</b> mean value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal cases was - 82. 4 ± 10. 8 mV. The potential was higher in the lower extremities than in the upper limbs. The age and <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> muscle caused {{no significant difference in the}} potentials. 2. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potentials <b>of</b> muscles <b>of</b> myogenic diseases. <b>The</b> mean value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potentials <b>of</b> muscles of progressive muscular dystrophies was abnormally as low as - 25. 5 ± 13. 6 mV., which seemed to be correlated to <b>the</b> progress <b>of</b> atrophy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscle fibers. The potentials and the muscle power showed parallelism. Lowering of intracellular potassium concentration and decrease of protein synthesizing ability were observed biochemically. Such a disturbance of metabolism was also assumed to be a cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low potentials. <b>The</b> mean value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potentials in disuse muscle atrophies was - 59. 1 ± 5. 7 mV., and decreased as <b>the</b> years <b>of</b> disease proceeded until <b>the</b> lowest value <b>of</b> - 50 mV. was reached, but not so far as in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> progressive muscular dystrophies which showed the abnormally low potentials. 3. Examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potentials <b>of</b> muscles <b>of</b> neurogenic diseases. <b>The</b> mean value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potentials <b>of</b> muscles in spinal injuries was - 34. 6 ± 7. 6 mV. in tibialis anterior muscles. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential showed a good correlation with <b>the</b> remainder <b>of</b> spinal reflex function, namely, with the H reflex irrespective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lapse <b>of</b> years and <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> spinal lesion. <b>The</b> mean value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potentials <b>of</b> peripheral nerve lesions was - 45. 6 ± 9. 3 mV. and there was a tendency that cases with good prognosis showed high potentials. <b>The</b> stages <b>of</b> muscle fiber atrophy in several kinds of muscle diseases could be differentiated according to <b>the</b> <b>resting</b> membrane potential values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tested muscle fiber. It was concluded that resting potential decreased in the following order: normal muscle, muscles of disuse atrphy, muscles of peripheral nerve lesions, muscles of spinal injury and muscles of progressive muscular distrophy...|$|R
