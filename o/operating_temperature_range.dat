5|$|In 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, {{research}} chemists in Heilmeier {{group at}} RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed {{only in the}} number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of Schiff base compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22–105°C. Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made. The team then proceeded to prepare numerous mixtures of nematic compounds many of which had much lower melting points. This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> eventually became the industry standard and is used to this very day to tailor materials to meet specific applications.|$|E

25|$|In tribology, liquids are {{studied for}} their {{properties}} as lubricants. Lubricants {{such as oil}} are chosen for viscosity and flow characteristics that are suitable throughout the <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> of the component. Oils are often used in engines, gear boxes, metalworking, and hydraulic systems for their good lubrication properties.|$|E
500|$|One {{advantage}} that mechanical filters have over LC electrical filters {{is that they}} can be made very stable. The resonance frequency can be made so stable that it varies only 1.5parts per billion (ppb) from the specified value over the <b>operating</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>range</b> (...) , and its average drift with time can be as low as 4ppb per day. This stability with temperature is another reason for using nickel-iron as the resonator material. Variations with temperature in the resonance frequency (and other features of the frequency function) are directly related to variations in the Young's modulus, which is a measure of stiffness of the material. [...] Materials are therefore sought that have a small temperature coefficient of Young's modulus. [...] In general, Young's modulus has a negative temperature coefficient (materials become less stiff with increasing temperature) but additions of small amounts of certain other elements in the alloy can produce a material with a temperature coefficient that changes sign from negative through zero to positive with temperature. Such a material will have a zero coefficient of temperature with resonance frequency around a particular temperature. It is possible to adjust the point of zero temperature coefficient to a desired position by heat treatment of the alloy.|$|E
