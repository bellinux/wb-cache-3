Also, to my alarm, it excited her philanthropic instincts, her great idea being to turn the hacienda into a convalescent smallpox hospital, of which she was to be the nurse and I the doctor. Indeed she refused to abandon this mad scheme until I pointed out that in the event of any <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients</b> dying, most probably we should both be murdered for wizards with the evil eye.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 15 -year-old woman with signs of hyperandrogenism {{affected}} by a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SLCT). In <b>our</b> <b>patient,</b> blood analysis showed a high testosterone (T) level (T: 8. 53 nmol/L; nv< 1. 87 nmol/L) while the GnRH-Analogue test demonstrated an exaggerated secretion of 17 -hydroxyprogesterone (OHP), T, and androstenedione (A) by the ovary after stimulation. We compared the GnRH-Analogue test <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> with that obtained in a group of normal and healthy women (no. 8 subjects, 16 - 26 years old), men (no. 4 subjects, 18 - 28 years old), and in a group of PCOS patients with age and body weight compared. We found in <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> a value <b>of</b> OHP, 17 -beta estradiol (E 2) and T, from 2 to 18 times higher than healthy women. When we compared <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> with healthy men, we differently observed a comparable response of T. The response <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> was also comparable with that observed in the PCOS group for E 2. During the post-surgical follow up, the GnRH-Analogue test <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> showed a response of OHP, T, and E 2 comparable with that of the PCOS group.

40|$|Introduction: Needle {{decompression}} of {{a tension}} pneumothorax {{can be a}} lifesaving procedure. It requires an adequate needle length to reach the chest wall to rapidly remove air. With adult obesity exceeding {{one third of the}} United States population in 2010, we sought to evaluate the proper catheter length that may result in a successful needle decompression procedure. Advance Trauma Life Support (ATLS) currently recommends a 51 millimeter (mm) needle, while the needles stocked in our emergency department are 46 mm. Given the obesity rates <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> population, we hypothesize these needles would not have a tolerable success rate of 90 %. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 91 patient records that had computed tomography of the chest and measured the chest wall depth at the second intercostal space bilaterally. Results: We found that 46 mm needles would only be successful in 52. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> population, yet the ATLS recommended length of 51 mm has a success rate of 64. 8 %. Therefore, using a 64 mm needle would be successful in 79 % percent <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>patient</b> population. Conclusion: Use of longer length needles for needle thoracostomy is essential given the extent of the nation’s adult obesity population. [West J Emerg Med. 2013; 14 (6) : 650 - 652. ...|$|R

50|$|Because {{psychosis}} may be precipitated or {{exacerbated by}} common classes of psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants, ADHD stimulant medications, and sleep medications, prescribed medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out, particularly for first-episode psychosis. This {{is an essential}} step to reduce diagnostic error and to evaluate potential medication sources of further patient harm. Regarding prescribed medication sources of patient harm, Yale School of Medicine Professor of Psychiatry Malcolm B. Bowers, Jr, MD wrote:Illicit drugs aren't the only ones that precipitate psychosis or mania—prescribed drugs can too, and in particular, some psychiatric drugs. We investigated this and found that about 1 in 12 psychotic or manic patients in an inpatient psychiatric facility are there due to antidepressant-induced psychosis or mania. That's unfortunate for the field psychiatry and disastrous for some <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|E
