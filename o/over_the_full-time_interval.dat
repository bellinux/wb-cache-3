5000|$|The level sets of the PRA are {{objective}} in two dimensions {{but not in}} three dimensions. An additional shortcoming of the polar rotation tensor is its dynamical inconsistency: polar rotations computed over adjacent sub-intervals of a total deformation do not sum up to the rotation computed for <b>the</b> <b>full-time</b> <b>interval</b> of <b>the</b> same deformation. [...] Therefore, while [...] is the closest rotation tensor to [...] in <b>the</b> [...] norm <b>over</b> a fixed time interval , these piecewise best fits do not form a family of rigid-body rotations as [...] and [...] are varied. For this reason, rotations predicted by the polar rotation tensor over varying time intervals divert from the experimentally observed mean material rotation of fluid elements.|$|R
