The degradation of these coatings when exposed to weathering is studied in this project and the influence it has on the <b>overcoatability.</b> Accelerated weathering {{has been used to}} expose coatings and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transformed Infrared) and pull-off adhesion measurements have been successfully used to study the primers and the following intercoat adhesion. Different variables have been investigated, being the chemical composition of the coating the most influent one. The intercoat adhesion has proved to decrease after short exposures to weathering and IR data have been used to assess the <b>overcoatability</b> of different formulations. The use of IR spectroscopy could be a very useful tool in the future of <b>overcoatability</b> testing if the results of this project are confirmed...|$|E
40|$|Five {{corrosion}} protective painls, {{including three}} used as on-rust ones, were tested for their anticorrosive effects at the outdoor exposure test yard of University of the Ryukyus, beginning on September 1, 1988. First, clean JIS SS 41 mild steel plates of 15 x 15 cm x 3. 2 mm each were exposed outdoor for 3 months,then they were removed {{of the resulting}} rust {{by means of a}} wire brush to retain slight rust. These specimens together with new plate specimens which were cleaned by grit blasting to retain no rust, were coated with the same protective paints. In addition, three kinds of uncoated steel sheets (JIS SS 41 mild steel, JIS SPCD cold rolled carbon steel and JIS SPA - H weathering steel), and two kinds of zinc coated steel plates (JIS SGCC hot dip zinc coated steel and zinc hot dip galvanized mild steel) were used as the specimens to obtain the atmospheric corrosion data. The results obtained by this outdoor exposure test are as follows. 1) After 6 month exposure, the three kinds of uncoated steel sheets showed equal corrosion rates of about 10 mg/dm^ 2 /day. Their corroded conditions were also equal to each other. The two kinds of zinc coated steel plates were increased in weight slightly due to oxidation of zinc. 2) Both the specimens coated with protective paints on their surfaces with slight rust and with no rust, respectively, showed no fault and no difference in their appearance. All paints coated on the surfaces with no rust showed good adhesive strength, and onc on-rust paints showed poor adhesive strength. 3) The results of cross cut test were nearly the same as those of pull off test, except when the <b>overcoatability</b> between the undercoat and the top coat was poor. 4) The impact strength of the coated paints in the initial stage was poorer than that after exposure. The longer the exposure period, the more improved this strength...|$|E
