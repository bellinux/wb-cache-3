5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side,</b> among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and ground control during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|The southwestern {{corner of}} Gyeongju, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the Taebaek range, drains into the Geumho River, which then {{flows into the}} Nakdong.

5|$|United {{responded to}} the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was {{deflected}} to Ronaldo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the goal, but it was deemed to have crossed the goal line first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the goal line, he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.|$|E

5|$|Zethus Crater is {{the largest}} (diameter about 40km) crater on and the only named surface feature of Jupiter's moon Thebe. There are several bright spots at the rim of this crater. It is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of Thebe, facing away from Jupiter. It was {{discovered}} by the Galileo spacecraft. It is named for Zethus, the husband of the nymph Thebe in Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. It is relatively nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed {{in the construction of}} mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E
5|$|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly is a hotspot (volcanic complex) on the Moon. It is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the Moon and {{was found}} by a gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} in 1998. It {{is an area of}} concentrated thorium, a radioactive element. Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago, but could have been as recent as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's far side.|$|E

5|$|The New Zealand Division {{continued}} to advance, with the 2nd Brigade capturing Haplincourt on 3 September following a failed attempt the previous day. It moved onto the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line, including Trescault Spur, which overlooked the German positions. In conjunction with 37th Division and {{elements of the}} 38th Division, the New Zealanders attacked the spur on 12 September. The crest of the spur was captured, although not the trench system <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side.</b> During this action, Sergeant Harry Laurent earned the VC for his exploits in leading a patrol that captured a company of Germans.|$|E
5|$|The long, sandy Watergate Bay {{leads to}} St Columb Porth and Newquay. A rail link with through trains to London and the North of England on summer {{weekends}} {{has helped the}} town prosper as a seaside resort popular with surfers and clubbers. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the town, beyond Fistral Beach, lies the River Gannel. There are seasonal ferries to Crantock and a footbridge which is passable at low tide, otherwise there is a detour inland to use the road bridge.|$|E
5|$|With Norfolk and its navy yard in Portsmouth, the Confederacy {{controlled}} the southern side of Hampton Roads. To prevent Union warships from attacking the yard, the Confederates set up batteries at Sewell's Point and Craney Island, at the juncture of the Elizabeth River with the James. (See map.) The Union retained possession of Fort Monroe, at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula. They also held a small man-made island {{known as the}} Rip Raps, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the channel opposite Fort Monroe, and on this island they completed another fort, named Fort Wool. With Fort Monroe went control of the lower Peninsula as far as Newport News.|$|E

5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{before the start of the}} {{services}} to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge. Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.|$|E
5|$|In 1689, William III {{moved his}} {{residence}} to Kensington Palace <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of Hyde Park {{and had a}} drive laid out across its southern edge which {{was known as the}} King's Private Road. The drive is still in existence as a wide straight gravelled carriage track leading west from Hyde Park Corner across the southern boundary of Hyde Park towards Kensington Palace and now known as Rotten Row, possibly a corruption of rotteran (to muster), Ratten Row (roundabout way), Route du roi, or rotten (the soft material with which the road is covered). It {{is believed to be the}} first road in London to be lit at night, which was done to deter highwaymen. In 1749, Horace Walpole was robbed while travelling through the park from Holland House. The row was used by the wealthy for horseback rides in the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Szilard {{published}} a book of short stories, The Voice of the Dolphins (1961), in which he dealt with the moral and ethical {{issues raised by the}} Cold War and his own {{role in the development of}} atomic weapons. The title story described an international biology research laboratory in Central Europe. This became reality after a meeting in 1962 with Victor F. Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew. When the European Molecular Biology Laboratory was established, the library was named The Szilard Library and the library stamp features dolphins. Other honors that he received included the Atoms for Peace Award in 1959, and the Humanist of the Year in 1960. A lunar crater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the Moon was named after him in 1970. The Leo Szilard Lectureship Award, established in 1974, is given in his honor by the American Physical Society.|$|E

5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E
5|$|The first clash {{occurred}} at Awala on 23 July, when a platoon from 'B' Company, {{under the command}} of Captain Sam Templeton, having destroyed the footbridge over the Kumusi River, engaged the Japanese <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the river. The Australians were forced to withdraw, however, when hundreds of Japanese marines began crossing the river under a barrage of mortar and machine gun fire. They withdrew only a few miles, before Templeton set up a successful ambush for the advancing Japanese {{on the banks of the}} Gorari Creek. Nevertheless, they were forced back further towards the high ground at Oivi where they attempted to make a stand while Templeton tried to make contact with battalion headquarters and the rest of the battalion who were spread out further along the track, in order to get more reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>side</b> of the island. Finishing the game unlocks one {{of more than a dozen}} game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E
