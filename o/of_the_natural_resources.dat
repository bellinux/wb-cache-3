One salient feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model is that consumers are concerned with <b>the</b> stock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> in that consumers’ demand for harvest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> depends upon <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource.</b> We also examine <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> taxation on equilibrium.

25|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> in the Salween basin {{remained}} unexploited {{until the}} twentieth century as well. Prior to extensive logging activity in the upper watershed, the Salween's flow varied much less between the rainy and dry seasons, allowing for fertile riverbanks fed by soil deposits from the river. With the clear-cutting of the forests during the 20th century, specifically in 1997, soil began to erode away in great amounts {{and was unable to}} hold water, thus lowering the river's baseflow during the dry season and causing floods of greater size during the monsoon. The erosion has also made the Salween very silty. The construction of logging roads made it even easier for Burmese interests to enter the area, exploiting other resources and severely damaging the native way of life. Although strict limitations have been imposed on logging, illegal practices continue, including one in 2009 involving the discovery of teak logs floating in the river on the Thailand-Burma border.|$|E

25|$|Proto-Elamite civilization grew up {{east of the}} Tigris and Euphrates {{alluvial}} plains; it was {{a combination}} of the lowlands and the immediate highland areas to the north and east. At least three proto-Elamite states merged to form Elam: Anshan (modern Khuzestan Province), Awan (modern Lorestan Province) and Shimashki (modern Kerman). References to Awan are generally older than those to Anshan, and some scholars suggest that both states encompassed the same territory, in different eras (see Hanson, Encyclopædia Iranica). To this core Shushiana (modern Khuzestan) was periodically annexed and broken off. In addition, some Proto-Elamite sites are found well outside this area, spread out on the Iranian plateau; such as Warakshe, Sialk (now a suburb of the modern city of Kashan) and Jiroft in Kerman Province. The state of Elam was formed from these lesser states as a response to invasion from Sumer during the Old Elamite period. Elamite strength was based on an ability to hold these various areas together under a coordinated government that permitted the maximum interchange <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> unique to each region. Traditionally, this was done through a federated governmental structure.|$|E
500|$|In June 1952, two lecturers in {{veterinary}} {{science at}} the University of Sydney, Doug Blood and Jim Steel, {{wrote a letter to}} the Australian Veterinary Journal complaining of their university's placement of animal husbandry as a subordinate topic within veterinary science. [...] They argued that the field of animal husbandry included [...] "the procurement of maximum production from the available animals, compatible with their continued health and the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> of the land on which they live" [...] and was worthy of its own profession. [...] McClymont saw the letter and responded with his own missive to the journal in June 1953. [...] In his letter, McClymont opined that the field in question should instead be called [...] "animal production" [...] and that it should, [...] "be defined as the integration of animal husbandry and agronomy (the science of pasture and crop production), or in more general terms, manipulation of the soil-plant-animal complex, for the purpose of economic production of animal products." [...] He added that the university-level training in the field should include, [...] "extension work, research, and commercial applications." [...] McClymont concluded that university graduates in such a field of study would be prepared to blend veterinary (animal) and agricultural (plant) production sciences to optimize farm animal output.|$|E
