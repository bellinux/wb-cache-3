On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a drastic reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E

5|$|North American red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, {{but they are still}} inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.|$|E
5|$|Over time, some {{attributes}} now {{regarded as}} integral became {{incorporated into the}} vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared {{over the course of}} the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature.

50|$|Duration is {{a linear}} measure <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a bond changes in {{response}} to interest rate changes.

Convexity is a measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curvature <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a bond changes as the interest rate changes. Specifically, duration can be formulated as <b>the</b> first derivative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bond {{with respect to the}} interest rate in question, and the convexity as the second derivative.|$|R
