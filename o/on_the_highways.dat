5|$|As {{part of its}} {{maintenance}} duties, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{tracks the}} volume of traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> it maintains. This number is {{expressed in terms of}} annual average daily traffic (AADT), a calculation of the average traffic for a segment of roadway on any average day of the year. In 2009, the department measured a peak of 19,719vehicles daily on the stretch north of Tittabawasee Road. The section south of the US10 interchange had the lowest traffic level at 9,315vehicles AADT. Additionally, entire route of M-47 has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

The lowest-paid man working on the sewers was informed he would need to move within the district and take a pay cut from £1:6s to £1:3s or be made redundant. He accepted.|$|E

5000|$|Traffic grew <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> {{because of}} <b>the</b> {{geography}} through which it passed. Much of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> was essentially flat and this made <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> a popular truck route. The Dust Bowl of the 1930s saw many farming families, mainly from Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Texas, heading west for agricultural jobs in California. US 66 became {{the main road}} of travel for these people, often derogatorily called [...] "Okies" [...] or [...] "Arkies." [...] And during the Depression, it gave some relief to communities located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> <b>The</b> route passed through numerous small towns and, with <b>the</b> growing traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> helped create <b>the</b> rise of mom-and-pop businesses, such as service stations, restaurants, and motor courts, all readily accessible to passing motorists.|$|R

After small investments were made the tram to Jar was extended to Bekkestua on 20 August 2007. The unidirectional SL79 trams had to run to Avløs to turn around, although they did not operate revenue services on the last leg, while SL95 trams turned at Bekkestua. The last day with a tram service was 15 February, after which the tram service was cut at Lilleaker.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays, as {{in other}} western Canadian cities, the old {{warehouses}} have long since outlived their utility as the railways {{have given way to}} the trucking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> as the preferred mode of commercial transport: in western Canada, as elsewhere, shipping by rail was supplanted by highway trucking once the Trans-Canada highway was extended from Ontario to the West and transport from eastern to western Canada no longer needed to dip into the United States below the Great Lakes. The old warehouses, however, have survived long enough that their destruction is not a foregone conclusion: they are, in Regina {{as in other}} North American cities, being turned into residential condominiums, tony restaurants and shopping precincts. However, at one time the warehouse district (together with the grain elevators adjacent to the CPR line) was Regina’s tenuous commercial raison d’être.|$|E

2500|$|While {{millions}} {{of tons of}} elemental hydrogen are distributed around the world each year in various ways, bringing hydrogen to individual consumers would require an evolution of the fuel infrastructure. [...] For example, according to GM, 70% of the U.S. population lives near a hydrogen-generating facility but has little public access to that hydrogen. [...] The same study however, shows that building the infrastructure in a systematic way is much more doable and affordable than most people think. For example, one article has noted that hydrogen stations could be put within every 10 miles in metro Los Angeles, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> between LA and neighboring cities like Palm Springs, Las Vegas, San Diego and Santa Barbara, for the cost of a Starbuck's latte for every one of the 15 million residents living in these areas.|$|E

The six rivers which flow through the reserve are the Tomellín, Chiquito, Las Vueltas, Salado, Zapotitán and Río Grande of the Papaloapan watershed, which finally flow into the Gulf of Mexico. On account of wide variation in topography and annual rainfall, the micro-climatic conditions in the reserve has created a biosphere reserve, which is very rich in flora and fauna. The rich biodiversity of the preserve consists of 910 plant genus, 2,700 vascular species, 102 species of mammals, 356 species of birds which includes the endangered Green Macaw (Ara militaris), and 53 species of reptiles. However, the reserve is faced with threats from poaching, deforestation, overgrazing, and trash scattered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> and secondary roads that pass close and through the reserve. Inadequate patrolling staff is an issue which needs to be addressed to remove the threats to the biosphere reserve.|$|E

[...] As they drive east on Route 66 from Needles, California, they pick up the Girl (Bird), a female hitchhiker, in Flagstaff, Arizona when she gets into their car at a diner. Although the Driver develops a crush on the Girl, she sleeps with the Mechanic when the Driver goes out drinking one night. In New Mexico, they begin to encounter another car driver, GTO (Oates), <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways.</b> An atmosphere of hostility develops between the two parties. Although GTO is not an overt street racer, and, in fact, seems to know little about cars, a cross-country race to Washington, D.C. is suggested. The Driver proposes that the prize should be [...] "for pinks," [...] or legal ownership of the loser's car. Along the way, GTO picks up various hitchhikers, including an importuning homosexual hitchhiker (Harry Dean Stanton). When GTO's inexperience becomes apparent, he, the Driver and the Mechanic form an uneasy alliance; the Driver even drives with him for a while when GTO gets fatigued.|$|E
