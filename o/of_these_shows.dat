5|$|Following {{the release}} of their second album, Led Zeppelin {{completed}} several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows</b> have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was {{during this period of}} intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.|$|E
5|$|Between September 2 and September 17, the Breeders {{performed}} in eleven cities, among which were St. Louis, Denver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Las Vegas. Support groups the Funs and the Neptunas opened {{for them at}} five and six <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows,</b> respectively. The band then played at the Hollywood Bowl concert, and wrapped up the tour on September 20 at the Goose Island 312 Urban Block Dance Party event in Chicago. In addition to their new songs, they performed numerous selections from Last Splash and Pod (1990). The tour received good reviews from critics; appraisal included comments that the performances were rousing, and that the band was as good as—or better than—in its heyday.|$|E
5|$|Tracy finally {{achieved}} {{some success}} by joining {{forces with the}} notable stock manager William H. Wright {{in the spring of}} 1924. A stage partnership was formed with the young actress Selena Royle, who had already made her name on Broadway. It proved a popular draw and their productions were favorably received. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows</b> brought Tracy to the attention of a Broadway producer, who offered him the lead in a new play. The Sheepman previewed in October 1925, but it received poor reviews and closed after its trial run in Connecticut. Dejected, Tracy was forced back to Wright and the stock circuit.|$|E

5|$|RAF Duxford, a Royal Air Force fighter station {{had been}} {{declared}} surplus to requirements by the Ministry of Defence in 1969, {{and the museum}} duly requested permission to use {{part of one of}} the airfield's hangars as temporary storage. Duxford featured three double bay hangars of First World War vintage, which together provided over 9000m2 of space. Within two years, ten of the museum's aircraft had been brought to Duxford, and were being restored by volunteers of the East Anglia Aviation Society. While the museum's own aircraft were not restored to flying condition, by cooperating with private groups the museum was able to mount its first airshow in 1973. Further air shows followed, with a display in June 1976 attracting an audience of 45,000 people. The runway was bought by Cambridgeshire County Council in 1977. The success <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows</b> provided a valuable source of revenue, and complemented the efforts of volunteers, so that the museum applied for the permanent transfer of the entire site to its use. Permission was received in February 1976 and Duxford became the first outstation of the Imperial War Museum. Initially open from March–October, Duxford received 167,000 visitors in the 1977 season, and 340,000 in 1978. Two million visitors had been received by 1982 and Duxford welcomed its ten millionth visitor in August 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows</b> developed them using {{a variant}} on the CTW model, a flexible model of production {{based upon the}} experiences of the creators and producers of the U.S. show. The model consisted of the combination of producers and researchers working together on the show, the development of a unique curriculum, and extensive test screening of the shows. The shows came to be called co-productions, and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Different co-productions were produced, depending upon each country's needs and resources. They included both dubbed versions of the American show and versions created, developed, and produced in each country that reflected their needs, educational priorities, and culture. For example, the first HIV-positive Muppet, Kami, from the South African co-production Takalani Sesame, was created in 2003 to address the epidemic of AIDS in South Africa, and was met with controversy in the U.S.. By 2006, there were 20co-productions in countries all over the world. In 2001, there were more than 120million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street, and by the US show's 40thanniversary in 2009, they were seen in more than 140countries.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{longevity}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows,</b> {{it is not}} uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of Mike Karr on The Edge of Night was played by three different actors.|$|E

25|$|Pinchon would {{participate}} in two more exhibitions {{during the first}} half of 1914. A catalogue was printed for one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows,</b> entitled L'École de Rouen, ses peintres et ses ferronniers.

40|$|Two {{patients}} {{are presented with}} a head-bobblng "tic" classically associated with a suprasellar cyst. The first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>showed</b> hypothalamic, neuroendocrinological and limbic abnormalities not previously described, although with a classic arachnoidal suprasellar cyst. The second <b>of</b> <b>these</b> patients <b>showed</b> head-bobbling behaviour during {{the first years of}} life as a manifestation of one out of many episodes of ventricular shunt obstruction. This case is therefore the first reported whose head bobbling was observed with an acute lesion...|$|R

25|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1990s and early 2000s, MTV placed a {{stronger}} focus on reality shows and related series, building on the success of The Real World and Road Rules. The first round <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows</b> came in the mid-1990s, with game shows such as Singled Out, reality-based comedy shows such as Buzzkill, and late-night talk shows such as The Jon Stewart Show and Loveline.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{the band}} played two triumphant shows in New York City and Baltimore. The New York show was filmed for the {{documentary}} Last Days Here.

25|$|In Melbourne, Australia the Show Times {{came out}} of the strong theater culture of the area. These are smaller then the local Gang Show {{originally}} pulling form a single district to produce a show. Currently there are 4 <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows</b> Whitehorse Showtime, South Metro Showtime, CamberwellShowtime and Strzelecki Showtime. Because these showtimes are not Gangshows {{they do not have the}} red scarf instead choosing a different color such as Strzelecki Showtime's gold Scarf.|$|E

25|$|The {{next round}} <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows</b> came in {{approximately}} the late 1990s, as MTV shifted its focus to prank/comedic {{shows such as}} The Tom Green Show and Jackass, and game shows such as The Challenge (aka Real World/Road Rules Challenge), The Blame Game, webRIOT, and Say What? Karaoke. A year later, in 2000, MTV's Fear {{became one of the}} first scare-based reality shows and the first reality show in which contestants filmed themselves.|$|E
25|$|Gervais later {{toured the}} UK in 2003 with his {{stand-up}} show Animals. The Politics tour followed a year later.

25|$|The {{types of}} {{performances}} staged were {{typical of the}} vaudeville era, including all manner of singers, dancers and musicians, ethnic comedians, magicians, minstrel shows, hypnotists, Asian acrobats and live animal acts ranging from dogs to seals to lions.

Fields and the Marx Brothers performed on the Majestic stage, but there is no evidence <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>shows</b> in newspapers during the six years the theater featured live vaudeville, although their appearances have been confirmed at other Madison theaters.|$|E
