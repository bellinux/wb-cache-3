25|$|In 2010, the non-teaching staff {{organised}} {{a strike}} against the management (headed by then trustee of Parshvanath Charitable Trust – Mr. Tekchand Shah) for non-payment of their salaries. Due to the strike, classes were not held for several days. At the same time, the political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's local branch also held a movement on college campus against then vice-principal and applied chemistry lecturer Mr. S. D. Shah for alleged harassment of some female {{students and staff}} members. The students also protested against {{certain aspects of the}} college that made student life difficult. For example: absence of basic facilities like ceiling fans in classrooms, canteen for the college, etc.; certain college rules like students not being allowed to wear T-shirts (and punishments like college IDs being confiscated, fines of Rs 100 or more being imposed on students not obeying these rules, or found loitering <b>outside</b> <b>class</b> during lecture/practical hours). The events led to the arrest (and later release on bail) of Mr. S. D. Shah, change of the PCT trustee from Mr. Teckchand Shah to Mr. Ashok Bhai Shah, and change of the college principal from Dr. Ram Reddy to Dr. Uttam D. Kolekar. In the transition process, the college was managed by the state government of Maharashtra. Mr. S. D. Shah has not been working in the college since his arrest.|$|E
500|$|The {{fossil record}} {{indicates}} that birds evolved from feathered ancestors within the theropod group, which are traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs, though a 2017 paper has {{put them in}} a proposed clade Ornithoscelida, along with the Ornithischia. True birds first appeared during the Cretaceous period, around 120 million years ago. DNA-based evidence finds that birds diversified dramatically {{around the time of the}} Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which killed off the pterosaurs and all the non-avian dinosaur lineages. Birds, especially those in the southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while diversifying during periods of global cooling. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie <b>outside</b> <b>class</b> Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago. Many of these early [...] "stem-birds", such as Archaeopteryx, were not yet capable of fully powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in place of beaks, and long bony tails.|$|E

60|$|And it was then, just then, {{that there}} arose in Rome that unpremeditated change in its form of {{government}} {{which resulted in the}} self-assumed dictatorship of Cæsar, and the usurpation of the Empire by Augustus. The old Rome had had kings. Then the name and the power became odious--the name to all the citizens, no doubt, but the power simply to the nobility, who grudged the supremacy of one man. The kings were abolished, and an oligarchy was established under the name of a Republic, with its annual magistrates--at first its two Consuls, then its Prætors and others, and occasionally a Dictator, as some current event demanded a concentration of temporary power in a single hand for a certain purpose. The Republic was no republic, as we understand the word; nor did it ever become so, though their was always going on a perpetual struggle to transfer the power from the nobles to the people, in which something was always being given or pretended to be given to the <b>outside</b> <b>class.</b> But so little was as yet understood of liberty that, as each plebeian made his way up into high place and became one of the magistrates of the State, he became also one of the oligarchical faction. There was a continued contest, {{with a certain amount of}} good faith on each side, on behalf of the so-called Republic--but still a contest for power. This became so continued that a foreign war was at times regarded as a blessing, because it concentrated the energies of the State, which had been split and used by the two sections--by each against the other. It is probably the case that the invasion of the Gauls in earlier days, and, later on, the second Punic war, threatening as they were in their incidents to the power of Rome, provided the Republic with that vitality which kept it so long in existence. Then came Marius, dominant on one side as a tribune of the people, and Sylla, as aristocrat on the other, and the civil wars between them, in which, as one prevailed or the other, Rome was mastered. How Marius died, and Sylla reigned for three bloody, fatal years, is outside the scope of our purpose--except in this, that Cicero saw Sylla's proscriptions, and made his first essay into public life hot with anger at the Dictator's tyranny.|$|E

40|$|Hampel, RobertResearch {{has shown}} that {{undergraduate}} students benefit from participating in peer study meetings in which they voluntarily work together on academic material <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> time. Such productive peer interactions can help students persist in college to the completion of their undergraduate degrees (academic achievement), and develop transferable skills that are essential for success in life after college (professional development). These ways of supporting students align with the main goals of the NUCLEUS program. Therefore, providing better support for NUCLEUS {{students to participate in}} productive <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> peer study meetings is one way NUCLEUS staff can foster the mission of the NUCLEUS program. The NUCLEUS program is an undergraduate academic support program in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Delaware. Historically, NUCLEUS staff have encouraged students to work on course material with classmates <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> time and class requirements. However, a survey of NUCLEUS students’ engagement in voluntary peer study meetings <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> time has never been carried out. This Executive Position Paper describes the findings of a descriptive study that used mixed methods to investigate the extent to which NUCLEUS students were involved in <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> peer study meetings during the fall 2012 semester. Furthermore, to ascertain how NUCLEUS staff can better support NUCLEUS students’ participation in productive, <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> peer study meetings (the organizational improvement goal of this Executive Position Paper), the study explored the factors that helped and hindered student participation in peer study meetings as well as the factors that helped and hindered productivity in peer study meetings. Implications from these findings, in addition to NUCLEUS students’ suggestions, informed the implementation of several program activities to better support NUCLEUS students’ participation in productive peer study meetings. Additionally, further recommendations for the NUCLEUS program and recommendations for ways the university may better support all students’ participation in <b>outside</b> of <b>class</b> peer study activities are described.

40|$|Abstract- An “inverted {{classroom}} ” is {{a teaching}} environment that mixes {{the use of}} technology with hands-on activities. In an inverted classroom, typical in-class lecture time is replaced with laboratory and in-class activities. <b>Outside</b> of <b>class,</b> lectures are delivered over some other medium such as video on-demand. As such, learning activities, which typically are done <b>outside</b> of <b>class,</b> are done in-class {{in the presence of the}} instructor. Passive activities, such as listening to lectures, are performed <b>outside</b> of <b>class.</b> In this paper, we describe the use of podcasting in an inverted classroom environment with the explicit goal of reclaiming lecture time for in-class laboratories and learning activities.
