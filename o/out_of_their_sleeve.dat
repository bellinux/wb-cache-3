50|$|In early April, Toubin {{attempted}} to DJ again between music sets a Portland club {{and found himself}} struggling with his ability to slide records <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> and with his hearing loss as his hearing aids reduced his ability to mix records. However, as he practiced, he found himself able to mix by focusing on his right ear. He soon found himself back to full capacity and quickly went on to gigs such as opening for Jack White at Webster Hall and in his residency at Home Sweet Home in NYC.|$|R
60|$|I do not, however, advise visiting {{it above}} {{any other place}} in Rome. What I always say is, take your chances with any or every time or place; you cannot fail of some {{impression}} which you will always like recurring to as characteristically delightful. For instance, I once walked home from the Piazza di Spagna with some carnival masks frolicking about me through the sun-shotten golden dust of the delicious evening air, and I had a pleasure from the experience which I shall never forget. It was as rich as that I got from the rosy twilight in which I wandered homeward another time from the Piazza di Venezia and found myself passing the Fountain of Trevi, and lingered long there and would not throw my penny into its waters because I knew I could not help coming back to Rome anyhow. Yet another time I was driving through a certain piazza where the peasants stand night long waiting to be hired by the proprietors who come to find them there, and suddenly the piety of the Middle Ages stood before me in {{the figure of the}} Brotherhood of the Misericordia, draped to the foot and hooded in their gray, unbleached linen. The brothers were ranged in a file at the doors of the church ready to visit the house of sickness or of mourning, barefooted, with their eyes showing spectrally through their masks and their hands coming soft and white <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves</b> and betraying the lily class that neither toils nor spins and yet is bound, as in the past, to the poorest and humblest through the only Church that knows how to unite them in the offering and acceptance of reciprocal religious duties.|$|R

2500|$|From 1945 onwards {{numbered}} shirts slowly {{came into}} use throughout Scotland, before becoming compulsory in 1960. [...] By this time Celtic {{were the last}} club in Britain to adopt the use of numbers on the team strip to identify players. [...] The traditionalist and idealistic Celtic chairman, Robert Kelly, baulked {{at the prospect of}} the famous green and white hoops being disfigured, and as such Celtic wore their numbers on the players shorts. This unusual tradition survived until 1994, although numbered shirts were worn in European competition from 1975 onwards. [...] Celtic's tradition of wearing numbers on their shorts rather than on the back <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shirts was brought to an end when the Scottish Football League instructed Celtic to wear numbers on their shirts {{from the start of the}} 1994â€“95 season. Celtic responded by adding numbers to the top <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>sleeves,</b> however within a few weeks the football authorities ordered the club to attach them to the back <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shirts, where they appeared on a large white patch, breaking up the green and white hoops.|$|R
