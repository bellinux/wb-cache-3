5000|$|In {{keeping with}} Westergaard's {{characteristic}} [...] "concern with fundamental methodological questions" [...] (Peles 1997, p. 75), ITT {{begins with a}} discussion of what it is that a theory of tonal music consists of. The conclusion reached {{is that it is a}} [...] "logical framework in terms of which we understand tonal music" [...] (ITT, p. 9)--the <b>operative</b> <b>words</b> being [...] "we understand". Westergaard is thus seeking a theory about a certain kind of cognition, as opposed to one dealing with acoustics or neurophysiology. The argument he gives for defining the domain of inquiry in this way is essentially the following: on the one hand, the acoustics of music are already well understood, and in any case acoustical theories are of limited use in addressing the psychological aspects of the musical experience; on the other hand, while neuroscience may eventually be capable of addressing these latter aspects, it is not currently equipped to do so—a situation which is unlikely to change in the near future. Consequently, our best strategy is to address the psychological questions directly, more or less at the level of introspection (ITT, pp. 3-7).|$|R

40|$|The works {{referred}} to above indicate the usefulness of viewing an N-particle system from a higher-dimensional perspective. In doing so, one should attempt {{to strike a balance}} between conceptual clarity and computational efficiency, which mitigates against considering calculations in 3 n-dimensional space except for rather small values of n. It appears that such a procedure may be profitably employed if a system of N particles were to be considered as consisting of a collection of units or sets, (I{sub k}), each containing n{sub k} particles so that {Sigma}{sub k} n{sub k} = N. The resulting problem associated with these sets of particles that interact with one another is obviously formally identical to the original one. However, it possesses the formal advantage of allowing, in principle, the systematic approach to an exact solution by treating the entire system as a single unit. The <b>operative</b> <b>words</b> here are in principle, as practical applications do not seem to be possible but for the smallest number of particles in a unit, say n = 2 or n = 3. However, in such an implementation, the interparticle correlation is treated directly and explicitly within a unit, resulting in a more accurate treatment of the system the larger the number of particle in a unit...|$|R
40|$|The {{wonderful}} {{thing about being}} in Mr. Burns, was that I {{was able to see}} my growth {{in a wide variety of}} performance aspects from the naturalistic contemporary dialogue or the first two acts, to the shamelessly entertaining clothes-shedding dance numbers in act two, to the comedia-esque physical characterization of the final act. In my final year I am starting to settle into characters more and not push. I feel I am acting to get something from the other performers onstage rather than act what I think the character feels or looks like in that moment. Both with Coleen in Burns and Anna in Golden Boy I feel, in my third year, I have truly found spontaneity and real "liveness" on stage by making it about others rather than the self. In playing Mr. Burns, I also found spontaneity in my relationship to the audience, which I learned from clowning. I also applied techniques from our mask pieces to specify the physicality of Burns and to use my head movements in order to communicate thought changes rather than my face. Vocally, Burns strange voice and long pieces of text required sharp diction and classical text techniques such as sustaining and <b>operative</b> <b>words</b> to get the rather strange ideas to the audience. Most importantly my training has given me the confidence to really find new exciting moments every time I go onstage because I respond to reality of the present, rather than my own ideas of what the moment should or should not be...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} {{foundations of}} a variety of emerging technologies [...] - ranging from the applications of quantum entanglement in quantum information to the applications of nonequilibrium bulk and interface phenomena in microfluidics, biology, materials science, energy engineering, etc. [...] - require understanding thermodynamic entropy beyond the equilibrium realm of its traditional definition. This paper presents a rigorous logical scheme that provides a generalized definition of entropy free of the usual unnecessary assumptions which constrain the theory to the equilibrium domain. The scheme is based on carefully <b>worded</b> <b>operative</b> definitions for all the fundamental concepts employed, including those of system, property, state, isolated system, environment, process, separable system, system uncorrelated from its environment, and parameters of a system. The treatment considers also systems with movable internal walls and/or semipermeable walls, with chemical reactions and/or external force fields, and with small numbers of particles. The definition of reversible process is revised by introducing the new concept of scenario. The definition of entropy involves neither the concept of heat nor that of quasistatic process; it applies to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium states. The role of correlations on the domain of definition and on the additivity of energy and entropy is discussed: it is proved that energy is defined and additive for all separable systems, while entropy is defined and additive only for separable systems uncorrelated from their environment; decorrelation entropy is defined. The definitions of energy and entropy are extended rigorously to open systems. Finally, to complete the discussion, the existence of the fundamental relation for stable equilibrium states is proved, in our context, for both closed and open systems.
