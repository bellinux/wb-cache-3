5|$|Thought {{process in}} the MSE refers to the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b> Thought process cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> is a global reduction in the quantity <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment <b>of</b> <b>thought,</b> or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on desire to smoke. However, previous research has examined suppression <b>of</b> general smoking <b>thoughts</b> rather than thoughts specifically related to desire to smoke. The present study investigated whether suppression <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke results in subsequently elevated ratings of desire to smoke. An experimental study examined the effects <b>of</b> suppressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke, versus expressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke, versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of desire to smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects <b>of</b> suppressing <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke on subsequent reports <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke were examined. Suppressing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke). However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of desire to smoke. Suppressing the <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> desire to smoke does not elevate subsequent ratings of this desire. Increased cigarette consumption following suppression <b>of</b> smoking <b>thoughts</b> may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased desire to smoke...|$|R

40|$|In 1995 the Obsessive Compulsive Cognitions Working Group {{initiated}} a collective process to develop two measures of cognition relevant to current cognitive-behavioural models of OCD. An earlier report (Behav. Res. Therapy, 35 (1997) 667) describes the original process of defining relevant domains. This {{article describes the}} subsequent steps of the development and validation process: item generation, scale reduction, and initial examination of reliability and validity. Two scales were developed. The Obsessive Beliefs Questionnaire consists of 87 items representing dysfunctional assumptions covering six domains: overestimation of threat, tolerance of uncertainty, importance <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> responsibility, and perfectionism. The Interpretation of Intrusions Inventory consists of 31 items that refer to interpretations of intrusions that have occurred recently. Three of the above domains are represented: importance <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> and responsibility. The item reduction and validation analyses were conducted on clinical and non-clinical samples from multiple sites. Initial examination of reliability and validity indicates excellent internal consistency and stability and encouraging evidence of validity. However, high correlations indicating overlap between some of the scales, particularly importance <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> and responsibility {{will need to be}} addressed in subsequent empirical and theoretical investigation...|$|R

40|$|Fifty-four {{individuals}} {{with a high degree}} of religiosity, 47 with a medium degree of religiosity and 64 with low religiosity completed anonymously the Italian versions of well-established measures of obsessive-compulsive (OC) cognitions and symptoms, depression and anxiety. After controlling for anxiety and depression, religious groups scored higher than {{individuals with}} a low degree of religiosity on measures of obsessionality, overimportance <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts,</b> perfectionism and responsibility. Moreover, measures <b>of</b> control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> and overimportance <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> were associated with OC symptoms only in religious subjects. It is concluded that religion might play a role in obsessive-compulsive disorder phenomenology. Additional research is warranted because it is plausible that only a few aspects of religious teachings (e. g., inflexibility and prohibition) are linked to OC phenomena...|$|R
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental representations. He maintains that these representations {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> (LOT) in the mind. Furthermore, this language <b>of</b> <b>thought</b> itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool. Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language <b>of</b> <b>thought.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{belief that}} we can control our {{thoughts}} is not inevitably adaptive, particularly when it fuels mental control activities that have ironic unintended consequences. The conviction that the mind {{can and should be}} controlled can prompt people to suppress unwanted thoughts, and so can {{set the stage for the}} intrusive return <b>of</b> those very <b>thoughts.</b> An important question is whether or not these beliefs about the control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> can be reduced experimentally. One possibility is that behavioral experiments aimed at revealing the ironic return <b>of</b> suppressed <b>thoughts</b> might create a lesson that could reduce unrealistic beliefs about the control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts.</b> Aims: The present research assessed the influence <b>of</b> the <b>thought</b> suppression demonstration on beliefs about the control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> in a non-clinical sample, and among individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Method: In Study 1, we assessed the effect <b>of</b> the <b>thought</b> suppression demonstration on beliefs about the control <b>of</b> <b>thoughts</b> among low and high obsessive individuals in the non-clinical population (N = 62). In Study 2, we conducted a similar study with individuals with OCD (N = 29). Results: Results suggest that high obsessive individuals in the non-clinical population are able to learn the futility of suppression through the thought suppression demonstration and to alter their faulty beliefs about the control o...|$|R
