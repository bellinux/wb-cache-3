5000|$|The {{categorization}} of Ceres has changed {{more than once}} and {{has been the subject}} of some disagreement. Johann Elert Bode believed Ceres to be the [...] "missing planet" [...] he had proposed to exist between Mars and Jupiter, at a distance of 419 million km (2.8 AU) from the Sun. Ceres was assigned a planetary symbol, and remained listed as a planet in astronomy books and tables (along with 2 Pallas, 3 Juno, and 4 Vesta) for half a century.As other objects were discovered in the neighborhood of Ceres, it was realized that Ceres represented the first of a new class of objects. In 1802, with the discovery of 2 Pallas, William Herschel coined the term asteroid ("star-like") for these bodies, writing that [...] "they resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them, even by very good telescopes". As the first such body to be discovered, Ceres was given the designation 1 Ceres under the modern system of minor-planet designations. By the 1860s, the existence of a fundamental difference between asteroids such as Ceres and the major planets was widely accepted, though a precise definition of [...] "planet" [...] was never formulated.The 2006 debate surrounding Pluto and what constitutes a planet led to Ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet. A proposal before the International Astronomical Union for the definition of a planet would have defined a planet as [...] "a celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid-body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet". Had this resolution been adopted, it would have made Ceres the fifth planet in order from the Sun. This never happened, however, and on 24 August 2006 a modified definition was adopted, carrying the additional requirement that a planet must have [...] "cleared the neighborhood around its orbit". By this definition, Ceres is not a planet because it does not dominate its <b>orbit,</b> <b>sharing</b> it as it does with the thousands of other asteroids in the asteroid belt and constituting only about a third of the mass of the belt. Bodies that met the first proposed definition but not the second, such as Ceres, were instead classified as dwarf planets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fast-slow {{systems are}} studied usually by “geometrical dissection” [4]. The fast {{dynamics}} exhibit attractors which may bifurcate {{under the influence}} of the slow dynamics which is seen as a parameter of the fast dynamics. A generic solution comes close to a connected component of the stable invariant sets of the fast dynamics. As the slow dynamics evolves, this attractor may lose its stability and the solution eventually reaches quickly another connected component of attractors of the fast dynamics and the process may repeat. This scenario explains quite well relaxation oscillations and more complicated oscillations like bursting. More recently, in relation both with theory of dynamical systems [11] and with applications to physiology [10, 26], a new interest has emerged in canard cycles. These <b>orbits</b> <b>share</b> the property that they remain for a while close to an unstable invariant set (either singular set or periodic orbits of the fast dynamics). Although canards were first discovered when the transition points are folds, in this article, we focus on the case where one or several transition points or “jumps ” are instead transcritical. We present several new surprising effects like the “amplification of canards ” or the “exceptionally fast recovery ” on both (1 + 1) -systems and (2 + 1) -systems associated with tritrophic food chain dynamics.

Hyades binaries tend to have small separations, with most binary pairs in <b>shared</b> <b>orbits</b> whose semimajor axes are smaller than 50 astronomical units. Although the exact ratio of single to multiple systems in the cluster remains uncertain, this ratio has considerable implications for our understanding of its population.

40|$|A kinky and clumpy ringlet <b>shares</b> <b>orbit</b> {{with the}} moon Pan {{in the center}} of the 320 -km wide Encke gap in Saturn's rings (Porco et al., 2005). The ringlet is mainly {{composed}} of micron-sized particles (Showalter, 1991, Hedman et al., 2011), implying that these particles may be significantly perturbed by non-gravitational forces, which can limit their lifetimes. We establish a kinetic model considering the birth, evolution, and death of dust in the Encke central ringlet allowing to evaluate the ringlet optical depth. First, we investigate the generation of dust by micrometeorite impacts (the `impact-ejecta' process) on putative, yet undetected embedded moonlets. Taking into account the orbital evolution under the influence of the relevant perturbation forces, the dominant loss mechanisms are collisions with ring particles in the gap edges, the putative moonlets in the gap, or erosion by sputtering in Saturn's plasma environment. However, our results show that this impact-ejecta process alone can only sustain a ringlet of optical depth 3 - 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the observed values. Consequently, other processes must be taken into account. For example, mutual collisions among putative moonlets should produce dust at about the same rate, while further disruption of ejecta, as proposed by Dikarev (1999), should increase the total amount of particles. Furthermore, observations show an azimuthal asymmetry of the material in the Encke gap ringlets (Ferrari and Brahic 1997, M. Sremčević, private communication). We investigate the scenario proposed by Hedman et al. (2013) that for the Encke central ringlet, the observed asymmetry is mainly due to the combined action of plasma drag and Pan's gravity causing a focusing of dust in the region leading Pan's orbit (Hedman et al. 2013).

40|$|A Study in Observation The Sonification of Morecambe Bay is a video about observation, how {{events that}} we might not {{normally}} see or hear in the environment can be brought {{within the limits of}} our perception. The video presents an uninterrupted series of over 6, 000 images taken during a four-day period in January/February 2010. Weather data captured concurrently with the images control elements of the soundtrack, offering new ways of perceiving the mix of ephemeral events and large-scale rhythms of the environment. The video presents images of Morecambe Bay, Lancaster: the horizon is deliberately placed to bisect the image at the midway point. Above, the main source of action is the clouds, below the ebbing and flooding of the tide. Other elements come into view from time to time: birds can be seen wading {{along the edge of the}} water or flying in the sky, fishing boats come and go. The time compression brings into focus events beyond the limits of our ordinary perceptions, and even then, some elements present in the video are mere fragments of larger cycles: the image sequence covers approximately 1 % of the earth’s orbit around the sun. The combination of the time-compression of the image sequence with the metereological data-mapping locks the viewer into a hyper-sensitized present, with no pause between scenes, no intervention in the unfolding of rhythms, none of the usual scope for reflection. The short, irregular rhythms associated with measurements of the wind bind the images to the surface elements of the soundtrack in a literal manner; the longer, periodic elements associated with the rotation of the earth and the moon’s <b>orbit</b> also <b>share</b> this connection with the surface of the soundscape and at the same time they go further by virtue of their periodicity and link the sounds and images together at the level of what in structural terms might be described as a musical middleground. The meteorological data can be considered as an extension of the image. Some of this data merely corroborates what is evident already in the visual data; additionally, some of it provides information about the environment that is either not conspicuous in the images or cannot be detected by the camera. For example, the meteorological data allows the wind to be heard: the visual counterpart is the movements of the clouds, which at times look homogenous and undifferentiated, yet the wind data adds a level of detail that brings these visual clues to life. Likewise, at night, when the screen is dark, the tide height data provides information about the movement of water in the bay, and the turning of the tide is clearly audible in glissandi clusters that track this data stream. The regular rhythms in the movement of the tides and the earth’s rotation are suggestive of polyphony in music, where two or more voices progress independently, at times moving in parallel and at others in contrary motion. Taken together, the visual and meteorological data create an extended data set that describes an environmental scene. The channels in Morecambe Bay are constantly moving with new ones forming every tide. Through tuning into the rhythms and timescales of these and other environmental events, we gain perspective on the ones that appear to govern our daily lives.

The camera was set to shoot at 30 -second intervals; in the dark of the night the frame rate drops to one a minute due to the longer exposure times.

The time-lapse technology allows observation of variations in landscape scenes, from different times of day and night, and contrasting weather conditions.
