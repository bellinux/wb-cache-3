5|$|On the upland farms of Wales, Welsh ponies and cobs {{would often}} have to do {{everything}} from ploughing a field to carrying a farmer to market <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> a family to services on Sunday. When coal mining became important to the economy of England, many Welsh ponies were harnessed for use in mines, above and below ground.|$|E
5|$|Although {{originally}} developed mainly for Western riding and stock uses, {{it has also}} been seen competing in endurance riding, three-day eventing, show hunter, and driving. It jumps well, and can be used for dressage. Originally, breed club shows did not allow people over the age of 16 to show POAs under saddle; adults could, however, show them in halter <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> classes. In 1973, the age limit for riders was raised to 18, and in 1987 it was decided that adults 19 and over could show horses two to four years old under saddle.|$|E
5|$|During the {{two years}} {{following}} the battle, Curtis had brief periods in command of HMS Canada, HMS Powerful, HMS Invincible and HMS Formidable. In 1796, {{he was promoted to}} rear-admiral and raised his flag on HMS Prince. In Prince, Curtis led the blockade of Brest when most of the fleet was paralysed by the Spithead Mutiny. He was also in overall command of the naval operations which succeeded in destroying <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> off much of the French force sent to support the Irish Rebellion of 1798 culminating in the Battle of Tory Island, at which he was not present. Later in the year he joined Lord St Vincent off Cadiz with a squadron of eight ships of the line, and was soon afterwards made a vice-admiral. In 1799, he retired ashore.|$|E

5|$|The {{principal}} motivation <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> {{force behind}} the re-establishment of religious houses {{in the kingdom of}} the English, living in strict accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict, was a desire to restore to their former glory some of the ancient houses known from the pages of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, from other literary works, from historical traditions of the later eighth and ninth centuries, or indeed from the physical remains of buildings... Modern historians will recognise how much was owed to the monastic reform movements on the continent, and will find extra dimensions, such as a wish to extend royal influence into areas where a king of the West Saxons might not expect his writ to run, or a more general wish to revive a sense of 'Englishness', through raising awareness of the tradition of the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{summer and}} fall {{included}} various conflicts throughout the southern territories of the German states as the armies of the Coalition and the armies of the Directory sought to flank each other. By mid-summer, the situation looked grim for the Coalition: Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east-northeast despite Charles' orders to unite with him. It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would succeed in flanking Charles <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> a wedge between his force and that of Wartensleben. At Neresheim on 11 August, Moreau crushed Charles' force, forcing him to withdraw further east. At last, however, Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction, moving his corps to join at Charles' northern flank. At Amberg on 24 August, Charles inflicted a defeat on the French; that same day, his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg. Regardless, the tide had turned in the Coalition's favor. Both Jourdan and Moreau had overstretched their lines, moving far into the German states, and were separated too far from each other for one to offer the other aid or security. The Coalition's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau, similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben. As the French withdrew toward the Rhine, Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward. On 3 September at Würzburg, Jourdan attempted unsuccessfully to halt the retreat; subsequently at the Battle of Limburg, Charles pushed {{him back to the}} Rhine. Once Moreau received word of this defeat, he had to withdraw from southern Germany. He pulled his troops back through the Black Forest, with Ferino supervising the rear guard. The Austrian corps commanded by Latour drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4,000 prisoners, some standards and artillery, and Latour followed at a more sensible distance. The two armies clashed again at Emmendingen, where Wartensleben was mortally wounded in the Coalition victory. After Emmendingen, the French withdrew to the south and west, and formed for battle by Schliengen.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{came from}} a naval family, Cotton was happier on horseback <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> horses and decided to join a cavalry regiment, the 10th Hussars or Light Dragoons. He served in Portugal as a {{lieutenant}} but was retired on half-pay in 1830 after three years.|$|E
25|$|The Italian {{occupation}} also {{reduced the}} number of livestock by killing, confiscation <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> the animals from their pastoral land to inhospitable land near the concentration camps.

25|$|Equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} is {{the systematic}} study of transformations of matter and energy in systems as they approach equilibrium. The word equilibrium implies a state of balance. In an equilibrium state there are no unbalanced potentials, <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> forces, within the system. A central aim in equilibrium thermodynamics is: given a system in a well-defined initial state, subject to accurately specified constraints, to calculate what {{the state of the}} system will be once it has reached equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|In {{the arts}} of vase-painting and mosaic, Amphitrite was {{distinguishable}} from the other Nereids only by her queenly attributes. In works of art, both ancient ones and post-Renaissance paintings, Amphitrite is represented either enthroned beside Poseidon <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> {{with him in a}} chariot drawn by sea-horses (hippocamps) or other fabulous creatures of the deep, and attended by Tritons and Nereids. She is dressed in queenly robes and has nets in her hair. The pincers of a crab are sometimes shown attached to her temples.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "Double Pole Double Throw" [...] (DPDT) relay can {{generally}} {{achieve the}} same electrical functionality as an H bridge (considering the usual function of the device). However a semiconductor-based H bridge would be preferable to the relay where a smaller physical size, high speed switching, <b>or</b> low <b>driving</b> voltage (<b>or</b> low <b>driving</b> power) is needed, or where the wearing out of mechanical parts is undesirable.|$|R

It is not {{safe to use}} a riding <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> whip for longeing because they are too short to reach the horse without {{bringing}} the handler {{close enough to the}} horse's hindquarters to risk being kicked by the horse. The longe whip is used as an encouragement to the horse but never as a punishment.|$|E
25|$|Often, Armstrong re-composed pop-tunes he played, simply with {{variations}} {{that made}} them more compelling to jazz listeners of the era. At the same time, however, his oeuvre includes many original melodies, creative leaps, and relaxed <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> rhythms. Armstrong's playing technique, honed by constant practice, extended the range, tone and capabilities of the trumpet. In his records, Armstrong almost single-handedly created {{the role of the}} jazz soloist, taking what had been essentially a collective folk music and turning it into an art form with tremendous possibilities for individual expression.|$|E
25|$|Even in {{his later}} years, Scheinberg {{continued}} to fly abroad to fund-raise for his yeshiva. He always took the Talmudic tractate of Niddah with him and tried to learn all 72 folio-pages during the flight. He was known for never wasting a minute, using the time he spent walking <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> to yeshiva immersed in Torah study. According to his driver, Asa Wittow, he always sat with a Torah book in front of him, even at a wedding, and propped a Mishnah Berurah on the shelf above his kitchen sink while he washed dishes.|$|E

25|$|The {{breeding}} {{goal is a}} hardy, fertile {{horse with}} mental and physical stamina, a good character and lively, balanced temperament. Horses may be suited to any type of riding <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> sport due to expansive, regular paces, a flat-footed walk and vibrant trot and canter. The best heads are fine, dry, and expressive, with a tapering neck and strong topline, withers pronounced and well-laid back, the back strong but flexible, and the croup long, sloping and muscular. The chest and shoulder should have depth and length, respectively. The foundation should be dry on prominent, correct joints and well-shaped hooves.|$|E
25|$|The {{top of the}} {{radiator}} was lowered 2 inches from the One-o-Four's. The styling of the Majestic is similar to, but wider and with smoother lines than the short lived Regency One-O-Four model it replaced. Interior width was increased by approximately 4 inches by extending the sides {{to the edge of}} the car. The handsome body is massive with a conventional high waistline —the doors later seemed to be high with narrow windows— and a rounded rear window. There are two standard-sized headlamps at the front extremities with Daimler's usual pair of fog lamps <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> lights just above low-set bumpers. There are plain disc wheels.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Spanish colonists {{on the shores of}} the Río de la Plata and the {{foundation}} of the city of Buenos Aires during the 16th century led directly to the first confrontations between the Spanish and the local Indian tribes, mainly the Querandí (also called the Pampas). The Spanish had purchased the Buenos Aires hinterland from the local Indians to be used for cattle raising. This use displaced most of the animals traditionally hunted by the natives. The Indians responded by attacking the towns, killing settlers and releasing <b>or</b> <b>driving</b> off many cattle and horses from the farms. In retaliation, the Spanish colonists built forts and defended themselves from the frequent attacks.|$|E
