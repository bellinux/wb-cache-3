5|$|Shimer {{has one of}} {{the highest}} rates <b>of</b> <b>doctoral</b> {{candidates}} in the U.S. In a 1998 University of Wisconsin–Madison study, the college had the highest rate of graduates receiving doctoral degrees of any liberal-arts college and the third-highest rate of any undergraduate program in the nation. A 2009 report by Washington Monthly ranked Shimer third in graduate Ph.D. rate among U.S. liberal-arts colleges. Studies based on Higher Education Data Sharing Consortium data found that Shimer had the seventh-highest alumni Ph.D. rate of U.S. colleges and universities, and the highest rate for Ph.D.s in linguistics.|$|E

25|$|Alabama's {{programs}} {{of higher education}} include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) (University of Alabama School of Medicine, University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine – Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and Tuskegee University), a dental school (University of Alabama School of Dentistry), an optometry college (University of Alabama at Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and Samford University), and five law schools (University of Alabama School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Miles Law School, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law).

25|$|Women remain {{very much}} a {{minority}} in Japanese science (15% in 2013), although the situation has improved slightly (13% in 2008) since the government fixed a target in 2006 of raising the ratio of female researchers to 25%. Calculated {{on the basis of}} the current number <b>of</b> <b>doctoral</b> students, the government hopes to obtain a 20% share of women in science, 15% in engineering and 30% in agriculture and health by the end of the current Basic Plan for Science and Technology in 2016. In 2013, Japanese female researchers were most common in the public sector in health and agriculture, where they represented 29% of academics and 20% of government researchers. In the business sector, just 8% of researchers were women (in head counts), compared to 25% in the academic sector. In other public research institutions, women accounted for 16% of researchers. One of the main thrusts of Abenomics, Japan’s current growth strategy, is to enhance the socio-economic role of women. Consequently, the selection criteria for most large university grants now take into account the proportion of women among teaching staff and researchers.|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} effort suffered several blows in 2013. In January 2013, {{a quarter}} of MSU's tenure-track faculty told Cruzado {{that they did not}} see the university putting money into hiring advanced faculty, improving research faculty salaries, improving laboratory space, or working {{to increase the number of}} graduate students—elements they said would go far to maintaining or improving the university's status as a high-activity research university. Research income for the 2012-2013 school year fell 16.6 percent to $93.7 million, which Cruzado said was due to federal budget cuts. On May 20, 2013, MSU's long-time Vice President for Research, Creativity and Technology Transfer, Thomas McCoy, left the university to take a similar position at the University of North Texas. Anne Camper, Associate Dean of the College of Engineering, was named interim vice president. That same month, an informal faculty poll showed that maintaining MSU's reputation as a high-activity research university was the highest priority of faculty. But tension between research faculty and non-research faculty was also very high. The number of graduate and doctoral students at the university also slipped. Graduate students (which included master's degree and doctoral degree students was 1,980 in 2010-2011, but just 1,888 in 2012-2013. The university strategic plan set a goal of 2,350 graduate students by 2019. The number <b>of</b> <b>doctoral</b> students was also inconsistent. There were 45 in 2010-2011, 56 in 2011-2012, but just 53 in 2013-2013. The strategic plan set a goal of 80 per year by 2019.|$|E

The Romantic movement treated Bellman as an inspired genius, whereas later he was admired more for his artistic skill and literary innovation.

500|$|There are 52 {{universities}} in Dhaka. Dhaka College {{is the oldest}} institution for {{higher education in the}} city and among the earliest established in British India, founded in 1841. Since independence, Dhaka has seen the establishment of numerous public and private colleges and universities that offer undergraduate and graduate degrees as well as a variety <b>of</b> <b>doctoral</b> programmes. University of Dhaka is the oldest public university in the country which has more than 30,000 students and 1,800 faculty staff. It was established in 1921 being the first university in the region. The university has 23 research centers and 70 departments, faculties and institutes. Eminent seats of higher education include Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Jagannath University and Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University. Dhaka Medical College and Sir Salimullah Medical College are two of the best medical colleges in the nation. Founded in 1875, Dhaka Medical School was the first medical school in Bangladesh (then British East Bengal), which became Sir Salimullah Medical College in 1962. Other government medical colleges are Shaheed Suhrawardy Medical College and Armed Forces Medical College, Dhaka.|$|E
500|$|As {{in earlier}} periods, {{the focus of}} the {{examination}} was classical Confucian texts, while the bulk of test material centered on the Four Books outlined by Zhu Xi in the 12th century. Ming era examinations were perhaps more difficult to pass since the 1487 requirement of completing the [...] "eight-legged essay", a departure from basing essays off progressing literary trends. The exams increased in difficulty as the student progressed from the local level, and appropriate titles were accordingly awarded successful applicants. Officials were classified in nine hierarchic grades, each grade divided into two degrees, with ranging salaries (nominally paid in piculs of rice) according to their rank. While provincial graduates who were appointed to office were immediately assigned to low-ranking posts like the county graduates, those who passed the palace examination were awarded a jinshi ('presented scholar') degree and assured a high-level position. In 276 years of Ming rule and ninety palace examinations, the number <b>of</b> <b>doctoral</b> degrees granted by passing the palace examinations was 24,874. Ebrey states that [...] "there were only two to four thousand of these jinshi at any given time, on the order of one out of 10,000 adult males." [...] This was in comparison to the 100,000 shengyuan ('government students'), the lowest tier of graduates, by the 16th century.|$|E
