500|$|Lady Gaga {{collaborated with}} RedOne and Space Cowboy {{in writing and}} {{producing}} [...] "So Happy I Could Die". All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An <b>occasional</b> <b>drinker,</b> the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you down to this very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E
30|$|We find, however, a {{positive}} effect of moderate drinking on paid work that is probably linked to the social aggregation value that occasional drinking may generate, especially {{in a country like}} Russia, where drinking is not associated with social stigma. This is observed through {{a positive}} and significant effect of being an <b>occasional</b> <b>drinker</b> on labour participation for husbands and wives. Moreover, being an <b>occasional</b> <b>drinker</b> has {{a positive effect}} on wives’ wages. Again, this is in line with previous findings of a positive association between moderate drinking and earnings (Berger and Leigh, 1988; Zarkin et al, 1998; MacDonald and Shields, 2001).|$|E
30|$|Given the {{complexity}} of the empirical specification, it is worth specifying the exclusions restrictions that help identifying the model 16. First, the participation equation includes variables that are excluded both from the labour supply and the wage equations. In addition, the wage equation should include some variables not present in the labour supply equation. Thus, we have three sets of exclusion restrictions. The first set concerns the participation equation with the labour supply equation where the excluded variables are: being an <b>occasional</b> <b>drinker,</b> being pregnant (wives only), the number of children in the age range 0 – 1, dwelling ownership, and three dummies identifying the waves of the panel. The second set of restrictions concerns the participation with the wage equation, where the excluded variables are: average males/females ratio, receive help with child care, number of grandparents, being pregnant, number of children aged 0 – 3, being non-Russian and being in bad health conditions. Finally, the third set of restrictions concerns the wage equation with the labour supply equation, and the excluded variables are: being an <b>occasional</b> <b>drinker,</b> having only primary education, number of children aged 0 – 1, dwelling ownership, and the three waves dummies.|$|E
40|$|A {{synthesis}} of two distinct research methods {{was used to}} investigate {{the extent to which}} Rhodes & Jason's (1988) Social Stress model, Olson's et. al. (1985) Family Cohesion and Adaptability theory and the Self-Efficacy construct (Lawrance, 1988) were associated with adolescent drinking behaviour. Two studies were carried out, one qualitative and one quantitative, based on the responses of a non-random sample of 60 and 238 adolescents respectively. Differences between Abstainers, <b>Drinkers</b> and <b>Occasional</b> <b>Drinkers</b> were investigated. No significant gender differences were identified in both studies, in regard to drinking practices reported by adolescents themselves. Analyses of the data in the qualitative and quantitative study reveal that family interactional patterns, locus-of-control, self-efficacy, peer drinking and peer pressure to drink accounted for the differences between <b>Drinkers,</b> Abstainers and <b>Occasional</b> <b>Drinkers.</b> In contrast, the three groups did not differ significantly in self-esteem, knowledge, social anxiety. social support and ability to resist pressure to drink. The findings are interesting in focusing on the fact that Drinkers differ significantly in a variety of measures from <b>Occasional</b> <b>Drinkers</b> and not just from Abstainers.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: The {{impact of}} {{emotional}} states on alcohol craving {{has so far}} mainly been investigated in abstinent and actively consuming alcohol addicts. Alcohol craving and the variables that influence alcohol craving {{have not yet been}} examined in non-addicted, alcohol abusing <b>drinkers</b> and non-abusing <b>occasional</b> alcohol <b>drinkers.</b> Methods: In this study 50 problem <b>drinkers</b> and 50 <b>occasional</b> alcohol <b>drinkers</b> were investigated. The impact of various craving-related variables such as stress and distress, alcohol effect expectancies, and stress coping strategies on reward and relief craving was examined and compared between the groups. Results: Whereas most <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> reported little alcohol craving, problem drinkers showed a significantly higher amount of reward and relief craving accompanied by increased levels of stress–distress and a stronger tendency to use negative (inadequate) coping strategies. Stress-distress and alcohol effect expectancies were significant predictors of reward and relief craving in problem <b>drinkers.</b> In <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> alcohol craving was not related to any of these variables. These variables were also found to be predictive of craving in alcohol addicts. Conclusions: We hypothesized, that in non-addicted problem drinkers the expected rewarding and reinforcing alcohol effects lead to an early stage of addictive behaviour. Therefore, in this stage therapeutic interventions focussing on the awareness of the function of alcohol intake as well as alternative coping skills might be useful to prevent alcohol dependence in problem drinkers...|$|R
40|$|Computerized tomographic (CT) {{scanning}} of {{the liver}} was undertaken in 17 occasional and 19 heavy drinkers undergoing health screening. The median attenuation value {{of the liver}} (CT number) in <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> with normal liver function tests was 54. 4 compared with 25. 9 in the heavy drinkers (P less than 0. 001). Fourteen of the heavy drinkers had a CT number below the lowest value observed in <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> with normal liver function, indicating reduced liver density due to fatty change. Serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase was normal in 36 % of these individuals. A rise in CT number was observed in 4 out of 5 heavy drinkers who underwent a second scan after decreasing their alcohol consumption.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we have {{constructed}} {{a mathematical model}} of al-cohol abuse which consists of four compartments corresponding to four pop-ulation classes, namely, moderate and occasional drinkers, heavy drinkers, drinkers in treatment and temporarily recovered class. Basic reproduction number R 0 has been determined and sensitivity analysis of R 0 indicates that β 1 (the transmission coefficient from moderate and <b>occasional</b> <b>drinker</b> to heavy drinker) is the most useful parameter for preventing drinking habit. Stability analysis of the model is made using the basic reproduc-tion number. The model is locally asymptotically stable at disease free or problem free equilibrium (DFE) E 0 when R 0 1, the endemic equilibrium E becomes stable. Further analysis gives the global asymptotic stability of DFE under some conditions. Our important analyt-ical findings are illustrated through computer simulation. Epidemiological implications of our analytical findings are addressed critically...|$|E

Regular drinkers were more likely than <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> or non-drinkers to say that harm would only be done if alcohol was taken in excess. The topic of alcohol is rarely discussed at antenatal clinics and cases of fetal alcohol syndrome, an uncommon but preventable condition, are probably being missed as a result.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{examine the}} effects of alcohol on risk of {{mortality}} from coronary heart disease (CHD), cardiovascular disease, and all causes in men with established CHD.  METHODS AND RESULTS—In a population based prospective study of 7169  men aged 45 - 64 years followed for a mean of 12. 8  years, 655  men (9. 1 %) had a physician diagnosis of CHD (myocardial infarction 455, angina only 200). In these 655  men, there were 294  deaths from all causes including 175  CHD deaths. Ex-drinkers had the highest risk of CHD, cardiovascular mortality, and all cause mortality even after adjustment for lifestyle characteristics and pre-existing disease. Using <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> as the reference group, lifelong teetotallers, <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> and light drinkers all showed similar risks of mortality from CHD, cardiovascular disease, and all causes. Moderate/heavy drinkers showed increased risk of mortality from CHD, cardiovascular disease, and all causes compared to <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers.</b> The adverse effect of moderate/heavy drinking was confined to the 455  men with previous myocardial infarction (adjusted relative risk for all cause mortality 1. 50,  95 % confidence interval 1. 01  to 2. 23). In contrast to lighter drinking, giving up smoking within five years of the start of follow up was associated with a considerable reduction in risk of all cause and cardiovascular mortality compared to those who continued to smoke.  CONCLUSION—Compared to occasional drinking, regular light alcohol consumption (1 - 14 units per week) in men with established coronary heart disease is not associated with any significant benefit or deleterious effect for CHD, cardiovascular disease or all cause mortality. Higher levels of intake (⩾  3 drinks per day) are associated with increased mortality in men with previous myocardial infarction. In contrast, smoking cessation in men with established CHD substantially reduces the risk of mortality.    Keywords: coronary heart disease; alcohol consumption; mortality risk; smoking cessatio...|$|R

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), {{there are an estimated}} 50 to 100 million cases of dengue fever (the symptoms associated with dengue infection) every year around the world (mostly in the tropics) 1. We demonstrate that “effective” mosquito control strategies are not sufficient in controlling dengue outbreaks. It is possible for low mosquito densities to cause large outbreaks. Furthermore, mosquito eradication is likely {{the most effective way to}} eliminate dengue fever but it is unpractical and nearly impossible to achieve. Based on the epidemiological threshold, R 0, we were able to determine the most sensitive parameters that can lead to enhance the implementation of public health policies and control strategies under different modeling scenarios. Alcohol abuse has been a problem for a long time in the United States. Drinking behavior patterns have changed over the years and it affects all races, age classes and social status. We used epidemiological approaches and constructed mathematical models to study drinking behavior. We find that peer pressure from moderate drinkers have the biggest impact on the population of low-risk drinkers. Threshold quantities that establish the prevalence of the drinking communities are studied and thoroughly analyzed to determine possible prevention strategies. We also explored the effect of the SDR (susceptible (’at-risk’), drinkers, temporarily recovered) model on a ’small-world’ structure and a continuous time Markov chain model. We found that network structure does not play a role on drinking behavior dynamics. We conclude that the SDR model is robust. For the stochastic simulations we computed final size drinker distributions. We also explored a more detailed model that includes four drinker classes (abstainers-occasional drinkers-moderate drinkers-heavy drinkers) and n neighborhoods. We computed threshold conditions and conducted an uncertainty analysis. We determine that the key transition to have an endemic drinking culture is from <b>occasional</b> <b>drinker</b> to moderate drinker. 1 CDC: Fact Sheet: Dengue and Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever.

40|$|The {{tendency}} to approach alcohol-related stimuli {{is known as}} the alcohol approach bias and has been related to heavy alcohol use. It is currently unknown whether the alcohol approach bias is more pronounced after emotional priming. The main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether positive and negative emotional primes would modulate the alcohol approach bias. For this purpose a new contextual Emotional Prime - Approach Avoidance Task (EP-AAT) was developed, containing both negative and positive emotional primes. Explicit coping drinking motives were expected to be related to an increased alcohol approach bias after negative primes. Results of 65 heavy and 50 <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> showed that the alcohol approach bias was increased in both groups during negative emotional priming. This appeared to be due to slower alcohol avoidance rather than faster alcohol approach. This change in alcohol approach bias was positively related to explicit enhancement drinking motives and negatively related to alcohol use-related problems. A stronger alcohol approach bias in heavy compared to <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> could not be replicated here and coping drinking motives were not related to the alcohol approach bias in any of the emotional contexts. The current findings suggest that both <b>occasional</b> and heavy <b>drinkers</b> have a selective difficulty to avoid alcohol-related cues in a negative emotional context.

METHODS: The samples were selected to be representative of the entire population of the three villages. Information on alcohol-drinking patterns was collected using a questionnaire that included a masked form of the CAGE rating scale. According to the frequency of alcohol intake, subjects were grouped in three categories: abstainers, <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> and daily drinkers. In agreement with WHO guidelines, 40 g/day for males and 20 g/day for females were taken as cut-off for 'heavy drinking' and consumptions of > 80 g/day for males and 40 g/day for females were used to define 'problem drinking'. RESULTS: A total of 2972 individuals were included in the survey (19 % of the population). Of these, 44 % were abstinent, 20 % <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> and 36 % daily drinkers. Daily drinking was found to be more common in males than in females but heavy drinking was significantly higher in females compared with males (P > or = 0. 0001).

40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the relationships between}} alcohol intake and serum lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a) ], a powerful predictor of organ damage, in patients with essential hypertension {{with a wide range}} of alcohol intake, and to investigate whether the association between alcohol intake and serum Lp(a) concentrations occurs over the entire spectrum of apo(a) phenotypes. Design Cross-sectional study of a case series. Setting University medical centre. Patients Four hundred and two patients with untreated essential hypertension recruited at a hypertension clinic. Main outcome measures Serum Lp(a) concentrations, apo(a) isoforms, alcohol consumption, smoking habits and cardiovascular status. Results No difference in Lp(a) concentrations was observed between teetotalers and <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Light drinkers (1 - 20 g/day ethanol), moderate drinkers (21 - 50 g/day), and heavy drinkers (> 50 g/day) had, respectively, 21, 26 and 57 % lower median Lp(a) concentrations than teetotalers and <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Similar findings were obtained when male and female patients were analysed separately. Log Lp(a) concentrations were inversely and independently correlated with alcohol consumption in both men and women with hypertension. The frequency distributions of apo(a) isoforms and liver function parameters were comparable across the different alcohol intake groups. Patients with evidence of cardiovascular damage had greater concentrations of serum Lp(a) and higher frequency of low-molecular weight apo(a) isoforms as compared with patients without such evidence. Conclusions Serum Lp(a) is inversely and dose-dependently related with alcohol intake in patients with hypertension, and this relationship is independent of the size distribution of apo(a) isoforms. Reduction of Lp(a) concentrations by regular consumption of alcohol might favourably affect the atherosclerotic risk profile of patients with hypertension and thereby decrease cardiovascular morbidity...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Uncertainty remains {{about the}} overall {{survival}} benefit of alcohol consumption and the mechanisms underlying the cardioprotective effect {{of light to}} moderate alcohol intake. Recent evidence suggests an anti-inflammatory effect of light to moderate alcohol consumption. We investigated the relationship of alcohol intake with all-cause mortality and cardiac events and evaluated whether this relationship is mediated or modified by inflammatory markers. METHODS: The analysis included 2487 subjects, aged 70 to 79 years, without baseline coronary heart disease (CHD) or heart failure (HF), participating in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study. All-cause mortality and incident cardiac events (CHD and HF) were detected during a mean follow-up of 5. 6 years. Alcohol consumption and serum levels of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed at baseline. RESULTS: A total of 397 participants died, and 383 experienced an incident cardiac event. Compared with never or <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> subjects drinking 1 to 7 drinks per week had lower age-, sex-, and race-adjusted incidences of death (27. 4 vs 20. 1 per 1000 person-years, respectively) and cardiac events (28. 9 vs 20. 8 per 1000 person-years). After adjustment for confounders, compared with never or <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> light to moderate drinkers (1 - 7 drinks per week) showed a decreased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 75; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 56 - 1. 00) and cardiac events (HR, 0. 72; CI, 0. 54 - 0. 97). Adjustment for potential mediators, and particularly inflammatory marker levels, {{did not affect the}} strength of this association. CONCLUSION: Light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with significantly lower rates of cardiac events and longer survival, independent of its anti-inflammatory effect...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{aimed at}} improving the medical care given to drivers who {{have been found to}} have excessive blood alcohol levels (over 1. 4 g/l) by roadside checks has been set up in the Département Val d’Oise. The aim is to ensure that these drivers receive medical attention at the earliest possible stage in the administrative and legal process in order to encourage some of them to receive treatment and help the judges decide what type of punishment is appropriate in each case. INRETS has assessed this experiment and come up with two sets of findings: the first relate to the development of criteria for describing the long term operation of the experiment on the period 1996 - 2000 (number of drivers counted at each stage of the process), and the others relate to an analysis of how judges have responded in terms of sentencing (based on in depth surveys of judicial records (1997 - 1998)). The target population (inhabitants of the department with a blood alcohol level> 1. 4 g /l) consists of about 600 drivers per year; about 70 % of them came to an appointment with a doctor specialized in alcohol-related problems before they were sentenced. Almost 60 % of those had an alcohol problem that required treatment. It appears that repetition of the offence of drink-driving is three times more common among those problem drinkers (37 % of cases) than among <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> (13 % of cases). Compulsory treatment, which was unusual before this experiment, became consistently a way for judges to react to those with a medical problem.

40|$|Serum or plasma {{levels of}} Lp(a) vary widely between {{individuals}} and are higher in Africans {{and their descendants}} compared with white persons. In whites, high serum levels of Lp(a) {{are associated with the}} premature development of atherosclerosis. In both ethnic groups, serum Lp(a) levels are highly genetically determined and only a few environmental or physiological factors, like testosterone or estrogen, have been shown to lower serum Lp(a) levels. In whites, alcohol consumption is associated with lower serum Lp(a) levels. However, the mechanism underlying this association and whether it holds true for blacks is not known. To address these questions, we analyzed serum Lp(a) levels in 333 middle-aged males of African descent from the Seychelles Islands (Indian Ocean). In addition, we analyzed the size of the apo(a) isoforms and the serum levels of albumin and sex hormones in a subset of 279 subjects. Serum Lp(a) levels were similar in teetotalers (median, 32. 5 mg/dL; n= 42) and <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> (median, 34. 1 mg/dL; n= 112). In contrast, individuals consuming 10 to 80 g of ethanol/d (n= 83) and heavy drinkers (> 80 g of ethanol/d, n= 96) had a 9 % and 32 % lower median Lp(a) level than teetotalers, respectively (P= 0. 01).

Quan-titation relies on the selective absorbance of the iron-transferrin complex at 460 nm. Transferrin isoforms deficient in sialic acid, with pls 5. 7 and 5. 9, can easily be separated and quantitated {{as a percentage of}} the total transferrin. This method has been applied to samples from teetotalers, <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> patients with recent heavy alcohol consumption, and patients during detoxifi-cation. The sensitivity of the method was 55 % in patients reporting 40 - 70 g daily ethanol consumption and nearly 100 % in heavily intoxicated patients (70 - 500 g daily con-sumption). The half-life of the dominating p 15. 7 isoform in this group was 9. 5 (± 1) days during detoxification. A CD...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore a}} {{relationship}} between culture and alcohol drinking Methods: Questionnaires on western cultural influence and drinking practices were administered to 1, 091 tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grade students in five senior high schools in Beijing in January 2002. Results: The mean cultural orientation scores for the three drinking groups were statistically different, F = 30. 64, p=. 03. A post hoc test indicated that significant differences in cultural orientation existed between non-drinkers (X= 2. 98, SD=. 28, N= 388) and <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> (X= 3. 08, SD=. 27, N= 418) and between non-drinkers and regular drinkers (X = 3. 13, SD=. 26, N= 149) Conclusions: The more westem-oriented the students were the {{more likely to be}} drinkers and the more Chinese-oriented the students were the less likely to be drinkers. Western cultural influence was a causal factor affecting Chinese adolescent drinking...|$|R

Chronic alcohol consumption {{is reported to}} be associated with increase in plasma homocysteine levels which is further influenced by the polymorphism in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. The present study aims to understand the extent of the MTHFR C 677 T polymorphism in alcohol dependent (AD) cases of Meiteis of Manipur, a Mendelian population of India. MTHFR C 677 T polymorphism was screened in 313 controls and 139 alcohol dependent (AD) cases who all met DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence. Both AD cases and controls were unrelated up to 1 st cousin. Among the control group, different drinking patterns like abstainer/nondrinkers (NDs), <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> (ODs), andmoderate drinkers (MDs) are included. Both the groups were found to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Blood {{samples were}} taken from, and {{interviews}} were conducted with, 76 persons injured in motor vehicle crashes, and from 126 controls with a home and leisure injury. The analysis was undertaken by modelling the data through conditional logistic regression, controlling for gender- and age-matched variables and other potentially confounding variables, including education and visual acuity. Detectable alcohol levels were associated with a 4. 9 relative risk (95 % confidence intervals 1. 4 to 16. 8). The population attributable fraction was about 10 % with wide confidence intervals. There was no evidence for a safe threshold in these data. The increased injury risk associated with detectable blood-alcohol levels was disproportionally, albeit non-significantly, elevated among <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> in comparison to regular drinkers. We conclude that alcohol intake is an important cause of road traffic injuries even {{in the context of}} the Mediterranean countries where alcohol is taken in moderation and mainly in the form of wine during meals...|$|R

On the other hand, after adjustment, positive associations between coffee consumption and clustering of ≥ 2 CRFs were observed in subjects with Mt 5178 A. However, these associations did not reach a significant level. For Mt 5178 C genotypic men, the adjusted OR for the clustering of ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 CRFs was significantly higher in daily <b>drinkers</b> than in <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> (OR = 2. 737, 95 % CI: 1. 361 – 5. 502, and OR = 3. 024, 95 % CI: 1. 269 – 7. 210, respectively). On the other hand, the association between Mt 5178 A genotype and the clustering of ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 CRFs did not appear to depend on alcohol consumption. Conclusions: The present results suggest that Mt 5178 C/A polymorphism modifies the effects of coffee consumption or alcohol consumption on the clustering of CRFs in middle-aged Japanese men...|$|R

Background: Some drugs of abuse down {{regulate}} {{the expression of}} cystine/glutamate (xCT) antiporter in the nucleus accumbens (Acb) after extinction or withdrawal. The altered level of xCT exchanger in Acb, a structure involved in ethanol reinforcement, {{may contribute to the}} pathological glutamatergic signaling, linked to addiction. We hypothesized that the expression of xCT may be changed in Acb and whole brain also in non-dependent (<b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers),</b> ethanol-dependent rats, as well as, during ethanol withdrawal. Methods: Wistar rats were made ethanol-dependent by chronic exposure to an alcoholic milk beverage (from 2. 4 to 7. 2 % v/v ethanol). Ethanol non-dependent rats were exposed to a similar, but non-alcoholic liquid diet and self-administered ethanol (10 %) twice a week. Withdrawal in ethanol-dependent rats was studied at 12 h after the last ethanol-enriched diet exposure. Immediately after the measurement of somatic signs of withdrawal, Western blot analysis with a polyclonal antibody against xCT was carried out in a naïv...|$|R

While the mortality rates of ex-drinkers and heavy drinkers are significantly elevated, the all-cause mortality rates may be 15-18% lower among moderate drinkers. Although {{the definition of a}} drink varies between studies and countries, this meta-analysis found that low levels of alcohol intake, defined as 1-2 drinks per day for women and 2-4 drinks per day for men, was associated with lower mortality than abstainers.

However, the J-curve for total and CHD mortality was reconfirmed by studies that took the mentioned confounders into account.

Methods: Retrospective {{analysis of a}} cohort study of 3, 542 community-dwelling men aged 65 to 83 years followed for 6 years. Cognitive impairment was established by a Mini-Mental State Examination score of 23 or less. Participants provided detailed information about their use of alcohol during the preceding year and were classified as abstainers, <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> and regular drinkers: mild (< 15 drinks/wk), moderate (15 - 27 drinks/wk), heavy (28 - 34 drinks/wk), and abusers (35 drinks/wk). We genotyped the rs 1229984 GA variant of the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 B (ADH 1 B) gene, which is associated with lower prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence. Other measures included age, education, marital status, smoking and physical activity, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Results: At study entry, rs 1229984 GA polymorphism was associated with lower prevalence of regular use of alcohol and decreased consumption among regular users.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the effects of beer, spirits, and wine drinking on coronary heart disease (CHD) events (fatal and nonfatal) and all-cause mortality. METHODS: Men aged 40 to 59 years (n = 7735) were drawn at random from one general practice in each of 24 British towns and followed up for an average of 16. 8 years. RESULTS: Regular drinkers showed a significantly lower relative risk of CHD, but no all-cause mortality, than <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> even after adjustment for potential confounders. The benefit for CHD of regular drinking was seen within both beer drinkers and spirit drinkers but not among men who reported wine drinking. However, all men who reported wine drinking (both occasional and regular) showed significantly lower age-adjusted risks of CHD and all-cause mortality than men drinking beer or spirits; beer and spirit drinkers showed similar risks. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that regular intake of all alcoholic drinks is associated with a lower risk of CHD, but not all-cause mortality, than occasional drinking. A large part, but not all, of the greater benefit seen in wine drinkers relative to other drinkers can be attributed to advantageous lifestyle characteristics (e. g., low rates of smoking and obesity) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Locus {{of control}} {{is one of}} the most {{extensively}} investigated psychological constructs in literature and the purpose of the study was to assess health-related locus of control among undergraduate’s substance users and non-users. Methods: Data from 574 students between ages 18 and 27 (n= 574, mean= 21. 15 (+/- 1. 8 years) was collected from five tertiary institutions in AdoOdo-Ota LGA, Nigeria. An adapted and validatedversion of the World Health Organization (WHO) questionnaire on drug use surveys and the multidimensional health locus of control (MHLC) which was designed to measure the degree to which an individual feels they are in control of their ownhealth were employed for data collection. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferentialstatistics. Three research hypotheses were raised and tested. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The preliminary result shows that there is no significant difference in the health-related locus of control between substance users and non-users, and between heavy and <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers,</b> but there exist significant differences based on gender. Conclusion: This article discusses the implications of these findings especially in the area of health education and the use of health locus of control measure...|$|R
40|$|Deficits of {{prefrontal cortex}} {{functioning}} and associated executive cognitive impairments are well-known correlates of chronic alcoholism and may reflect cumulative effects of high alcohol exposure. However, such associations may also reflect traits predating alcohol exposure which predispose to heavy drinking. In the present investigation, 60 university undergraduates aged 18 - 25 years were administered the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), and Sensitivity to Punishment and Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire (SPSRQ). All participants reported {{they were at}} least <b>occasional</b> <b>drinkers</b> who rarely or never used illicit drugs and had no reported history of head injury or neurological problems. All were sober at time of testing. AUDIT total scores were positively correlated with both FrSBe Disinhibition scores and SPSRQ Reward Sensitivity scores. The latter were negatively correlated with age at onset of regular alcohol use. High risk drinkers (as defined by AUDIT) had higher FrSBe Disinhibition and SPSRQ Reward Sensitivity scores compared to low risk drinkers. Findings indicate that even in a highly selected subset of young adults-undergraduates attending a prestigious private university-associations may be present between indices of prefrontal cortex dysfunction and alcohol consumption, perhaps reflecting traits that predispose to heavy drinking...|$|R
