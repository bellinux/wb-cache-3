5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual bladed dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E
5|$|Also {{visible from}} the circle is a scatter of over thirty stones on the Westwater Allotment; these are up to 0.5m (1.6 feet) long, with two {{reported}} as being standing in 1988. Elsewhere on Withypool Common {{is a collection of}} six stones arranged in a roughly circular fashion, which may have represented another stone circle <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> the kerbstones from a since-destroyed round cairn.|$|E

5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded that new fans are drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (<b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E
5|$|Her early {{style is}} less {{individual}} and more realistic or primitive, despite {{her lack of}} knowledge of, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> rejection of, basic perspective. Initially she created simple compositions or copied existing images. As her career advanced she created complicated, panoramic compositions of rural life.|$|E

5|$|In spite <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{because of}} his role in these nuclear tests, Reines was {{concerned}} about the dangers of radioactive pollution from atmospheric nuclear tests, and became an advocate of underground nuclear testing. In the wake of the Sputnik crisis, he participated in John Archibald Wheeler's Project 137, which evolved into JASON. He was also a delegate at the Atoms for Peace Conference in Geneva in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are no records of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon jihad, {{perhaps because of the}} internal troubles in Bundu at that time, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> because Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of anthropology, sociology, and {{feminism}} {{have pointed}} out the symbolic nature of phallic architecture, especially large skyscrapers which dominate the landscape as symbols of male domination, power and political authority. Towers and other vertical structures may unintentionally <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> subconsciously have those connotations. There are many examples of modern architecture that {{can be interpreted as}} phallic, but very few for which the architect has specifically cited or admitted that meaning as an intentional aspect of the design.|$|E

5|$|The above {{explanations}} all {{place the}} causeway within a Roman military context. An alternative, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> secondary, usage for the causeway in Roman times {{is suggested by}} landscape author Michael Dunn and others, who state {{that it may have}} been constructed for the transport of jet inland from Whitby. Hayes and Rutter are dismissive, stating that the value of jet mined in the Roman period would not have justified the expense of the causeway's construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{account of}} ant sting fatalities in Australia was first recorded in 1931; two adults and an infant girl from New South Wales died from ant stings, possibly from the jack jumper ant or Myrmecia pyriformis. 30 years later, another fatality {{was reported in}} 1963 in Tasmania. Historical and IgE results have suggested these two species <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> another species were responsible for all recorded deaths.|$|E
5|$|The illustration—humorously {{depicting}} New Yorkers' self-image {{of their}} place in the world, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> outsiders' view of New Yorkers' self-image—inspired many similar works, including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson; that movie poster led to a lawsuit, Steinberg v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 663 F. Supp. 706 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright Steinberg held on his work.|$|E

5|$|The {{previous}} Causeway {{had carried}} electric trams, {{and it was}} expected that the new Causeway would also carry trams, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed to be able to carry trams.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Giant, the {{earthworks}} {{belong to}} Lord Digby, {{rather than the}} National Trust. Its purpose is unknown, though it {{is thought to be}} the site of maypole dancing. It has been considered to be Roman, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> an Iron-Age burial mound containing the tomb of the person represented by the Giant.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing of}} the Roman {{alliance}} with Aetolia, Philip's first action was to secure his northern borders. He conducted raids in Illyria at Oricum and Apollonia and seized the frontier town of Sintia in Dardania <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> Paionia. He marched rapidly south through Pelagonia, Lyncestis and Bottiaea and on to Tempe which he garrisoned with 4000 men. He turned north again into Thrace, attacking the Maedi and their chief city Iamphorynna before returning to Macedon.|$|E

5|$|According to Tough, an {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{might want}} to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an Encyclopædia Galactica, containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them. A civilization that sees itself {{on the brink of}} decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that they may not die along with their civilization.|$|E
5|$|After being {{occupied}} with suppressing the revolt of Bardas Phokas {{throughout the year}} 970, Tzimiskes marshalled his forces in early 971 for a campaign against the Rus', moving his troops from Asia to Thrace and gathering supplies and siege equipment. The Byzantine navy accompanied the expedition, tasked with carrying troops to effect a landing in the enemy's rear and to cut off their retreat across the Danube. The emperor chose Easter week of 971 to make his move, catching the Rus' completely by surprise: The passes of the Balkan mountains had been left unguarded, either because the Rus' were busy suppressing Bulgarian revolts <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> (as A.D. Stokes suggests) because a peace agreement that had been concluded after the battle of Arcadiopolis made them complacent.|$|E
5|$|After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital {{moved from}} Kharkiv to Kiev in 1934, {{and the city}} {{was in need of}} a {{suburban}} residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, <b>or</b> <b>perhaps</b> of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well.|$|E
