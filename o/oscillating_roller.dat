Based on {{the design}} {{parameters}} of disc CAM with the <b>oscillating</b> <b>roller</b> follower and modified trapezoid curve follower motion, by introducing macro program cyclic variable, the mathematical calculation model of macro program about cutter path of disc CAM with the holonomic constraint <b>oscillating</b> <b>roller</b> follower is established. The macro {{program is designed to}} can be adjusted quickly, according to the design parameters and the process parameters. The numerical control program completely parametric design is realized.

40|$|AbstractCam {{mechanisms}} {{are very important}} mechanical objects which {{are used in the}} design of various machinery. Their application can be found, for example, in machine tools, textile, printing, sewing machines, etc. This mechanical object was used in the design of a sewing machine hook drive. The hook drive is composed by a four-bar linkage and a cam mechanism with radial conjugate cams and an <b>oscillating</b> <b>roller</b> follower. The main aim of the kinematic synthesis was to determine the optimal characteristic parameters of the cam mechanism hook drive. As the criterion for the determining of the most appropriate dimensions, it was chosen the pressure angle course in the proposed mechanical system. Another goal of the computational analysis was the determining of the cam mechanism dynamic behavior and properties, which are expressed in the Hertzian pressure course and estimated rating life of curve roller bearings...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCCC {{systems are}} {{the state of}} the art method for an {{assessment}} of the achieved compaction success with vibratory rollers. However, CCC systems were not available for oscillatory rollers, which differ from vibratory rollers not only in their construction, but also in their motion behaviour and way of dynamically loading the soil. Experimental field tests were performed to analyse the motion behaviour of an oscillatory drum and a CCC value for <b>oscillating</b> <b>rollers</b> is presented based on empirical observations and a semi-analytical modelling of the drum-soil interaction. Moreover, the algorithm of the CCC value is tested on measurement data of the experimental field tests and the influence of weak spots on the CCC values is investigated...|$|R
50|$|The ink {{fountain}} stores {{a quantity of}} ink in a reservoir and feeds small quantities of ink to the distribution rollers from the {{ink fountain}} roller and the ink ductor roller. The ink ductor roller is a movable roller that moves {{back and forth between}} the ink fountain roller and an ink distribution roller. As the ductor contacts the ink fountain roller, both turn and the ductor is inked. The ductor then swings forward to contact an ink distribution roller and transfers ink to it. There are generally two types of ink distribution rollers: the ink rotating rollers (or ink transfer rollers), which rotate in one direction, and the ink <b>oscillating</b> <b>rollers</b> (or ink vibrating rollers), which rotate and move from side to side. The ink distribution rollers receive ink and work it into a semiliquid state that is uniformly delivered to the ink form rollers. A thin layer of ink is then transferred to the image portions of the lithographic plate by the ink form rollers.|$|R

Based on the {{principle}} of reversal method, the “Motion Simulation ” module of NX 8. 0 is adopted to find the trajectory of the <b>oscillating</b> follower <b>roller</b> center relative to the cam with the IF function driving the oscillating follower.

The cam design by the “reversal method ” and the theoretical one are compared and analyzed...|$|R
30|$|During the {{oscillating}} twin-roll {{strip casting}} process, {{the quality of}} final products is directly influenced by the flow field distribution of molten metal in the pool. The variation in the flow field is caused by <b>oscillating</b> <b>roller</b> benefits, for homogeneous distribution of strip impurity, and decreasing the grain size. Thus, {{the quality of the}} strip could be improved. A numerical model was developed using the multiphase flow technology, coupled with heat transfer, fluid flow, solidification, and oscillation. Furthermore, a transient algorithm was adopted for simulating the oscillating twin-roll strip casting process of AlSi 9 Cu 3 and 3104 aluminum alloy. This paper focuses on the flow distribution in the pool, in comparison with the traditional vertical twin-roll strip casting process, while the amplitude or frequency is changing with the definite value of casting velocity, roller diameter, nozzle angle, and the strip thickness. Consequently, the conclusions were experimentally validated by oscillating twin-roll 3104 aluminum alloy strip casting. Vibrating casting technology can change the flow field in the pool by vibration, which can improve the quality of the strip core.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new testing {{form was}} designed, {{in which the}} screens having gray scales and some solid blocks were included. The screens consist of gray scales from 0 to 100 % of dot {{coverage}}, and the solid blocks also have coverage scales from 0 to 100 %. Printing experiment was performed, and densities and dot coverage of specific places were measured and recorded. Based on the testing data, density or dot coverage undulation with printing impressions was indicated by curves. Furthermore analysis was taken. Dot gains in the same prints are not constant, which cause that saddle shape in prints. Some reasons from construction of press such as the gap of cylinder, swing of transferring roller and oscillation of <b>oscillating</b> <b>rollers</b> were brought out. Same values of ink presetting can not get the same printing quality in the ink zones which have the same graphic coverage. The traditional press has a long make-ready time in printing running, which can reduce the efficiency of press. Shaft-less technology of inking system is put forward to cut down the make-ready time and to decrease the power consumption. New algorithm research is necessary for ink zone presetting {{in order to get}} more precise ink feeding. Some research on the press construction is also important for the press having some inherent defects...|$|R

40|$|This {{correction}} factor is {{in accordance with}} the value that has been found by Vukovich et al. (10) and corresponds with what one would theoretically expect when 1 part citrate solution and 9 parts blood with a hematocrit of 42 % are taken together (11). The D-dimer concentration in lithium-heparin plasma in our study is unaffected by transport by pneumatic mail or by rough handling, simulated by placing the sample on an <b>oscillating</b> <b>roller.</b> This opens the possibility of pneu-matic dispatch of the sample tubes and thus a gain in time at the emergency department. It also indicates that sam-ples obtained by general practitioners or local hospitals with limited capacity can be transported to a central laboratory for D-dimer measurements without decreasing their quality. That means that patients do not necessarily {{have to go to the}} emergency room for D-dimer determi-nations. We found that the D-dimer concentrations in citrate and heparin plasma were stable regardless of the time of measurement or freezing. The results obtained with dif-ferent types of analyzers were comparable. This indicates that it is valid to perform studies on frozen material and that test results of the Tina-quant assay, obtained under different (pre) analytic conditions, can be compared with-out loss of reliability. In conclusion, measurement of D-dimer concentrations with the Tina-quant D-dimer test using heparin plasma is valid and provides a reduction in TAT. The D-dimer assay remains valid under different (pre) analytic condi-tions...|$|E

2500|$|Orthodox: The {{withered}} {{tea leaves}} are heavily rolled either by hand or mechanically {{through the use}} of a cylindrical rolling table or a rotovane. The rolling table consists of a ridged table-top moving in an eccentric manner to a large hopper of tea leaves, of which the leaves are pressed down onto the table-top. The process produces a mixture of whole and broken leaves and particles which are then sorted, oxidized and dried. [...] The rotorvane (rotovane), created by Ian McTear in 1957 can be used to replicate the orthodox process. [...] The rotovane consisted of an auger pushing withered tea leaves through a vane cylinder which crushes and evenly cuts the leaves, however the process is more recently superseded by the boruah continuous roller, which consists of an <b>oscillating</b> conical <b>roller</b> around the inside of a ridged cylinder. The rotorvane can consistently duplicate broken orthodox processed black tea of even sized broken leaves, however it cannot produce whole leaf black tea. The broken leaves and particles from the orthodox method can feed into the CTC method for further processing into fanning or dust grade teas.|$|R
40|$|A {{sintered}} part’s {{mechanical properties}} are often variable {{dependent on the}} temperature at which it was sintered. Prior research has investigated how predefined process conditions (such as scan speed and laser power) in the ‘Sinter’ software affect built parts, however, little work focuses on other process conditions that can directly affect the temperature distribution in the bed relative to these parts. These conditions are not always controllable in the ‘Sinter’ software. By replacing the scanner {{at the top of}} the Sinterstation 2000 with a thermal imaging camera, an insight into the temperature distribution on the part bed was obtained. A temperature variance of up to 7 °C was found across the bed, as well as a large temperature drop and recovery period on powder layer recoat. This paper explores the possible causes of this variation in the processing of DuraForm™ Polyamide- 12 powder by monitoring and assessing build operations, enabled by replacing the front viewing window with a retro-fitted thermal imaging camera. The part bed was observed and various process conditions analysed including powder recoat, part and feed heaters, and swing gate configuration. On powder recoat, the part bed exhibited a drop in temperature because the fresh layer of powder is at a lower temperature than the powder already present in the part bed. The part bed temperature drop lessens with raised feed bed temperatures however there are limitations. Thermal analysis of the part heater proved that the uneven part bed heat distribution was not linked to the temperature gradient of the part heater. Swing gates were found to minimise hot and cold spots but spend a substantial time <b>oscillating</b> on <b>roller</b> passing...|$|R
