5|$|Production was centred at Pinewood Studios and {{principal}} photography began there on 11 January 1999 with scenes {{from inside the}} MI6 offices, designed by Peter Lamont. The pre-title sequence was shot in Bilbao, Spain, in February, with production moving to Chamonix, France, which doubled for the Caucasus scenes. The exterior of a Kazakh nuclear facility was shot at the Bardenas Reales, in Navarre, Spain, while the exterior of an oil refinery control centre was doubled by the Motorola building in Groundwell, Swindon. The exterior of the <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> was filmed in Cwm Dyli, Snowdonia, Wales, while the production teams shot the <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> explosion in Hankley Common, Elstead, Surrey.

5|$|In February 1969, {{before the}} SS Manhattan had even sailed from its East Coast {{starting}} point, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), an unincorporated joint group created by ARCO, British Petroleum, and Humble Oil in October 1968, asked for {{permission from the}} United States Department of the Interior to begin geological and engineering studies of a proposed <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> route from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, across Alaska. Even before the first feasibility studies began, the oil companies had chosen the approximate route of the pipeline. Permission was given, and teams of engineers began drilling core samples and surveying in Alaska.|$|E

After Massoud was killed September 9, 2001 in a Taliban bombing, Raphel's critics accused her of collaborating with the Taliban to advance American commercial interests even as the group gave refuge to Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri and other senior al-Qaeda leaders in the time leading up to the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|The HOSL is a {{major hub}} on the UK's <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> network (UKOP) with {{pipelines}} to Humberside and Stanlow Refinery and is an important fuel source to the British aviation industry, providing aircraft fuel for local airports including Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton airports. About half of the complex {{is dedicated to the}} storage of aviation fuel. The remainder of the complex stores oil, kerosene, petrol and diesel fuel for petrol stations across much of the South-East of England. The terminal is owned by TOTAL UK Limited (60%) and Texaco 40%.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude <b>Oil</b> <b>Pipeline</b> and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E

5|$|Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky and is {{informed}} that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is {{in league with}} Renard: Bond kills Davidov and follows the trail to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. Posing as a Russian nuclear scientist, Bond meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones. The two witness Renard stealing the GPS locator card and a half quantity of weapons-grade plutonium from a bomb and set off an explosion, from which Bond and Jones escape. Elektra kidnaps M after she thinks Bond had been killed and Bond establishes that Elektra intends to create a nuclear explosion in a submarine in Istanbul to increase the value of her own <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Bond frees M, kills Elektra and then disarms the bomb on the submarine where he kills Renard.|$|E
5|$|In the 1910s, several power {{companies}} built lines through the area. The General Pipe Line Company completed an <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> connecting the San Joaquin Valley's Midway-Sunset Oil Field with the port at San Pedro in 1913. Its alignment followed the Ridge Route north of Gorman {{and south of}} Reservoir Summit, a longer distance {{than any of the}} earlier transportation routes, but from Gorman south to the present location of Pyramid Lake, where it turned east to Reservoir Summit, it roughly followed the later Ridge Route Alternate. That same year, the Midway Gas Company opened a natural gas line, and the Pacific Light and Power Company opened a power line, both staying fairly close to the entire Ridge Route.|$|E
5|$|The MI6 {{traces the}} {{recovered}} {{money to a}} KGB agent-turned-terrorist known as Renard, who previously kidnapped King's daughter, Elektra. M assigns Bond to protect Elektra, {{who is about to}} oversee the construction of an <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> in Azerbaijan. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Bond suspects the attack was caused by Elektra's head of security, Davidov, and decides to kill him before taking his place on a flight to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond meets nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and learns that Renard managed to steal plutonium from a nuclear warhead.|$|E
40|$|Operating <b>oil</b> <b>pipelines</b> in an optimum {{capacity}} through out its life, effective construction management and failure free operations are considered as critical success factors in oil transportation business. Operating <b>oil</b> <b>pipelines</b> in derated capacity due to deteriorating pipeline health {{or lack of}} demand, non-ability of augmenting pipeline capacity despite of demand, non-achievement of time, cost, and quality of pipeline construction projects, and many failures of pipelines despite of huge expenditure in inspection and maintenance are the common phenomena in <b>oil</b> <b>pipelines</b> industry. These not only cause business loss, but also increase stakeholders' concerns for sustainable development. This study addresses the above issues using an analytical framework through stakeholders' involvement. Copyright © 2006 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|R

5|$|To get a lead {{on where}} Renard might be hiding, Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in {{exchange}} for the use of a submarine currently being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline</b> in the Bosphorus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden's Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra and boards the submarine. Ultimately, Bond finds Renard in the submarine's reactor and kills him before escaping with Jones.|$|E

Thomson and Thompson are cleared and released, but Tintin is kidnapped by the Arab insurgent Bab El Ehr, who mistakenly believes that Tintin has informations for him concerning an arms delivery. Tintin escapes and encounters an old enemy, Dr. Müller, sabotaging an <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline.</b> He reunites with Thomson and Thompson during a sandstorm and eventually arrives in Khemed's capital city of Wadesdah. When Tintin narrates the sabotage orchestrated by Müller to the Emir Mohammed Ben Kalish Ezab, one of the Emir's attendants, Ali Ben Mahmud, informs the Emir that his son Prince Abdullah is kidnapped. Tintin suspects that Müller is responsible and assures the Emir that he would rescue Abdullah.|$|E
5|$|Zveno-SPB saw limited but {{successful}} combat {{use during}} the German-Soviet War. In the opening stages, the Black Sea Fleet Air Force was tasked with destroying industrial targets in Nazi Germany-allied Romania. The {{most important of these}} was the King Carol I Bridge over Danube which carried the Ploieşti-Constanţa <b>oil</b> <b>pipeline.</b> After several failed attempts to destroy the heavily protected bridge with conventional bombers, the task was given to the Zveno squadron. As a combat test, it was decided to first attack the Constanţa oil depot. On 26 July 1941, two Zveno-SPB aircraft performed a successful attack on the depot in broad daylight with no losses. The fighters disconnected 40km (22 NM, 25mi) from the target and returned to the home airfield under their own power.|$|E
