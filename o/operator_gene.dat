50|$|A {{regulator}} gene, regulator, or {{regulatory gene}} is a gene involved in controlling {{the expression of}} one or more other genes. Regulatory sequences, which encode regulatory genes, are often 5' to the start site of transcription of the gene they regulate. In addition, these sequences can also be found 3' to the transcription start site. In both cases, whether the regulatory sequence occurs before (5') or after (3') the gene it regulates, the sequence is often many kilobases away from the transcription start site. A regulator gene may encode a protein, or it may work at the level of RNA, {{as in the case of}} genes encoding microRNAs. An example of a regulator gene is a gene that codes for a repressor protein that inhibits the activity of an <b>operator</b> <b>gene</b> (a gene which binds repressor proteins thus inhibiting the translation of RNA to protein via RNA polymerase).|$|E

Map {{order of the}} structural <b>genes</b> and <b>operator</b> <b>genes.</b> J. Bacteriol. 89 : 661 – 664. 1965. —A new method has been employed to determine the map order of the structural <b>genes</b> and <b>operator</b> <b>genes</b> governing the enzymes of the isoleucine-valine biosynthetic pathway. This method relies on the observation that phage transduction of markers carried on an F-genote leads to the establishment in the recipient of F-genotes of various lengths. Using this method, we have established that the order of loci is the following: F/ilvE ilvD ilvA oprA/ilvC/ilvB oprB. The operator locus, oprA, regulates the activity of structural genes ilvE (transaminase B), ilvD (dehydrase), and ilvA (threonine deaminase). The operator locus, oprB, regulates the activity of ilvB (condensing enzyme). An operator for ilvC (reductoisomerase) can be inferred to exist, but {{has not yet been}} detected genetically.

Identification of two <b>operator</b> <b>genes.</b> J. Bacteriol. 89 : 654 – 660. 1965. —A tightly clustered set of five structural genes governs {{the synthesis of}} the five enzymes of isoleucine and valine biosynthesis in Escherichia coli. Three of the genes governing transaminase B, dehydrase, and threonine deaminase, are controlled by a single operator locus, designated oprA. The structural gene governing the condensing enzyme is controlled by a second operator locus, designated oprB. Both oprA and oprB {{have been shown to}} regulate structural genes which are cis, but not trans, to their own operator. No mutations have yet been found which affect the level of reductoisomerase, but the existence of a third operator controlling the synthesis of this enzyme can be inferred. Enzyme derepression resulting from mutations in oprA confers resistance to high levels of valine. Derepression of the condensing enzyme resulting from mutations in oprB confers resistance to low levels of valine, and to α-aminobutyric acid. The significance of these findings with respect to the valine sensitivity of E. coli strain K- 12 is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The operon {{model was}} {{proposed}} by Jacob and Monod in 1961 {{to explain the}} regulation of enzyme synthesis in bacteria. The model requires two genetic elements: a locus i which directs the synthesis of a repressor, and a locus called the operon which contains an <b>operator</b> <b>gene</b> and associated structural genes. The repressor is believed to stop RNA and enzyme synthesis by combining with the operator site. The inhibiting effect of the repressor is reversed by an inducer which interacts directly with the repressor. A DNA-dependent cell-free system has been developed for studying the regulation of the operon containing the gene for β-galactosidase enzyme. In this cell-free system, gene activity is indirectly measured by the synthesis of part of the enzyme. Qualitatively, the regulation of the operon in the cell-free system is similar to its regulation in intact cells. The cell-free system is used to advantage in experiments where it is desirable to use predetermined levels of repressor, operon, and inducer. Such quantitative studies suggest that two inducer molecules are most effective in removing the repressor from the gene...|$|E

The mitochondrial enzyme 6 -aminolevulinate synthetase (ALAS), which is rate limiting for this pathway (4), is found at high levels of activity in the livers of AIP patients (5, 6), and this accounts for the excessive formation and subsequent excretion into the urine of porphyrin precursors which characterizes the disorder. The high levels of hepatic ALAS in AIP have been postulated to reflect an <b>operator</b> <b>gene</b> defect (5, 7, 8) which ultimately finds expression in the "over-production " of this enzyme.
