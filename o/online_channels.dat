40|$|As {{increasingly}} more organizations transit from a brick-and-mortar into a brick-and-click organization, consumers' embracing the new <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> is becoming {{critical to the}} success of these organizations. Although consumers' <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> adoption behavior has recently received a lot of attention, there still lacks a systematic investigation into the internal mechanism of consumers' channel adoption behaviors, especially, in an offline plus <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> context. Using brand extension theory and expectation-confirmation theory as the theoretical basis, this study examines what factors affect a consumer's decision on moving or extending from an offline <b>channel</b> to an <b>online</b> <b>channel.</b> A research model based on the above two theories is developed and empirically tested against data collected from 308 customers of a major commercial bank in China. The results confirm the usefulness of the two theories in explaining the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> adoption and identify the concurrence effects of cross-channel synergies and dissynergies on customer's channels evaluation. This research advances our theoretical understanding of <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> adoption behaviors and offers practical implications for organizations to manage such <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> adoption. © 2012 Elsevier B.

500|$|The March 2010 {{announcement}} {{said that}} Portal 2 {{would be released}} in late 2010. In August 2010, Valve postponed the release to February 2011, with a Steam release date of February 9, {{to allow it to}} complete changes to the game's dialogue, to fill and connect about sixty test chambers, and to finish refinements to the gel gameplay mechanic. Valve announced a further delay in November 2010, and gave a worldwide release date through retail and <b>online</b> <b>channels</b> of April 18, 2011. Wolpaw stated that this eight-week delay was used to expand the game's content before reaching an internal milestone called a [...] "content lock", after which no further content could be added. The remaining development work involved debugging. Newell allowed the delay considering the added benefits of the new content, because he thought the company would not lose any commercial opportunities because of it.

40|$|Purpose: Dual-channels {{have been}} widely used in practice, and the pricing {{decisions}} and the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> operation mode choice have been the core problems in dual-channel supply chain management. This paper focuses on the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> operation mode choice from the supply chain power structures based on game theoretical analysis. Design/methodology/approach: This paper utilizes three kinds of game theoretical models to analyze the impact of supply chain power structures on the optimal pricing and <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> operation mode choice. Findings: Results derived in this paper indicate that when the self-price elasticity is large, the power structures have no direct impact on the decisions. However, when the self-price elasticity is small and customers’ preference for the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> is low, then in the MS market, it is better for the retailer to operate the <b>online</b> <b>channel,</b> while in the RS market or in the VN market, it is better for the manufacturer to operate the <b>online</b> <b>channel.</b> Research limitations/implications: In this paper, we do not consider stochastic demand and asymmetric information, which may not well suit the reality. Originality/value: This paper provides a different perspective to analyze the impact of supply chain power structures on the pricing decisions and <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> operation mode choice. The comparison of these two <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> operation modes in this paper is also a unique point. </p...|$|R

2500|$|After a new {{package is}} assembled, the {{customer}} {{needs to be}} made aware of the new release. In the process-data model this is being depicted as a loop which states advertising the update until the customers are being properly informed. Besides this, the package ready for delivery, needs to be stored in a repository for the online distribution. In addition the vendor needs to create transfer channels. For the online distribution this means that the vendor needs to create <b>online</b> <b>channels</b> to its repository. In most cases this means that a link to the product on the website of the vendor is created. In case of updates it is largely applicable that the current version of the software product at the customer site automatically checks the [...] for new updates of the product. In case of offline distribution, the vendor needs to create physical transfer channels. This can be shops or just a contract with a courier company.|$|E
2500|$|The United States presidential {{election}} of 2012 broke new records in financing, fundraising, and negative campaigning. Through grassroots campaign contributions, online donations, and Super PACs, Obama and Romney raised a combined total {{of more than}} $2 billion.

40|$|With the {{explosion}} of the Internet and the reach that it affords, many manufacturers have complemented their existing retail <b>channels</b> with an <b>online</b> <b>channel,</b> which allows them to sell directly to their consumers. Interestingly, there is a significant variation within product categories in manufacturer's use of the Internet as a direct distribution channel. The main objective {{of this study is to}} examine the strategic forces that may influence the manufacturer's decision to complement the retail channel with a direct <b>online</b> <b>channel.</b> In particular, we are interested in answering the following questions: (I) Why is it that in some markets only a few firms find it optimal to complement their retail channels with a direct Internet channel while other firms do not? (II) What strategic role (if any), does the direct Internet channel serve and how do market characteristics impact this role? To address these issues we develop a model with a single strategic manufacturer serving a market through a single strategic retailer. In addition to the focal manufacturer's product the retailer carries products of competing manufacturers. Consumers in this market are one of two types. They are either brand loyal or store loyal. The retailer sets the retail price and the level of retail support, which impact the demand for the manufacturer's product. The retailer's decisions in turn depend on the wholesale price as well as the Internet price of the product if the manufacturer decides to complement the retail <b>channel</b> with an <b>online</b> <b>channel.</b> Our analysis reveals that the optimality of complementing the retail <b>channel</b> with an <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> and the role served by the latter depends critically upon the level of support that the retailer allocates to the manufacturer's product in the absence of the <b>online</b> <b>channel.</b> The level of support allocated by the retailer, in the absence of the <b>online</b> <b>channel,</b> depends upon the retail margins on the manufacturer's product relative to that on rival products in the product category. When the size of the brand loyal segment is small relative to the size of the store loyal segment then in the absence of the <b>online</b> <b>channel,</b> the manufacturer can lower wholesale price and enhance retail support, especially when the retail margins on the rival products are low. In contrast, when the size of the loyal segment is large and the retail margins on rival products are high the manufacturer will find it more profitable to charge a high wholesale price even if that induces the retailer to extend low levels of support. If the manufacturer decides to complement the retail <b>channel</b> with an <b>online</b> <b>channel,</b> some consumers who would have purchased from the retailer might prefer to purchase online. Our analysis reveals that when consumers' sensitivity to price differences across the competing channels exceeds a certain threshold it is not optimal for the manufacturer to complement the retail <b>channel</b> with an <b>online</b> <b>channel.</b> However, this price sensitivity threshold itself depends upon product/market characteristics, suggesting that manufacturers seeking to complement their retail <b>channels</b> with an <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> should look beyond the nature of threat the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> poses to the retail channel in devising their optimal distribution strategies. When the retail margins on rival products are sufficiently small, complementing the retail <b>channel</b> with an <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> when optimal allows the manufacturer to price discriminate and enhance profits. In contrast when retail margins on rival products are sufficiently high, complementing the retail <b>channel</b> with an <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> serves to enhance retail support. We also identify market conditions under which profits of both the manufacturer and the retailer are greater with the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> than that without it. This is particularly interesting since the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> competes with the retail channel.

40|$|Due to {{copyright}} restrictions, {{the access}} to {{the full text of}} this article is only available via subscription. The Internet has become a channel for experts offering their services. We investigate the optimal <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> adoption strategy of a high-quality expert with a brick-and-mortar presence in the face of potential entry by an expert with just an online presence. We find that the high-quality expert does not have the incentive to adopt the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> unless new entry is imminent. If the incumbent high-quality expert cannot offer a sufficiently high-quality online service, the incumbent expert accommodates entry and provides only a face-to-face service. However, a satisfactory level of online quality allows the incumbent expert to deter entry and to limit what would otherwise be a more intense competition. This paper thus establishes an entry deterrence role for the adoption of the <b>online</b> <b>channel</b> in expert markets.
