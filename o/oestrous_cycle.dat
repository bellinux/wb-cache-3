5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycle</b> of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or anovulatory) surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E

All hamsters displayed 4 -day <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> postoperatively in the long-day photoperiod (14 h light/day); control females and those with unilateral MBH damage ceased to undergo <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> approximately 8 weeks after transfer to a short-day photocycle (10 h light/day), whereas 12 of 15 females with bilateral MBH lesions continued to generate 4 -day <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> throughout 22 weeks in short days. Serum prolactin concentrations were either undetectable or low in all hamsters 8 or 14 weeks after the transfer to short-day lengths, but increased above long-day baseline values by week 22. We conclude that melatonin-binding sites in the MBH mediate suppression of <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> but not prolactin secretion by short-day lengths; recovery of prolactin secretion in females during prolonged exposure to short-day lengths reflects development of refractoriness to melatonin in a substrate distinct from the MBH.

50|$|As a marsupial, {{the common}} {{ringtail}} possum carries its young in a pouch, where it develops. Depending on the area, the mating season {{can take place}} anywhere between April and December. The majority of the young are born between May and July.

If a female prematurely loses her litter, she can return to oestrous and produce a second litter in October as a replacement if conditions are right. The average litter is made up two young and very occasionally triplets. Common ringtail possum young tend to grow relatively slowly due to dilute milk with low lipid levels that is provided to the young.

The effect of bromocriptine on progesterone secretion by the corpus luteum was reversed by neutralization of the biological activity of LH at dioestrus by injection of 0 =. ml anti-LH serum at 08. 00 h at metoestrus. Injection of the antiserum alone prolonged pro-gesterone secretion by the corpus luteum, but had no effect on the length of dioestrus. These results are interpreted as suggesting (1) that prolactin secretion on the afternoon of oestrus protects the corpus luteum of the rat ovarian cycle against the luteolytic effects of LH secretion during early dioestrus and (2) that prolactin stimulates progesterone secretion in the absence ofsuch a luteolytic action.

The buffalo is classified as a short-day breeder but in equatorial zones can show <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> throughout the year provided that nutrition is adequate to maintain reproductive function. In sub-tropical zones and at higher latitudes, day length is often the major determinant of reproductive function including the occurrence of regular <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles,</b> duration of oestrus, and the period to resumption of ovulation postpartum. Indeed, at higher latitudes buffaloes that give birth {{during the period of}} increasing day length may not show a resumption of ovulation until the following period of decreasing day length.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{southern}} Africa, various {{options to}} manage elephant populations are being considered. Immunocontraception {{is considered to}} be the most ethically acceptable and logistically feasible method for control of smaller and confined populations. In this regard, the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) vaccine has not been investigated in female elephants, although it has been reported to be safe and effective in several domestic and wildlife species. The aims of this study were to monitor the <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> of free-ranging African elephant cows using faecal progestagen metabolites and to evaluate the efficacy of a GnRH vaccine to induce anoestrus in treated cows. Methods Between May 2009 - June 2010, luteal activity of 12 elephant cows was monitored non-invasively using an enzyme immunoassay detecting faecal 5 alpha-reduced pregnanes (faecal progestagen metabolites, FPM) on a private game reserve in South Africa. No bulls of breeding age were present on the reserve prior to and {{for the duration of the}} study. After a 3 -month control period, 8 randomly-selected females were treated twice with 600 micrograms of GnRH vaccine (Improvac®, Pfizer Animal Health, Sandton, South Africa) 5 - 7 weeks apart. Four of these females had been treated previously with the porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccine for four years (2004 - 2007). Results All 12 monitored females (8 treated and 4 controls) showed signs of luteal activity as evidenced by FPM concentrations exceeding individual baseline values more than once. A total of 16 <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> could be identified in 8 cows with four of these within the 13 to 17 weeks range previously reported for captive African elephants. According to the FPM concentrations the GnRH vaccine was unable to induce anoestrus in the treated cows. Overall FPM levels in samples collected during the wet season (mean 4. 03 micrograms/gram dry faeces) were significantly higher (P Conclusions The GnRH vaccination protocol failed to induce anoestrus in the treated female elephants. These results indicate that irregular <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> occur amongst free-ranging elephants and are not restricted to elephants in captivity. The relationship between ecological conditions and endocrine activity were confirmed. Free-ranging female elephants were observed to not cycle continuously throughout the year in the absence of adult bulls. </p...|$|R
40|$|The Brattleboro {{diabetes}} insipidus mutant {{is incapable of}} synthesizing vasopressin, but is activated in its production and release of oxytocin. In the homozygous female mutant, there were abnormally short and long <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles</b> and reduced conception rates after mating with mutant males, a shortened gestation length, and a shorter time-course of labour. A better conception rate when mutant females were mated with normal Brattleboro males indicates the involvement of a male factor in the subfertility. The reduced litter size in {{diabetes insipidus}} rats appeared neither dependent of the male's genotype, nor due to a decreased viability of diabetes insipidus fetuse...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Daily or more {{frequent}} samples of cervical mucus {{were collected from}} forty-two gilts and analysed for Na and K. In five gilts, sampled through several <b>oestrous</b> <b>cycles,</b> the K level exceeded that of Na for short periods during oestrus. The ovarian status of twenty animals indicated that the K peak occurred approximately 40 hr before ovulation but with some individual variations. Two of these animals did not show a K peak, and had never ovulated. The results differed in twelve gilts on a restricted feed level, the K level generally being in excess of Na. A K peak occurred in two immature gilts after injection of deoxy-corticosterone...|$|R
