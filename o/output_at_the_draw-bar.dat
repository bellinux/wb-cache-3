40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the event-triggered output feedback H ∞ control for sampled-data control systems with nonuniform sampling. Firstly, an output-based event-triggered communication scheme is proposed, in which the state of the system is sampled with a nonuniform sampling period. Under this scheme, whether or not the sampled data should be transmitted is determined by a predetermined output-based event-triggering condition. Secondly, an event-triggered networked control system is modeled as a time-delay system by taking into consideration the output-error between <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> current sampling instant and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> last transmitted sampling instant. Thirdly, stability and stabilization criteria are derived to guarantee the uniform ultimate bounded stability and the desired performance while using less communication resources. Finally, two illustrative examples are used to show the effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|R
