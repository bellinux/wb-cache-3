60|$|But {{it was the}} {{introduction}} and general employment of lightning-rods that dealt a final deathblow to the thunderbolt theory. A lightning-conductor consists essentially of a long piece of metal, pointed at the end whose business it is, not so much (as most people imagine) to carry off the flash of lightning harmlessly, should it happen to strike the house to which the conductor is attached, but rather {{to prevent the occurrence}} of a flash at all, by gradually and gently drawing off the electricity as fast as it gathers before it has had time to collect in sufficient force for a destructive discharge. It resembles in effect an <b>overflow</b> <b>pipe</b> which drains off the surplus water of a pond as soon as it runs in, in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of an inundation, which might occur if the water were allowed to collect in force behind a dam or embankment. It is a flood-gate, not a moat: it carries away the electricity of the air quietly to the ground, without allowing it to gather in sufficient amount to produce a flash of lightning. It might thus be better called a lightning-preventer than a lightning-conductor: it conducts electricity, but it prevents lightning. At first, all lightning-rods used to be made with knobs on the top, and then the electricity used to collect at the surface until the electric force was sufficient to cause a spark. In those happy days, you had the pleasure of seeing that the lightning was actually being drawn off from your neighbourhood piecemeal. Knobs, it was held, must be the best things, because you could incontestably see the sparks striking them with your own eyes. But as time went on, electricians discovered that if you fixed a fine metal point to the conductor of an electric machine it was impossible to get up any appreciable charge because the electricity kept always leaking out by means of the point. Then it was seen that if you made your lightning-rods pointed at the end, you would be able in the same way to dissipate your electricity before it ever had time to come to a head in the shape of lightning. From that moment the thunderbolt was safely dead and buried. It was urged, indeed, that the attempt thus to rob Heaven of its thunders was wicked and impious; but the common-sense of mankind refused to believe that absolute omnipotence could be sensibly defied by twenty yards of cylindrical iron tubing. Thenceforth the thunderbolt ceased to exist, save in poetry, country houses, and the most rural circles; even the electric fluid was generally relegated to the provincial press, where it still keeps company harmoniously with caloric, the devouring element, nature's abhorrence of a vacuum, and many other like philosophical fossils: while lightning itself, shorn of its former glories, could no longer wage impious war against cathedral towers, but was compelled to restrict itself to blasting a solitary rider now and again in the open fields, or drilling more holes in the already crumbling summit of Mount Ararat. Yet it will be a thousand years more, in all probability, before the last thunderbolt ceases to be shown as a curiosity here and there to marvelling visitors, and takes its proper place in some village museum as a belemnite, a meteoric stone, or a polished axe-head of our neolithic ancestors. Even then, no doubt, the original bolt will still survive as a recognised property in the stock-in-trade of every well-equipped poet.|$|E

40|$|Newtown Creek is an {{industrial}} waterway and former tidal wetland in New York City. It {{is one of}} the most polluted water bodies in the United States and was designated as a superfund site in 2010. For over a century, organic compounds, heavy metals, and other forms of industrial pollution have disrupted the creek’s environment. The creek is also impacted by discharges from twenty combined sewer <b>overflow</b> <b>pipes,</b> which may deposit raw sewage or partially treated wastewater directly into the creek during heavy or sustained rain events. Combined sewer overflow events and associated nutrient over-enrichment at the creek drive eutrophication and subsequent hypoxia. At the current study, three sites were sampled one week apart during a dry period and a wet period, where indication of a combined sewage overflow event could be detected. 16 s rRNA high-throughput sequencing from these three sites collectively yielded over 1000 species of bacteria belonging to twenty-two classes. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that differences identified in the microbiome on wet versus dry days are as a result of combined sewage overflow, street runoff, and additional fluctuations in the creek’s environment associated with rain. It was found that after a combined sewer overflows event, the levels of Gamma Proteobacteria increased while the levels of Actinobacteria decreased. However, levels of bacteria stayed relatively unchanged at a site further away from combined sewer overflows discharge.

50|$|A spring {{supply is}} a {{provision}} of piped mains {{water to a}} number of consumers direct from a natural spring. Spring supplies are therefore a source of groundwater, which in most instances has fewer micro-organisms (e.g. coliform bacteria and protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium) and chemical contaminants than a supply from surface water. The point at which the groundwater reaches the surface is prone to contamination, so must be protected using a structure called a spring box. This is often surrounded by a fence to keep animals out, with other common features being a ditch on the uphill side, an <b>overflow</b> <b>pipe</b> and a well fitting lid. Spring supplies can range from single property supplies that are privately owned, to large supplies that are managed by water companies and serve entire communities. As with any water supply, a spring supply may need to be treated in order to bring it up to drinking water standards. The method for doing this will vary according to the contaminant, but can include sand filters, pH balancing units and ultraviolet light.|$|E
5000|$|This unusual {{windmill}} pump {{was built}} c.1850 by the Suffolk Millwrights Whitmore and Binyon [...] {{and it was}} built to pump water from the nearby Beck to fill up massive water tanks, {{one on top of}} Starston Place house and one in the nearby farmyard of Home Farm.

The paleolimnological methods included the removal of two sediment cores from the lake and spectroscopically analyzed for absorbance and for concentrations of the metals cadmium, copper, zinc, chromium, lead and manganese {{to determine if the}} disappearance was associated with the presence of metals. High levels of metals associated with road runoff from a nearby highway had been measured in another study, leading to the hypothesis that road runoff could have caused the demise of E. canadensis in lake Årungen. The sediment cores were also analyzed for percent water, dry matter and organic matter. A numerical analysis was conducted on the absorbance data obtained from the spectroscopic analysis to separate individual pigment data from the absorbance data, using methods developed by Prof. Hendrik Küpper (Küpper et al., 2007) Field surveys were conducted in lake Årungen and in the streams contributing to the location where the sediment cores were removed. Streams and <b>overflow</b> <b>pipes</b> were sampled during low flows and high flows including locations receiving discharge from road and urban runoff and combined sewer and stormwater discharge. Stream and sediment samples and samples of E. canadensis were analyzed for cadmium, copper and zinc. Historical documents were also searched for information about changes in the landscape that could have contributed to the introduction and disappearance of E. canadensis. The search of historical records show that E. canadensis was very likely introduced during the construction of a rowing pier in the lake. The pier construction occurred during the same time period in which a new highway was constructed, resulting in a change in traffic patterns that greatly reduced traffic on a road adjacent to the lake, and reduced the amount of metals being introduced into the lake. An investigation of the installation of municipal and highway stormwater drainage systems revealed that runoff from several drainage systems was entering the lake at one location. Over time, the levels of metals in the lake increased concurrently with increasing traffic on the highway, which is attributable to levels of metals measured in road and urban runoff discharging into this location. The continuous inputs of metals and perhaps other pollutants from urban and road runoff very likely caused an initial decline of E. canadensis. Multiple sources of pollutants discharging at high concentrations during extreme rainfall and rain-on-snow events in 2006 and 2007 probably caused the final die-off of the plant.

5000|$|Combined sewage {{overflow}} (CSO) {{has been}} {{occurring in the}} Puget Sound. CSO occur during rain events when runoff with the combination of raw sewage <b>overflows</b> the <b>pipes</b> and it carries pollutants, harmful pathogens, and excess nutrients directly into Puget Sound. This {{is a threat to}} the biodiversity of marine wildlife as it degrades/damages the marine habitat. Due to high amounts of excess nutrients and water disturbance, there are fewer number of benthic invertebrate species found near CSO outfalls. One of the nutrients found in excess amounts is Nitrogen, which can cause low oxygen level. Excess nitrogen can causes algae blooms which leads to low oxygen level which is dangerous for marine organism that need oxygen. Furthermore, at the outfall the output disturbs the soils, which makes the water more turbid. Turbid water can increase the number of pathogens in the water. [...] Many fishes and shellfish can be affected by some pathogens that are naturally found in the Puget Sound. High turbidity can decrease light penetration which can decrease food sources for fishes. [...] If the turbidity is high enough it can kill fishes and/or affect reproduction and growth. Other pollutants carried by the runoff can have direct harm on many marine organisms and pollute the soils. For example, heavy metal buildup can cause physiological and reproductive harm. For example, lead in river otters and spotted sandpiper affect their reproduction. Furthermore, build-up in pollutants has been found to affect fish growth.To reach standards stated in the Clean Water Act, Washington State must have a long-term CSO Control Plan so that 1 or fewer overflow events occur on average in a year.|$|R

The tool consists of two Excel files coupled with a database which permits to send a daily email to the operator with the functioning state of each measurement point. However, the tool does not do everything, human analysis is necessary to have a critical eye on the results and to decide when to trigger a cleaning operation. The main perspective {{at the end of this}} thesis is the replacement of the preventive cleaning operations that were previously performed with a fixed frequency per year by conditional cleaning operations triggered by the tool and to observe the decrease of cleaning operations. Other perspectives are to spread the tool to other sites and to use the received feedbacks to adjust the different parameters and eventually to determine an automatic trigger condition of cleaning operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{infrastructure in}} Singapore {{is undergoing a}} major revamp, which includes {{the construction of a}} new water reclamation plant (WRP) in Tuas. This plant aims to maximise the energy recovered from wastewater, with the ultimate aim of achieving energy self-sufficiency. The Integrated Validation Plant (IVP) is a 1000 m 3 /day pilot plant equipped with an AB configuration. The A-stage biosorption process increases the amount of COD recovered in the primary sludge to increase biogas production, whereas the B-stage membrane bioreactor (MBR) treats the wastewater using activated sludge. The effluent then undergoes reverse osmosis (RO) to produce potable water. This report investigates the biological treatment process in the IVP and aims to answer the following question: Given that most WRP in Singapore uses the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration (MLE; also known as the pre-denitrification configuration) for the B-stage, will a change in configuration reduce net energy consumption while achieving good effluent quality? The research is divided into three main parts with the following objectives: 1. To create and calibrate a Biowin model to simulate the biological treatment process in the IVP 2. To optimise the MBR B-stage by finding the configuration and operating conditions that requires the least influent COD to achieve acceptable effluent quality (in terms of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus), and to determine the appropriate changes in the A-stage (if any) that is required to achieve this effluent quality 3. To explore issues facing the IVP and future developments of wastewater treatment in Singapore – effect of an unaerated deoxygenation tank, feasibility of mainstream Anammox, and modification of the treatment process to reduce chemical dosage in the downstream RO process The Biowin model for the MBR was first calibrated using jar tests and oxygen uptake tests, then validated with profile studies that are being carried out in the MBR regularly. It was found that Biowin is able to model the biological treatment process relatively well, with the major discrepancy being that Biowin is not able to model ammonia adsorption onto activated sludge in the anoxic zone. With the calibrated model, various configurations and operating conditions were simulated to optimise the MBR. It was found that the optimal configuration is the Anoxic-Oxic-Anoxic-Oxic (AOAO) configuration with a step feed of 50 % of the influent entering the first anoxic zone and 50 % entering the second anoxic zone. The return activated sludge (RAS) flow should be 73 % of the influent flow and the DO in the aerated tanks should be maintained at 1 mg/l. As the biosorption tank at the IVP is not functioning well, data was obtained from another biosorption pilot plant in Singapore to calibrate the A-stage. Using this calibrated biosorption model, the optimal MBR configuration, and the typical raw influent characteristics for the IVP, it was determined that a functioning biosorption stage will result in insufficient COD entering the MBR for sufficient phosphorus removal. To achieve the required effluent quality, the best option during steady state operations would be to reduce the sludge retention time (SRT) of the biosorption process from 0. 5 days to 0. 32 days by increasing sludge wastage as this leads to the highest overall COD recovery. On the other hand, the best method to cope with sudden increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus load in the raw influent would be to partially bypass the biosorption tank and divert some of the raw influent to the primary clarifier as this option results in the fastest response in the effluent quality. As the membrane tanks in the MBR are aerated to scour the membranes and minimise fouling, the mixed liquor in the tanks have a high concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). A small deoxygenation tank is installed after the membrane tanks to allow DO to deplete before the mixed liquor is recycled back to the anoxic zone at the start of the MBR. However, the deoxygenation tank is not functioning well due to the presence of a cascade overflow from the membrane tanks. Simulations show that the presence of residual DO in the recycle stream leads to a large deterioration the biological phosphorus removal performance of the MBR, mainly due to reduced COD availability for the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Modifications to reduce the impact of the cascade include the installation of baffle walls, slopes, or <b>overflow</b> <b>pipes.</b> One of the technologies for B-stage that can allow even higher COD recovery is mainstream Anammox for nitrogen removal, which consumes less COD than conventional nitrogen-removal processes. As it works best at temperatures of about 30 oC, it may be suitable for implementation in Singapore where the average wastewater temperature is about 31 oC. Biowin simulations revealed that mainstream Anammox can occur under the local conditions, with CANON and DEMON configurations being more suitable than the SHARON-Anammox configuration. However, a very high solids removal efficiency in the primary clarifier is required to remove sufficient COD in the A-stage for Anammox to develop in the B-stage. Further studies would be required to determine if this is achievable under local conditions. Lastly, the MBR effluent is sent to a RO process to be reclaimed as potable water. Ammonia and sodium hypochlorite is first added to produce chloramine to prevent biofouling and provide the necessary residual disinfection. it was found that the ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent can be increased sufficiently to remove the need for ammonia dosage. However, the reduced nitrification also resulted in a higher nitrite concentration in the effluent, increasing the amount of sodium hypochlorite needed to produce the required chloramine as sodium hypochlorite also oxidises nitrite into nitrate. In addition, the dosage of anti-scalants can be reduced with better phosphorus removal as the lower effluent phosphorus leads to less scaling potential in the RO process by calcium phosphate.
