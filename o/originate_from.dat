5|$|Although not proven, {{recent data}} from the Galileo orbiter {{indicate}} that Io might have its own magnetic field. Io has an extremely thin atmosphere made up mostly of sulfur dioxide (SO2).

5|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the Anahim hotspot is supplied by a miniplume. These mantle plumes have their roots in the upper mantle but they may later <b>originate</b> <b>from</b> the lower mantle. Arguments for an Anahim miniplume are centred {{on the existence of}} two small dike swarms at the western (hence oldest) end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt. This assumption is in turn based on the notion that giant dike swarms mark the arrival of deep-seated mantle plumes.|$|E
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) <b>originating</b> <b>from</b> the {{caudate lobe}} is a special-site HCC, which is rare {{and difficult to}} treat.

This paper briefly introduces the anatomic features of the caudate lobe and the features of blood supply in HCC <b>originating</b> <b>from</b> the caudate lobe, reviews the research advances in the therapeutic methods of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and local ablation for HCC <b>originating</b> <b>from</b> the caudate lobe, and points out {{that a combination of}} interventional therapies for HCC <b>originating</b> <b>from</b> the caudate lobe needs to be further investigated in clinical practice...|$|R
