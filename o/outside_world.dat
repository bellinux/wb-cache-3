5|$|In 1964, {{the largest}} {{earthquake}} ever {{recorded in the}} United States struck Anchorage and southern Alaska, cutting communications to the <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> The quake was felt in Fairbanks, and it took 40 minutes for communications to be re-established with the Associated Press office in Seattle. When the connection was restored, the News-Miner sent the first reports of the earthquake to the <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> The quake also destroyed {{the offices of the}} Anchorage Times, the leading newspaper in that city. The News-Miner offered its press facilities to the Times, and the two papers shared a masthead as Anchorage recovered from the tremor.|$|E
5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some {{links with}} the <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> at this time, trading with neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, {{the young and the}} military, whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country. A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's control of the country, limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from the <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before the 20th century, Torajans {{lived in}} {{autonomous}} villages, where they practised animism and were relatively {{untouched by the}} <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b> In the early 1900s, Dutch missionaries first worked to convert Torajan highlanders to Christianity. When the Tana Toraja regency was further opened to the <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> in the 1970s, it became an icon of tourism in Indonesia: it was exploited by tourism development and studied by anthropologists. By the 1990s, when tourism peaked, Toraja society had changed significantly, from an agrarian model—in which social life and customs were outgrowths of the Aluk To Dolo—to a largely Christian society. Today, tourism and remittances from migrant Torajans have made for {{major changes in the}} Toraja highland, giving the Toraja a celebrity status within Indonesia and enhancing Toraja ethnic group pride.|$|E
50|$|Customs are doorways {{to other}} worlds. The customs are {{operated}} by a customs officer-functional, {{the only person who}} is able to let others through the doors.

5|$|Francis Bok {{was raised}} in a large Catholic family of cattle herders in the Dinka village of Gurion in Southern Sudan. His father, Bol Buk Dol, managed several herds of cattle, sheep and goats. When Bok was {{captured}} at the age of 7 on May 15, 1986, he could not count beyond 10 and knew very little of the <b>outside</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, lack of power {{prevented}} communications and the <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> had little {{knowledge of the}} extent of the damage in Dominica. A citizen named Fred White ended that by using a battery-operated ham radio to contact the world.|$|E

5|$|A Canticle for Leibowitz is a post-apocalyptic {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Walter M. Miller Jr., first {{published}} in 1960. Set in a Catholic monastery in the desert of the Southwestern United States after a devastating nuclear war, the story spans thousands of years as civilization rebuilds itself. The monks of the fictional Albertian Order of Leibowitz take up the mission of preserving the surviving remnants of man's scientific knowledge until the day the <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> is again ready for it.|$|E

5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely {{cut off from the}} <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted the bulk of his assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 {{profile in}} the book Madcap by biographer and {{journalist}} Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name of Roger, continued to live in his late mother's semi-detached home in Cambridge, and had returned to painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also {{said to have been}} an avid gardener and his main point of contact with the <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular contact with the <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, chelicerates' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the <b>outside</b> <b>world,</b> except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{with the}} <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> {{on the land}} side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed {{on the western side}} {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E

5|$|During Shadow of the Colossus, {{the player}} {{receives}} little {{information concerning the}} backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another.

5|$|During this period, the Mycenaean centers {{witnessed}} increased {{contacts with}} the <b>outside</b> <b>world</b> and especially with the Cyclades and the Minoan centers in the island of Crete. Mycenaean presence appears to be also depicted in a fresco at Akrotiri, on Thera island, which possibly displays many warriors in Boar's tusk helmets, a feature typical of Mycenaean warfare. In the early 15th century, commerce intensified with Mycenaean pottery reaching the western coast of Asia Minor, including Miletus and Troy, Cyprus, Lebanon, Palestine and Egypt.|$|E
