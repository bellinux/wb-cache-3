5|$|A final wave of war {{cemetery}} memorials {{were completed}} in the 1930s under the Fascist governments <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> Italy. The main Italian war cemeteries were not finished until 1938, and their positioning in some cases carried special political meaning, emphasising Italy's right to claim important, but ethnically diverse, border regions. In Germany, the same decade saw the completion of totenburgen, fortresses of the dead, used as war cemeteries and memorials. These were in some senses {{an extension of the}} cemetery designs of the 1920s, celebrating a natural German landscape, but included extensive modernist, monumental features, intending to highlight German artistic skill.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War, Queen Mary instituted an {{austerity}} {{drive at}} the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which caused her great emotional strain.

News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost to those in Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat <b>of</b> <b>Germany</b> <b>and</b> the abdication and exile of the Kaiser.|$|E
