40|$|The {{way people}} dress in Africa is often {{overlooked}} and interpreted as traditional or fixed. Nevertheless, {{interaction between the}} African ways <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> and western styles of fashion has occurred over time increasingly. Especially during colonialism, {{the influence of the}} western styles <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> had on the Africans has increased. As a result of this, the African ways <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> have changed among many different areas on the continent. In all the various regions of the continent the ways <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> have developed in different directions and with the colonial influences the changes have been developing via several roads as well. Therefore, each case has its own answers and reasons for why people dress the way they do and its own reasons to reject or embrace the western styles <b>of</b> <b>dressing.</b> Within the following pages the political and cultural reasons for people to embrace or reject the western ways <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> will be examined...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{physical}} origin of population inversion via continuous wave two-colour coherent excitation in three-level systems by dressing the inverted transition. Two different mechanisms {{are identified as}} being responsible for the population inversion. For V-configured systems and cascade (E) configured systems with inversion on the lower transition, the responsible mechanism is the selective trapping <b>of</b> <b>dressed</b> states, and the population inversion approaches the ideal value of 1. For Lambda-configured systems and Xi-configured systems with inversion on the upper transition, population inversion {{is based on the}} selective excitation <b>of</b> <b>dressed</b> states, with the population inversion tending towards 0. 5. As the essential difference between these two mechanisms, the selective trapping <b>of</b> <b>dressed</b> states occurs in systems with strong decay into dressed states while the selective excitation appears in systems with strong decay out <b>of</b> <b>dressed</b> states...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The main {{objective}} <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> wounds {{is to prevent}} wound infections. Successful wound management depends on {{an understanding of the}} healing process combined with knowledge of the properties of the various dressings available. Wounds can heal primarily, secondarily, or by delayed primary closure. The method <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> includes occlusive and non-occlusive dressing. Aim: To evaluate the clinical outcome of non-occlusive versus occlusive dressings in postoperative sutured wounds. Materials and Methods: This was a prospective study done on 298 patients over a period of one and half years from 1 st January 2012 to 30 th June 2013. All elective inpatients with sutured wounds in the Department of General Surgery requiring local wound care postoperatively were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the type <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> used i. e., occlusive or non-occlusive. The results obtained were statistically analysed by student t-test and Chisquare test. Results: In our study, we found that wound infection and wound dehiscence were noted more in non-occlusive dressing group as compared to occlusive dressing group. We also found that mean cost <b>of</b> <b>dressing,</b> frequency <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> changes, the pain during dressing change, mean duration of hospital stay for nonocclusive dressing was more than occlusive dressing. Conclusion: After a careful review of current study on wound management and type <b>of</b> <b>dressing,</b> it is evident that occlusive dressing had better clinical outcomes as compared to nonocclusive dressing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objectives: To {{identify}} {{the frequency of}} change of chlorhexidine-impregnated gel dressings applied in central venous catheter insertion sites, describe reasons for dressing changes, and {{identify the}} amount of dressings used per adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Methods: Descriptive study consisting of daily record of occurrence evaluation, reason for dressing change and quantity used per patient, between April and December 2014. Descriptive statistical analysis was used. Results: A total of 159 dressings were applied at the insertion site of 64 central venous catheters whose mean frequency <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> changes was 3. 04 days. The mean number <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> per patient was 3. 1, but 83 unscheduled changes occurred before 7 days of stay, due to detachment, wetness, soiling, and loss <b>of</b> <b>dressing.</b> Conclusion: The frequency <b>of</b> <b>dressing</b> changes was less than seven days, resulting in greater quantities of dressings per patient.
