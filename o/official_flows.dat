40|$|<b>Official</b> <b>flows</b> {{account for}} close to half of capital flows to {{developing}} countries, and close to 90 per cent of receipts for Sub-Saharan Africa. This paper documents trends in these <b>official</b> <b>flows</b> {{over the last three}} decades. The most striking trend has been declining aid volume. Following two decades of relative stability, <b>official</b> <b>flows</b> have decline in the 1990 s; in particular aid to just 0. 2 per cent of donor GNP. A second trend is the decline in aid to low-income countries, partly as aid flows are diverted to transition economies and ‘trouble spots’. As a result of these trends, real aid per capita to Sub-Saharan Africa fell by 40 per cent in the 1990 s. Continuing an existing trend, multilateral agencies have accounted for a growing share of total aid, in part {{as a result of the}} expansion of EU aid, but non-EU donors have contributed more of their aid through the UN system. Positive developments have been the increased concessionality of aid and a move toward untying. However, substantial parts of the multilateral system, notably the World Bank, continue to extend loans rather than grants. And the move to untying is not well-established, having been somewhat reversed in some countries in recent years. Finally, the aid programme of most donors is thinly spread over many recipients. Whilst there are good grounds to question the current fashion for selectivity, there remain good developmental arguments for greater concentration by individual donors. ...|$|E
40|$|Portfolio {{investment}} has {{played an important}} role in the rapid growth of Asia’s emerging economies. It has also played a key — if uncertain — role in the Asian Crisis; and is expected to play a significant role in Asia’s recovery and restructuring. Therefore understanding portfolio investment behaviour and key factors shaping such behaviour, could make an important contribution to an understanding of Asia’s sustainable recovery. To put this in context, total net portfolio equity investment in emerging markets stood in 1996, just prior to the crisis, at $ 33. 7 billion, or approximately 4. 6 times net <b>official</b> <b>flows.</b> For Asia/Pacific emerging economies net portfolio equity investment in 1996 was $ 17. 2 billion, or over 2. 7 times net <b>official</b> <b>flows.</b> Looking to the future, by some estimates over $ 200 billion in equity is likely to be needed by Asia’s crisis economies to recapitalize the banks and restructure heavily indebted corporations.

40|$|The authors study {{what drives}} private capital flows to {{developing}} countries, {{as well as}} the apparent response of official lending for the years 1978 - 97. Econometric results reveal that non-foreign direct investment portfolio flows to a country tended to rise in response to: 1) An increase in the current account deficit. 2) A rise in foreign direct investment flows. 3) Higher per capita income. 4) Growth performance. Once those variables were accounted for, private flows {{did not seem to be}} influenced by location, and regional factors. In addition, private capital flows (whether foreign direct investment or not) seem to respond positively (with a one-year lag) to World Bank lending commitments. By far the most important determinant of official lending to a developing country, seems to be the external current account balance, or a change in international reserves in the country. <b>Official</b> <b>flows</b> - including World Bank lending - appear to have played a stabilizing (or counter-cyclical) role in response to the volatility of private capital flows, and fluctuations in commodity prices, and GDP growth.

40|$|Debate {{about the}} {{effectiveness}} of foreign aid has intensified in recent years, as budgetary pressures on aid have increased in donor countries. Whatever the merits of opposing arguments, the question is: do conventional measures of aid (such as OECD's Net ODA), which lump together grants and loans, accurately reflect true aid flows? The authors analyze the methodological shortcomings of conventional measures of aid and propose a new approach, which measures official aid flows as the sum of grants and the grant-equivalents of official loans (in a new aggregate they call"Effective Development Assistance,"or EDA). They show how results using this conceptually superior measure may differ significantly from conventional aggregates, providing a quite different view on major aid trends. They implement their approach empirically using data on some 40, 000 official loans from the World Bank's DRS database [...] virtually all of the official loans to 133 developing countries from 1975 to 1995. The numerical results underscore several points: 1) The conventional approach has led to systematic overestimates of the concessionality of official loans. This overestimate has increased significantly since the mid- 1980 s. Conventional methods show a rising trend; the new method shows the opposite. 2) Net ODA increasingly overstates the true aid content of <b>official</b> <b>flows,</b> although the divergence between the two approaches is somewhat muted by the rising relative importance of grants over loans in total <b>official</b> <b>flows.</b> Strategic Debt Management,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Banks&Banking Reform,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Economic Theory&Research,Economic Adjustment and Lending,Banks&Banking Reform,Strategic Debt Management,Economic Theory&Research,Payment Systems&Infrastructure...|$|E
