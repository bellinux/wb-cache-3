2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>grains</b> into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a malting floor. The cereal is spread out on the malting floor in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the malting or germination floor, where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired colour and specification. Malts range in colour from very pale through crystal and amber to chocolate or black malts.|$|E

40|$|As in <b>other</b> <b>cereals,</b> <b>grain</b> yield in {{pearl millet}} is {{directly}} related to grain number m− 2. Hence, an attempt was made to increase grain numbers by (1) increasing the length of vegetative period (to increase potential grain number per panicle and increase leaf area and light interception before flowering) by using a non-inductive long photoperiod during the early stages of crop growth, and (2) using a dwarfing gene to vary assimilate partitioning between panicle and stem prior to flowering. Extended day length delayed panicle initiation (PI) and flowering and increased leaf area index and assimilate production. Time to flowering was directly related to assimilate allocation to individual panicles, and to grain number per panicle. Delayed PI, however, reduced panicle numbers. Dwarf hybrids partitioned more assimilates to panicles and less to stems, which was also associated with more grains per panicle. The increase in grain number per panicle was offset by decrease in panicles per plant so that neither longer vegetative stage nor dwarfing gene caused in increase in grain yield. With increase in grain numbers per panicle in the dwarfs, grain density (grains cm− 2 surface area of panicle) also increased resulting in the dwarf hybrids producing smaller grains and failing to benefit from the increased grain numbers per ear...|$|R

40|$|Background: Taking {{folic acid}} {{supplements}} before pregnancy {{to reduce the}} risk of a neural tube defect (NTD) is especially important in countries without universal folic acid fortification. The extent of folic acid supplementation among women who had antenatal screening for Down’s syndrome and NTDs at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, London between 1999 and 2012 was assessed. Methods and Findings: 466, 860 women screened provided details on folic acid supplementation. The proportion of women who took folic acid supplements before pregnancy was determined according to year and characteristics of the women. The proportion of women taking folic acid supplements before pregnancy declined from 35 % (95 % CI 34 %– 35 %) in 1999 – 2001 to 31 % (30 %– 31 %) in 2011 – 2012. 6 % (5 %– 6 %) of women aged under 20 took folic acid supplements before pregnancy compared with 40 % of women aged between 35 and 39. Non-Caucasian women were less likely to take folic acid supplements before pregnancy than Caucasian women; Afro-Caribbean 17 % (16 %– 17 %), Oriental 25 % (24 %– 25 %) and South Asian 20 % (20 %– 21 %) compared with 35 % (35 %– 35 %) for Caucasian women. 51 % (48 %– 55 %) of women who previously had an NTD pregnancy took folic acid supplements before the current pregnancy. Conclusions: The policy of folic acid supplementation is failing and has led to health inequalities.

40|$|This {{research}} project examined {{how to treat}} raw oat material for oat-based food products in order to sustain or increase the levels of phenolic compounds. The focus was mainly on the avenanthramides, which are potentially health beneficial bioactive components found exclusively in oats. A proposed enzymatic decrease in avenanthramide levels when non heat-treated milled oats are steeped in water was investigated. The decrease was strongly suggested {{to be caused by}} a polyphenol oxidase. Although the avenanthramides are only found in oats, the polyphenol oxidase enzyme that acted on avenanthramides was also found to be present in wheat, barley and rye. The effects of a highly controlled steeping and germination process on levels of phenolic compounds and related enzyme activities in oats were studied. The process resulted in increased levels of avenanthramides and some unknown compounds to various extents depending on cultivar. This increase was suggested to be partly due to enzymatically catalysed de novo biosynthesis. Whether germination was the reason behind elevated levels of avenanthramides in one harvest year compared with another, in the same oat genotypes, were investigated. The differences in avenanthramide levels between the two years could not be explained by preharvest sprouting of the oat grains in the field. The content and location of tricin was studied in various oat samples. Tricin was found to be localised to oat hulls and was detected and quantified in a minority of all oat samples analysed. The overall conclusion was that germination of oats can be a good method to sustain or increase avenanthramides and other potentially health beneficial phenolic compounds. It is important to inactivate the polyphenol oxidase present in oats and <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>grain</b> ingredients included in oat-based food products, since it may otherwise decrease the levels of avenanthramides in these products.

Previous research has shown that pyridine growth regulator herbicides can affect seed production in annual grasses including downy brome, Japanese brome, wheat, and <b>other</b> <b>cereal</b> <b>grain</b> crops. Aminocyclopyrachlor is a pyridine carboxylic acid growth regulator herbicide that has recently been registered for broadleaf weed and brush control in nonagricultural areas, which may help facilitate release of native perennial grasses in native plant restoration sites. The influence of aminocyclopyrachlor on downy brome seed production was evaluated at multiple application rates and timings under controlled field conditions. The effect of aminocyclopyrachlor on seed production was compared with aminopyralid, another pyridine growth regulator herbicide. When applied to downy brome plants in the early vegetative stage (EPOST) at approximately 580 growing degree days (GDD), aminocyclopyrachlor at 320 g ae ha⁻¹ reduced seed germination by 50 to 88 % in the first and second study years, respectively. Aminopyralid reduced seed germination by 94 % in the first study year, but only 20 % in the second year. When applied to downy brome plants in the early heading stage at approximately 1, 235 GDD (LPOST), aminocyclopyrachlor at 320 g ae ha⁻¹ reduced seed germination by 100 % both years. Aminopyralid reduced seed germination by 95 % in the first year, and 81 % in the second year. Other than the observed reduction in seed germination, herbicides did not produce any visible changes in downy brome aboveground plant growth or development. Because downy brome seeds are relatively short-lived in soil, aminocyclopyrachlor and aminopyralid applications to downy brome–infested rangelands and other natural areas could result in reductions in downy brome population densities over time. No published data exist on the effect of aminocyclopyrachlor on seed production of desirable perennial grasses in natural ecosystems, thereby suggesting the need for further research...|$|R

A genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to predict chemotypes was developed based on the structural gene sequences of Tri 13 genes involved in trichothecene mycotoxin biosynthesis pathways. A single pair of primers derived from the Tri 13 genes detected a 583 bp fragment from 15 -AcDON-chemotypes, a 644 bp fragment from 3 -AcDON-chemotypes and an 859 bp fragment from NIV-producing strains.
