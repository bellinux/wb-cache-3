50|$|<b>Oxilorphan</b> (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} L-BC-2605) is an opioid {{antagonist}} of the morphinan family {{that was never}} marketed. It acts as a μ-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist but a κ-opioid receptor (KOR) partial agonist, and has similar effects to naloxone and around the same potency as an MOR antagonist. <b>Oxilorphan</b> has some weak partial agonist actions at the MOR (with miosis, nausea, dizziness, and some euphoria observed) and can produce hallucinogenic/dissociative effects at sufficient doses, indicative of KOR activation. It was trialed {{for the treatment of}} opioid addiction, but was not developed commercially. The KOR agonist effects of <b>oxilorphan</b> are associated with dysphoria, which combined with its hallucinogenic effects, serve to limit its clinical usefulness; indeed, many patients who experienced these side effects refused to take additional doses in clinical trials.|$|E
5000|$|Ketorfanol (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} SBW-22), or ketorphanol, is an opioid {{analgesic}} of the morphinan family {{that was found}} to possess [...] "potent antiwrithing activity" [...] in animal assays but was never marketed. It is a 17-cycloalkylmethyl derivative of morphinan and as such, is closely related structurally to butorphanol, cyclorphan, <b>oxilorphan,</b> proxorphan, and xorphanol, which act preferentially as κ-opioid receptor agonists {{and to a lesser}} extent as μ-opioid receptor partial agonists/antagonists.|$|E
40|$|By {{selectively}} blocking cross-interferences {{from other}} types of binding sites, a binding site which likely represents kappa opiold binding sites was obtained in the guinea-pig brain suspension of the particulate fraction. Selective ligands for mu, sigma, delta and epsilon opioid binding sites were poor inhibitors for inhibiting [3 H]ethylketocyclazocine binding to this site, whereas kappa opiolds like <b>oxilorphan,</b> dynorphin(I- 1 3), ethylketocyclazocine, butorphanol, cyclazocane, ketocydazocine, tifluadom, nalor-phine, pentazocine, U- 50 - 488, nalbuphine and naloxone were potent ligands. Buprenorphine, generally {{believed to be a}} mu opiate, was the most potent inhibitor at the kappa site. Scatchard analysis of the saturation curve of[3 H]ethylketocydazocine bind-ing revealed two subtypes of kappa binding sites: a high-affinity site and a low-affinity site wfth K = 0. 7 and 78 nM and maximum binding = 22 and 1 01 frnol/mg of protein, respectively.

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{addition of}} [D-Ala 2, D-Leu 5]-enkephalin and morphiceptin at concentrations at which 98 % of enkephalin (delta) and morphine (mu) receptors are occupied only partially inhibits the binding of [3 H]diprenorphine to rat brain membranes. These conditions, furthermore, do {{not affect the}} curves for displacement of [3 H]diprenorphine binding by unlabeled diprenorphine. These data suggest that [3 H]diprenorphine binds to a third subtype of opiate binding site, which has high affinity for diprenorphine but very low affinity for mu and delta agonists. The [3 H]-diprenorphine binding observed {{in the presence of}} morphiceptin and [D-Ala 2, D-Leu 5]enkephalin exhibits high affinity for several benzomorphan drugs in the chemical family of 6, 7 -benzomorphan (e. g., cyclazocine, ethylketocyclazocine, SKF 10047, UM 1072, <b>oxilorphan,</b> etc). Because of its selectivity for most benzomorphan drugs, this putative receptor site is tentatively referred to as a benzomorphan binding site. Its regional distribution in rat brain {{is similar to that of}} morphine (mu) receptors but differs from that for enkephalin (delta) receptors. The content of benzomorphan binding sites in rat brain is only one-half to one-third that of morphine receptors. The relative affinities of various opioids to morphine enkephalin, and benzomorphan binding sites are also described...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{reports have}} {{suggested}} that opioid peptides {{may be involved in}} renal water excretion. The present in vivo experiments, therefore, were undertaken to determine the effect of opioid peptides on the osmotic and nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in the conscious rat. Experimental animals were infused intravenously with naloxone (20 μg/kg per min) or <b>oxilorphan</b> (40 μg/kg per min), chemically dissimilar opioid antagonists. Control rats were infused with normal saline, the vehicle for the opioid antagonists. In all three groups the osmotic release of AVP was examined during an acute hypertonic saline (3 %) infusion (2 ml/ 100 g body wt). The antidiuresis following the hypertonic saline infusion was significantly attenuated in naloxone- and oxilorphan-treated rats, as the peak urinary osmolality (Uosm) rose to 581. 4 ± 22. 4 and 558. 2 ± 27. 6 mosmol/kg H 2 O in naloxone- and oxilorphan-treated rats as compared with the value in control rats of 735. 3 ± 24. 2 mosmol/kg H 2 O (both P < 0. 001 vs. control). At the same time the plasma AVP levels of 5. 4 ± 1. 3 and 5. 2 ± 1. 1 pg/ml in naloxone- and oxilorphan-treated rats, respectively, were significantly lower than the plasma AVP in control rats of 16. 9 ± 2. 5 pg/ml (P < 0. 001). In another three groups of rats the nonosmotic release of AVP was examined during hypovolemia induced by intraperitoneal 6 % dextran (1. 8 ml/ 100 g body wt). Following intraperitoneal administration of dextran the peak Uosm of 703. 0 ± 87. 8 and 734. 8 ± 99. 1 mosmol/kg H 2 O in naloxone- and oxilorphan-treated rats, respectively, was significantly less than the value in control rats of 1, 169. 3 ± 135. 5 mosmol/kg H 2 O (both P < 0. 02 vs. control). A comparable decrease in blood volume of 13 % occurred in all three groups of animals. During the dextran administration plasma AVP levels in naloxone- and oxilorphan-treated rats increased to 4. 3 ± 1. 0 and 6. 0 ± 2. 0 pg/ml, respectively; both of these values were significantly lower than the plasma AVP of 12. 9 ± 1. 4 pg/ml in control rats (P < 0. 02). The effect of opioid antagonists to impair the osmotic and nonosmotic release of AVP occurred in the absence of differences in mean arterial pressure, glomerular filtration rate and the renal response to AVP. These results, therefore, indicate that opioid peptides are involved in renal water excretion primarily by modulating the central release of AVP...|$|E
