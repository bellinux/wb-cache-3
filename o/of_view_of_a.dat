Given the timing and Twain's views, the story may {{have been inspired by}} the libel trial, according to Mark Twain scholar Shelley Fisher Fishkin. Coleridge ordered 3,000 copies of A Dog's Tale, which were specially printed for him by Harper's.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, {{bibliography}} and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential fates of plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks. It is written from the point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> science journalist with explanations and testimonies backing his predictions. There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.|$|E
5|$|The various {{speakers}} represent different {{facets of}} Holmes's life and experiences. The {{speaker of the}} first installment, for example, is understood {{to be a doctor}} who spent several years studying in Paris, while the second volume—The Professor at the Breakfast-Table—is told from the point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> professor of a distinguished medical school. Although the speakers discuss myriad topics, the flow of conversation always leads to supporting Holmes's Paris-taught conception of science and medicine and how they relate to morality and the mind. Autocrat in particular addresses philosophical issues such as the nature of one's self, language, life and truth.|$|E

5|$|Non-black belts, {{from white}} through to brown, denote the kup ranks. 'Tips' {{denoting}} odd-numbered kup ranks {{are marked by}} a stripe of the higher colour near the right end (from the wearer's point <b>of</b> <b>view)</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> belt of the lower colour. Black belts denote the dan ranks. A specific dan rank {{is represented by the}} number of white bars embroidered on the black belt. A black belt with no bars is a Junior Black Belt, a rank assigned to members considered too young (typically 15 years or younger) for 1st dan. Junior Black Belt members are tested for 1st dan when they reach 18 years of age. One bar denotes 1st dan, two bars denote 2nd dan, and so on. The end of the belt bearing the dan rank also carries embroidery noting the name of the master issuing the promotion (Chong Chul Rhee, Chong Hyup Rhee, or Chong Yoon Rhee).|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring is {{featured}} in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being during the Prague Spring. It follows {{the repercussions of}} increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. The Liberators, by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, from the point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Soviet tank commander. Rock 'n' Roll, a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, {{as well as the}} 1989 Velvet Revolution. Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, H.D. wrote a {{considerable}} amount of poetry, most notably Helen in Egypt (written between 1952–54), an examination from a feminist point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male-centred epic poetry. H.D. used Euripides's play Helen {{as a starting point for}} a reinterpretation of the basis of the Trojan War and, by extension, of war itself. This work has been seen by some critics, including Jeffrey Twitchell-Waas, as H.D.'s response to Pound's Cantos, a work she greatly admired. Other poems from this period include Sagesse, Winter Love and Hermetic Definition. These three were published posthumously with the collective title Hermetic Definition (1972). The poem Hermetic Definition takes as its starting points her love for a man 30 years her junior and the line 'so slow is the rose to open' from Pound's Canto 106. Sagesse, written in bed after H.D. had broken her hip in a fall, serves as a kind of coda to Trilogy. being partly written in the voice of a young female Blitz survivor who finds herself living in fear of the atom bomb. Winter Love was written together with End to Torment and uses as narrator the Homeric figure of Penelope to restate the material of the memoir in poetic form. At one time, H.D. considered appending this poem as a coda to Helen in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but from the point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{implications}} of brane motion in angular directions of Calabi-Yau flux compactifications are discussed {{from the point}} <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> observer living on the worldvolume of the brane and from the point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> observer living elsewhere in the three non-compact dimensions. The brane observer can experience cosmological bounces and cyclic behavior of the scale factor induced by centrifugal angular momentum barriers. Observers living elsewhere in the compactification experience marginally prolonged periods of inflation due to large angular momentum (spinflation). The presence of spinflaton fields (or other fields with non-standard kinetic terms) during inflation may lead to interesting observational signatures in {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation.
