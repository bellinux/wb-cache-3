5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state <b>of</b> <b>affairs</b> on the mainland.|$|E

5|$|Hoffman {{notes that}} A Free Ride {{contains}} many fundamental constituents {{which are the}} characteristics of an archetypal pornographic film.

5|$|Most state-run {{radio and}} {{television}} stations are based in Ankara, but Istanbul is the primary hub of Turkish media.

Sale was part of the Altrincham Union, which ran the nearest work house in Altrincham.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{pushed for}} greater {{consultation}} and {{voice for the}} dominions, and succeeded in having Richard Casey appointed as a permanent political liaison in London who would have access to British government decisions and act as a conduit between Westminster and Melbourne.

However, while fellow dominions generally agreed that the imperial system should be modified, not all shared his vision for closer collaboration and strong ties.
