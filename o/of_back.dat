5|$|Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other spiders, {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs <b>of</b> <b>back</b> legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E

5|$|At {{its peak}} of popularity, the Large Black was used mainly for meat production, {{especially}} bacon. The {{meat from the}} Large Black {{is known for its}} lean quality and flavour without an excess <b>of</b> <b>back</b> fat, but for commercial production it was often crossed with the Yorkshire and Middle White pigs, producing a vigorous hybrid that was well regarded by farmers. However, today commercial processors do not favour the black skin of the purebred Large Black.|$|E
5|$|During Gladbach's opening {{match of}} the 2013–14 season against Bayern Munich, Domínguez conceded a penalty when he handled {{the ball in}} the box. Thomas Müller's {{resultant}} penalty was saved by goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen but Domínguez handled again from the rebound, giving away a second penalty which was duly converted by David Alaba. Gladbach ultimately lost the match 3–1. It was an injury-disrupted season for Domínguez, though, as early in October he suffered a broken collarbone and dislocated shoulder. He managed just 22 appearances for the campaign, and 34 in the next before a spate <b>of</b> <b>back</b> injuries severely curtailed his playing time in the seasons that followed.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Internal Revenue Service began {{investigating}} the Reagans over allegations they owed additional {{tax on the}} gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewelry to the First Lady during {{their time in the}} White House (recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize taxable income even if they are returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount <b>of</b> <b>back</b> taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} weeks, the regiment supported first the 6th, {{and then the}} 5th Brigades in their attacks on Orsogna, {{as part of the}} Moro River Campaign. The tanks struggled to break into Orsogna and although the infantry made some gains, the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into a stalemate, with a number <b>of</b> <b>back</b> and forth actions as winter set in. These movements saw many of the regiment's tanks become stuck in the sodden ground. Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December and the New Zealanders withdrew from the area on 13 January 1944.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the outcome}} for acute {{low back pain}} is positive. Pain and {{disability}} usually improve {{a great deal in}} the first six weeks, with complete recovery reported by 40 to 90%. In those who still have symptoms after six weeks, improvement is generally slower with only small gains up to one year. At one year, pain and disability levels are low to minimal in most people. Distress, previous low back pain, and job satisfaction are predictors of long-term outcome after an episode of acute pain. Certain psychological problems such as depression, or unhappiness due to loss of employment may prolong the episode of low back pain. Following a first episode <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pain, recurrences occur in more than half of people.|$|E
5|$|Part II was {{released}} on November 22, 1989, to similar financial and critical success as the original, finishing as the third highest-grossing film of the year worldwide. The film continues directly from the ending <b>of</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future and follows Marty and Doc as they travel into the future of 2015, an alternative 1985, and 1955 where Marty must repair the future while avoiding his past self from the original film. Part II became notable for its 2015 setting and predictions of technology such as hoverboards. Part III, released on May 25, 1990, continued the story, following Marty as he travels back to 1885 to rescue a time-stranded Doc.|$|E

5|$|The 20th Armoured Regiment disembarked at Taranto on 22 October 1943 and {{gradually}} travelled up Italy towards the Sangro River, which it duly crossed on 3 December. In the following weeks, the regiment {{was involved in}} a supporting role in the 5th and 6th Brigades' attack on Orsogna, as part of the Moro River Campaign. Although the infantry made some gains, the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into a stalemate, with a number <b>of</b> <b>back</b> and forth actions. The regiment lost a number of tanks during the fighting but generally acquitted itself well and was withdrawn from the line the following month. McKergow had been wounded at Orsogna, and Lieutenant Colonel H. A. Purcell took over command of the regiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{body can}} be divided into three parts – the cephalon (head), the pereon (thorax), and the abdomen. The pereon {{comprises}} most of the length of the body. It is divided into seven segments known as pereonites. The rounded and smooth cephalon is fused to the first pereonite; while the highly reduced and almost invisible abdomen is attached to the posterior of the seventh pereonite. In males the first two pereonites are elongated, with the second pereonite being the longest of all the pereonites. They are densely covered with long setae (bristles), giving them a hairy appearance. The second pereonite also has two to three pairs of spines on the back, with an additional two pairs at the sides near the base of the limbs. The remaining pereonites (third to seventh) lack the dense setae of the first two pereonites. The third pereonite has seven pairs of spines at the back while the fourth pereonite has eight pairs. Both have three to seven pairs of spines near the base of the gills. The fifth pereonite has five pairs <b>of</b> <b>back</b> spines and a pair of spines at the sides. The sixth and seventh pereonites each have two pairs <b>of</b> <b>back</b> spines, situated at their centers and near the posterior. Females differ from males in having much shorter pereonites which lack the dense covering of setae. The cephalon and first pereonite also possess a single pair of spines each, though they can sometimes be absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of state inheritance taxes on two estates also plagued Black. In the first case, Governor Stanley {{had made a}} compromise settlement <b>of</b> <b>back</b> taxes with L. V. Harkness before his death. The compromise was criticized, and although Black asked {{the attorney general to}} investigate, the case was not decided during Black's tenure as governor. In the second case, Stanley had appointed three special attorneys to collect inheritance taxes from the estate of Mrs. Robert Worth Bingham. Black wanted the attorneys to resign and save the state their large fees, but refused to remove them outright. This action was made more damning because one of the attorneys was a member of Black's campaign staff.|$|E

5000|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> tracks {{has drawn}} some {{criticism}} from music critics. Many fans dislike {{the use of}} tracks live, feeling that it detracts from the integrity and honesty of a live performance. The amount of criticism tends to vary with the amount <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> tracks used. The playback of additional audio such as rapid, complex synthesizer parts or string section parts while a band plays live tends to draw the least criticism; the heaviest is usually reserved for backup tracks that include {{all or most of}} the backup band performance. Some musicians have spoken out against the use <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> tracks; notably, Elton John said in 2004 that [...] "anyone who lip-syncs in public onstage when you pay 75 pounds to see them should be shot." [...] (Specifically, he levied this criticism at Madonna, who does use backing tracks on tour, although accusations of lip synching were denied by her management, who argued it {{is not the same as}} miming. John later rescinded his claims of lip synching, although he continued to criticize her use <b>of</b> <b>backing</b> tracks.) ...|$|R
5|$|Winehouse's {{battles with}} {{substance}} abuse were {{the subject of much}} media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing <b>of</b> <b>Back</b> to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to having such problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near the fireplace, and a wind {{came down the}} chimney. Her body {{disappeared}} amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part <b>of</b> <b>Back</b> Bay National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
5|$|Bile is {{produced}} by the liver, and serves to eliminate cholesterol and bilirubin from the body, as well as emulsifying of fats {{to make them more}} soluble in water and aid in their digestion. Bile is formed in the liver by hepatocytes (liver cells) and excreted into the common hepatic duct. Part of the bile is stored in the gall bladder because <b>of</b> <b>back</b> pressure (exerted by the sphincter of Oddi), and may be released at the time of digestion. The gallbladder also concentrates the bile by absorbing water and dissolved salts from it. All bile reaches the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) through the common bile duct and the ampulla of Vater. The sphincter of Oddi, located at the junction of the ampulla of Vater and the duodenum, is a circular muscle that controls the release of both bile and pancreatic secretions into the digestive tract.|$|E
