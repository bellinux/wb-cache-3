5|$|Filitti lived secluded in a townhouse on Oltarului Street, in the Bucharest {{quarter of}} Moșilor. He {{repeatedly}} complained about street noises, confiscated the footballs <b>of</b> <b>neighborhood</b> children, and eventually received (from Romanian Police chief Gavrilă Marinescu) a permanent guard {{to protect him}} from distractions. Filitti had few visiting friends, among them Alexandru Filitti-Robănești, teacher Alexandru Pisoschi, historians Emanoil Hagi-Moscu and G. D. Florescu. He was however in constant correspondence with other scholars who shared his passions, including Greek jurist Panagiotis Zepos, His Majesty's Antiquarian G. T. Kirileanu, bibliophile Constantin Karadja, regional historian G. Poboran, academician-priest Nicolae M. Popescu and Hungarian archivist Endre (Andrei) Veress. In addition to the anti-Germanophile Nicolae Iorga, his rivals in academia included a new generation of leading historians, who were targets of his polemical articles: Gheorghe I. Brătianu, George Fotino, Constantin C. Giurescu and P. P. Panaitescu. The latter was however influenced by Filitti's ideas on the sources of landed property, and incorporated them into his own historical narrative.|$|E

5|$|With the school's growing popularity, the Butlers saw {{the need}} for a larger space so they {{developed}} plans to build a 1,500-seat facility. In an article published in the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1997, the estimated cost of the project was quoted at $700,000, with a groundbreaking planned for April 1998. The Butlers initiated their capital campaign on February 18, 1998, with the goal of raising $1.1 million for their new building. By August 1999, they had raised $1 million of their expanded $1.6 million goal for the circus expansion, with plans to break ground on the new facility that November. Part of the funding came from Saint Paul's Sales Tax Revitalization (STAR) program, through which surplus funds were distributed by councilmembers to worthy organizations. A total of $627,183 was disbursed for the circus through the program, split between three STAR components: $450,000 as part <b>of</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> STAR which sought to fund local initiatives, $122,183 as part of Cultural STAR which funded arts and culture programs, and $55,000 from 3rd Ward City Councilmember Pat Harris's discretionary Neighborhood Investment Initiative budget. Another $60,000 came from an anonymous recently retired Saint Paul businessperson.|$|E

40|$|In {{covering}} based rough sets, the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>of</b> {{an element}} is {{the intersection of}} all the covering blocks containing the element. All the neighborhoods form a new covering called a covering <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> In the course of studying under what condition a covering <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> is a partition, the concept of repeat degree is proposed, {{with the help of}} which the issue is addressed. This paper studies further the application of repeat degree on coverings <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> First, we investigate under what condition a covering <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same covering <b>of</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b> Finally, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree.
