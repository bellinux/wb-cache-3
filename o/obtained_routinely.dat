50|$|The {{most common}} method for cantilever-deflection {{measurements}} is the beam-deflection method. In this method, laser {{light from a}} solid-state diode is reflected {{off the back of}} the cantilever and collected by a position-sensitive detector (PSD) consisting of two closely spaced photodiodes, whose output signal is collected by a differential amplifier.Angular displacement of the cantilever results in one photodiode collecting more light than the other photodiode, producing an output signal (the difference between the photodiode signals normalized by their sum), which is proportional to the deflection of the cantilever. The sensitivity of the beam-deflection method is very high, a noise floor on the order of 10 fm Hz− can be <b>obtained</b> <b>routinely</b> in a well-designed system. Although this method is sometimes called the 'optical lever' method, the signal is not amplified if the beam path is made longer. A longer beam path increases the motion of the reflected spot on the photodiodes, but also widens the spot by the same amount due to diffraction, so that the same amount of optical power is moved from one photodiode to the other. The 'optical leverage' (output signal of the detector divided by deflection of the cantilever) is inversely proportional to the numerical aperture of the beam focusing optics, as long as the focused laser spot is small enough to fall completely on the cantilever. It is also inversely proportional to the length of the cantilever.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The {{efficacy}} of <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> chest radiographs (CXRs) on {{admission to the}} intensive care unit (ICU) is largely unknown. The current study investigated the {{efficacy of}} <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> admission CXRs and determined whether the value of this diagnostic test was dependent on patient category. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospective nonrandomized controlled study. including 1081 admission CXRs of 1330 patients admitted to a 28 -bed mixed medical-surgical university-affiliated ICU, over a 10 -month period. To determine the value of admission CXRs, 2 categories of efficacy were used: diagnostic efficacy (the number of CXRs with a new or progressive major finding divided {{by the total number of}} CXRs) and therapeutic efficacy (the number of CXRs resulting in a change in clinical management divided by the total number of CXRs). Efficacy < 15 % was considered low. Patients were subclassified into subcategories on the basis of type of admission. RESULTS: Of all admission CXRs, 227 were clinically indicated and 854 were <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> to establish a baseline prior to admission to ICU. Diagnostic efficacy of <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> admission CXRs was 11 %. The majority of abnormalities were malposition of invasive devices and severe pulmonary congestion. Therapeutic efficacy of <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> admission CXRs was only 5 %. Subgroup analysis showed highest efficacy in nonsurgical patients. CONCLUSIONS: In our mixed medical-surgical ICU the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> admission CXRs is low, though not completely negligible. Highest efficacy of CXRs was found in nonsurgical patients. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether abolishing this diagnostic test is a safe strateg...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{clinical}} {{value of}} postoperative chest radiographs (CXRs) for surgical {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) patients is largely unknown. In the present study, we determined the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of postoperative CXRs for different surgical subgroups and related their efficacy to the time after ICU admission. Methods. A prospective, observational study of consecutive postoperative surgical ICU patients was performed during a 10 month period. We restricted our analysis to CXRs obtained within six hours after admission to the ICU. Diagnostic efficacy was defined {{by the presence of}} predefined major abnormalities; therapeutic efficacy was defined by predefined actions taken because of any abnormality found on postoperative CXRs. Results. Of 857 surgical ICU patients, 670 (78 %) had a postoperative CXR after admission to the ICU. Of these CXRs, 80 were performed for clinical reasons, and 590 were <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> (i. e., these CXRs were made without a reason other than admission to the ICU itself). The diagnostic efficacy of clinically indicated and <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> CXRs was 18 % (14 / 80) and 13 % (79 / 590), respectively. Of all predefined abnormalities found on CXRs, 60 % involved the malposition of invasive devices, such as endotracheal tubes or central venous lines. The therapeutic efficacy of clinically indicated and <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> CXRs was 4 % (3 / 80) and 4 % (26 / 590), respectively. While the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> CXRs were not dependent on timing of admission, the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of clinically indicated CXRs was higher for CXRs taken closer to the time of ICU admission. Conclusion. Although the diagnostic efficacy of clinically indicated and <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> postoperative CXRs in surgical ICU patients appears to be significant, their therapeutic efficacy is low.

40|$|Objective To {{develop a}} {{prediction}} {{model for the}} occurrence of hypertension in pregnancy using clinical variables <b>obtained</b> <b>routinely</b> at the antenatal booking visit prior to 16 weeks gestation. Methods We studied 2334 nulliparous pregnant women participating in two population-based prospective cohort studies. Potential predictors included maternal age, blood pressure, body weight, height, previous miscarriage and smoking history, assessed at the visit booking prior to 16 weeks gestation. The outcome measure was the development of hypertension before 36 weeks of gestation. A prediction model {{was derived from the}} regression model using discrimination, calibration, bootstrapping approaches and transformed into a prediction model usable in clinical practice. Results One hundred and forty-one of 2334 women (6. 0 %) developed hypertension. Main predictors were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and weight. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0. 78, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 75 - 0. 82. Among women with a very low score (19 % of the population) the risk of hypertension was 0. 5 %. In those with a high score (13 % of the population) the risk was 22. 9 %. Conclusion Among nulliparous and initially normotensive women, the use of three simple clinical variables <b>obtained</b> <b>routinely</b> at the antenatal booking visit prior to 16 weeks, can accurately identify women at very low and very high risk of becoming hypertensive before 36 weeks of gestation. When confirmed in recent cohorts, application of the prediction model may lead to a reduction in frequency of antenatal visits for low-risk and increased surveillance for high-risk women.

40|$|Introduction: The chest {{radiograph}} (CXR) is a frequently obtained test {{to complement}} physical examination in ICU and post-surgery PACU patients. The opinion on indications for a CXR {{in these two}} patient categories varies worldwide. One approach is to obtain CXR on indication only, i. e., {{when there is a}} reason to obtain a CXR (so-called ‘on demand’ CXRs). Another approach is to <b>obtain</b> a CXR <b>routinely,</b> i. e., on admission to the ICU or PACU (so-called ‘routine admission’ CXRs) and/or daily thereafter. These CXRs are obtained shortly after admission (so-called ‘routinely obtained admission CXRs’) to the ICU or PACU, and every next day (so-called ‘daily routine’ CXRs), even when there has been no change in the clinical condition and/or treatment. Aims and hypotheses of this thesis: This thesis is a collection of studies evaluating the clinical value of the CXR in intensive care unit (ICU) and post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) patients. Conclusion: The clinical value of the <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> CXRs in intensive care units and post-anesthesia care units is low. We conclude that elimination of daily routine CXRs does not negatively impact outcome of ICU patients. As for the other <b>routinely</b> <b>obtained</b> CXRs we think that ordering these test should be further reviewed...|$|R

In a large number of experiments an increase was found in the concentration of ΦX 174 -neutralizing protein upon incubation of the subcellular systems under suitable conditions.
