5|$|Gloucester's {{precarious}} {{health was}} a constant source <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> to his mother. His death, in 1700 {{at the age of}} eleven, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. The English Parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs <b>of</b> <b>worry,</b> while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, an invigorated Walter ventures out to Chinatown {{to find a}} herbalist for his research; {{unaware of}} the clerk's {{connection}} to the case, Walter casually mentions the giant worms. Walter manages to lose Astrid (Jasika Nicole), who was sent to follow him out <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> {{for his ability to}} travel alone. She goes back to the lab, but is attacked by Triad gang members intent on getting back the remaining worms. Unaware of this, a distraught Walter becomes lost and wastes all his bus money on wrong phone numbers, causing Peter to have to pick him up. Olivia talks to Jarvis, who finally admits to being aware of the medicine. She tells Olivia the whereabouts of the incoming ship, but they find it already empty. Peter and Walter return to the herbalist shop and discover the remaining passengers. The FBI storms in and the survivors are sent to the hospital for care. Feeling remorseful about the trouble he caused, Walter injects himself with a tracking implant and gives Peter the transponder.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, General Joaquín Ibáñez Cuevas y de Valonga, Baron de Eroles marched {{a portion}} of his {{division}} from Martorell to Figueres. Along the way he wiped out French garrisons at Olot and Castellfollit de la Roca, capturing 548 prisoners. Eroles brought his Spanish regulars into Sant Ferran on the 16th. At the same time, the guerillas became very active throughout Catalonia and caused d'Hilliers a lot <b>of</b> <b>worry.</b> Soon General of Brigade Louis Auguste Marchand Plauzonne's division was on the march from Languedoc and Provence. It began arriving at the end of April and would eventually include several French infantry regiments. Before all these troops massed at Figueres, the French position in northern Catalonia was very vulnerable. It was on 16 April that MacDonald appealed to Suchet for help.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a report}} issued by the Government of India, Pilibhit {{is one of the}} Minority Concentrated Areas in India {{on the basis of the}} 2001 census data on population, {{socio-economic}} indicators and basic amenities indicators. Though separated only by a short distance from the outer ranges of the Himalayas, Pilibhit consists entirely of a level plain, containing depressions but no hills and is intersected by several streams. Pilibhit is one of the forest rich areas of Uttar Pradesh, which has very high tourism potential. The almost 54km-long Indo-Nepal international border makes Pilibhit a highly sensitive for security purposes. According to an estimate by the Government of India, Pilibhit has 45.23% of its population living under the poverty line. Increasing population and unemployment is a cause <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> in the area, and many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and government-run organizations have initiated projects to provide employment, but human resources are yet to be exploited in full. The city came third-bottom in terms of hygiene and sanitation in a Government ranking list of 423 towns and cities in India.|$|E

500|$|Zotov {{became one}} of Peter's first friends, and the two {{remained}} close throughout Zotov's life. Lindsey Hughes, a 20th-century historian, has criticized Zotov for giving Peter an education that did not teach what a future tsar ought to know. Her contemporary, Robert K. Massie, {{has argued that the}} education was the best possible one for a curious boy like Peter, because it was unlikely that he would ever become tsar, as his half-brother, Ivan V, was before him in the line of succession. According to Massie, although Zotov may have not taught Peter at the highest possible level, he delivered [...] "the best education for a mind like Peter's", as it [...] "stimulated [...] curiosity" [...] and allowed him to become [...] "in large part, a self-taught man". Zotov's closeness to the Tsar later became a source <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> to others in government, many of whom—including even the powerful Menshikov—feared his influence.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{increasing}} evidence that stressors {{contribute to the}} severity of chronic inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis. However, much less is known about possible individual differences between patients in their stress reactivity, particularly the role of cognitive and behavioural factors, such as the role <b>of</b> <b>worrying</b> or scratching behaviour, in reaction to itch. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the direct and moderating role of individual stress reactivity factors, particularly of cognitive and behavioural patterns <b>of</b> <b>worrying</b> and scratching, {{on the relationship between}} daily stressors and changes in disease severity [Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) ] and itch in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: Patients were followed for 6 months through monthly clinical and self-reported measures of daily stressors, itch, disease severity and individual reactivity factors. Data from 62 patients were suitable for analysis. RESULTS: Cognitive and behavioural patterns <b>of</b> <b>worrying</b> and scratching were both independently related to an increase 4 weeks later in disease severity (PASI) and itch, at moments when patients experienced a high level of daily stressors. At these moments, stressors also interacted with vulnerability factors, showing that patients with more daily stress and high worrying and scratching had particularly worsened disease severity and itch. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with high levels <b>of</b> <b>worrying</b> and scratching are most vulnerable to the impact of stressors on their psoriasis, particularly at highly stressful periods...|$|R
500|$|The Whitsun festivals, {{suspended}} during Holst's absence, resumed at Dulwich in 1920. Joseph's part in {{this event}} is unrecorded, but she made a major contribution to the following year's festivities, which began beside the Thames at Isleworth and concluded on Whit Monday at SPGS in the gardens of Bute House. For the Monday's celebrations Joseph devised a presentation of Purcell's semi-opera from 1690, Dioclesian. Writing of the occasion after Joseph's death, Holst recalled that she had woven Purcell's music and Thomas Betterton's text, both long neglected, [...] "into a delightful out-door pageant founded on a fairy story, complete with lost princess, dragon and princely hero". Not satisfied with planning {{every aspect of the}} outdoor performance, Joseph prepared an indoors version of the entertainment, should the weather require this. The production was a great success, and was repeated that summer in Hyde Park and, [...] in October 1921, at the Old Vic theatre. Throughout this considerable organisational task, Holst wrote, [...] "Jane gave the minimum <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> to each person concerned by giving herself the maximum of hard work and forethought".|$|E
500|$|Though Bobby is [...] "fairly content, {{at least}} on the surface, to be alone in the world", he slowly comes to be a {{surrogate}} father for Sam and Dean. On this relationship, Beaver feels that [...] "Bobby's concerned about them both, with Dean's sense of self, but there's a sort of undercurrent <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> about Sam. Sam seems to have more of the heart of darkness about him than Dean does... I just sense that there's this ongoing watchful eye that Bobby's got on Sam." [...] Although he loves each of them [...] "like a son", Bobby is willing to allow the brothers to put themselves in harm's way if it is absolutely necessary. For example, when Dean wants to detoxify Sam from his addiction to demon blood in [...] "When the Levee Breaks", Bobby instead points out that Sam giving in to his demonic abilities could help him to prevent Lucifer's return, even though the amount of blood required to kill Lilith would [...] "change [...] forever". Beaver noted, [...] "Bobby is old enough that he's fairly clear-headed about what the priorities ought to be. Bobby's position is, more or less, 'if you have a family member with a drinking problem and you want to stage an intervention, you might not want to do it in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.'" ...|$|E
500|$|While fanciers {{sought to}} {{identify}} and standardize the breed and its description through the late 19th century, the Scottish Terrier was known by many different names: the Highland, the Cairn, Diehard, and most often, the Aberdeen Terrier—named because of the abundant number of the dogs {{in the area and}} because a J. A. Adamson of Aberdeen successfully exhibited his dogs during the 1870s. Roger Rough, a dog owned by Adamson, Tartan, a dog owned by Mr Paynton Piggott, Bon Accord, owned by Messrs Ludlow and Bromfield, and Splinter II owned by Mr Ludlow, were early winners of dog exhibitions and are the four dogs from which all Scottish Terrier pedigrees ultimately began. It is often said that all present day Scotties stem from a single , Splinter II, and two sires. In her book, The New Scottish Terrier, Cindy Cooke refers to Splinter II as the [...] "foundation matron of the modern Scottish Terrier." [...] Cooke goes on to say [...] "For whatever reason, early breeders line bred on this bitch to the virtual exclusion of all others. Mated to Tartan, she produced Worry, the dam of four champions.

500|$|The NTSB {{investigators}} {{found that the}} weather data that the flight crew received in Medellín was nine to ten hours old. Additionally, the alternate airport on the flight plan, Logan International Airport in Boston, was forecast to be below the safe minima for landing. The NTSB also stated that the flight crew {{should have been more}} aware of these problems and cited these deficiencies as evidence of inadequacies in the dispatch of the airplane. The NTSB also found no evidence that the flight crew ever requested weather information en route or communicated with Avianca dispatchers about their fuel status and intents as other flights did. Flight 52 did not make contact with FAA flight service stations or flight watch en route, and the NTSB was unable to determine why. The flight did not express any concern to ATC about their fuel situation during the first two holding patterns that the flight made. The first indication <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> came at 20:09 when the flight crew inquired about delays at Boston. The NTSB posited that the flight crew might have become confused about the [...] "expect further clearance" [...] (EFC) times they were given. This confusion may have been the reason that the flight continued to hold, burning up its reserve fuel {{to the point where it}} could no longer divert to Boston.|$|E

[...] Schumacher added that his team was confident of securing third in the Constructors' Championship; although he could not match Häkkinen's pace, he praised the team for his car's set-up. Coulthard was disappointed with his fourth-place finish, and thought his team's decision to call him into the pit lane after his competitors cost him the victory; however, he remained confident about his championship chances. Button was also disappointed to finish fifth: [...] "It was a bad race for me, if not the worst. The car was working well at the start, but when I tried to pass Jarno I went in a bit late." [...] Trulli refused to criticise Button after the race, believing that Button made a mistake. Fisichella and Verstappen felt similarly about their lap-nine collision, with Fisichella saying that he [...] "felt sorry" [...] for Verstappen and describing his weekend as [...] "disastrous".

2500|$|With {{regard to}} the {{condition}} of healthy narcissism, {{it is suggested that}} this is correlated with good psychological health.

Other researchers suggested that healthy narcissism cannot be seen as 'good' or 'bad'; however, it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured. In certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships, and with certain outcome variables, such as feeling good about oneself, healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with other outcome variables, such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{examined}} (a) {{the demographic}} and clinical correlates <b>of</b> <b>worries</b> about hypoglycemia in adult {{family members of}} adults with diabetes, and (b) the association <b>of</b> these <b>worries</b> with measures <b>of</b> diabetes support. Methods: The second multinational Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs (DAWN 2) study cross-sectionally surveyed 2057 family members from 17 countries. Participants completed questions about demographics, diabetes, and psychosocial functioning, including worry about overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Analyses included hierarchical ordinal and linear regression. Results: Eighty-five percent of family members (n = 1661) were at least occasionally very worried {{about the risk of}} hypoglycemic events overall. Correlates <b>of</b> <b>worries</b> about hypoglycemia included female gender, higher age and lower education in the family member, younger age of the person with diabetes and this person being a parent or another adult (versus spouse or partner), insulin or non-insulin injectable treatment, severe or non-severe hypoglycemia in the past 12 months, and family member recognition <b>of</b> hypoglycemia. Elevated <b>worries</b> about hypoglycemia had a significant independent association with increased odds of diabetes-related family arguments and family member frustration in providing helpful support (OR range 1. 60 – 3. 72). High levels <b>of</b> <b>worries</b> about hypoglycemia were associated with increased odds of attending diabetes-related health-care visits. Worries about hypoglycemia were not associated with family member involvement in diabetes care. Similar results were found for worries about nocturnal events. Conclusion: Worries about hypoglycemia were common in family members and were associated with suboptimal diabetes support. This issue therefore deserves increased clinician attention...|$|R
