It sold 30,000 copies in North America and 50,000 in Europe as of November 2007, a few weeks after release in North America. Initial sales were lower than those for Children of Mana, the other Nintendo DS title in the series {{released}} one year earlier. Koichi Ishii attributed this to the overall lack <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> popularity of the RTS genre in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{and the ability}} to attend to an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal relationships that rely on the sharing <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> knowledge. Infants are highly motivated to share experience. An infant's motivation to engage in joint attention is strong enough that infants voluntarily turn away from interesting sights to engage in joint attention with others.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities <b>of</b> <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E

5|$|This {{intolerance}} for incompetence {{served him}} well when he accepted the invitation of Dunn to be his replacement {{as director of the}} Aggie Band. Adams began his tenure with an undisciplined band devoid <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> ravaged by years of war, but in his first year of leadership, the ranks of the band quickly swelled to 225members. Infantry and field artillery associations were no longer required by the Army and Adams changed the units' names to the Maroon and White Bands.|$|E
5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (framing) <b>of</b> <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Tolbert also {{accepts the}} Slender Man as folkloric and {{suggests}} {{it represents a}} process he calls “reverse ostension.” Ostension in folkloristics {{is the process of}} acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples <b>of</b> <b>experience,</b> <b>and</b> it involves the combination of these elements into a body of “traditional” narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s Scottish {{literature}} enjoyed {{another major}} revival, particularly {{associated with a}} group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic, poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum. Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz, editor of Polygon Books. Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman, Alasdair Gray, Liz Lochhead, Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail. In the 1990s major, prize-winning, Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting (1993), Warner's Morvern Callar (1995), Gray's Poor Things (1992) and Kelman's How Late It Was, How Late (1994). These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> used vivid vernacular language (including expletives and Scots dialect). Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid, Frederic Lindsay, Christopher Brookmyre, Quintin Jardine, Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels. This period also saw {{the emergence of a new}} generation of Scottish poets that became leading figures on the UK stage, including Don Paterson, Robert Crawford, Kathleen Jamie and Carol Ann Duffy. Glasgow-born Carol Ann Duffy was named as Poet Laureate in May 2009, the first woman, the first Scot and the first openly gay poet to take the post.|$|E
5|$|Ron Wolf, who {{had been}} the Oakland Raiders’ Director of Player Personnel since 1963 and was {{credited}} with much of their success, was hired as Vice President of Operations. Los Angeles Rams general manager Don Klosterman and former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram were early candidates for the job; but Klosterman withdrew, and Stram was interested in a combined coach/general manager position. Wolf was directly responsible for the drafting of 20 of the Raiders’ 22 starters, and his effectiveness at scouting talent was believed to be a major reason for the Raiders’ being one of the few teams not to belong to a scouting combine. The Buccaneers quickly developed a Raiders flavor, choosing to hire a scouting staff rather than rely on the computerized scouting reports that almost all other teams were using, and hiring Raiders business manager Ken LaRue to serve in the same capacity. One of Wolf’s responsibilities was to assist in the hiring of a head coach. Wolf persuaded Culverhouse {{that it would be better}} for any prospect to gain a year <b>of</b> <b>experience</b> <b>and</b> knowledge in his present job, rather than be named at expansion time, when there was little or no advantage to having a coach in place.|$|E

In addition, <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination can be a barrier to successful recovery and rehabilitation. The {{aim of this study}} was to study the level <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated (the expectation to be rejected) discrimination among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders as well as the association between both concepts of discrimination. In addition, the association <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination with clinical and social characteristics was investigated. A cross-sectional survey among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders in the Netherlands was carried out in 2012. Individuals in treatment (N = 186) completed a self-reported questionnaire about <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination. Descriptive statistics and chi-squared analyses were performed to investigate the level <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination and the association between both concepts. Linear regression analyses were used to investigate the association with clinical and social characteristics, such as occupational status and type of treatment. Individuals in treatment for substance use disorders reported high levels <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination. Respondents experienced most discrimination in family ties, intimate relationships <b>and</b> friendships. <b>Experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination were both positively correlated. Having complex substance use problems and a longer history of substance use problems was related to higher levels <b>of</b> <b>experienced</b> discrimination. In conclusion, <b>experienced</b> <b>and</b> anticipated discrimination were highly prevalent among individuals in treatment for substance use disorders. Attention in addiction treatment for adequate coping with discrimination may be needed in order to achieve successful social participation and rehabilitation of these individuals...|$|R
