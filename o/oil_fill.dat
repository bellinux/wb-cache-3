40|$|When quartz-rich sands {{are buried}} and heated, pore space is {{gradually}} filled by precipitation of quartz cement from aqueous formation fluids. Here we examine whether {{the presence of}} oil in the pore space can retard or halt this loss of porosity by slowing or stopping quartz cementation. The effect of <b>oil</b> <b>fill</b> on quartz cementation is examined by using the distribution of quartz cement in the Brae Formation deep-water sandstone reservoir of the Miller oil field (North Sea). Petrographic data demonstrate that sandstones from the oil zone have much less quartz cement, and more porosity, than sandstones from the water zone. Sandstones in both oil and water zones are compositionally and texturally identical and have been affected by a similar burial history. Kinetic modeling of the cementation process suggests that progressive oil charging has slowed quartz-cement growth rates by at least two orders of magnitude, halting it completely in the most extreme cases. Our data demonstrate that early oil charging in the crestal part of an anticline can preserve porosity in deeply buried sandstones. This knowledge is especially relevant to porosity prediction for petroleum exploration in deeply buried sandstones...|$|E

The simulation {{was done for}} the probe used for measurements reported by Lister et al. (1990). These measure-ments were reduced by the conventional method of subtracting a time delay to maximize the linearity of temperature plotted against Bullard's (1954) F (a, z) function. The frictional heating from entry into the sea-floor could be extrapolated to equilibrium {{by the use of}} small, but rather variable, time delay. However, the decays from a calibrated heat pulse, used to calculate thermal conductivity, required large time delays that increased up the probe. We have found that the heater-pulse decays are correctly reproduced by a multi-cylindrical model corresponding to the measured dimensions and materials of probe construction, except for some super heating at early times due to the non-cylindrical nature of the heater spiral.

40|$|The project aims at {{investigating}} how effectively {{the groundwater}} can be isolated from diesel oil that has leaked from a failed tank by covering the ground surface {{in a few}} hundred square meters large area confined by soil dikes. The scenario to be considered is a sudden outflow of oil over the ground followed by removal of the oil {{after a period of}} time taken here to be 2 weeks. The depth of the <b>oil</b> <b>fill</b> in this period is assumed to be 0. 5 m, which will cause oil to penetrate and migrate into the membrane built on the ground surface. The problem to be solved is to predict to what depth the membrane will be contaminated by oil, i. e. how much of it that has to be removed and replaced after the two weeks. The ground surface is assumed to be perfectly horizontal. The project comprised oedometer testing of the artificially prepared membrane clay, which contains a small amount (11 % by weight) and which is a candidate material for isolation of the ground from oil that can leak out from failing tanks or valves. The oedometer tests were made for determining the (fluid) conductivity and swelling pressure of the membrane material for water and for diesel oil and they were complemented by column tests for simulating of the function when oil is let into air-dry membrane material, and into water saturated material, respectively.

40|$|This Final Report on the Monitoring Phase of {{the former}} Weeks Island Strategic Petroleum Reserve crude oil storage {{facility}} details the results of five years of monitoring of various surface accessible quantities at the decommissioned facility. The Weeks Island mine was authorized by the State of Louisiana as a Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil storage facility from 1979 until decommissioning of the facility in 1999. Discovery of a sinkhole over the facility in 1992 with freshwater inflow to the facility threatened {{the integrity of the}} oil storage and led to the decision to remove the <b>oil,</b> <b>fill</b> the chambers with brine, and decommission the facility. Thereafter, a monitoring phase, by agreement between the Department of Energy and the State, addressed facility stability and environmental concerns. Monitoring of the surface ground water and the brine of the underground chambers from the East Fill Hole produced no evidence of hydrocarbon contamination, which suggests that any unrecovered oil remaining in the underground chambers has been contained. Ever diminishing progression of the initial major sinkhole, and a subsequent minor sinkhole, with time was verification of the response of sinkholes to filling of the facility with brine. Brine filling of the facility ostensively eliminates any further growth or new formation from freshwater inflow. Continued monitoring of sinkhole response, together with continued surface surveillance for environmental problems, confirmed the intended results of brine pressurization. Surface subsidence measurements over the mine continued throughout the monitoring phase. And finally, the outward flow of brine was monitored as a measure of the creep closure of the mine chambers. Results of each of these monitoring activities are presented, with their correlation toward assuring the stability and environmental security of the decommissioned facility. The results suggest that the decommissioning was successful and no contamination of the surface environment by crude oil has been found...|$|E

40|$|Low {{friction}} lubricant development {{provides a}} worthwhile contribution to vehicle CO 2 emission reduction. Conventional low friction lubricant development focuses on empirical processes using out dated engine technology and old test methods. This strategy is inefficient and restricts the lubricant's potential. A new method {{proposed in the}} present research combines tribological simulations with rig, engine and vehicle tests. This approach provides insights undocumented until now. The contribution to CO 2 emission reduction from individual engine components on vehicle drive cycles that include warm-up is predicted using lubricants down to the new SAE 8 viscosity grade. A bearing model is used to design the lubricant's non Newtonian characteristics to achieve friction reduction. An isoviscous lubricant with a viscosity of 4. 6 cSt is shown to achieve the minimum friction in the bearing. The research shows that by starting with lubricants having kinematic viscosities higher than this value, {{it is possible to}} improve lubricant performance by lowering viscosity index (VI), introducing shear thinning, or reducing the density and pressure viscosity coefficient. Conversely, for lubricants with lower starting viscosities it is shown that higher VI values, more shear-stable lubricants and higher densities and pressure viscosity coefficients are required. The model predicts that high oil film pressures occur in the bearing and cause significant local lubricant viscosity increase (300 %), indicating that the lubricant's pressure viscosity behaviour is important here, despite the contact being conformal. Simulation and motored engine testing establishes lubricant behaviour in the piston-to-bore conjunction. This analysis identifies a poor correlation between measured and predicted values at low engine speeds. A rig-on-liner tribometer shows that this error is attributable to a deficiency in the simulation's characterisation of boundary regime friction. An oil pump test determines how a modern variable displacement oil pump (and its control system) responds to lowering viscosity. The hypothesis that low viscosity lubricants cause the parasitic load from this component to increase is disproven using this component-level rig test. Chassis dynamometer testing compares the CO 2 reduction performance of lubricant thermal management systems to the values achieved by reducing the viscosity grade. CO 2 reductions of between 0. 4 % and 1. 0 % are identified using a cold-start new European drive cycle (NEDC) with a 5 W- 30 preheated to 60 °C and 90 °C respectively. Reductions in CO 2 emissions between 0. 4 % and 1. 2 % are found on the NEDC by lowering the <b>oil</b> <b>fill</b> volume from 5. 1 L to 2. 1 L. For the unmodified case, a 3. 7 % reduction in CO 2 emissions is reported by reducing the viscosity grade from a 5 W 30 to an SAE 8 in the NEDC. The performance of a novel external oil reservoir is simulated to understand its ability to retain oil temperature during the vehicle cool-down procedure. An oil temperature of 65 °C {{at the end of the}} soak period (following a prior test where the oil was assumed to reach 90 °C) is predicted by installing insulation to the reservoir and indicates that a viable method to achieve the CO 2 benefits identified through lubricant preheating tests exists. A full vehicle model combines the outputs from each of these sub-models to predict lubricant performance on the NEDC the new World-wide harmonized light duty test cycle (WLTC). This new approach provides a tool that enables next generation low friction lubricants to be developed. The model predicts that an SAE 8 lubricant can reduce CO 2 emissions by 2. 8 % on the NEDC and 1. 9 % on the WLTC compared to a 5 W- 30. A theoretical experiment, where all lubricant related friction was deleted from the simulation, predicts that lubricant-related CO 2 emissions are 8. 7 % on the NEDC and reduce to 6. 3 % on the WLTC. These results indicate that the planned adoption of the WLTC in September 2017 reduces the potential contribution to CO 2 emission reduction from lubricants by 28 %. </p...|$|E
