5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range <b>of</b> <b>ecological</b> niches and exploit many {{different}} food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E

40|$|The {{ecological}} footprint is an indicator that measures {{the size of}} the bioproductive land needed to provide resources and disposal of waste from existing technologies. It's an important sign of the sustainability of the population on Earth. As we are currently facing an impending lack of many natural resources,this is an important issue. The biomass we use is created by plants,which play a critical role not only in functioning of the ecosystems,but in the concept <b>of</b> the <b>ecological</b> footprint. Individual types of vegetation differ in their relative contribution the overall ecosystems production and consequently to the calculation <b>of</b> the <b>ecological</b> footprint <b>of</b> various lands. For this reason this work is concerned not only with the concept <b>of</b> the <b>ecological</b> footprint, but also with the services that plants provide. The objective of this work is to compile the current information on the evolution of the concept <b>of</b> the <b>ecological</b> footprint,what preceded its creation,and to focus on the important role of plants in the functioning of ecosystems,allowing for the calculation <b>of</b> the <b>ecological</b> footprint. The evolution of the concept <b>of</b> the <b>ecological</b> footprint is covered in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 deals with ecosystem services,their rating,and the critical role that plants play in them.

5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H.

The theoretical underpinnings of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function <b>of</b> <b>ecological</b> communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E

The entropy weight method and improved TOPSIS were employed in the study on the spatial difference <b>of</b> land <b>ecological</b> security among cities in Shandong in 2013. The results showed that:(1) The grade <b>of</b> the land <b>ecological</b> security evaluation in Shandong Province included "relatively safety", "critical safety" and "less safety".

The evaluation index system based on PSR model can reflect the relationship among the factors <b>of</b> land <b>ecological</b> system, and the TOPSIS can reveal {{the gap between the}} land ecological security and it's ideal state.

5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike.

There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% <b>of</b> <b>ecological</b> damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range <b>of</b> <b>ecological</b> positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly {{specialised}} in their habitat or food requirements.

Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant eating, and piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E
