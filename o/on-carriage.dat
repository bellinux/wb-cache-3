50|$|As heavy field howitzers {{and light}} siege howitzers {{of the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries used {{ammunition}} {{of the same size}} and types, there was a marked tendency for the two types to merge. At first, this was largely a matter of the same basic weapon being employed on two different mountings. Later, as <b>on-carriage</b> recoil-absorbing systems eliminated many of the advantages that siege platforms had enjoyed over field carriages, the same combination of barrel assembly, recoil mechanism and carriage was used in both roles.|$|E
50|$|The new M102 was {{substantially}} lighter, weighing {{little more}} than 1½ tons whereas the M101A1 weighed approximately 2½ tons; as a result, more ammunition could be carried during heliborne operations, and a 3/4-ton truck rather than a 2½-ton truck was its prime mover for ground operations. Another major advantage of the M102 was {{that it could be}} traversed a full 6,400 mils; the M101A1 had a limited <b>on-carriage</b> traverse, which required its trails (stabilizing legs) to be shifted if further traverse was necessary. The M102 fires the same semi-fixed ammunition as the M101, but its longer barrel (32 calibres versus 22 calibres on M101) allows a slightly higher muzzle velocity and thus enhanced firing range. A low silhouette made the new weapon a more difficult target for the enemy, an advantage that far outweighed the disadvantage of being somewhat less convenient to load.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Learnable Evolution Model is a {{stochastic}} optimization method {{which employs}} machine learning {{to guide the}} optimization process. LEM 3, its newest implementation, combines its machine learning mode with other search operators. The presented research concerns its application within a multi-agent system for autonomous control of container <b>on-carriage</b> operations. Specifically, LEM 3 is used by transport management agents that act {{on behalf of the}} trucks of a forwarding agency for the planning of individual transport schedules. ...|$|E
30|$|The initial {{investments}} in the fleet of the non-liftable semi-trailers allow their usage solely in this transport mode. The reasons for forwarders to invest in non-liftable semi-trailers include a higher payload (200 – 500  kg) and, more relevantly, lower costs (CargoBeamer 2013). In contrast, to increase the attractiveness of investing in liftable semi-trailers, several policy incentives were introduced. Semi-trailers {{that are used in}} CCFT were allowed to transport 44 t rather than 40 t in the RFT (§ 34 par. 6 StVZO) and were exempted from the road vehicle tax (§ 3 par. 9 KraftStG). In addition, road pre- and <b>on-carriage</b> were exempted from the weekend and holiday driving ban (§ 30 par. 3 StVO). An additional advantage of CCFT-use for semi-trailers is the possible abolishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) regulation no. 3820 / 85 on driving hours and rest periods, which is applied across the European Union. According to this rule, the driver must have rest for 45  min after each 4.5  h of driving. Moreover, after a driving period of 9  h, an 11 -h rest period must be taken. Because the main run in the CCFT is performed via rail to limit the pre- or post-carriage to as short a time as possible (UN/ECE 2001 : 18), the EEC regulation is not applied.|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, we {{describe}} transactions {{in international trade}} transaction, and we zoom in on the ocean transport part of that transaction. We use transaction cost economics as our theoretical framework. We highlighted a number of ocean transport related processes that generate uncertainty and costs in logistics chains: {{the use of the}} container in pre- and <b>on-carriage,</b> the release process of the container in port, and the formalities related to the supervision on vessels coming into ports in the country of destination. A first estimate of the uncertainties and costs that follow from these processes (delays, additional time required for supervision) reveals that the uncertainties far outweigh the additional costs. This holds especially because companies take into account a certain degree of uncertainty in their logistics planning, even though the probability is very low. We extend this discussion with the fundamental problem of the information quality of the ocean carrier documentation, the ship manifest, which has negative consequences for risk assessment by Customs in Europe. We conclude that specific processes that are connected to ocean transportation do result in time loss, uncertainty and, to a lesser extent, in additional costs that impact the efficiency of logistics and supply chains. The transaction costs are predominantly generated as additional charges on the ocean transport bill, as a result of supervision, {{and as a result of}} the use of the container. Transaction cost theory predicts that if such frictions exist, there will be a tendency to move from a market relationship to a more hierarchical relationship between parties involved in the transaction. We observe that international transportation by sea is in an intermediate position between market and hierarchy and we identify at least two important developments in the Port of Rotterdam and its European hinterland that can be recognized as a further shift towards more hierarchy as a result of the frictions we identified...|$|E
