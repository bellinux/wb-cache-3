40|$|AbstractWe prove analogues for {{elliptic}} interpolation {{functions of}} Macdonaldʼs {{version of the}} Littlewood identity for (skew) Macdonald polynomials, in the process developing an interpretation of general elliptic “hypergeometric” sums as skew interpolation functions. One such analogue has an interpretation as a “vanishing integral”, generalizing a result <b>of</b> <b>Rains</b> <b>and</b> Vazirani (2007) [17]; the structure of this analogue gives sufficient insight to enable us to conjecture elliptic versions {{of most of the}} other vanishing integrals <b>of</b> <b>Rains</b> <b>and</b> Vazirani (2007) [17] as well. We are thus led to formulate ten conjectures, each of which {{can be viewed as a}} multivariate quadratic transformation, and can be proved in a number of special cases...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav passed just {{to the east of}} Cape Hatteras, areas of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia {{experienced}} heavy rain and tropical storm force winds. Parts of the Outer Banks received 2–5inches (50–125mm) <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> winds of up to 50mph (80km/h), and the Coast Guard station at Cape Hatteras reported a wind gust of 78mph (125km/h). The storm produced storm surges of 3– along the Outer Banks, and 1– along the southeastern coast of Virginia. These surges, combined with strong winds and high sea swells, resulted in minor flooding, mainly in Ocracoke and Hatteras Village, North Carolina. A weak waterspout also touched down on Silver Lake near Ocracoke and moved onshore, but only minor roof damage was reported. Sporadic power outages were also reported. One person died after suffering injuries in the high surf, and 40 other people had to be rescued from riptides and storm surges. Damage in the region amounted to $100,000 (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|England {{had four}} captains in Gatting, John Emburey, Chris Cowdrey and Graham Gooch, but each Test ended in West Indian dominance. They won each match except the first Test, which was drawn because <b>of</b> <b>rain,</b> <b>and</b> the series {{finished}} 4–0. The West Indies pace attack {{was the main}} difference between teams with Marshall being the most dangerous bowler, taking 35 wickets at an average of 12.65. This included a 7/22 in the third Test which he bowled with a broken left hand. Marshall was supported by Ambrose's bowling which yielded 22 wickets. After this series both teams would go into decline. Many of the great West Indian players such as Richards and Marshall would soon retire, and their dominance of the Test stage was nearing its end.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains {{fell over}} Taumalipas, with 348.8mm {{measured}} along the Tamesí River. Widespread flooding forced some 400families to evacuate throughout the state; 70trapped families in El Mante {{had to be}} rescued from their flooded homes. At {{the height of the}} storm, high-voltage electrocutions due to downed power lines caused two deaths in the municipalities of Tampico and Reynosa while critically injuring two workers in Matamoros. By July4, two more deaths were reported in the state, though their causes remain unspecified. Approximately 40,000residents suffered property damage to their homes. A state of emergency was declared in the municipalities of Tampico, Ciudad Madero, Altamira, and González in light of the damage. Broken drains and sewers in the storm's wake increased the risk of cholera through contaminated water. Damage estimates in Tamaulipas exceeded Mex$67million (US$5.8million). In neighboring San Luis Potosí, Arlene dropped 12.18in (309.4mm) <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> claimed the lives of five people, two due to drownings.

5|$|In the Babylonian star {{catalogues}} {{dating from}} at least 1100 BCE, what later became known as Corvus was called the Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). As with more familiar Classical astronomy, it was placed sitting on {{the tail of the}} Serpent (Greek Hydra). The Babylonian constellation was sacred to Adad, the god <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> storm; in the second Millennium it would have risen just before the autumnal rainy season. John H. Rogers observed that Hydra signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, were introduced to the Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and summer solstices respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the celestial equator in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} World Championship Grand Prix in 1950, red flags {{have been shown}} in seventy races, with the latest one being at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix on 25 June 2017. Twenty-six were {{restarted}} on the first lap. Thirteen races were not restarted, nine because <b>of</b> <b>rain</b> <b>and</b> four due to accidents involving drivers. Five races were stopped due to incidents that resulted in fatalities: The 1975 Spanish Grand Prix was stopped on lap twenty-nine and not restarted after Rolf Stommelen's car crashed into a spectator area, killing five people. The 1978 Italian Grand Prix was red-flagged after a massive crash that ultimately contributed {{to the death of}} Ronnie Peterson. The 1982 Canadian Grand Prix was halted on the first lap after Riccardo Paletti was killed when his car collided with the back of Didier Pironi's Ferrari. The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was red-flagged on lap five following the fatal accident of Ayrton Senna, in which his car crashed into a wall at the Tamburello curve. The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was red-flagged for a second time following a serious collision between Jules Bianchi and a recovery vehicle which would ultimately prove to be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The first cacti {{are thought}} to have been only {{slightly}} succulent shrubs or small trees whose leaves carried out photosynthesis. They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought. If Pereskia clade A is a good model of these early cacti, then, although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby, they had already evolved strategies to conserve water (some of which are present in members of other families in the order Caryophyllales). These strategies included being able to respond rapidly to periods <b>of</b> <b>rain,</b> <b>and</b> keeping transpiration low by using water very efficiently during photosynthesis. The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata. Like Pereskia species today, early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C3 mechanism, where carbon dioxide is used continuously in photosynthesis, to CAM cycling, in which when the stomata are closed, carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in photosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{precipitation}} effectiveness on the yield of Irish potato in Jos-Plateau, Nigeria. Rainfall data for 20 years (1989 – 2008) was collected from National Root Crop Research Institute (NRCRI), Vom, Plateau state. Precipitation effectiveness indices including dry spell or drought, onset dates <b>of</b> <b>rains,</b> <b>and</b> hydrologic ratio were derived from and used together with total annual rainfall data to assess their effects on yields of Irish potato. The indices were subjected to various descriptive and inferential statistical techniques, including correlation and regression analysis. While the correlation analysis was employed to determine the degree of relationship between yields and the indices, the regression technique was adopted to identify the factors that are critical in influencing yields. Results reveal that while rainfall total correlates positively with yields, dry spell, onset dates <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> <b>and</b> hydrologic ratio exhibit negative correlation with yields. The correlation between onset dates <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> <b>and</b> yields {{was found to be}} statistically significant at 5 % while others are insignificant. Step-wise regression analysis identifies onset dates <b>of</b> <b>rains</b> as the most critical factor affecting Irish potato in the area. The coefficient of determination of r 2 = 0. 219 shows that the index contributes about 22 % to variations in the yields of Irish potato on the Plateau. It was recommended that further studies should consider combine effects of climate and other factors like farming practices, soil factors and cultural practices of the farmers so as to generate comprehensive information for better agricultural planning and development in the area...|$|R

30|$|It {{seems that}} the predicative {{function}} of these particles is still preserved in modern Mandarin. For example, {{the realization of the}} event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> in 6 is signaled by the predicative utterance particle 了 le (cf. “There is an event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> <b>and</b> this event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> has been realized”), which inherits the aspectual meaning from the verb 了 liao ‘finish’. The temporal meaning of the event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> in 7 is associated with 來著 laizhe (cf. “There was an event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> <b>and</b> this event <b>of</b> <b>raining</b> had come to its existence”), which inherits the existential and directional meaning from the deictic verb 來 lai ‘come’ and the affirmative meaning from 著 zhuo ‘order’. The evaluative mood of 吧 ba in 8 can be interpreted as a solicitation of approval or agreement from the hearer that may settle certain debates or uncertainties (cf. “certain uncertainty of your going can be ceased”), which inherits the meaning of settling down from the verb 罷 ba ‘stop’. It is highly likely that these three particles in Mandarin, namely, 了 le, 來著 laizhe, and 吧 ba, all have a verbal origin, which {{can be traced back to}} verbs like 了 liao ‘finish’, 來 lai ‘come’, 著 zhuo ‘order’, and 罷 ba ‘stop’.|$|R
