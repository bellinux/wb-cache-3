5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the <b>open</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E

25|$|The River {{class are}} {{significantly}} {{larger than the}} Island-class vessels and have a large <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> aft allowing them to be fitted with equipment for a specific role, which can include fire-fighting, disaster relief and anti-pollution work. For this purpose, a 25 tonne capacity crane is fitted. In addition, the deck is strong enough for the transport of various tracked and wheeled light vehicles, or an LCVP. The class are primarily used with the Fishery Protection Squadron and EEZ patrol.|$|E
25|$|Third Class {{accommodations}} {{also included}} their own dining rooms, {{as well as}} public gathering areas including adequate <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> space, which aboard Titanic comprised the Poop Deck at the stern, the forward and aft well decks, and a large open space on D Deck {{which could be used}} as a social hall. This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a General Room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.|$|E
25|$|Leisure {{facilities}} were provided {{for all three}} classes to pass the time. As well as making use of the indoor amenities such as the library, smoking rooms, and gymnasium, it was also customary for passengers to socialise on the <b>open</b> <b>deck,</b> promenading or relaxing in hired deck chairs or wooden benches. A passenger list was published before the sailing {{to inform the public}} which members of the great and good were on board, and it was not uncommon for ambitious mothers to use the list to identify rich bachelors to whom they could introduce their marriageable daughters during the voyage.|$|E

25|$|There {{are some}} {{differences}} {{between the first and}} the second series of barges. The first two were built with lower side coamings due to the limited clearance under the loader at the port of Luleå. When the Finnpusku system was developed, the volume enclosed by the fixed coamings was included in the tonnage of the barge by the rules regarding ship measurement, so to minimize this the side coamings in Kalla and Tasku consisted of removable cassettes held in place by vertical supports. However, the rules were later changed so that none of the <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> was included in tonnage assessment, so the last three barges had their cassettes welded in place. The second series was also originally designed with higher coamings all around to increase capacity for cargo with low stowage factor, such as coal, but restrictions placed by the cargo handling equipment of the ports resulted in a compromise with lower coamings forward of the side ramps and higher towards the aft.|$|E
500|$|The {{two units}} of Station 3 became {{operational}} in 1952 and 1954. At the time The New York Times called it [...] "one {{of the most}} modern power plants in the country," [...] with both mechanical and electrostatic precipitators for dust and ash collection, as well as valve silencers and noise barriers. [...] It was the first turbine generator mounted on an <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> in the Northeastern United States. An identical unit was constructed in Far Rockaway, Queens in 1953.|$|E

2500|$|The Fairmile is {{a wooden}} hulled {{passenger}} vessel. Her hulls-form is very fine for a vessel of her type; {{it is based}} on a destroyer hull, albeit much smaller, as her original speed was some 20 knots. The hull is split into watertight compartments, the midships compartment is the engine room, housing twin Gardner diesels, and an aft compartment contains the toilet facilities. The main deck has a forward open passenger deck. Aft of this, the forward deckhouse contains a chart room. [...] In the centre of the main deck is a raised <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> area, surrounding the funnel, and with the open flybridge above the chartroom.

2500|$|He had {{embarked}} on the steamship Empire City from New York {{and crossed the}} Isthmus of Panama on the [...] "hurricane deck of a mule" [...] (there was no Panama Canal until 1914 over ten years after his death). At Panama City he boarded the S.S. Columbia, one of the ships of the Pacific Steamship Company. She was then on her maiden voyage en route to San Francisco. The Columbia was the first steamship built to ply the route between San Francisco and Astoria, {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia River.

2500|$|During the boat's {{twenty-one years}} of service, the paddlesteamer was rebuilt by several new owners. A Certificate of Enrollment issued on January 21, 1890 when {{ownership}} of the steamboat was transferred to brothers Charles B. and Benjamen Wade shows a rebuild in 1889. The paddlesteamer was now [...] long, 18 feet 7inches wide, and 3 feet 5inches deep.It weighed 66.21 gross tons and was modified to have a recessed stern wheel instead of a propeller. According to a January 13, 1894 Certificate of Enrollment, the steamboat was enlarged to 81 feet 4inches length with a gross weight of [...] 69.60 tons with [...] "an enlarged cabin deck running {{the full length of}} the boat above the boiler deck" [...] and a larger captain's cabin. The Alligator's final rebuild occurred in 1906. The new reconfiguration made the boat more suitable for local freight and passenger trips rather than more lengthy transport. The cabins deck was removed and replaced with an <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> running half the length of the boat; with the pilot house and captain's cabin placed on that same level.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Open grid {{steel bridge}} decks {{have been in}} use for nearly a century. These <b>open</b> grid <b>decks</b> provide an {{economical}} and lightweight alternative to traditional reinforced concrete decks. As the transportation infrastructure continues to deteriorate, <b>open</b> grid <b>decks</b> {{can be used as}} a cost effective way to rehabilitate structurally deficient bridges. <b>Open</b> grid <b>decks</b> weigh less than conventional reinforced concrete decks and reduce the dead load on a bridge superstructure, thereby increasing the live load capacity. While modern bridge design specifications have evolved to LRFD principles, present design methods for <b>open</b> grid <b>decks</b> are mostly empirical and based on historic practice and performance. Further, fatigue limit states in practice tends to be controlled by cracking in the weak direction, for which no design provisions currently exist. A comprehensive research program was developed to address these issues. The results provide a better understanding of grid deck behavior, and will improve detailing and design provisions...|$|R
50|$|The loss {{of sailing}} {{capabilities}} made long-range deployment problematic, as the gunboats {{now had to}} travel with extra coal supply heaped on their <b>open</b> <b>decks,</b> and their engines struggled to propel them on sustained ocean-crossing voyages. HMS Thistle eventually reverted to a practical sailing rig in 1919, but adopted a progressively simplified arrangement, going from a brig to a ketch and finally becoming a sort of cutter.|$|R
2500|$|Because it sailed the {{southern}} Atlantic routes, Andrea Doria {{was the first}} ship to feature three outdoor swimming pools, one for each class (first, cabin, and tourist). When fully booked, the ship was capable of accommodating 1,241 passengers in three different classes; 218 in first class, 320 in cabin class, and 703 in tourist class. As was the rule aboard Trans-Atlantic passenger liners, each passenger class was strictly segregated to specific parts of the ship. First class accommodations were located amidships on the upper decks, cabin class accommodations were located just aft of first class, and tourist-class accommodations were divided between the forward- and after-most ends {{of the ship and}} were connected by corridors which ran the full length of the ship. Each class had its own separate dining room, lounges, and social halls, designated areas of <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> space and enclosed promenades, and even their own swimming pools with verandas. In addition, 563 crew members were charged with operating and maintaining the ship. Over US$1 million was spent on artwork and the decor of the cabins and public rooms, including a life-sized statue of Admiral Doria, and many consider the ship to {{have been one of the}} most beautiful ocean liners ever built next to Cunard's two Queens, , , and the French Line's [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the {{earliest}} oared vessels is mostly unknown and highly conjectural. They likely used a mortise construction, but were sewn together rather than pinned together with nails and dowels. Being completely open, they were rowed (or even paddled) from the <b>open</b> <b>deck,</b> and likely had [...] "ram entries", projections from the bow lowered the resistance of moving through water, making them slightly more hydrodynamic. The first true galleys, the triaconters (literally [...] "thirty-oarers") and penteconters ("fifty-oarers") were developed from these early designs and {{set the standard for}} the larger designs that would come later. They were rowed on only one level, which made them fairly slow, likely only 5-5.5 knots. By the 8th century BC the first galleys rowed at two levels had been developed, among the earliest being the two-level penteconters which were considerably shorter than the one-level equivalents, and therefore more maneuverable. They were an estimated 25m in length and displaced 15 tonnes with 25 pairs of oars. These could have reached an estimated top speed of up to 7.5 knots, making them the first genuine warships when fitted with bow rams. They were equipped with a single square sail on mast set roughly halfway {{along the length of the}} hull.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 1964, the NCPC {{approved}} the preliminary {{design of the}} FBI building. During the design phase, the architects discovered that the NCPC supported the FBI's desire for a highly secure building, and this influenced the structure's design significantly. The plans by Murphy and Associates called for an eight-story structure on Pennsylvania Avenue and a 12-story building along E Street. The two buildings were connected by wings along 9th and 10th Streets NW, forming an open-air courtyard in the interior. A portion of these wings would push underground into the hill which rose behind Pennsylvania Avenue. The building was set back [...] from Pennsylvania Avenue. It also had underground parking [...] accessible from 9th and 10th streets. [...] An <b>open</b> <b>deck,</b> designed to allow pedestrians to enter on E Street and stroll along {{the second floor of}} the building, existed on the east and west sides of the FBI building. The architects noted that this deck could be extended on the south (Pennsylvania Avenue) side. The NCPC voiced only one concern. It worried that the [...] "penthouses" [...] atop the building (which were designed to conceal the HVAC and elevator equipment) were illegal. The penthouses raised the building's height to — higher than permitted by law.|$|E
