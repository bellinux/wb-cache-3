GOME- 2 ozone data was made available by KNMI at pre-selected sites. The reference data which was available limited this study to the European mid-latitudes and European Nordic region. The algorithm version used for this retrieval of GOME- 2 ozone profiles is 3. 2. For this study, data from other <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> stations besides Uccle have been used (De Bilt, Hohenpeissenberg, Payerne, NY-Alesund, Sodankyla and Lerwick). GOME- 2 ozone profiles show sensibly better results at European mid-latitudes than at Nordic latitudes, especially in the tropopause region. The target accuracies for the ozone profiles are respectively 30 % in the troposphere and 15 % in the stratosphere. Data analysis over the time period March 2007 - February 2008 has shown that this accuracy is reached at least partially in the stratosphere. In the UTLS region, and especially at high latitudes, GOME- 2 ozone profiles are least accurate. In the troposphere, mean relative differences are reasonable, at least at midlatitudes, but the information content in the lower levels is relatively low...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of 2. 5 years of weekly ozone soundings conducted at a new monitoring station in Paramaribo, Surinam (6 deg N, 55 deg W). This is currently {{one of only three}} <b>ozone</b> <b>sounding</b> stations in the northern hemisphere (NH) tropics, and {{the only one in the}} equatorial Atlantic region. Paramaribo is part of the Southern Hemisphere ADditional <b>Ozone</b> <b>Sounding</b> program (SHADOZ). Due to its position close to the equator, the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) passes over Paramaribo twice per year, which results in a semi-annual seasonality of many parameters including relative humidity and ozone. The dataset from Paramaribo is used to: (1) evaluate ozone variability relative to precipitation, atmospheric circulation patterns and biomass burning; (2) contrast ozone at the NH equatorial Atlantic with that at nearby southern hemisphere (SH) stations Natal (6 deg S, 35 deg W) and Ascension (8 deg S, 14 deg W); (3) compare the seasonality of tropospheric ozone with a satellite-derived ozone product: Tropical Tropospheric Ozone Columns from the Modified Residual method (MR-TTOC). We find that Paramaribo is a distinctly Atlantic station. Despite its position north of the equator, it resembles nearby SH stations during most of the year. Transport patterns in the lower and middle troposphere during February and March differ from SH stations, which leads to a seasonality of ozone with two maxima. MR-TTOC over Paramaribo does not match the observed seasonality of ozone due to the use of a SH ozone sonde climatology in the MR method. The Paramaribo ozone record is used to suggest an improvement for northern hemisphere MR-TTOC retrievals. We conclude that station Paramaribo shows unique features in the region, and clearly adds new information to the existing SHADOZ record...|$|E

From the ozonesonde observations, the injection of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere through the tropopause gap was deduced. The decreased ozone concentration in the lower stratosphere, similar to as same as the Antarctic ozone hole, was observed south of 60 °S.

The values of Zs at fixed times appeared to be systematically too low as compared to Zr. The differences Zr-Zs increase with altitude; at 30 km the annual mean values of Zr-Zs (plus or minus standard deviation) vary between 590 plus or minus 910 m and 1410 plus or minus 1160 m, according to the pressure calibration of different manufacturing series of radiosondes. From these results it is found that around the 30 km level the ozone concentrations calculated from soundings with VIZ sondes are too low by 7. 5 to 14 percent, depending upon the manufacturing series of radiosondes. At least part of the discrepancy which has often been found between ozone profiles from balloon soundings and from other techniques such as rocket observations or Umkehr measurements may be explained by this effect. An altitude correction would have important consequences as to the climatology of ozone in the middle stratosphere as adopted at the moment. About half of the day-to-day variability of <b>ozone</b> observed from <b>soundings</b> with VIZ radiosondes above the 30 km level, is induced by the variability of Zr-Zs.
