5|$|Borders and {{administration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> similarly changed {{a number of}} times. Originally, and for the initial period, the colony vacillated between military administration and civilian administration from Senegal. In 1893, French Sudan formally came under civilian administration, which lasted until 1899. At that point, a reorganization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> split 11 southern provinces to other French colonies like French Guinea, the Ivory Coast and Dahomey.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 Colonial Parliament passed The Railway Construction Act, which {{authorised}} fifty-nine {{new lines}} to almost every corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> and thus {{became known as}} the Octopus Act. The proposed lines would serve both new agricultural towns and support suburban land speculation. It was also this decade that the first narrow gauge line was opened from Wangaratta to Whitfield, with three other lines following by 1910. The South Gippsland line was also opened from Dandenong to Leongatha by 1891. However, by the late 1890s the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> was now covered in railways, {{with the exception of the}} Mallee country in the north west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> which saw further line openings, such as the Mildura line in 1903.|$|E
40|$|As part <b>of</b> {{bacteriological}} identification, <b>the</b> macroscopic observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> on {{a culture}} medium {{is a critical}} step as it allows the clinical microbiologist to conduct a primary screening of microorganisms {{and in some cases}} even to identify them. This study shows how <b>the</b> macroscopic observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies,</b> in particular <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> Escherichia coli isolated on MacConkey agar from various clinical specimens, allowed to identify 5 classes of morphological variants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> or colonial morphology, thanks to the knowledge and the experience gained by the clinical microbiologist...|$|R

50|$|Some {{monks and}} priests {{attempted}} {{to describe and}} classify indigenous languages with Spanish. Philip II of Spain decreed in 1570 that Nahuatl become <b>the</b> official language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> <b>of</b> New Spain {{in order to facilitate}} communication between <b>the</b> natives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of nymphs into adults can take months; {{the time period}} depends on food availability, temperature, and the general population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also {{take part in the}} social life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies, preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colony</b> of New South Wales did {{not occur}} on 26 January as is commonly assumed. It {{did not occur}} until 7 February 1788, when the formal proclamation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> and of Arthur Phillip's governorship were read out. The vesting of all land in the reigning monarch King George III also dates from 7 February 1788.|$|E
5|$|The queen {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the worker, {{but they are the}} largest members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> The hair is more abundant, and the head is broader. The mandibles are shorter and broader, although they are still as long as the head. The wings are yellowish in colour and translucent in appearance. Males are the smallest members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> and can be easily identifiable by their perceptibly smaller mandibles. The hairs on males are the longest and most abundant among the worker and queen castes, with a long and broad head.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, allied Free France, {{often with}} British support, and Axis-aligned Vichy France {{struggled}} for control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies,</b> sometimes with outright military combat.

5000|$|During <b>the</b> early {{settlement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies,</b> {{children born}} <b>of</b> immigrants in <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> were {{often referred to}} as [...] "Creole". This is found more often in <b>the</b> Chesapeake <b>Colonies.</b>|$|R
5|$|Actual {{schools were}} rare in Plymouth colony. The first true school was not founded until 40 {{years after the}} {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> The General Court first authorized colony-wide funding for formal public schooling in 1673, but only the town of Plymouth made use of these funds at that time. By 1683, though, five additional towns had received this funding.|$|E
5|$|Box {{huckleberry}} prefers dry, acidic soils, including duff, {{and partial}} shade. Locations on wooded slopes tend to face north; however, the New Bloomfield site faces west.

5|$|Carter {{continued}} {{working in}} senior colonial positions— being appointed the Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the Island of Barbados and its Dependencies in 1904, and as Administrator of the Government <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colony</b> of Trinidad and Tobago, and its Dependencies {{in the absence}} of the Governor from 1907 until 1910, whereupon he retired.|$|E
50|$|Van der Stel pursued an expansionist {{agricultural}} policy which was continued {{by his son}} William thereby increasing <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> farms in <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> to 258 by 1705. <b>The</b> number <b>of</b> free hold farms almost doubled by 1731 to 435 farms. Income inequality increased rapidly in <b>the</b> early years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony's</b> development and by 1731 only 7% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony's</b> small free settler population controlled over half <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> private property in <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b>|$|R
50|$|The American Civil War had decisive {{political}} {{effects on}} <b>the</b> BNA <b>colonies.</b> <b>The</b> {{tensions between the}} United States and Britain, which had been ignited by the war and made worse by the Fenian Raids, led to concern for the security and independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies,</b> helping to consolidate momentum for <b>the</b> confederation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> in 1867.|$|R

5|$|Coolsma {{returned}} to the Netherlands {{with his wife in}} 1876 and became the leader of the NZV, holding the office until 1908. He disputed the idea that missionary work should be focused on the non-Islamicised eastern portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> He believed instead that missionary work should be prioritsed in the western portion, where Islam had already become entrenched.|$|E
5|$|Despite this assurance, {{disruption}} {{broke out}} in the city of Stanleyville (now Kisangani in the eastern Congo) among the white population panicking about the future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> and the threat of an Italian invasion.|$|E
5|$|In 1619, the Governor of the Virginia Colony, Sir George Yeardley {{incorporated}} four jurisdictions, termed citties, for {{the developed}} portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> These {{formed the basis}} for colonial representative government in the newly minted House of Burgesses. What would become Norfolk was put under the Elizabeth Cittie incorporation.|$|E

5|$|In September 1833, Governor Irwin sailed for London, {{partly to}} give his own account of the {{events leading up to}} the killing.

5|$|In {{response}} to this cancellation and rumors of an anti-Protestant alliance between Catholics and Native Americans, Protestant settlers formed an association to defend themselves. In July 1689, they marched on the colonial capital, St. Mary's City. Led by John Coode, the Protestant associators were quickly able to capture St. Mary's and the other major towns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony.</b> The Governor {{and a number of}} other Calvert allies fled to Virginia. Charles Calvert turned for relief to the Lords of Trade and eventually to the Privy Council, but these groups sided with the Protestants and took away the power of the Calvert family to govern the colony. Soon thereafter, the new leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony</b> barred Catholics from holding office, bearing arms, or serving on juries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colony,</b> the land between Iron Cove and the Cooks River {{was known as the}} Kangaroo Ground. This {{suggests}} that the land was open terrain favoured by kangaroos, that they were common in the area and may have formed {{a significant part of the}} Aboriginal diet.|$|E
