5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the <b>olecranon</b> process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology of the bone suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|The prepatellar bursa and the <b>olecranon</b> bursa {{are the two}} bursae {{that are}} most likely to become infected, or septic. Septic {{bursitis}} typically occurs when the trauma to the knee causes an abrasion, though it is also possible for the infection to be caused by bacteria traveling through the blood from a pre-existing infection site. In approximately 80% of septic cases, the infection is caused by Staphylococcus aureus; other common infections are Streptococcus, Mycobacterium, and Brucella. It is highly unusual for septic bursitis to be caused by anaerobes, fungi, or Gram-negative bacteria. In very rare cases, the infection can be caused by tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{episodes of}} acute gout may develop into chronic gout with {{destruction}} of joint surfaces, joint deformity and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% {{of those who}} are untreated for five years, often in the helix of the ear, over the <b>olecranon</b> processes, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic kidney dysfunction may occur.|$|E
5|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals {{about half of the}} total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular deltopectoral crest is present, the attachment for the Musculus pectoralis major and the Musculus deltoideus. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The ulna is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large <b>olecranon,</b> the attachment process for the Musculus triceps brachii. Radius, wrist and hand are unknown.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm pronator and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large <b>olecranon</b> process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the triceps muscle. While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly rooting for food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large <b>olecranon</b> (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{anatomy of}} Heterodontosaurus tucki has been well-described, {{although}} H. tucki {{is generally considered}} the most derived of the Early Jurassic heterodontosaurids, so {{it is impossible to}} know how many of its features were shared with other species. The forelimbs were long for a dinosaur, over 70% of the length of the hindlimbs. The well-developed deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles) of the humerus and prominent <b>olecranon</b> process (where muscles that extend the forearm were attached) of the ulna indicate that the forelimb was powerful as well. There were five digits on the manus ('hand'). The first was large, tipped with a sharply curved claw, and would rotate inwards when flexed; Robert Bakker called it the 'twist-thumb'. The second digit was the longest, slightly longer than the third. Both of these digits bore claws, while the clawless fourth and fifth digits were very small and simple in comparison. In the hindlimb, the tibia was 30% longer than the femur, which is generally considered an adaptation for speed. The tibia and fibula of the lower leg were fused to the astragalus and calcaneum of the ankle, forming a 'tibiofibiotarsus' convergently with modern birds. Also similarly to birds, the lower tarsal (ankle) bones and metatarsals were fused to form a 'tarsometatarsus.' There are four digits in the pes (hindfoot), with only the second, third, and fourth contacting the ground. The tail, unlike many other ornithischians, did not have ossified tendons to maintain a rigid posture and was probably flexible. The fragmentary skeleton known for Abrictosaurus has never been fully described, although the forelimb and manus were smaller than in Heterodontosaurus. Also, the fourth and fifth digits of the forelimb each bear one fewer phalanx bone.|$|E
25|$|Shirley Lynette Ledford's {{body was}} found by a jogger the {{following}} morning. An autopsy revealed that, {{in addition to having}} been sexually violated, she had died of strangulation after receiving extensive blunt-force trauma to the face, head, breasts, and left elbow, with her <b>olecranon</b> sustaining multiple fractures. Her genitalia and rectum had been torn, caused in part by Bittaker having inserted pliers inside her body. In addition, her left hand bore a puncture wound and a finger on her right hand had been slashed.|$|E
25|$|The arm {{had a short}} humerus {{and also}} the lower arm was short and elegant with an ulna showing only a weakly {{developed}} <b>olecranon</b> process on its back upper end. The hand was very elongated though, {{as long as the}} ulna and upper arm combined. The second metacarpal was expanded at the top {{at the side of the}} first metacarpal, making the entire metacarpus more compact. The second claw was elongated, as long as the thumb claw. The third metacarpal was rather short and carried a thin, third, finger.|$|E
25|$|The entire arm is {{referred}} to as the brachium and brachial, the front of the elbow as the antecubitis and antecubital, the back of the elbow as the <b>olecranon</b> or olecranal, the forearm as the antebrachium and antebrachial, the wrist as the carpus and carpal area, the hand as the manus and manual, the palm as the palma and palmar, the thumb as the pollex, and the fingers as the digits, phalanges, and phalangeal. The buttocks are the gluteus or gluteal region and the pubic area is the pubis.|$|E
25|$|The epijugal (cheek horn) has {{a length}} of , also the largest known among centrosaurines. The skull frill is {{moderately}} long, and pierced by a large kidney-shaped parietal fenestra at each side. Apart from the midline epiparietal, there are seven epiparietals at each side, and about four to five episquamosals. In the forelimb, the ulna is exceptionally robust with a large <b>olecranon</b> process. Of the three patches with skin impressions found near the left shoulder, one shows a pattern of large, eight to eleven millimetres wide, hexagonal scales surrounded by smaller triangular scales.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the surgery should be to make an {{incision}} along the posterior border of the deltoid. The muscle is exposed to its insertion on the humerus. Next the part of the muscles that originates from the spina scapulae, the posterior one third to one half, is isolated from the anterior portion of the muscle. The insertion of the posterior deltoid is then elevated of the muscle and the distance between the mobilized deltoid tendon to the <b>olecranon</b> is measured to determine the length of the interposition graft needed. The interposition graft must now be harvested from its donor site. It should be 5 to 10cm longer than the gap.|$|E
25|$|The humerus is very robust with {{strongly}} expanded {{upper and}} lower joints, combined with a narrow shaft. On the upper shaft an enormous deltopectoral crest is present of which the lower part does not gradually merge with the shaft but is warped to the front, forming a thick knob or lip. All this indicates a very heavy musculature. In the lower arm the robust ulna has a well-developed <b>olecranon</b> process. The wrist and hand bones are not well known. In the pelvis, the front blade of the ilium splayed out to the front, reaching {{all the way to}} the widest point of the belly to support the gut. This blade also forms a bone shelf at the rear side of the body. The rear blade of the ilium is shorter than the diameter of the hip socket it was located behind, meaning the leg is located at the rear end of the pelvis, near the tail base and much closer to the midline than the belly sides. The pubic bone is unknown. The ischium is a short, curved, vertically positioned bone strap. The thighbone is short, robust and straight with a low fourth trochanter positioned below the midpoint of the shaft. The robust shinbone is shorter than the thighbone. The foot is not well known but functionally tridactyl with hoof-shaped instead of sharp claws.|$|E
500|$|Tertials {{arise in}} the brachial region and are not {{considered}} true remiges as they are not supported by attachment to the corresponding bone, {{in this case the}} humerus. These elongated [...] "true" [...] tertials act as a protective cover for {{all or part of the}} folded primaries and secondaries, and do not qualify as flight feathers as such. However, many authorities use the term tertials to refer to the shorter, more symmetrical innermost secondaries of passerines (arising from the <b>olecranon</b> and performing the same function as true tertials) in an effort to distinguish them from other secondaries. The term humeral is sometimes used for birds such as the albatrosses and pelicans that have a long humerus.|$|E
500|$|Ampelosaurus is {{also known}} from a pubis, about [...] long. It has a strong distal expansion, {{that is similar to}} a {{titanosaur}} from Brazil, and a large foramen. Contrary to the South American titanosaurs, the ilium does not have an expansion on the side. The ischium, known from a shaft, is unexpanded distally and very well developed. It is also very flat. An incomplete radius {{is also known}}. It lacks the proximal and distal ends, and possesses a very prominent ridge along it. The largest and best-preserved specimens are both ulnas.

500|$|The scapulae (shoulder blades) were robust; {{the bones}} of the forelimb were short in {{relation}} to the animal's size, but broad and sturdy. The humerus was short and stout, with its ends broadly expanded and flattened—the upper side for the deltopectoral crest and muscle attachment and the lower for articulation with the radius and ulna. The radius was short, stout and straight, and the <b>olecranon</b> of the ulna apparently very powerful. The lower part of the ulna had a broad expansion. The hands had three fingers; the first finger bore a large claw (ungual bone) measuring about [...] along its curve, which would have been lengthened by a keratin sheath in life. Apart from its size, the claw's proportions were fairly typical of a theropod; it was bilaterally symmetric, slightly compressed, smoothly rounded, and sharply pointed. A groove for the sheath ran {{along the length of the}} claw. The pubic foot of the pelvis was not expanded.|$|E
500|$|Like Probactrosaurus, the {{scapular}} {{blade of}} Eolambia is nearly rectangular, with {{the sides of}} the blade being straight and meeting the end of the blade at an almost-right angle. The humerus is bowed towards the midline, and the deltopectoral crest on the humerus is prominently thickened. A knob is present on the outer surface of the joint with the radius on the humerus. Both the ulna and the radius are relatively straight bones. The top of the ulna bears three [...] "prongs", namely the <b>olecranon</b> process and two additional triangular flanges. Meanwhile, the radius bears a flattened inner surface at the top end, and a distinct platform on the inner surface at the bottom end, both for articulating with the ulna. The hand has five digits. Among the metacarpal bones of the hand, the second is curved, the third is straight, and the fourth is strongly curved. Like Iguanodon, Probactrosaurus, and other basal iguanodonts, the claw on the first digit is distinctively conical. The second and third claws are hoof-like, with the third claw bearing roughened flanges on its sides – a trait also shared with other iguanodonts.|$|E

2500|$|The biceps muscle {{can only}} be used for this {{transfer}} if the other elbow flexors are intact (m. brachialis and m. brachioradialis). This procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia but can be performed under supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade. The incision depends on {{whether there is a}} contracture that needs to be released. If this is the case a wide exposure of the anterior side of the elbow joint is needed. The distal side of the incision should allow complete dissection of the tendon of the biceps. The primary tendon of the biceps is released from its insertion on the radius [...] and then rerouted medial or lateral. If the ulnar nerve is functional a lateral route is favored to prevent compression, however, the lateral route can cause compression of the radial nerve. A second incision is made to expose the triceps insertion and the triceps is dissected from its insertion on the <b>olecranon.</b> A hole is then drilled in the <b>olecranon</b> and a gauge wire is then looped in the hole. The biceps is routed through a skin tunnel to the posterior side and woven into the triceps tendon to create more length. Then the tendon is inserted to the <b>olecranon.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The skull has an {{extremely}} narrow parietal with block like dorsal aspect, very broad, T-shaped frontals {{that form the}} [...] "lateral wings" [...] that Chatterjee applies {{to the lack of}} postorbitals. There are short curved ulnae with <b>olecranon</b> processes, and a possible scapula with bent shaft, and the cervicals have profiles and aspects to their exterior that are very similar to the Megalancosaurus cervical series. All the cervicals but the most posterior and axis/atlas have hypapophyses and those triangular neural spines; all characteristics that have been described in Megalancosaurus. This suggests that portions of Protoavis may be drepanosaurid in nature.|$|E

6000|$|Section 82. The fore-limb (pectoral limb) {{consists}} of an upper arm bone, the humerus (hum.) the distal end of which is deeply excavated by the <b>olecranon</b> fossa (o.f.) {{as indicated by the}} dotted lines; of two bones, the ulna (u.) and radius (r.) which are firmly bound by ligament in the position of the figure (i.e., with the palm of the hand downward, [...] "prone"); of a number of small bones (carpalia), the carpus (c.); of a series of metacarpals (mc.); and of three digits (= fingers) each, except the first, or pollex, of three small bones-- the phalanges, only the proximal of which appear in the figure. The ulna has a hook-like head, the <b>olecranon</b> (o.) which distinguishes it easily from the distally thickened radius. The limb is attached to the body through the intermediation of the shoulder-blade (scapula, sc.) a flattened bone with a median external ridge with a hook-like termination, the acromion (acr.). There is also a process overhanging the glenoid cavity (g.) wherein the humerus articulates, which process is called coracoid (co.); it is ossified from two separate centres, and represents a very considerable bone in the bird, reptile, and frog. Along the dorsal edge of the scapula of the rabbit is unossified cartilage, which is called the supra-scapula (s.sc.). In man there runs from the acromion to the manubrium of the sternum a bone, the collar-bone or clavicle. This is represented by a very imperfectly ossified rudiment in the rabbit. The scapula and clavicle, the bones of the body connected with the fore-limb, are frequently styled the pectoral girdle, or shoulder-girdle; this name of girdle will appear less of a misnomer when lower vertebrate types are studied.|$|E
60|$|Section 83. The {{hind limb}} and its body bones-- pelvic limb and girdle-- {{are shown in}} Figure 2. The limb {{skeleton}} corresponds closely {{with that of the}} fore-limb. The femur (fe.) answers to the humerus, and is to be distinguished from it by the greater distinctness of its proximal head (hd.) and by the absence of an <b>olecranon</b> fossa from its distal end. The tibia (ti = the radius) is fused for the distal half of its length with the fibula (fb. = ulna). A tarsus (tarsalia) equals the carpus.* Two of the proximal tarsalia may be noted: one working like a pulley under the tibia, is the astragalus (as.); one forming the bony support of the heel, is the calcaneum (ca.). There is a series of metatarsals, and then come four digits of three phalanges each.|$|E
6000|$|... "3. A left humerus {{of which}} the upper-third is wanting, and which is so much slenderer than the right as {{apparently}} {{to belong to a}} distinct individual; a left 'ulna', which, though complete, is pathologically deformed, the coronoid process being so much enlarged by bony growth, that flexure of the elbow beyond a right angle must have been impossible; the anterior fossa of the humerus for the reception of the coronoid process being also filled up with a similar bony growth. At the same time, the <b>olecranon</b> is curved strongly downwards. As the bone presents no sign of rachitic degeneration, it may be supposed that an injury sustained during life was the cause of the anchylosis. When the left ulna is compared with the right radius, it might at first sight be concluded that the bones respectively belonged to different individuals, the ulna being more than half an inch too short for articulation with a corresponding radius. But it is clear that this shortening, as well as the attenuation of the left humerus, are both consequent upon the pathological condition above described.|$|E
