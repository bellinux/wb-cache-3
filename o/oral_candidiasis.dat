40|$|INTRODUCTION : <b>Oral</b> pseudomembranous <b>candidiasis</b> (OPC) is {{commonly}} associated with immunosuppression caused by HIV/AIDS and TB infections. The knowledge and beliefs about OPC among traditional health practitioners in South Africa are not well explored. PURPOSE : To investigate this concern. METHODS : A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted in the rural Vhembe district of the Limpopo Province. Data were collected from 427 traditional health practitioners who were to attend training workshops on HIV/AIDS and TB diseases. An open-ended semistructured questionnaire with an A 4 colour picture of <b>oral</b> pseudomembranous <b>candidiasis</b> was presented to assess their previous exposure to, and their knowledge and beliefs about, the etiology and management of OPC. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION : Only thirteen percent correctly identified the lesion. More than 64 % were uncertain on etiology, and 24 % blamed witchcraft and supernatural powers. Almost two thirds (60 %) were confused {{about the relationship between}} HIV/AIDS and OPC lesions. The belief that witchcraft and ancestors could cause OPC could increase the risk of HIV infections and result in delays in seeking treatment. The outcomes of this study should be incorporated in the training of the traditional health practitioners on oral signs and symptoms of HIV/ AIDS diseases.

40|$|Introduction: Aloe vera (Av), a {{succulent}} of Liliaceae {{family is}} now a widely used medicinal plant. Its′ application covers {{a wide spectrum of}} human diseases, including oral mucosa, gastric mucosa and skin. Aloe vera preparations in the form of gel, mouth washes and cream are applied topically for many oral diseases. The applications include <b>oral</b> lichen planus, <b>candidiasis,</b> <b>oral</b> submucous fibrosis, geographic tongue, etc. Aims and Objectives: To evaluate the cytotoxicity of Av on human fibroblasts. Materials and Methods: Aloe vera preparation (70 %) was applied on the fibroblast cell lineage and the cell viability was evaluated by microculture tetrazolium technique (MTT) colorimetric assay. Results: The cell viability at different concentrations was measured. The cells have maintained their viability at different concentrations used in the study. Conclusion: Our study shows the cell viability at different sample concentrations of Av. This could open up wide clinical applications of Av for reactive, inflammatory and potentially malignant oral and other mucocutaneous diseases...|$|R
25|$|There {{are usually}} no {{symptoms}} {{other than the}} unusual appearance of the tongue, {{but in some cases}} persons may experience pain or burning e.g. when eating hot, acidic, spicy or other kinds of foods (e.g. cheese, tomatoes, fruit). Where there is a burning symptom, other causes of a burning sensation on the tongue are considered, such as <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Denture-related {{stomatitis}} (also termed denture sore mouth, denture stomatitis, chronic atrophic candidiasis, Candida-associated denture induced stomatitis, and denture-associated erythematous stomatitis) is {{a common}} condition where mild inflammation and redness of the oral mucous membrane occurs beneath a denture. In about 90% of cases, Candida species are involved, which are normally a harmless component of the oral microbiota in many people. Denture-related stomatitis {{is the most common}} form of <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis</b> (a yeast infection of the mouth). It is more common in elderly people, and in those who wear a complete upper denture (a denture which replaces all the upper teeth, worn by someone with no natural teeth in their upper jaw). Denture-related stomatitis is more likely to develop when the denture is left constantly in the mouth, rather than removing it during sleep, and when the denture is not cleaned regularly.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is cause-related, {{but also}} {{symptomatic}} if {{the underlying cause}} is unknown or not correctable. It {{is also important to}} note that most ulcers will heal completely without any intervention. Treatment can range from simply smoothing or removing a local cause of trauma, to addressing underlying factors such as dry mouth or substituting a problem medication. Maintaining good oral hygiene and use of an antiseptic mouthwash or spray (e.g. chlorhexidine) can prevent secondary infection and therefore hasten healing. A topical analgesic (e.g. benzydamine mouthwash) may reduce pain. Topical (gels, creams or inhalers) or systemic steroids may be used to reduce inflammation. An antifungal drug may be used to prevent <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis</b> developing in those who use prolonged steroids. People with mouth ulcers may prefer to avoid hot or spicy foods, which can increase the pain. Self-inflicted ulceration can be difficult to manage, and psychiatric input may be required in some people.|$|E
40|$|Candida dubliniensis is a new, {{recently}} described {{species of}} yeast.

40|$|Oroesophageal {{candidiasis}} {{is caused}} by the combined action of fungal virulence factors and host inflammatory responses when protective immunity is absent. Hyphal wall protein 1 (Hwp 1) on germ tubes and true hyphae of Candida albicans forms covalent cross-links to buccal epithelial cells in vitro by functioning as a substrate for mammalian transglutaminases. In this study, beige-athymic (bg/bg-nu/nu) or transgenic e 26 mice that have combined natural killer and T cell defects did not succumb to <b>candidiasis</b> after <b>oral</b> administration of C. albicans strains with inactivated HWP 1 genes, whereas mice given isogenic strains of C. albicans that had a single copy of HWP 1 survived only 2 – 3 weeks.

25|$|Leukoedema lesions {{disappear}} {{when the}} mucosa is stretched, which helps to differentiate it from other white lesions in the mouth. The differential diagnosis is with leukoplakia, <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> oral lichen planus, white sponge nevus, morsicatio buccarum, hereditary benign intraepithelial dyskeratosis and dyskeratosis congenita. Tissue biopsy is not indicated, but when taken, the histologic appearance {{is one of}} increased epithelial thickness, broadening and eleongation of the rete ridges, parakeratosis and intracellular edema of the spinous layer. The cells of the spinous later are vacuolated, large and possess pyknotic nuclei. The superficial squamous cells have a clear, seemingly empty cytoplasm {{but it has not}} been shown that there is an increase in intracellular water, possibly making the term edema misleading. The histologic appearance is thought to be caused by water within the cells of the spinous layer causing the light to reflect back as whitish. The diagnosis is usually made based on the clinical appearance alone, but oral exfoliative cytology {{has been used as a}} diagnostic aid.|$|E
500|$|An aphtha (plural aphthae) is a non {{specific}} term {{that refers to}} an ulcer of the mouth. The word {{is derived from the}} Greek word aphtha meaning [...] "eruption" [...] or [...] "ulcer". The lesions of several other oral conditions are sometimes described as aphthae, including Bednar's aphthae (infected, traumatic ulcers on the hard palate in infants), <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> and foot-and-mouth disease. When used without qualification, aphthae commonly refers to lesions of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Since the word aphtha is often taken to be synonymous with ulcer, {{it has been suggested that}} the term [...] "aphthous ulcer" [...] is redundant, but it remains in common use. Stomatitis is also a non-specific term referring to any inflammatory process in the mouth, with or without oral ulceration. It may describe many different conditions apart from aphthous stomatitis such as angular stomatitis.|$|E

40|$|Candida is {{a fungus}} (yeast) that is {{generally}} regarded as a normal and harmless member of the oral microbiome in humans.

50|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>candidiasis</b> is a mycosis (fungal infection). Traditionally, <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis</b> is {{classified}} using the Lehner system, originally {{described in the}} 1960s, into acute and chronic forms (see table).

However, these typical presentations do not always hold true, which created problems with this system. A more recently proposed classification of <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis</b> distinguishes primary <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> where the condition is confined to the mouth and perioral tissues, and secondary <b>oral</b> <b>candidiasis,</b> where there is involvement of {{other parts of the}} body in addition to the mouth.
