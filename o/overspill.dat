5|$|Historically the {{population}} of Manchester began to increase rapidly during the Victorian era, peaking at 766,311 in 1931. From then {{the population}} began to decrease rapidly, due to slum clearance and the increased building of social housing <b>overspill</b> estates by Manchester City Council after the Second World War such as Hattersley and Langley.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Government {{decided that}} a further {{generation}} of new towns in South East England was needed to take the projected population increase of London, after the initial 1940s/1950s wave. Bletchley had already been considered as a new town in this first wave, and in the 1950s the London County Council had constructed <b>overspill</b> housing for several London boroughs there.|$|E
5|$|More recently, ragstone and {{newsprint}} {{industries have}} developed and become important sources of local employment. The {{population of the}} village grew rapidly with the <b>overspill</b> of housing from {{the nearby town of}} Maidstone. Today Ditton has a mixed agricultural and industrial economy, {{with a wide range of}} social and leisure facilities. In 2001 it had a population of 4,786.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Second World War, local {{authorities}} {{made an effort}} to rehouse people away from Victorian slums in inner-city Manchester. An area of Partington extended as an <b>overspill</b> estate {{is now one of the}} most deprived parts of the Greater Manchester conurbation. The Cheshire Lines Committee opened a railway line through the town in 1873, but it closed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Wellingborough has {{approximately}} 2,500 registered businesses {{within its}} boundaries. Much {{of the town}} centre was redeveloped during the 1970s, when it grew rapidly from London <b>overspill.</b> The Borough Council has adopted a 'Town Centre Action Plan'. The former traditional economic structure based on footwear and engineering is gradually diversifying with wholesale, logistics, and service sectors providing new opportunities for employment.|$|E
5|$|Malvern {{had already}} become an <b>overspill</b> for the nearby city of Worcester, {{and the new}} {{motorways}} constructed in the early 1960s brought the industrial Midlands within commuting distance by car. With this development came the construction of large private housing developments. The town continues to swell as increasingly more farmland, especially in the Malvern Link area between the villages of Guarlford and Newland, is turned over to housing projects creating new communities and suburbs.|$|E
40|$|This Essay {{presents}} a novel proposal for counter balancing 2 ̆ 2 copyright <b>overspills.</b> 2 ̆ 2 In {{the background of}} the discussion is the common reality of users succumbing to rights holders 2 ̆ 7 attempts to license uses which are most likely fair uses or completely free of copyright protection. These practices have attracted considerable attention in recent literature. Most scholarly proposals in this context emphasize the need to clarify the contours of the fair use doctrine and to remove doctrinal ambiguities. Yet these initiatives are probably insufficient to overcome users 2 ̆ 7 risk aversion in copyright markets due to an inherent structural imbalance within copyright law. While the law is designed around the prevailing narrative of providing an incentive for innovation, it is quite oblivious to providing an incentive to challenge copyright <b>overspills.</b> The Essay argues, then, that users should be provided with an actual incentive to challenge undue attempts to broaden the scope of copyright. The proposal draws on the experience acquired in other branches of intellectual property. More specifically, it is inspired by the unique system of incentives created under the Hatch-Waxman Act in order to encourage generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge pharmaceutical patents. These incentives have led to a significant {{rise in the number of}} patent challenges in the pharmaceutical field. In the spirit of the Hatch-Waxman regime, the Essay discusses the introduction of an incentive to challenge into copyright law to offset copyright <b>overspills.</b> It then proposes to develop an affirmative copyright misuse doctrine, which would entitle successful challengers of copyright <b>overspills</b> to statutory damages. Beyond the doctrinal proposals, the Essay 2 ̆ 7 s more fundamental conclusion is that, in order to achieve the desired access-incentive equilibrium, copyright law should not be concerned merely with providing an optimal degree of incentive to innovate but also with providing users with an adequate incentive to challenge...|$|R
50|$|The Kelantan River {{regularly}} <b>overspills</b> {{its banks}} {{during the months}} of November to February because of the northeast monsoon season. The estimate flood volume under the 50 year flood condition at Kusial Bridge is about 6 billion m3. Severe flooding occurred in 1926 and 1967. In the 1967 floods 84% of the Kelantan population (537,000 people) were badly affected. Some 125,000 people were evacuated and 38 drowned.|$|R
50|$|To {{begin with}} the {{spillway}} was not large enough: in December 1760 water <b>overspilled</b> the dam {{during a period of}} exceptional high water. Damage was limited, which said something, especially about the stable design of the dam. In response to this incident the dam was raised by about a metre, which has probably merely compensated for the subsidence of the dam since that time.|$|R
5|$|Ashford {{has been}} {{targeted}} {{as a key}} area for population development since the 1960s. In 1959, the London County Council negotiated 5000 new homes {{to be built in}} Ashford as <b>overspill</b> from London, which created most of what is now South Ashford and Kennington. The Buchanan Report, published in 1967, identified Ashford as a major town for growth. In 2001, Ashford was identified as one of four key areas for expansion in South East England. Subsequently, the Ashford's Future Company was set up to support a mix of publicly and privately funded projects in the town.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused {{as part of}} {{the post-war}} slum {{clearances}} in Manchester, to 16Wardle Brook Avenue in the new <b>overspill</b> estate of Hattersley. Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12Wardle Brook Avenue. Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to Saddleworth Moor to collect peat, something that many householders on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble. She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} London <b>Overspill</b> plan, along wth {{places such}} as Ashford and Swindon, Basingstoke was rapidly {{developed}} in the late 1960s as an 'expanded town', in similar fashion to Milton Keynes. Many office blocks and large estates were built, including a ring road. The shopping centre was built in phases. The first phase was completed by the 1970s and was later covered in the 1980s, and was known as The Walks. The second phase was completed by the early 1980s, and became The Malls. The third phase was abandoned and the site was later used to build the Anvil concert hall. The {{central part of the}} shopping centre was rebuilt in 2002 and reopened as Festival Place. This has brought a dramatic improvement to shoppers' opinions of the town centre, but it is unclear if it has softened the town's overall image.|$|E

5|$|The total {{population}} {{for the great}} spotted woodpecker is estimated at 73.7–110.3million individuals, with 35% {{of the population in}} Europe. The breeding range is estimated as , and the population is considered overall to be large and apparently stable or slightly increasing, especially in Britain, where the population has recently <b>overspilled</b> into Ireland. For this reason the great spotted woodpecker is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|Deepwater rice {{is grown}} in {{tropical}} monsoon climates normally around river deltas and their floodplains mainly in backswamps and natural levees. The {{nature of the}} flood is important for success of deepwater rice, with timing {{and the rate of}} rise of water affecting survival and crop density. Generally, the flood water comes from rainfall or rises in the water table. In places with low rainfall, water <b>overspilling</b> from rivers can flood rice-producing areas.|$|R
5|$|Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, {{there was}} a {{significant}} economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era were found to be in a poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing <b>overspill</b> estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000inhabitants a year. While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} M54 was {{originally}} presented due to the high volumes of traffic on the A5, London to Holyhead road which was largely constructed by civil engineer Thomas Telford in the early 19th century following {{the route of the}} Roman Watling Street, which connected Rochester, Kent with Wroxeter, Shropshire. The initial plan for a motorway following the M54's present route was therefore designed to alleviate the roads which handled the commercial traffic to the port of Holyhead, destined for Ireland. With the proposal in the early 1960s for a new town to provide an <b>overspill</b> housing area for the West Midlands conurbation, then named Dawley New Town (designated as Telford in 1967), the M54 was becoming more likely to be built; the government also wanted to increase transport provision to the rest of Shropshire.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} growth of {{industry}} there were not enough good jobs: as a result, from 1841 to 1931, about two million Scots emigrated to North America and Australia, and another 750,000 Scots relocated to England. With a population of 4.8 million in 1911, Scotland sent 690,000 men to the First World War, of whom 74,000 died in combat or from disease, and 150,000 were seriously wounded. Thus, although Scots were only 10 per cent of the British population, they made up 15 per cent of the national armed forces and eventually accounted for 20 per cent of the dead. While emigration began to tail off in England and Wales after the First World War, it continued apace in Scotland, with 400,000 Scots, 10 per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. When the Great Depression hit in the 1930s there were no easily available jobs in the US and Canada, and emigration fell to less than 50,000 a year, bringing to an end the period of mass migrations that had opened in the mid-eighteenth century. This contributed to the growth of the population, which reached a peak of 5,240,800 in 1974. Thereafter it began to fall slowly, moving down to 5,062,940 in 2000. There was also a decrease in some urban populations as a result of slum clearance, <b>overspill</b> and relocation to new towns, with the population of Glasgow falling from over a million in 1951 to 629,000 in 2001. Rural areas also saw a loss of population, particularly the Highlands and Hebrides. In {{the early part of the}} twenty-first century Scotland saw a rise in its population to 5,313,600 (its highest ever recorded) at the 2011 census.|$|E
50|$|The Kew Bridge Studios were a British film studio {{located in}} Kew Bridge, Brentford, west London which {{operated}} from 1919 to 1924.

25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{development}} of private semi-detached and detached housing estates, particularly in the Mottram Rise, Hough Hill, Hollins and Carrbrook areas; the redevelopment of Castle Hall was also completed.

25|$|The {{area has}} three {{medium-sized}} council housing estates (Hillock Estate, Elms Estate and Victoria Estate) which originally consisted of only council-owned properties. The Elms estate {{began to be}} constructed in the 1920s and was completed in the 1950s, whilst the Hillock estate was conceived in the 1950s as an <b>overspill</b> estate for 8,000people rehoused from the City of Manchester ward of Bradford, and Beswick, which were at the time undergoing housing clearances. All three estates now include privately owned properties bought from council ownership under right-to-buy schemes, with the remainder at the Elms and Victoria managed by Six Town Housing, an arms-length management organisation (ALMO) {{set up by the}} Metropolitan Borough of Bury, and at Hillock by Rivers Housing. Hillock is an attractive estate, and is often regarded as the most successful of all Manchester Corporation's many <b>overspill</b> developments.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme water goes to the scheme from the dam through a 5.8 km [...] gradient-driven open canal.
