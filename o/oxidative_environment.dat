5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly <b>oxidative</b> <b>environment</b> that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase, which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

25|$|The human Y {{chromosome}} {{is particularly}} exposed to high mutation rates {{due to the}} environment in which it is housed. The Y chromosome is passed exclusively through sperm, which undergo multiple cell divisions during gametogenesis. Each cellular division provides further opportunity to accumulate base pair mutations. Additionally, sperm are stored in the highly <b>oxidative</b> <b>environment</b> of the testis, which encourages further mutation. These two conditions combined put the Y chromosome at a greater risk of mutation {{than the rest of the}} genome. The increased mutation risk for the Y chromosome is reported by Graves as a factor 4.8. However, her original reference obtains this number for the relative mutation rates in male and female germ lines for the lineage leading to humans.|$|E
40|$|Gel-spun {{polyacrylonitrile}} (PAN) {{and carbon}} nanotube (CNT) composite fibers have been stabilized using various processing conditions {{to study the}} kinetics of stabilization reactions. Differential scanning calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy, wide angle X-ray diffraction and thermo-gravimetric analysis studies suggest that individual stabilization reactions can be separated at different stabilization stages when inert and <b>oxidative</b> <b>environments</b> are used in sequence. Among various stabilization reactions, {{it was found that}} the cross-linking has the highest activation energy, followed by cyclization and oxidation. The oxidation preferentially occurs with the cyclized structure and the shrinkage during stabilization is affected by the gaseous environment. The addition of CNTs reduces both entropic and reaction shrinkages, and improves the maximum tension that a fiber can bear during stabilization in both inert and <b>oxidative</b> <b>environments.</b> ⓒ 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The general {{transcription}} factor TFIIB, encoded by SUA 7 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{is required for}} transcription activation but apparently of a specific subset of genes, for example, linked with mitochondrial activity and hence with <b>oxidative</b> <b>environments.</b> Therefore, studying SUA 7 /TFIIB as a potential target of oxidative stress is fundamental. We found that controlled SUA 7 expression under oxidative conditions occurs at transcriptional and mRNA stability levels. Both regulatory events {{are associated with the}} transcription activator Yap 1 in distinct ways: Yap 1 affects SUA 7 transcription up regulation in exponentially growing cells facing oxidative signals; the absence of this activator per se contributes to increase SUA 7 mRNA stability. However, unlike SUA 7 mRNA, TFIIB abundance is not altered on oxidative signals. The biological impact of this preferential regulation of SUA 7 mRNA pool is revealed by the partial suppression of cellular oxidative sensitivity by SUA 7 overexpression, and supported by the insights on the existence of a novel RNA-binding factor, acting as an oxidative sensor, which regulates mRNA stability. Taken together the results point out a primarily cellular commitment to guarantee SUA 7 mRNA levels under <b>oxidative</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

The simplest, most cost efficient method to synthesize silicon carbide nanotubes is conversion from carbon nanotubes. By investigating the conversion mechanisms of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to silicon carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs), studying their resulting properties, and applying them in different ways, two composites can be created for use in applications that require optimal mechanical properties in high heat and oxidation. The first structure involves covering continuous silicon carbide fiber with protruding silicon carbide nanotubes, dubbed “fuzzy” fiber, which is created to be woven, layered, and put inside a ceramic matrix for extremely high temperature heat engines encountered in aerospace applications which come into contact with high heat and oxidation. The second structure is a silicon carbide nanotube/nanowire sphere {{that can be used for}} its excellent compressive strength and resiliency as well as its resistance to high heat and oxidation.

This may also happen, aided by any of the hydrolytic or oxidative mechanisms. Uncoiling of the chains in the triple helix to random conformations finally occurs. As chains are now exposed to a denser water environment, hydrogen bonding becomes more intense, significantly affecting spectral characteristics (as a key feature throughout the results in this work, see “Results and discussion” section). As a result of the various degrading processes, the hydrothermal constant of parchment has been shown to change on the structural and molecular levels.

50|$|The {{discovery}} of chemical chaperones’ effect on protein folding led to periplasmic protein expression, especially for ones that require an <b>oxidative</b> <b>environment</b> to form disulfide bonds for proper folding. Folding of proteins {{that are difficult}} to do in the cytoplasm can be enhanced in the periplasm where the osmotic pressure can be readily controlled. The osmotic pressure of the periplasmic space can be simply altered by changing that of the medium as osmolytes freely penetrate the outer membrane. Proteins is secreted to this space when an appropriate signal sequence is attached to its terminal. A good example of folding enhancement by periplasmic expression is the disulfide bond-containing plasminogen activator variant (rPA). Folding of rPA is shown to increase when folding enhancers or arginine is added to the culture medium.|$|E

50|$|Noriaki Sano et al. {{synthesized}} single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWNHs) via a gas-injected arc-in-water method. The electrode configuration {{and duration}} of arc discharge were modified {{in order to enhance}} the yield and methane-adsorption properties ofSWNHs. Using these modified experimental parameters, the horn units in the SWNH aggregates increased in size, and the thermal stability of SWNHs in an <b>oxidative</b> <b>environment</b> increased accordingly. SWNHs obtained using the above modified conditions adsorbed a larger amount of methane than did SWNHs obtained from the conventional synthetic conditions. The effect of a mild oxidation treatment on SWNHs on their methane adsorption suggested that SWNHs with micropores would be more flexible than pristine SWNHs. By comparing the methane adsorption on the oxidized SWNHs to that on the pristine SWNHs, one can see that the oxidation of the SWNHs significantly increased the amount of methane adsorbed per apparent volume of SWNH bulk. The amount of methane adsorbed per apparent volume of oxidized SWNHs was about 2 times larger than that of pristine SWNHs, and the amount of methane adsorbed per mass of oxidized SWNHs was about 1.8 times larger than that of pristine SWNHs. The difference between “2 times” and 1.8 times” suggests that oxidized SWNHs can be packed more densely by compression than the pristine SWNHs, which is due to the change in the structural flexibility of SWNHs caused by mild oxidation.|$|E

The results also imply that the DAEM is not suitable for evaluation of the degradation kinetics under air atmosphere. Comparatively, the activation energy obtained from established global kinetic model is correspondingly lower than that from DAEM under both inert and <b>oxidative</b> <b>environments.</b> The global kinetic model is estimated to be applicable for describing the thermal decomposition of Spirulina wastes under both inert and oxidative conditions.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{limitations}} to the application of gold nanorods (Au NRs) as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) probes for in situ monitoring of chemical processes is their instability in <b>oxidative</b> <b>environments.</b> Oxidation induces progressive anisotropic shortening of the NRs, which are eventually dissolved once this process has been completed. This paper compares two types of Au NRs, obtained through different routes and characterized by similar aspect ratios but different sizes. The key factors influencing the resistance of Au NRs to oxidation were systematically investigated, showing that the reduction of free bromide species and the increase of the particle size allowed the NRs to maintain their stability under harsh environments for several weeks. The most stable Au NRs were also demonstrated to be highly efficient SERS substrates {{in a series of}} Raman experiments involving molecular probes, treated under either oxidizing or nonoxidizing conditions, which simulate the oxidation of organic pollutants in water.
