5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general <b>of</b> <b>prisons,</b> to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector <b>of</b> <b>prisons.</b> While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general <b>of</b> <b>prisons,</b> effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{understand}} the meaning <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> quality for Australian First Peoples, the authors examine the aspects <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> considered to be positive and negative for First Peoples serving sentences of imprisonment in the Kimberley Region in Western Australia. The meaning <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> quality as experienced by First Peoples is compared with the meaning <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> quality as defined by an existing measure of the quality <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> life. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with 25 prisoners and staff members from West Kimberley Regional Prison and Broome Regional Prison, seven key aspects <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> as experienced by First Peoples are identified. Six of these key aspects, respect and courtesy, staff-prisoner relationships, bureaucratic legitimacy, fairness, family contact, and personal development, are consistent with dimensions previously identified as pertaining to the quality <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> life. An additional culture-traditions dimension was also identified. The findings show that the differences between prison quality as experienced by First Peoples and non-Indigenous peoples are influenced by aspects relevant to the culture and traditions of First Peoples. The authors highlight the importance of considering culture and traditions in understanding the meaning <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> quality for First Peoples.

40|$|The {{increased}} populist and punitive turn {{in criminal}} justice {{policy in the}} United Kingdom over recent years has led to punishment becoming politicised, harsher and more ostentatious. The role of media and popular culture discourses <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> is rarely examined in this account. Adopting a Foucauldian discourse analysis <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> films released over the past 10 years, this article explores the prison film as one important element of the discursive regime. It seeks to investigate what representational practices are at work, how they limit the meaning <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> and prisoners, and how this may contribute to debates {{about the nature and}} aim <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> in contemporary society. It argues that several discursive practices exist in cinematic representations of the incarceration that strengthen support for the use <b>of</b> <b>prison.</b> The explicit and recurring depiction of violence in most prison films over the past 10 years, while appearing to offer evidence for prison reform, does the opposite. This paper suggests that discourses around the futility and inhumanity of incarceration are scant, replaced by scenes <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> violence; rape and death appear, which appear to exist purely for the pleasure of the spectator: a generic feature <b>of</b> the <b>prison</b> film. Secondly, prisoners are largely constructed as an inhuman other: a danger to society and deserving of harsh punishment. Consequently, the discursive regime <b>of</b> <b>prison</b> in cinema over the past decade constructs prison as not only necessary, but as the only process for crime control and reduction...|$|R

Clinton offered clemency, on condition that the prisoners renounce violence, at the appeal of 10 Nobel Peace Prize laureates, President Jimmy Carter, the Archbishop of New York, and the Archbishop of Puerto Rico. The commutation was opposed by U.S. Attorney's Office, the FBI, and the Federal Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Prisons</b> and criticised by many including former victims of FALN terrorist activities, the Fraternal Order of Police, and members of Congress.

5|$|The main prison {{building}} {{was built in}} 1910–1912 during its time as a United States Army military prison; Alcatraz had been {{the site of a}} citadel since the 1860s.

5|$|The {{operation}} of local prisons in locations such as castles had been criticised, since John Howard's {{work in the}} 1770s, and pressure for reform continued {{to grow in the}} 1850s and 1860s. Reform of the legislation surrounding bankruptcy and debt in 1869 largely removed the threat of imprisonment for unpaid debts, and in the process eliminated the purpose of the debtor's prisons in castles such as St Briavels. Efforts were made to regularise conditions in local prisons but without much success, and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British prisons, including prisons at castles like York. Compensation was paid to the former owners, although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction, this payment was denied. In the short term this led to a 39% reduction in the number <b>of</b> <b>prisons</b> in England, including some famous castle prisons such as Norwich; over the coming years, centralisation and changes in prison design led to the closure of most remaining castle prisons.|$|E
