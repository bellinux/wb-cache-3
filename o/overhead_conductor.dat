5|$|In 2008, the old {{section of}} Nationaltheatret Station was renovated, {{including}} tracks 1 and 2 {{and the two}} original entrances. Upgrades included new lighting, a new public address system, new escalators which have lighting that changes color, a more powerful fire safety system, improved emergency exits and replacement of cables and baldachin. The upgrade made the old section lighter, and visually similar to the new section, as it was previously painted in dark red. Between 2008 and 2012, the Norwegian National Rail Administration performed a major upgrade to the section between Lysaker and Etterstad, including the permanent way past Nationaltheatret. Among the upgrades are axle counters, mounting of an <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> rail, new switches and new tracks.|$|E

25|$|Until summer 2018 {{there will}} be major track, {{signalling}} and station remodelling works at London Bridge station {{as part of the}} Masterplan project (some works within the station building started during Key Output 1). A grade-separated junction is being created at Bermondsey. New permanent way (track level, in this case including both plain rail and junctions) and overhead line equipment will be laid out in the new Canal Tunnels just north of St Pancras between the Thameslink route and the East Coast Main Line, thereby opening up the Thameslink network to new destinations north of London.

500|$|The committee's {{preferred}} {{system was}} a 3,000volt, three-phase alternating current system proposed by Hungarian electrical engineering company Ganz. The system delivered current by <b>overhead</b> <b>conductor</b> wires and was cheaper than alternatives using power rails and required fewer electrical sub-stations. An experimental line had been constructed by Ganz in Budapest, although the system {{had not yet}} been adopted for the full-scale operation of a railway. Before the appointment of Ganz could be finalised, Yerkes took control of the DR. He and his engineers preferred the low voltage direct current conductor rail system they had worked with in the United States and were intending to use on the tube lines when they were constructed; they rejected the Ganz system putting the DR and the MDETC into dispute with the MR which wanted to proceed with the Ganz system. [...] After some acrimonious debate between the two companies, some of which was carried out in public through the letters pages of The Times newspaper, the dispute went to arbitration at the Board of Trade. The decision was made in December 1901 to use the four-rail system, although the arbitrator, Alfred Lyttelton, was critical of the DR's unilateral decision.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the phase sequence and voltage level (132 kV, 275 kV or 400 kV) of single-circuit <b>overhead</b> <b>conductors</b> can be calculated from measurements made by passive, non-contact sensors situated on a moving platform at ground level. The investigation relies on sensing the electric field along {{the profile of the}} conductors through the use of passive sensors. The fabrication of the passive sensor is described together with an analysis of its performance. The variation of the vertical component of electric field strength along the lateral profile beneath single-circuit conductors has been studied using finite element modeling software, ANSYS. The results of this simulation have led to a proposed method of determining the magnitude and phase sequence information from <b>overhead</b> <b>conductors</b> via analysis of the induced voltages on the sensors. The paper concludes with an investigation made in a 400 kV substation in the UK. Analysis of the experimental results shows that the proposed technique can successfully evaluate the phase sequence, voltage level, the spacing between phases and the orientation of high-voltage <b>overhead</b> <b>conductors...</b>|$|R

50|$|Use of {{the area}} below an {{overhead}} line is limited because objects must not come {{too close to the}} energized <b>conductors.</b> <b>Overhead</b> lines and structures may shed ice, creating a hazard.

40|$|Building new {{transmission}} lines is a challenging issue for connecting expected geothermal power plants located {{in remote areas}} to the existing electricity network in Australia.

40|$|Abstract: Forest fire {{can cause}} a serious damage to <b>overhead</b> <b>conductors.</b> Therefore, {{detailed}} investigation on the changes of mechanical and electrical properties of damaged conductors should be carried out to understand the effect of forest fires on conductors. This is of critical importance in maintaining transmission line safely. This paper examines the changes of mechanical and electrical properties of flame exposed conductor. Tensile strength (TS) decreased according to increase of forest fire temperature and conductivity changed according to forest fire temperature. Specimens were aluminum conductors of aluminium conductor steel reinforced (ACSR) 410, 240, 480 ㎟. In this paper, the electrical and mechanical characteristics of forest fires exposed <b>overhead</b> <b>conductors</b> depending on the diameter of aluminum conductors are presented.
