40|$|There is {{much debate}} {{as to whether}} online <b>offenders</b> are a {{distinct}} group of sex <b>offenders</b> or if they are simply typical sex <b>offenders</b> using a new technology. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine {{the extent to which}} online and offline <b>offenders</b> differ on demographic and psychological variables. Online <b>offenders</b> {{were more likely to be}} Caucasian and were slightly younger than offline <b>offenders.</b> In terms of psychological variables, online <b>offenders</b> had greater victim empathy, greater sexual deviancy, and lower impression management than offline <b>offenders.</b> Both online and offline <b>offenders</b> reported greater rates of childhood physical and sexual abuse than the general population. Additionally, online <b>offenders</b> were more likely to be Caucasian, younger, single, and unemployed compared with the general population. Many of the observed differences can be explained by assuming that online <b>offenders,</b> compared with offline <b>offenders,</b> have greater self-control and more psychological barriers to acting on their deviant interests...|$|R
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{criminal}} history of serious violent <b>offenders.</b> Our aim is to determine: (a) {{to what extent the}} criminal history of lethally violent <b>offenders</b> differs from nonlethally violent <b>offenders</b> and (b) to what extent one’s criminal history influences the likelihood that violence ends lethally. We use criminal record data of <b>offenders</b> convicted of lethal violence (i. e., homicide <b>offenders,</b> N = 2, 049) and <b>offenders</b> convicted of nonlethal violence (i. e., attempted homicide <b>offenders,</b> N = 3, 387). The results suggest that nonlethally violent <b>offenders</b> have a more severe criminal history and that <b>offender’s</b> criminal history can be influential in predicting lethal versus nonlethal outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Research has {{consistently}} revealed that released <b>offenders,</b> if unemployed and uneducated, would likely become recidivist <b>offenders.</b> This {{study was a}} 5 -year follow-up study (2005 - 2009) of 6, 561 <b>offenders</b> who were released from the Indiana Department of Correction (IDOC) to five metropolitan counties during the calendar year 2005. It examined the effect of education and postrelease employment on recidivism among those released <b>offenders.</b> Results of this study revealed that an <b>offender’s</b> education and employment {{were the most important}} predictors of postrelease recidivism. In other words, <b>offenders</b> would likely return to the IDOC custody if they were unemployed.

5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described the <b>offender</b> as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the <b>offender</b> as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber suspect was characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic. A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take any calls related to the Unabomber investigation, with a $1million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{compared}} {{subgroups of}} juvenile sex <b>offenders</b> (JSOs) who victimized children (child <b>offenders),</b> peers (peer <b>offenders),</b> or {{both children and}} peers (mixed <b>offenders)</b> on sexual and nonsexual offense history, treatment outcomes, and recidivism to determine if these are distinct and valid subgroups. Though the group of mixed <b>offenders</b> was small, results showed that they exhibited a more diverse and more physically intrusive sexual offense history than the other JSOs and {{were less likely to}} successfully complete treatment. Sexual and nonsexual recidivism rates of mixed <b>offenders</b> did not differ from the other subgroups despite subgroup differences in juvenile sexual and nonsexual criminal records. However, differences in sexual recidivism rates of child versus peer <b>offenders</b> were found when the mixed <b>offenders</b> were either excluded from the sample or combined with child <b>offenders.</b> The results highlight the need to include mixed <b>offenders</b> in future research examining the etiology of sexual offending, treatment, and recidivism of JSOs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There is {{some debate}} about whether sex <b>offenders</b> are similar to non–sex <b>offenders.</b> It is known that sex and non–sex <b>offenders</b> are {{heterogeneous}} groups. Comparative studies must take this heterogeneity into account. Based on an aggregated database, a study was con-ducted among adjudicated juvenile (sex) <b>offenders.</b> The sample consisted of juvenile male sex and non–sex <b>offenders</b> who had been subjected to a psychological assessment {{at the request of}} the judge or district attorney. The central question focused on the differences between juvenile sex <b>offenders,</b> in particular rapists and sexual assaulters (n = 57), child molesters (n = 55), and non–sex offenders: violent (n = 85) and nonviolent <b>offenders</b> (n = 80). The results demon-strated that sex <b>offenders</b> differ from non–sex <b>offenders</b> with regard to demographic character-istics, problem behavior, and personality traits.

50|$|Regarding their rate of compliance, violent <b>offenders</b> {{monitored}} by GPS were 91.2% {{less likely to}} abscond than those <b>offenders</b> not monitored at all. Electronic monitoring also effectively prevented <b>offenders</b> from committing new offences while being monitored: monitored <b>offenders</b> were 94.7% less likely to commit new offences than unmonitored <b>offenders.</b> The researchers found ‘no clear evidence that, overall, the decision to monitor <b>offenders</b> on home confinement with enhanced electronic control mechanisms results in ‘front-end' net-widening. In other words, <b>offenders</b> sentenced to home confinement with EM seem to have posed a significantly higher risk to public safety and {{would have had a}} higher likelihood of receiving a prison sentence if not for the availability of EM as an enhanced control mechanism.' In the end, GPS monitored <b>offenders</b> are 90.2% less likely than <b>offenders</b> on home confinement without EM to be revoked for a technical violation.|$|R

Data spanned 236 samples, comprising 25, 146 sexual <b>offenders</b> and controls. The literature contained sufficient information to permit comparison of adult versus juvenile sexual <b>offenders,</b> <b>offenders</b> targeting children versus adults, <b>offenders</b> targeting their own versus unrelated children, and <b>offenders</b> targeting boys versus girls.

To achieve these objectives, three <b>offenders</b> types were constructed based on criminal history analysis: First-time <b>Offenders,</b> Repeat Drug <b>Offenders,</b> and Mixed Multiple <b>Offenders.</b> The study found that First-time <b>Offenders</b> were less deviant in all respects {{than the other two}} subtypes. First-time <b>Offenders,</b> hailing from lower-middle class environments, were relatively better educated, more skilled, employed for longer periods, and possessed more self-control than members of the other subtypes. First-time <b>Offenders</b> were frequently reared in intact homes with both parents present (or involved in their lives). Repeat <b>Offenders</b> had mostly drug convictions with or without traffic violations and misdemeanors charges. Mixed Multiple <b>Offenders</b> had lengthier arrest histories than other subtypes with a variety of convictions ranging from a simple battery to homicide, rape or armed robbery-indicating a more threatening, violent, and pervasive deviant and/or criminal lifestyle than First-time or Repeat <b>Offenders.</b> Unlike the First time <b>Offenders,</b> both the Repeat Drug <b>Offenders</b> and Mixed Multiple <b>Offenders</b> were relatively less educated, less skilled, employed for less periods of time or sporadically or irregularly employed, and were reared in lower class, broken homes environments with a larger number of family members present. Findings from this study provide a more in-depth understanding of what criminal behavior means to those who commit criminal acts and their life circumstances under which it occurs.
