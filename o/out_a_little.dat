5|$|The end came swiftly in {{the months}} after the Grey Cup. By the time of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had already folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer and flirted with a {{relocation}} to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal disputes in Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in the news in January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to move them to Shreveport as a replacement for the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league approving the sale and relocation, which never happened.|$|E

Cuthbert broke that {{record in the}} {{following}} heat {{with a time of}} 11.4seconds. The world record of 11.3 was held by another Australian, Shirley Strickland who was eliminated in her heat. In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50metre mark. Cuthbert sensed Isabella Daniels from the USA close behind her and pulled <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra to win Australia’s first gold at the Games in a time of 11.5seconds, Matthews was third. The result was repeated in the 200m final. Cuthbert won her second gold breaking Marjorie Jackson’s Olympic record. Mathews was third again.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} {{was no better}} for Butler going 6 for 37 to end the game. On the other hand, University of Connecticut came <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hot. They started how they left off, with a huge three. After that shot fell {{the rest of the}} players on Connecticut started to heat up, {{including}} star, Kemba Walker. Although they didn't go on any huge runs to extend the lead tremendously, they were able to push it up to 14 when they had the score 30-44 with about three to four minutes left in the second half. Butler was able to get within nine making 49-40 but at that point with 1:31 left on the clock it was out of reach with the way their shooting was going for them. Connecticut's last 8 points were all free throws concluding the game and sealing the deal for the win with a final score of 53-41.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Arab Revolt, Ahmed Bey {{had been}} made the {{commander}} of Ottoman forces in Tā'if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 guns of the mountain artillery. Ghalib Pasha, {{the governor of the}} Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the Hashemites launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. That city had fallen and then in July, Abdullah, the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca Husayn ibn Ali, was sent with seventy men to Tā'if. Whilst his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by so small a force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and then went on the attack. All Hashemite assaults on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to Tā'if, and then the city held <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer; it finally surrendered on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz.|$|E

[...] Shortly after arriving in Hollywood, the group resumed recording at Columbia studios on 7 January and at RCA studios on 10 January 1966.

According to Baker, she had been offered numerous leading parts in feature films before that point, but chose to debut in a supporting role in Giant because she was [...] "insecure" [...] and [...] "wanted to start <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> less 'profile.

500|$|Critics welcomed Partners in Times use of {{the dual}} screen, {{as well as the}} rumble pak feature. GameSpot criticised the {{momentary}} {{use of the}} touchscreen, labeling it as [...] "tacked on"; Eurogamer's John Walker, also critical of this, felt that the game was better without utilising the DS's touchscreen. Reviewers complained about the game's controls, expressing difficulty with coordinating the four characters, with problems arising specifically in enemy encounters with characters that were not being controlled. The alterations to the battle system received a mixed responseGameSpot praised the more complicated and [...] "richer" [...] boss fights, while Nintendo World Report criticised the added complexity, stating [...] "the growth in enemy resilience outpaces your growth in strength, so battles get longer and longer". IGN noted that [...] "Partners in Time's quest starts <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too easy", although they acknowledged that the game became increasingly difficult as it progressed.|$|E

500|$|R.E.M. {{released}} Around the Sun in 2004. During {{production of}} the album in 2002, Stipe said, [...] " [...] sounds like it's taking off from {{the last couple of}} records into unchartered R.E.M. territory. Kind of primitive and howling". After the album's release, Mills said, [...] "I think, honestly, it turned <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower than we intended for it to, just in terms of the overall speed of songs." [...] Around the Sun received a mixed critical reception, and peaked at number 13 on the Billboard charts. The first single from the album, [...] "Leaving New York", was a Top 5 hit in the UK. For the record and subsequent tour, the band hired a new full-time touring drummer, Bill Rieflin, who had previously been a member of several industrial music acts such as Ministry and Pigface. The video album Perfect Square was released that same year.|$|E
500|$|It was {{confirmed}} on March 24, 2009 that Shawnee Smith would return as Amanda Young.

On April 19 it was announced that James Van Patten would return as Dr. Heffner, a character featured in the opening scene of the fourth installment performing the autopsy on John Kramer. Peter Outerbridge was cast as a new character, William, and Tobin Bell, Betsy Russell, and Mark Rolston returned as their characters John Kramer, Jill Tuck, and Special Agent Erickson, respectively. Russell commented about her character: [...] "You find <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more about if Jill is good or evil. Pretty much you'll know." [...] Greutert wanted to bring Cary Elwes's character Dr. Gordon back but Elwes was not available. He was later cast in Saw 3D, though the storyline is very different than the one Greutert had for him in Saw VI.|$|E
500|$|A Thousand Leaves is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1995 album Washing Machine, which was released {{shortly after the}} band concluded their stint headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza music festival. With the money they had made at the festival, the band decided to build a recording studio, called Echo Canyon, on Murray Street in Lower Manhattan. The span of nearly three years between Washing Machine and A Thousand Leaves also represented the longest gap between studio albums in Sonic Youth's career at the time. Singer and guitarist Thurston Moore explained that the band needed a break, noting {{that they had been}} touring non-stop for 16 years. He said, [...] "We're having children, we're getting older, let's just cool <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit and build this workshop, and go that way, work that route." [...] In their new studio, the band began writing new songs from extended improvisations in rehearsal. Several instrumental jams were released as extended plays through the band's own record label, Sonic Youth Recordings, and distributed by Smells Like Records, an independent record label previously formed by drummer Steve Shelley.

500|$|Stephanie Zacharek, {{writing for}} Salon.com, liked the reinvention {{of the plot}} and the style and {{execution}} of the action sequences, specifically those involving the trio of Mini Coopers, which she wrote were {{the stars of the}} film. BBC reviewer Stella Papamichael gave The Italian Job 4 stars out of 5, and wrote that the [...] "revenge plot adds wallop lacking in the original". Los Angeles Times reviewer Kevin Thomas praised the opening Venice heist sequence and the characterization of each of the thieves, but felt that the Los Angeles heist sequence was [...] "arguably stretched <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too long". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, writing that the film was [...] "two hours of mindless escapism on a relatively skilled professional level." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle concurred, describing The Italian Job as pure but smart entertainment [...] "plotted and executed with invention and humor". Reviewer James Berardinelli also gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and said that Gray had discovered the right recipe to do a heist movie: [...] "keep things moving, develop a nice rapport between the leads, toss in the occasional surprise, and top with a sprinkling of panache." [...] Varietys Robert Koehler compared The Italian Job to The Score (2001), another [...] "finely tuned heist pic" [...] which also featured Edward Norton in a similar role.|$|E
500|$|Variety {{reported}} in March 2010 that Chris Evans was cast as Captain America and Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull; Marvel Studios confirmed {{the latter in}} May. Ryan Phillippe and John Krasinski were also considered {{for the role of}} Captain America. In April 2010, Sebastian Stan, who had been mentioned in media accounts as a possibility for the title role, was cast as Bucky Barnes. Stan is contracted for multiple films. Also in April, Marvel announced that Hayley Atwell had been cast as Peggy Carter, and that the film's name had been changed from The First Avenger: Captain America to Captain America: The First Avenger. The next day it was reported that Joss Whedon would be rewriting the script as part of his negotiation to write and direct The Avengers. Whedon said in August, [...] "I just got to make some character connections. The structure of the thing was really tight and I loved it, but {{there were a couple of}} opportunities to find his voice a little bit —and some of the other characters' — and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be. And progressing through the script to flesh it <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit". Samuel L. Jackson revealed in an interview that he would reprise his role as Nick Fury in the film.|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow <b>out</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
