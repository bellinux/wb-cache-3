Many have assumed {{that she had been}} tutored in the game. However, Balukas states, [...] "when they find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father doesn't play, many people think I must have learned the game from Frank McGown. That isn't true. I taught myself to play pool." ...|$|E
2500|$|The sixth track, [...] "I", {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "moody-electro" [...] and a [...] "dark pop" [...] track. It opens with an Eastern-style introduction which merges into a [...] "romantic synth" [...] part, with Roberts singing [...] "I’m scared to wake up one day and find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> bubble's burst" [...] and hoping that [...] "everyone loves" [...] her new direction, as well as mentioning her dislike for [...] "people that leave comments on the internet". The track has been compared to songs by Lily Allen, Goldfrapp and Kylie Minogue. The next track is a cover of The Korgis' [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime". Roberts explained the inclusion of the track on the album saying [...] "The lyrics mean a lot to me. I identified with the song in general. It might not be powerful to everybody, but it's powerful to me. I wanted to do it, I love the song." [...] The cover is preceded by the song [...] "Say It Out Loud", which has gathered comparisons to Katy Perry, and is a high-energy pop song featuring [...] "Crystal Castles-ish 8-bit bleeps here and there" [...] and a chorus with a [...] "big old fuzzy hollering rush".

Track eleven, [...] "Take a Bite" [...] has been compared to singer Robyn; and features a rap from Roberts including [...] "Called me a rude ginger bitch, they're gonna eat all their words" [...] – referencing a 2003 feud with a member of pop group Busted. The final track [...] "Sticks + Stones" [...] describes a time when she would beg her driver to buy her vodka despite being underage, in relation to the subject matter Roberts explained [...] "How funny that I was too young for so many things, yet you thought I'd cope with being told I'm ugly, Over and over". Roberts explained the concept of the track, noting [...] "What it is with Sticks + Stones is I wanted all the people out there who hurt like that to know that they’re not the only ones in that position. Sometimes there's so many people in the world suffering from the same thing or hurting from the same thing, but they feel like they’re on their own. I wanted a song that could highlight the subject so it was like, actually I’m so not on my own here." [...] Lyricism on the album, was based around rap, and rhyme with Roberts stating they were based on personal events, she said: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{can tell}} Flint," [...] he said, [...] "that {{if he will}} sign a bond of one hundred {{thousand}} dollars to elect me next time, I'll get <b>out.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>my</b> last word." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then they saluted {{with their}} axes, calling me [...] "Chief" [...] and other fine names, and {{departed}} {{as they had}} come, at a run, calling <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> message should be delivered and that doubtless Umslopogaas would send the guide.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, come on! Let's go anyhow," [...] put in Spouter. [...] "I'm {{anxious to}} know what sort of neighbors we have. They can't find any fault with us for coming over when they find <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> father owns this ranch." ...|$|E

60|$|It is what I think. But I am only a girl, {{the first}} that has {{examined}} this matter, and it may turn <b>out</b> <b>that</b> in <b>my</b> ignorance and inexperience I have not got it right.|$|R
5000|$|Without hesitation, I said, 'I did. But it came <b>out</b> <b>that</b> {{way because}} <b>my</b> camera {{was out of}} focus.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very; {{so tight}} that I rejoice to think, as you were kind enough to point <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> years protect me from {{anything}} of the sort. I have no advice to give; I think you had better ask it of the lady." ...|$|E

60|$|I often {{planned to}} give him a job, that I might see him nearer; but I had few errands, and little Bob, the hall-boy, {{depended}} on doing those: so the winter was nearly over before I found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Red Cap was an old friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "They say he {{has sold}} himself to the enemy, but you and I know better--he don't buy. I'll tell you what, though; my lodger is so black-humoured and gloomy that I believe he'd as soon make that bargain as any other.

6000|$|... "Oh, you needn't try {{to smooth}} it over, Jack Ruddy," [...] fumed the bully. [...] "Don't imagine that I don't {{know all about}} the mean stories you and others are {{circulating}} about my family.

6000|$|... "You're smart. I {{believe my}} people entertained {{some idea of}} that nature; George is {{considered}} safe. Still, to prevent any misapprehension, I'd better point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> chief failings are a fondness for looking at the amusing side of things and a slackness in availing myself of my opportunities. As an instance of the latter defect, I'm boring you by talking about Lansing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ("We miss <b>out</b> all <b>that</b> about <b>my</b> {{wearing your}} {{portrait}} next my heart, {{and put in}} the rich apparel bit, the same as last week.") ...|$|R

5000|$|Alex Turner {{confirmed}} {{the release of}} the single in an interview with NME: [...] "Leave Before the Lights Come On feels very much like it could be on the album.

6000|$|But it was Sir James's evident {{annoyance}} {{that most}} stirred Mr. Brooke.

60|$|I {{meant to}} be very {{energetic}} and final, but Captain Giles continued to gaze at me thoughtfully. Nothing could stop him. He went on to point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> personality was involved in that conversation. When I tried to preserve the semblance of unconcern he became positively cruel. I heard what the man had said? Yes? What did I think of it then?--he wanted to know.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was as Harry Holl {{that you}} knew him, but we have since found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> he is <b>my</b> grandson, the son of my {{daughter}} Ella," [...] Captain Bayley explained.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just this!" [...] he said. [...] "I'm an American citizen, {{and the way}} I've {{figured it}} <b>out</b> is <b>that</b> <b>my</b> place is in America.

6000|$|He saw Waynefleet {{raise his}} eyebrows, and he added: [...] "I guess it's not worth while troubling to point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> it's not <b>my</b> affair. Now, if you'll get ahead with your symptoms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{glad you}} think so, Copperfield,' rejoined Traddles, 'because, without any {{imputation}} on the Reverend Horace, I do think parents, and brothers, and so forth, are sometimes rather selfish in such cases. Well! I also pointed <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> most earnest desire was, {{to be useful}} to the family; and that if I got on in the world, and anything should happen to him--I refer to the Reverend Horace--' ...|$|E
60|$|THE SHE-ANCIENT. I, like Arjillax, found <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> {{statues of}} bodily beauty {{were no longer}} even {{beautiful}} to me; and I pressed on and made statues and pictures {{of men and women}} of genius, like those in the old fable of Michael Angelo. Like Martellus, I smashed them when I saw that there was no life in them: that they were so dead that they would not even dissolve as a dead body does.|$|E
60|$|And {{for fear}} that the idea may still lurk in some minds that my {{preceding}} years of drinking were the cause of my disabilities, I here point <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Japanese cabin boy, Nakata, still with me, was rotten with fever, as was Charmian, who in addition was in the slough of a tropical neurasthenia that required several years of temperate climates to cure, and that neither she nor Nakata drank or ever had drunk.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not even}} know," [...] said I, {{speaking}} low as he took his seat at the table, [...] "by what name to call you. I have given <b>out</b> <b>that</b> you are <b>my</b> uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her finger {{was on the}} man {{who stood}} poised ready to jump. With an awful recoil, I drew back and {{suppressed}} a scream. It was {{on the tip of}} my tongue to cry <b>out,</b> [...] "Why, <b>that's</b> <b>my</b> father's murderer!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Raman is {{well known}} for his sense of humor and poetry."Now two {{questions}} remain. First: How did it all begin? Science says Big Bang, and religions say God. Why not simply say, God said, [...] "Let there be a Big Bang, and the wide world was born." [...] And God also said, [...] "Let there be a Little Bang, and the DNA was born." [...] Second question: What will happen to me when I die? I'll just wait and see, and I'm in no hurry to find <b>that</b> <b>out.</b> <b>That's</b> <b>my</b> statement on religion and science, and now I must get back to my sports program on TV".
