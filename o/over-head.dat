They did however suffer under artillery bombardments, until their trenches had adequate <b>over-head</b> cover. Adopting a policy of mine laying, setting ambushes, raiding and patrolling, at times the battalion's patrols reached as far as Bures and Troarn. The battalion remained in the woods until 16 June, when the 3rd Parachute Brigade went into reserve. When they returned to the front, they continued patrolling and harassing the Germans for the next six weeks. Until 17 August when the 6th Airborne Division, crossed the River Dives. The 8th Battalion were involved in heavy fighting at Goustranville, which they captured by nightfall. By 21 August the battalion, had reached Annebault. Supported by a left flanking attack by the 9th Parachute Battalion, the 8th put in a frontal assault. The village was well defended and both battalions fought all day to liberate the village. The 8th Battalions next major engagement was on 25 August at Beuzeville, attacked by the 3rd Parachute and the 4th Special Service Brigade. Supported by the Cromwell tanks of the 6th Airborne Division Reconnaissance Regiment the battalion gradually overcome the German strong points and captured the town. After the liberation of Beuzeville the 6th Airborne Division having reached Honfleur on the River Seine was ordered to hold their positions. By September the battalion had been withdrawn to England. At the same time Lieutenant Colonel George Hewitson replaced the incapacitated Lieutenant Colonel Pearson as commanding officer.|$|E

This paper focuses on two important issues for cloud computing: density (guests per physical host) and start-up latency (for responding to load spikes). We conclude that the overall den-sity is highly dependent on the most demanded resource.

Prior adap-tive methods using octrees or unstructured meshes carry large <b>over-heads</b> and implementation complexity. We instead stick with coarse regular Cartesian grids, using detailed cut cells at boundaries, and discretize the dynamics with a p-adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method.

40|$|Despite {{the success}} of {{peer-to-peer}} systems, a majority of their overlay architectures are vulnerable to exploitation. Some of the features for improved performance have cre-ated security holes that attackers can breach {{to gain control of}} the network. De facto network security solutions (e. g., trusted servers, encryption, and firewalls) offer little assis-tance, as they are often not compatible with the open and decentralized structure of peer-to-peer networks. To address overlay security problems, we propose Phyllo, a node-partitioning framework that isolates un-trusted nodes from the core network. Yet, the isolated nodes can still participate in peer-to-peer communications. Our partitioning scheme also allows nodes to move between partitions, while introducing marginal performance <b>over-heads.</b> Our experimental results indicate that Phyllo sup-ports more reliable message delivery in the presence of ma-licious nodes. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{high-level}} variable se-lection for partial-scan approach {{to improve the}} testa-bility of digital systems. The testability of a design is evaluated at the high level based on previously proposed controllability and observability measures. A testabil-ity grading technique is utilized to measure the rela-tive testability improvement in a design {{as the result of}} making a subset of the variables fully controllable and observable. The variables that cause the greatest testa-bility improvement are selected, and the selection pro-cess is performed incrementally until no further testa-bility improvement can be achieved. Then the registers that correspond to the selected variables are placed in the scan-chain for partial-scan implementation. The experimental results shows that the variable selection approach produces partial-scan implementations that can achieve high fault coverage, while the logic <b>over-heads</b> are fairly low. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} mission-critical systems, {{systems may}} be resource-constrained including limited bandwidth, so minimising protocol overhead, whilst maintaining per-formance, is important. Proactive MANET routing protocols tend to provide smaller route discovery la-tency than on-demand protocols because they maintain route information {{to all the}} nodes in the network at all time. However, such protocols may impose excessive soft-state routing control overhead which is generated by disseminating periodic update messages. In order to mitigate {{the side effects of}} the soft-state control <b>over-heads,</b> we propose two adaptive proactive routing al-gorithms, namely DT MIAD and DT ODPU. By tun-ing the value of refresh intervals dynamically and auto-matically, refresh updates are triggered based on traffic conditions and node mobility. We show through sim-ulations that the proposed adaptive routing algorithms can outperform a traditional proactive routing protocol (OLSR). ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Enterprise Service Buses (ESBs) are highly-dynamic {{component}} plat-forms {{that are}} hard to test for correctness because their connected components may not necessarily be present prior to deployment. Runtime Verification (RV) is a potential solution towards ascertaining correctness of an ESB, by checking the ESB’s execution at runtime, and detecting any deviations from the expected behaviour. A crucial aspect impinging upon the feasibility of this verification ap-proach is the runtime overheads introduced, which may have adverse effects on the execution of the ESB system being monitored. In turn, one factor that bears a major effect on such overheads is the instrumentation mechanism adopted by the RV setup. In this paper we identify three likely (but substantially different) ESB instrumentation mechanisms, detail their implementation over a widely-used ESB platform, assess them qualitatively, and empirically evaluate the runtime <b>over-heads</b> introduced by these mechanisms. ...|$|R

Behav-ioral watchpoints extend the traditional approach of using a DBT system by providing context-specific information at the instruction level and specializing instrumentation to individ-ual data structures.
