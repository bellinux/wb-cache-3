50|$|Mediterranean hartwort {{does have}} edible leaves. In Italy {{it is used}} as a condiment. The {{essential}} oil composition of aerial parts of Tordylium apulum L. from Italy was analyzed. Sixty-seven compounds were identified representing 96.5% of the oil. The most abundant compounds were (E)-β-ocimene (17.3), α-humulene (11.4%) and octyl octanoate (8.8%). Essential oil from aerial parts of T. apulum from Greece was reported to have α-humulene (28.7%) and <b>octyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> (11.7%) as the main constituents. There are no known medicinal uses for this plant.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] l. A {{comparison}} of the volatile exocrine secretions of Oecophylla smaragdina with published results on O. longinoda shows the two species are very similar. 2. The contents of Dufour glands of both major and minor workers are closely similar, with undecane the major substance in both castes of both species. 3. The mandibular glands were distinctly different, both between major and minor workers of O. smaragdina and between major workers of the two species. Major workers ' mandibular glands contain chiefly hexyl hexanoate, 3 -decanone and <b>octyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> while minor workers contain nerol and 1 -nonanol. 4. Males ' mandibular glands contain chiefly 3 -dodecanone, 3 -decanone and 3 -decanol, which {{is very different from}} the mixture of carboxylic acids in the heads of males of O. Ionginoda...|$|E
