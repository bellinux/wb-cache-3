5|$|At the Potsdam Conference, {{which started}} in late July after Germany's surrender, serious {{differences}} emerged over the future development of Germany and the rest <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> Eastern Europe. Moreover, the participants' mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each other's hostile intentions and entrench their positions. At this conference Truman informed Stalin that the United States possessed a powerful new weapon.|$|E

5|$|Cabbage was {{probably}} domesticated later in history than Near Eastern {{crops such as}} lentils and summer wheat. Because of {{the wide range of}} crops developed from the wild B.oleracea, multiple broadly contemporaneous domestications of cabbage may have occurred throughout Europe. Nonheading cabbages and kale were probably the first to be domesticated, before 1000 BC, by the Celts <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>and</b> western Europe.|$|E

5|$|During the Peninsular War, Portugal fielded light {{infantry}} units {{known as}} Caçadores, who wore brown-jackets which helped conceal them.

5|$|Greece: The {{species has}} been {{recorded}} in the Pindus and Rhodopi Mountains <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>and</b> northern Greece. Here, M.alcathoe is usually found in stands of plane or alder trees next to small streams in ravines. The bat hunts close to the trees, within the stand. It is often found together with the lesser horseshoe bat and with M.mystacinus.|$|E
5|$|In 1817, the General Assembly {{joined with}} two other Reformed denominations, the American branch of the Dutch Reformed Church (now the Reformed Church in America) and the Associate Reformed Church, to form the United Foreign Missionary Society.

This finding would render Urobatis polyphyletic, though further study is warranted to elucidate the relationships between these taxa.|$|E

5|$|Adult birds may {{be killed}} by cats, little owls and sparrowhawks, and eggs and nestlings are taken by magpies, jays, and, where present, grey squirrels. As with other {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common, and include endoparasites, such as the nematode Splendidofilaria (Avifilaria) mavis whose specific name mavis derives from this thrush. A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma. Ixodes ticks are also common, and can carry pathogens, including tick-borne encephalitis in forested areas <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>and</b> eastern Europe and Russia, and, more widely, Borrelia bacteria. Some species of Borrelia cause Lyme disease, and ground-feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>and</b> northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 of his men.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the rebels}} were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning {{in the interior}} <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> East Java had more success. The rebel campaign culminated {{in the fall of}} the capital Plered in June 1677. The king was ill, and distrust among the royal princes prevented organized resistance. The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels to enter and plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E

5|$|At {{the close}} of the 20th century, malaria {{remained}} endemic in more than 100 countries throughout the tropical and subtropical zones, including large areas <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> South America, Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Africa, the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Resistance of Plasmodium to anti-malaria drugs, as well as resistance of mosquitos to insecticides and the discovery of zoonotic species of the parasite have complicated control measures.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{evolved from}} older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by {{immigrants}} to North America, where the modern version developed. By the late 19th century, baseball was {{widely recognized as}} the national sport of the United States. Baseball is currently popular in North America and parts <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{features}} two sub-plots {{based on}} the two playable factions of the game. Commanding the Global Defense Initiative's troops, the player becomes instrumental in eliminating Nod's European forces. Under the command of General Mark Jamison Sheppard, the player completes missions that range from securing a beach, to rescuing civilians and scientists, to defending GDI bases from Nod assaults. Combat occurs in countries <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> Eastern Europe. A major plot element is an international scandal caused by a Nod media manipulation, which convinces {{the world that the}} GDI deliberately attacked and massacred the Polish city of Białystok. This leads to a cut in GDI funding, forcing the player to play several missions with limited forces. Finally, the player besieges the Temple of Nod in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which Kane uses as his main base of operations.|$|E
