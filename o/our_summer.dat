500|$|The {{improved}} {{results of}} the 1990s prompted higher expectations from the Australian Winter Olympic hierarchy. At {{the start of the}} 2002 Olympics, the Australian chef de mission Ian Chesterman addressed the team, saying [...] "historically our winter teams have been the child racked by self-doubt, shy in nature as we saw our big brother, <b>our</b> <b>summer</b> Games team, take on and conquer the world."

Though the review criticized Inna's pronunciation of the lyrics and wished the text was stronger, it concluded: [...] "this is definitely a song that we need on <b>our</b> <b>summer</b> playlist". Outlet Magazine applauded [...] "Heaven" [...] for [...] "bringing the summer heat" [...] and for being [...] "the ideal song to sit outside and listen to all day long as the sun's rays caress your skin". Urban.ro foresaw it as being successful on radios, and an editor of Pro FM listed {{the recording}} in their list of [...] "16 hits with which Inna made history".|$|E

2500|$|On April 8, 2011, Louis Marinelli, a 25-year-old NOM {{activist and}} online {{strategist}} who {{describes himself as}} [...] "the one behind the 2010 Summer for Marriage Tour", had driven the bus during that tour, and had moderated many of NOM's web properties (including its Facebook page, its Twitter account, and the Tour blog), resigned from his affiliation with the organization, announced his support for same-sex marriage, and categorically apologized for and repudiated his past actions on behalf of the organization. He also shut down the Facebook page he had built up for NOM, which had 290,000 followers. The next day, NOM created a new official Facebook page (to replace Marinelli's), and released this statement: [...] "Louis Marinelli worked in a volunteer capacity as a bus driver during <b>our</b> <b>summer</b> marriage tour. Around this time, NOM began to pay him as a part-time consultant for helping us expand our internet reach. He has since chosen a different focus. We wish him well." [...] NOM president Brown publicly downplayed Marinelli's role with the organization, however, after Marinelli published several articles critical of NOM on his website, Brown contacted him and said that if the articles were not removed, NOM would pursue legal action against Marinelli for violation of a confidentiality agreement he had signed as a contractor with access to specialized information.|$|E

60|$|DEAR DOCTOR,--This town {{is in the}} {{interior}} of the State of New York--and was my wife's birth-place. We are here to spend the whole summer. Although it is so near summer, we had a great snow-storm yesterday, and one the day before. This is rather breaking in upon our plans, as it may keep us down here in the valley a trifle longer than we desired. It gets fearfully hot here in the summer, so we spend <b>our</b> <b>summers</b> on top of a hill 6 or 700 feet high, about two or three miles from here--it never gets hot up there.|$|R

60|$|I {{did little}} more than make my appearance, and assume the command of my estates, {{in the kingdom of}} Ireland; {{rewarding}} generously those persons who had been kind to me in my former adversities, and taking my fitting place among the aristocracy of the land. But, in truth, I had small inducements to remain in it after having tasted of the genteeler and more complete pleasures of English and Continental life; and we passed <b>our</b> <b>summers</b> at Buxton, Bath, and Harrogate, while Hackton Castle was being beautified in the elegant manner already described by me, and the season at our mansion in Berkeley Square.|$|R
60|$|This is no pretty pond {{such as we}} in England are wont {{to visit}} and delight in during <b>our</b> <b>summer</b> holidays. It is a great sheet of water; a grand fresh-water sea, 200 miles long and 15 miles broad--a fitting gem for the bosom of the mighty region on which it glitters.|$|E

60|$|At Rye Beach, during <b>our</b> <b>summer's</b> vacation, there came, {{as there}} always will to seaside visitors, {{two or three}} cold, chilly, rainy days,--days when the skies that long had not rained a drop seemed {{suddenly}} to bethink themselves of their remissness, and to pour down water, not by drops, but by pailfuls. The chilly wind blew and whistled, the water dashed along the ground and careered in foamy rills along the roadside, and the bushes bent beneath the constant flood. It was plain that {{there was to be}} no sea-bathing on such a day, no walks, no rides; and so, shivering and drawing our blanket- shawls close about us, we sat down at the window to watch the storm outside.|$|R

Speakers included climate experts from both NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), who provided updates on climate model diagnostics and evaluation and remote sensing of the planet.
