Thereupon the workers begin to form combinations (Trades Unions) against the bourgeois; they club together {{in order to keep}} up the rate of wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there the contest breaks out into riots. Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit of their battles lies, not in the immediate result, but in the ever-expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on by the im- proved means of communication that are created by modern industry, and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was needed to centralize the numerous local struggles, all of the same character, into one national struggle between classes. But every class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to attain which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required centuries, the modern proletarians, thanks to railways, achieve in a few years. This organization of the proletarians into a class, and consequently into a political party, is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interests</b> of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself.'' ...|$|E

While scientists can use RMBL's facilities [...] to study any topics relevant to the ecosystems around the Lab, a number of particular research areas have emerged as topics <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interests.</b> Charles Remington, an influential figure in the study of butterflies, spent a number of years working on the genetics of butterflies at the Lab.

Ehrlich, Carol Boggs, Ward Watt (former President of the California Academy of Sciences [...] ), Maureen Stanton, and Naomi Pierce, have also spent time working on butterflies at the Lab.|$|E
5000|$|A {{key event}} in {{the early history of}} the modern anti-war stance in {{literature}} and society was the American Civil War, where it culminated in the candidacy of George McClellan for President of the United States as a [...] "Peace Democrat" [...] against incumbent President Abraham Lincoln. The outlines of the anti-war stance are seen: the argument that the costs of maintaining the present conflict are not worth the gains which can be made, the appeal to end the horrors of war, and the argument that war is being waged for the profit <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interests.</b> During the war, the New York Draft Riots were started as violent protests against Abraham Lincoln's Enrollment Act of Conscription plan to draft men to fight in the war. The outrage over conscription was augmented by the ability to [...] "buy" [...] your way out; the amount of which could only be afforded by the wealthy. After the war, The Red Badge of Courage described the chaos and sense of death which resulted from the changing style of combat: away from the set engagement, and towards two armies engaging in continuous battle over a wide area.|$|E
5000|$|Alerted by {{the dangers}} that {{threaten}} the equilibrium {{of the world}} and the future of humanity, the members of the International Ethical, Political and Scientific Collegium have identified four principal reasons as the origin of these dangers.The first is a lack of orientation, vision or ethical practices in the exercise of political, economic, media, and technological power by those who hold it. Neither States nor multinational corporations nor other holders of effective power appear to express this vision. The United Nations identified the objectives to be achieved in order to respond to the major challenges of the new century; however, its normative function is weakened by the fragmentation of competences, between the various international organizations, and by the absence of an integrated mechanism, such as a world human rights jurisdiction, which would control the effective and indivisible application of all fundamental rights, whether civil, political, economic, cultural and/or social.This ethical weakness is all the more serious given that there is an increasing deficit of responsibility: as globalization occurs, power is concentrated, but responsibility becomes diluted. Today, effective power is disseminated between economic, political, media, social, cultural, intellectual and religious players, without clearly predetermining the conditions and means of their responsibility with regard to the peoples and citizens concerned.The second is the growing impact on human beings and the ecosystems, of the physical, biological, and atmospheric degradation of our world, with consequences manifested in a sporadic manner through droughts (and consequent desertification), floods, cyclones, climatic changes and the threats of irreversible pollution. The programs advocated at the world Conferences of Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and Johannesburg in 2002 for dealing with such threats, already insufficient solutions in relation to the risks, are afterwards ignored or misinterpreted.The third reason for alarm is the widening gulf between rich and poor, exemplified by the fact that more than two-thirds of the world's population today are deprived of their political, economic and cultural human rights, in contradiction with the promises that have been formulated by the international community since the adoption of the legal instruments drafted by the United Nations. Our primary indicators, which are principally monetary, are leading us towards a market society guided by pure economics. Globalization thus works to the detriment of the majority of humanity by destroying its ecological backbone. The informational mutation is failing to attain the promises that it has been holding. The weight accorded to true riches — those of intelligence and life — should however lead us to take the only possible route: a renaissance of ethical, ecological and anthropological fundamentals.The fourth reason resides in the growing risks of war and terrorism, and in the absence of ways to curb rising violence and barbarity, which indicate that humanity today is principally threatened by its own inhumanity. However, the possibility of humanity's self-destruction makes it its own victim, while being in charge of its own history. The stakes of an ethical and spiritual responsibility are thus becoming major political issues that must be treated within the framework of a genuine dialogue between civilizations.In order to come forward with a pertinent response to these risks and challenges — replacing science, economics and technology in the realm of means and not of ends - the construction of world civility requires an entity, which is not subject to the constraints <b>of</b> <b>particular</b> <b>interests,</b> to media obsession, or to short-term pressure. This established fact is now the driving force behind the creation of an International Ethical, Political and Scientific Collegium that has a quadruple function:To be vigilant and alert regarding the principal risks faced by humanity;To apply discernment, in particular ethical, as to the nature of these risks and the quality of the means which are necessary for dealing with them, without such means becoming themselves counter-productive;To deliberate in the event of major conflicts, which call for an ethical framework;To give advice to governments and international institutions (primarily the United Nations) in order to clarify their decision-making procedures.An appeal for an acute awareness of world interdependence, an idea that was predominant during the drafting of the United Nations Charter, appears necessary. This appeal reflects the joint responsibilities of Statesmen and -women as well as of men and women relevant in the different fields that affect the life of the planet and the thinking of its people. These voices must also make themselves heard through the world network of civil society that has taken shape during the last decade.As a follow-up to the Preamble of the Declaration of Rio which, for the first time, proclaimed that [...] "the Earth, home of humanity, constitutes a whole denoted by interdependence", this appeal takes the form of a general Declaration, recalling that if interdependence has become a reality, it is also time to formulate it as a project.|$|E
