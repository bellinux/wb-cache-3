5|$|Chaos;Head follows Takumi Nishijou, a {{high school}} student living in a cargo crate atop a {{building}} in Shibuya, Tokyo. One day, he is sent pictures over the internet, depicting a murder in an alley; he later witnesses a murder resembling the one in the pictures, and believes the killer to be a pink-haired girl he sees at the crime scene. Because of his presence {{at the scene of the}} crime, he is suspected of being the murderer, and starts suffering from paranoia and experiencing delusions. More murders – referred to as the New Generation serial murders – occur, while Takumi meets a number of girls who have an interest in him, but who he suspects of being linked to the murders. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> pink-haired girl, named Rimi, who claims to be friends with him despite him not having any previous memory of her.|$|E
5|$|The Andriyivskyy Descent {{also has}} a number of {{monument}}s. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> monument to Yaroslav the Wise, the Grand Prince of Novgorod and Kiev, which depicts him holding a model of the Saint Sophia Cathedral. Another is the monument to Pronya Prokopovna and Svirid Golohvastov, which was unveiled in 1989, depicting two characters, Pronya Prokopovna and Svirid Golohvastov, from the play Chasing Two Rabbits, which was written by Mykhailo Starytskyi. Another main monument on the street is dedicated to the famous Ukrainian poet and artist Taras Shevchenko, located {{to the right of the}} monument to Yaroslav the Wise. Most recently, a monument to Mikhail Bulgakov was opened on the Andriyivskyy Descent, the first dedicated to the writer in the former Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over {{the course of the past}} 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher androstenedione levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Set in an {{alternate}} 19th century, the story focuses on {{an organization of}} exorcists, named the Black Order, as they defend humanity against the Noah Family, reincarnations of Noah and his 12 apostles whom bear hatred towards humanity and God led by a man known as the Millennium Earl. The exorcists' main weapon against the Noah Family are sentient holy artifacts called Innocence. Innocence comes {{in a variety of}} forms, varying from everyday objects such as boots to grandfather clocks, to weapons such as swords and guns; regardless of their form, each Innocence possesses unique offensive and supportive abilities and will only work for the wielder of their choosing. Out of the 109 Innocence hidden and scattered throughout the world, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> master Innocence; whichever side obtains this Innocence first will win the war. In contrast to the Innocence, the Noah Family's weapons are derived from a power source known as Dark Matter. Dark Matter, grants the Noah superpowers, along with the ability to create and control demons.|$|E
5|$|When Leslie leaves Ron {{with his}} {{favorite}} movies for his surprise birthday party, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> <b>The</b> Bridge on the River Kwai, a 1958 film about British World War II prisoners forced {{to build a}} bridge in Thailand. The scene Ron watches on television is an actual scene from that film. The other film Leslie gives Ron is The Dirty Dozen, a 1967 war film about a team of convicted murderers being trained for mission to assassinate German officers, also during World War II. Leslie only finds out Ron's birthday, which was a closely guarded secret, by bribing an employee from Baskin-Robbins, an ice cream parlor chain that gives free scoops of ice cream to customers on their birthdays. Eagleton is such a rich town that, after their town meeting, they distribute gift bags that include an iPod Touch, a portable music player by Apple, Inc. Lindsay Carlisle Shay also drives a Cadillac Escalade, an expensive luxury sport utility vehicle brand by Cadillac. During another scene, Ron declares that birthdays were made up by Hallmark, a greeting cards company, to sell more cards.|$|E
