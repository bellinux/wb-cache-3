40|$|To improve {{national}} food security, successive Mali {{governments have}} always focused on expanding and intensifying {{production in the}} government-managed irrigation schemes (Office du Niger), which account for about 50 % of domestic rice production. Because the cost of expanding and rehabilitating those schemes is high, the government is looking for complementary cost-effective ways to achieve this goal. The government could increase domestic rice supply by investing in improving the farmer-managed inland valley swamps. Although the government has {{paid little attention to}} those marginal lands, farmers have been growing rice in these areas using traditional technologies. This paper used data from a survey of 334 bas-fond farmers and secondary data to examine the potential contribution that these undeveloped bas-fonds could make to improve food security and rice exports in Mali. The study found that, if fully developed, the bas-fonds and flooded plains could produce more rice than is currently being supplied by the Office du Niger, or imported through commercial imports or food aid. As expected, rice yields in the bas-fonds are lower than in the Office du Niger. However, bas-fonds rice production is both financially profitable and provides a higher return per day of family labor than the competing upland crops (maize, sorghum/millet and cotton). In addition, the estimated domestic resources cost ratios show that, compared to the <b>Office</b> <b>d</b> u Niger, bas-fond rice production represents a better use of domestic resources, both for producing rice for home consumption and for the market.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} the implementation of procurement procedures in the King William’s Town Education District. In spite of {{the provisions of the}} Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Act 108 of 1996 and Public Finance Management Act No 1 of 1999 (PFMA), in respect of the provision of services, procurement in the King William’s Town Education District is flawed. The study explored the legislative framework governing procurement procedures in the District, the extent of compliance and non compliance with procurement procedures, and the causes of flawed procurement procedures. A descriptive case study was used to describe, analyse and interpret a particular phenomenon, in this case the procurement procedures in the King William’s Town Education District. Purposive sampling was chosen for this study to create an understanding of the research problem, and to complement the case study method in eliminating any potential bias in the data. Respondents included mainly the managers in the District, who are instrumental in the implementation of procurement processes in the District. Self administered interviewing schedules were used for respondents to answer without the assistance of the researcher. The study found out that the District was lagging behind in respect of compliance to procurement procedures, monitoring and evaluation, and accountability. Based on the above findings, the study recommended the following: (a) strengthening accountability in all managers and public servants, (b) professional training and education of personnel and managers {{in order to be able}} to implement procurement processes, (c) establishment of compliance <b>office,</b> (<b>d)</b> introduction of complaints mechanisms, and (e) effecting monitoring and control mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{error control}} coding (ECC) use in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) to determine the energy efficiency of specific ECC implementations in WSNs. ECC provides coding gain, resulting in transmitter energy savings, {{at the cost of}} added decoder power consumption. This paper derives an expression for the critical distance d C R, the distance at which the decoder's energy consumption per bit equals the transmit energy savings per bit due to coding gain, compared to an uncoded system. Results for several decoder implementations, both analog and digital, are presented for d C R in different environments over a wide frequency range. In free space, d C R is very large at lower frequencies, suitable only for widely spaced outdoor sensors. In crowded environments and <b>office</b> buildings, <b>d</b> C R drops significantly, to 3 m or greater at 10 GHz. Interference is not considered; it would lower d C R.

30|$|Recreational {{activities}} were also widely reported by parents as {{in favour of}} their children’s wellbeing. But before going into it in details, let us mention some restrictions encountered by most families: (a) high fees, especially for the summer period; (b) over-specialisation of services, regarding age groups or type of activities, since families {{with more than one}} child have to juggle with several services at the same time; (c) unsupported daily trips between school and services, during <b>office</b> hours; (<b>d)</b> uneven distribution of supply, since certain activities cannot be found within a reasonable distance; (e) and poor access to information regarding available activities and the appropriate time to book them were mentioned as problems in our interviews. These barriers were mostly reported as limitations of use rather than actual barriers to access. Indeed, the fundamental difference that we observed between families referred to their perspective on the benefits of recreational activities for children’s wellbeing, even if for some families that were deprived of access to recreational activities for their children, affordability was the key issue.|$|R
