5|$|Fantasy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common LARP genres internationally and is the genre that the largest events use. Fantasy LARPs are set in pseudo-historical worlds {{inspired}} by fantasy literature and fantasy role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons.

5|$|The rise {{of provincial}} {{men to the}} senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social {{mobility}} {{in the first three}} centuries of the Empire. Roman aristocracy was based <b>on</b> <b>competition,</b> and unlike later European nobility, a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands. Admission to the higher ordines brought distinction and privileges, but also a number of responsibilities. In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services (munera), rather than on tax revenues, which primarily supported the military. Maintaining one's rank required massive personal expenditures. Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged by the central government to give up their seats and return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.|$|E
