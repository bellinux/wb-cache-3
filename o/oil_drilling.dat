40|$|This {{research}} has investigated {{the use of}} waste <b>oil</b> <b>drill</b> cuttings treated by thermal desorption in sandcrete, a major construction material used throughout Nigeria and much of West Africa. Sandcrete samples were prepared using a sand to cement ratio of 6 : 1. The results show that replacing up to 50 wt% of sand by treated <b>oil</b> <b>drill</b> cuttings produced sandcrete with reduced water absorption and reduced sorptivity, increased density and reduced thermal conductivity. In addition, the compressive strengths of samples containing <b>oil</b> <b>drill</b> cuttings were comparable to control samples.

5|$|After an <b>oil</b> <b>drilling</b> {{operation}} in 1903 in Dexter, Kansas, produced a gas geyser {{that would not}} burn, Kansas state geologist Erasmus Haworth collected samples of the escaping gas and took {{them back to the}} University of Kansas at Lawrence where, with the help of chemists Hamilton Cady and David McFarland, he discovered that the gas consisted of, by volume, 72% nitrogen, 15% methane (a combustible percentage only with sufficient oxygen), 1% hydrogen, and 12% an unidentifiable gas. With further analysis, Cady and McFarland discovered that 1.84% of the gas sample was helium. This showed that despite its overall rarity on Earth, helium was concentrated in large quantities under the American Great Plains, available for extraction as a byproduct of natural gas.|$|E

5|$|Strengthening {{faster than}} anticipated, Gay {{attained}} typhoon status early on 3 November. Later that day, the storm developed an eye before passing over the Seacrest, an <b>oil</b> <b>drilling</b> ship. On 4 November, Gay's winds increased to 185km/h (115mph), {{equivalent to a}} Category3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, before making landfall in Chumphon Province, Thailand, at 0600UTC. The Japan Meteorological Agency assessed that the storm had ten-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a pressure of 960mbar (hPa; 28.35inHg). Crossing the Kra Isthmus, Gay weakened to minimal typhoon status as it entered the Bay of Bengal. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gay was the first typhoon since 1891 to form in the Gulf of Thailand and enter the Bay of Bengal. Responding to a ridge to its north, Gay maintained a west-northwestward to northwestward track {{for the next four}} days. The storm gradually restrengthened as it moved through an area of low wind shear and warm waters; however, this was limited by restrictions to the cyclone's outflow. Early on November6, Gay passed near the Andaman Islands as a Category2-equivalent cyclone.|$|E

Funding for local and central administration was increased heavily, and the Governor increased its activities in Soviet settlements.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese planes were seen making {{reconnaissance}} flights over Miri. The Brooke government decided on a complete destruction of oilfields and airfields in Miri. Shell company officials received orders {{to carry out the}} Denial Scheme on 8 December 1941. In the evening on the same day, the task was completed. All producing oil wells were sealed up with vital equipment and machinery dismantled and shipped off to Singapore. Skilled workers and important company papers also went along with the equipment and sent to Singapore. The Punjab Regiment and several officials were sent to guard Kuching. On 16 December 1941, 9 days after the Pearl Harbor bombing, Japanese troops consisting of 10,000 men landed on Tanjung Lobang Beach, Miri without much resistance. However, on 19 December 1941, a Dutch flying boat from Tarakan Island attacked the Japanese destroyer Shinonome (under the command of Hiroshi Sasagawa) off Miri. The ship was sunk along with the entire crew of 228. Another flying boat X-33 also damaged a Japanese transport ship. After the fall of Singapore on 15 January 1942, skilled workers that went into hiding with their equipment were sent back to Miri by the Japanese.
