To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime <b>our</b> <b>intelligence</b> may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

[...] Having lost his glasses, Juskalian could not distinguish the soldiers that were approaching him from 50feet (15m) away. The soldiers were Germans and took him prisoner.

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} what have been {{historically}} and contemporarily defined as different domains of human cognition {{are served by}} one of four functionally- and structurally-distinct areas of the prefrontal cortex. Their contributions to human intelligence are as follows: (a) BA 9, enables <b>our</b> emotional <b>intelligence,</b> engaging the psychosocial domain, (b) BA 47, enables <b>our</b> practical <b>intelligence,</b> engaging the material domain, (c) BA 46 (or BA 46 - 9 / 46), enables <b>our</b> abstract <b>intelligence,</b> engaging the hypothetical domain and (d) BA 10, enables <b>our</b> temporal <b>intelligence,</b> engaging in planning within {{any of the other}} three domains. Given their unique contribution to human cognition, it is proposed that these areas be called the, social (BA 9), material (BA 47), abstract (BA 46 - 9 / 46) and temporal (BA 10) mind. The evidence that BA 47 participates strongly in verbal and gestural communication suggests that language evolved primarily {{as a consequence of the}} extreme selective pressure for practicality; an observation supported by the functional connectivity between BA 47 and orbital areas that negatively reinforce lying. It is further proposed that the abstract mind (BA 46 - 9 / 46) is the primary seat of metacognition charged with creating adaptive behavioral strategies by generating higher-order concepts (hypotheses) from lower-order concepts originating both from our perceptual representations and the other three domains of cognition...|$|R

We briefly review dual process models of cognition and cast machine intelligence within that framework, characterising it as a dominant System Zero, which can drive behaviour through interfacing with us subconsciously.
