The FISP fertiliser subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, and farmers developed reluctance to purchase fertilisers and other agricultural inputs on the <b>open</b> <b>markets</b> that remained.|$|E

NetBank normally originated loans and resold the loans to other financial institutions on the <b>open</b> <b>markets.</b> Some of the loans that NetBank sold did not meet the underwriting guidelines and NetBank was forced to repurchase these loans from the other banks.
