30|$|The ORBIS {{database}} of Bureau van Dijk updated on 11 May 2017 was utilized in this study. It contains the business data such as financial information, trade description, products, {{and services in}} the world (about 200 million companies). In this research, the financial information of publicly listed enterprises was mainly focused for analyzing the relation of R&D investment to turnover and their number in all industrial fields of the world. The US Standard Industrial Classification (US SIC) is the systematic classification assigned by US government {{in order to identify}} the industrial activities of companies. It is comprised of total 11 divisions and they are divided into 83 major groups (2 -digit level), 416 industry groups (3 -digit level), and 1005 industries (4 -digit level). Furthermore, the US SIC primary code of each company is decided by its first line of business (e.g., its business area generating the highest profit). The raw data from the ORBIS based on the list of individual enterprises in the 4 -digit level of the US SIC primary code was merged into its 2 -digit level to gain the figures related to (a) number of listed businesses (2017), (b) turnover (2007 ~[*] 2015), and (c) R&D expenditure (2007 ~[*] 2015). The turnover used in this study means the total <b>operating</b> <b>revenues</b> including net sales, <b>other</b> <b>operating</b> <b>revenues,</b> and stock variations. Also, it does not include value added tax (ORBIS database). The definition of R&D investment is the total amount of expenses on R&D activities (ORBIS database). Moreover, thousand US dollar (USD) was used as a currency unit in this study. The overall procedure to analyze the company-related data is composed of total 4 steps. First of all, the number and the ratio of listed businesses in each US SIC code were obtained in order to observe their distribution in all industrial fields. Secondly, the top 10 average turnovers with their compound annual growth rate (CAGR) figures and descriptive statistics for each US SIC primary code were gained to analyze the industrial trends in the viewpoint of market circumstance. Thirdly, the top 10 average R&D expenditures with their CAGR values and descriptive statistics were calculated to comprehend the trends of industry about research activities of listed enterprises. Finally, investigation into relation of R&D expense to turnover and number of listed companies in all industries was performed through correlation and linear regression analyses. In this step, among 83 major groups (2 -digit level), total 6 codes were excluded in the viewpoint of independent variable (R&D expenditure from 2007 to 2015) by the following two reasons: (1) No R&D investment (43 - United States postal service, 81 - Legal services, 88 - Private households, 91 - Executive, legislative, and general government, except finance, and 99 - Nonclassifiable establishments) and (2) Very small average R&D expense (93 - Public finance, taxation, and monetary policy, 0.52 thousand USD).|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the performance of audit firms in the Republic of Serbia in the period 2008 - 2010. For this period the trend in the number of audit firms in the Republic of Serbia, the size and number of employees in audit firms, and the participation of individual audit firms in total <b>operating</b> <b>revenue,</b> employment, and net income were observed. Further, correlation analysis of variations in <b>operating</b> <b>revenue,</b> employment, and net income of audit firms was carried out. The analysis showed the absence of the expected correlation between <b>operating</b> <b>revenue</b> and net income, as well as between the number of employees and net income. Additional analysis showed that the newly established audit firms achieved lower than average results and a higher level of variation in the level of profitability in relation to the audit firms that have been in the audit service market longer.
