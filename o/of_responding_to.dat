5|$|Clark Gregg reprises {{his role}} as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by series regulars Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. The episode draws {{comparisons}} {{to the plight of}} first responders to the September 11 attacks by showing firefighters (with guest star Vincent Laresca playing one) dying as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> the Battle of New York, as seen in Marvel's The Avengers. The episode also features a major skydiving sequence, realized by combining live footage with CGI, as part of the development of the characters Fitz and Simmons, who received their own musical theme for the episode. It also sees Titus Welliver reprise his S.H.I.E.L.D. agent role from the Marvel One-Shot short films.|$|E
5|$|I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings is a 1969 {{autobiography}} {{about the}} early years of American writer and poet Maya Angelou. The first in a seven-volume series, it is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of Caged Bird, Maya transforms from a victim of racism with an inferiority complex into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> prejudice.|$|E

25|$|Here Descartes {{notes that}} automata are capable <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> human {{interactions}} but argues that such automata cannot respond appropriately to things said in {{their presence in}} the way that any human can. Descartes therefore prefigures the Turing Test by defining the insufficiency of appropriate linguistic response as that which separates the human from the automaton. Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency, and so does not propose the Turing Test as such, even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion.|$|E

In response, Wilko cited language in the 1933 Act barring any such contractual waiver of an investor's right to take such claims to court.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} an {{enormous}} growth {{of interest in the}} ICD and ways had to be found <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> this, partly by modifying the classification itself and partly by introducing special coding provisions. A number of representations were made by specialist bodies which had become interested in using the ICD for their own statistics. Some subject areas in the classification were regarded as inappropriately arranged and there was considerable pressure for more detail and for adaptation of the classification to make it more relevant for the evaluation of medical care, by classifying conditions to the chapters concerned with the part of the body affected rather than to those dealing with the underlying generalized disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{functional}} analysis {{is the most}} direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects {{on the behavior of}} interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a {{functional analysis}}, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) {{it can be said that}} there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.|$|E

25|$|The Special Operations Group (SOG) {{was created}} in 1971, and is the Marshals Service {{specially}} trained and highly disciplined tactical unit. It is a self-supporting response team capable <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> emergencies anywhere in the US or its territories. Most of the deputy marshals who have volunteered to be SOG members serve as full-time deputies in Marshals Service offices throughout the nation, and they remain on call 24 hours a day. The SOG also maintains a small, full-time operational cadre stationed at the Marshals Service Tactical Operations Center at Camp Beauregard, where all deputies undergo extensive, specialized training in tactics and weaponry. Deputies must meet rigorous physical and mental standards. The group's missions include: apprehending fugitives, protecting dignitaries, providing court security, transporting high-profile and dangerous prisoners, providing witness security, and seizing assets. Members of the U.S. Marshal SOG Teams are armed with M1911A1 Springfield pro rail Pistol (.45 ACP). Marshals are also equipped with AR-15s and 12 gauge Remington 870 shotguns.|$|E
500|$|This did {{not extend}} to every case, but merely to those which had been {{dismissed}} because one party's [...] "suggestions [...] proved untrue", and was normally awarded {{to pay for the}} innocent party's costs in responding to the party that had lied. Lord Hardwicke, however, claimed that the Chancery's jurisdiction to award damages was not derived [...] "from any authority, but from conscience", and rather than being statutory was instead due to the Lord Chancellor's inherent authority. As a result, General Orders were regularly issued awarding the innocent party additional costs, such as the cost of a solicitor on top of the costs <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> the other party's false statements.|$|E
500|$|Self-control {{has been}} called the [...] "master virtue" [...] by {{clinical}} and social psychologists, suggesting that the ability to delay gratification plays a critical role in a person's overall psychological adjustment. People with better ability to delay gratification report higher wellbeing, self-esteem and openness to experience, as well as more productive ways <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> anger and other provocations. Early delay ability has been shown to protect against the development of a variety of emotional vulnerabilities later in life, such as aggression and features of borderline personality disorder. Meanwhile, many maladaptive coping skills that characterize mental illness entail a difficulty delaying gratification. The tendency to choose short-term rewards at the expense of longer-term benefits permeates many forms of psychopathology.|$|E

500|$|While the limitanei were {{supposed}} to deal with policing actions and low-intensity incursions, the duty <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> more serious incidents fell upon the provincial troops. The countering of the very largest scale incursions on a strategic scale was {{the task of the}} comitatenses and palatini or mobile field troops, possibly accompanied by the emperor's scholae. Both border and field armies consisted of a mix of infantry and cavalry units although the weight of cavalry was, according to some authorities, greater in the mobile field armies. Overall, approximately one quarter of the army consisted of cavalry troops but their importance is uncertain. Older works such as the Eleventh Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica (1911) state that the Roman military of the late Empire was [...] "marked by that predominance of the horseman which characterised the earlier centuries of the Middle Ages," [...] but many more recent authors believe that the infantry remained predominant.|$|E
500|$|Memory and naïve B cells {{normally}} {{exist in}} relatively small numbers. [...] As the body {{needs to be}} able to respond to a large number of potential pathogens, it maintains a pool of B cells with a wide range of specificities. Consequently, while there is almost always at least one B (naive or memory) cell capable <b>of</b> <b>responding</b> <b>to</b> any given epitope (of all that the immune system can react against), there are very few exact duplicates. However, when a single B cell encounters an antigen to which it can bind, it can proliferate very rapidly. Such a group of cells with identical specificity towards the epitope is known as a clone, and is derived from a common [...] "mother" [...] cell. [...] All the [...] "daughter" [...] B cells match the original [...] "mother" [...] cell in their epitope specificity, and they secrete antibodies with identical paratopes. These antibodies are monoclonal antibodies, since they derive from clones of the same parent cell. A polyclonal response is one in which clones of multiple B cells react to the same antigen.|$|E
