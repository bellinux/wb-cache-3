5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern matters <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>security,</b> the Court {{held that}} this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1983), the Court of Appeal decided that {{it is up to}} the courts to determine whether a decision is in fact based on grounds <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>security.</b> Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{added that}} there is a need for the {{decision-maker}} to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>security</b> are involved. A mere assertion by the decision-maker that a matter involves national security does not preclude the court's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based on grounds <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>security.</b> In other words, national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot do is decide what action national security requires. This is to be left solely to those responsible for it.|$|E

5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of his hard line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security.</b> This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E

5|$|First, the High Court held, upon an {{examination}} of section 3 of the UPA and section 24(1) of the SA, {{that there was no}} express requirement for the Minister to have given the affected parties a right to be heard before the orders were made. Further, {{there was no room for}} the appellants' contention that the principles of natural justice had to be complied with fully. The orders had been made with respect to both the public interest and the public order, and their objective was clearly the preservation <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>security.</b> The Court affirmed the conclusion of Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, in R. v.
