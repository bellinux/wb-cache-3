To this, the paper propose a fast wavelet denoising algorithm, which was identified in mathematics, and the algorithm step {{was given in}} this paper. Through analysis of Mallat tower algorithm principle, some step was improved, and fast FFT and long sequence signal volume fast algorithm {{was used in this}} paper, so that <b>operation</b> <b>amount</b> can be reduced greatly. DSP emulation experimental result indicated, compared with denoising algorithm using direct wavelet transform, this method can improve the speed of operation greatly. As to denoising effect, this method is superior to other several kinds of methods not only at the index of denoising performance, but also in visual effect. Key words: Long sequence volume, Mallat algorithm, PCT denoising algorithm, PSNR, DSP Introduction: Wavelet theory is a new application theory developing recently. Due to its good time-frequency local characteristics, wavelet analysis have been applied extensively in many fields, such as signal analysis, image processing, speech synthesis, trouble diagnosing, geological prospecting, etc. But because of the huge <b>operation</b> <b>amount</b> of direct discrete wavelet transform and its complexity, its application in actual system is hindered greatly, so the further research to discrete wavelet transform fast algorithm is necessary...|$|E

Color {{image compression}} algorithms based on quaternion are very common in recent years. In this paper, we propose a color image compression scheme, based on the real SVD, named real compression scheme.

High-temperature land installations are considered and particular note is made of high-temperature high-pressure turbines used. Properties of materials available are given in Appendix I and {{are used in the}} main text of the lecture to determine the upper limit of temperature to be explored. Reheating by steam, gas, and liquid metal, are mentioned, and the latter is recommended. Temperatures are then examined at various pressure levels up to 1, 500 deg. F. without reheat and with up to two stages of reheat. The maximum gains are assessed and the possible type of future marine propulsion-turbine is discussed. Some of the problems of uncooled gas turbines are described in particular relation to the Pametrada 3, 500 s. h. p. unit. The possibility of cooled gas turbines is discussed and calculations are made as to the efficiency attainable in relation to cooling at various temperatures. The results are contrasted with those possible with high-temperature steam-turbine machinery. The cooled gas turbine would appear to have the greater potentiality for improvement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare {{immediate}} surgical outcomes of low anterior resections (LAR) and intersphincteric resections (ISR) of the rectum. Materials and methods. Treatment outcomes of 42 patients operated on between March, 2014 and January, 2015 were presented. Group I consisted of 24 patients who underwent laparoscopic ultra-low anterior resection (uLAR) for rectal cancer. Group II comprised 18 patients who underwent laparoscopic ISR. Results. No significant differences in the median length of surgery and blood loss between two groups were observed. Circular and distal resection margins were negative in all cases. In 18 (75 %) patients of Group I and in 14 (77. 7 %) patients of Group II, total mesorectumectomy(TME) was assessed as grade 3 (p= 0. 83). The frequency of postoperative complications in uLAR-treated group was 20. 8 %, not requiring a secondary revision procedure, and 27. 8 % in ISR-treated group, requiring repeated surgery. The mean value of the fecal incontinence according to the Wechsler scale in a month after surgery was significantly higher in group II than in Group I patients (9. 3 versus 6. 2, р= 0. 01). The average treatment cost for uLAR was higher by 45, 000 rubles than that for ISR. Conclusion. Both surgical procedures were matched by the duration of <b>operation,</b> <b>amount</b> of blood loss and the quality of mesorectumectomy. The complication rate was not significantly different between two groups, however, 16. 8 % of Group II patients required relaparotomy, likely due to the mastering of the ISR technique. Ultra-low anterior resections of the rectum are functionally preferred. When performing ISR, the technique of reservoir colo-anal anastomosis with preservation of the portion of the internal sphincter provides functional results comparable with those obtained using LAR. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Postoperative pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complications}} following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Because the majority of the analgesic drugs including opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have many side effects, using drugs with lesser side effects is beneficial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of N-acetylcysteine on the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: In a randomized clinical trial, in two university-affiliated teaching hospitals in Babol City (Shahid Beheshti and Shahid Yahyanezhad Hospitals), Iran, from August 2015 to March 2015, a total number of 38 patients with age of 20 - 50 years, who were candidates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy with American Society of Anesthesiologists Class-I were chosen and randomly assigned into two groups. The night before operation, 1200 mg oral N-acetylcysteine is given to intervention group. Also, they received 600 mg IV N-acetylcysteine in the morning before operation. In the control group, two vitamin C effervescent tablets as placebo were given at night before operation and 3 ml sterile water as placebo was injected in the morning of <b>operation.</b> <b>Amount</b> of pethidine consumption and the changes in hemodynamic in two groups was recorded and analyzed at 24 hours after operation. 	 		 			 			Results: The average of patients age was not significant different between two groups (P= 0. 23). Average of pain score in placebo group was 3. 5 and in N-acetylcysteine group was 2. 7 that it was not significant difference between two groups (P= 0. 06). Average of pethidine consumption in placebo group was 52 mg and in N-acetylcysteine group was 29 mg in 24 hours, that the difference was statistically significant between two groups (P= 0. 01) 			Conclusion: As the results of the study, it can be concluded that the anti-inflammatory effects N- acetylcysteine can inhibit the function of lipoproteins and prostaglandins, reduced glutathione peroxidase and dismutase has been restored and can be used to treat pain or analgesic dose reduction.

40|$|Starting {{point for}} this essay was the G-BA's (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) {{demand for a}} minimum amount for {{selected}} operations. In this literature you will find only few connections between operation volume and injury infection, because {{the result of an}} operation is influenced by many different risk factors. On the basis of the OP-KISS module's data from the national reference center for surveillance of nosocomial infections it was examined: 1. if an association between postoperative injury infection and the annual amount selected operations existed. 2. which boundary values are most effective for the minimum amount regulation from the G-BA. 3. if the G-BA's boundary value for knee endoprosthesis implantation can be supported scientifically examining the postoperative injury infections. Nine indicator operations from the OP-KISS module's catalog from the national reference center for surveillance of nosocomial infections were examined. 278, 509 operations from 431 sections from {{five and a half years}} (from 01. 01. 2001 until 30. 06. 2006) were included in the calculations. The indicator operation's types were selected after the following aspects: 1. a minimum of 20 participating sections 2. a minimum of 10, 000 operations in the OP-KISS data base 3. operations that can be scheduled The threshold values were tested for the following areas of expertise and operations. 1. Orthopedy (knee endoprosthesis implantation, ilium endoprosthesis implantation after fracture, arthroscopy) 2. Abdominal surgery (herniotomy, colon operation, endoscopic cholecystectomy) 3. Gynecology (sectiotomy, mastectomy) 4. Struma operation A reduction of the injury infection rate when the operation volume is regulated can be observed in orthopedic indicator operations (knee endoprosthesis implantation and ilium endoprosthesis implantation). At > 50 operations per year the injury infection rate of knee endoprosthesis implantation decreased from 1. 91 % to 1 % and the injury infection rate of ilium endoprosthesis implantation decreased from 1. 73 % to 1. 06 %. When the boundary value was > 100 operations/ year the injury infection rate decreased even further (knee endoprosthesis implantation 0. 91 %, ilium endoprosthesis implantation 0. 94 %). This indicates that it would be effective to establish a <b>operation</b> <b>amount</b> regulation. Therefore an amount of > 50 operations/ year would be reasonable and an amount of > 100 operations/ year would be even better regarding lower injury infection rates. The G-BA's demand for minimum amount for selected operations for knee endoprosthesis implantation (a minimum of 50 operations per year) is therefore reasonable and justified. With abdominal surgery it is different. The wound infection rate of colon operations increases with a higher amount, though in the indicator operation COLO many different colon operations (some with long stretched resections) were included. The establishment of a <b>operation</b> <b>amount</b> regulation isn't reasonable when it comes to colon operations due to the different operation types. Further examination of the operation type's concentration would be necessary. No change of the hernio operation's rate is found (0. 94 %, 1. 09 %, 0. 99 %) and therefore a regulation isn't necessary. The same can be applied to cholecystectomies. For abdominal surgeries no boundary value could be found. For gynecologic operations a boundary value couldn't be found neither. Regarding mammaoperations there is no connection between the amount and the injury infection rate. For the indicator operation sectio cesarea a higher amount can lead to a significant increase of the injury infection rate. This could be a consequence of the different operation types (some in combination with further gynecologic operations) which are included in the indicator operation. Further no connection between amount and infection rate can be found for struma operations. The wound infection rate is already small and doesn't decrease further through a higher amount. Concluding it can be said that boundary values for orthopedic operations has been found. The minimum amount of 50 operations/ year from G-BA for knee endoprosthesis implantation has been affirmed. No boundary value could be found for abdominal surgeries and gynecologic operations. Further examinations are necessary for the establishment of minimum amounts. For the minimum amounts for other operations further examinations have to be done...|$|E
