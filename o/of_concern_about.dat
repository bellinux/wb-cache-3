5|$|On September 6, Mayor Ray Nagin {{ordered a}} forced {{evacuation}} of {{everyone from the}} city who {{was not involved in}} clean up work, citing safety and health concerns. The order was given not only as an attempt to restore law and order, but also out <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the hazardous living conditions in the city. Eviction efforts escalated three days later, when door-to-door searches were conducted to advise remaining residents to leave the city. Despite this, a number of residents defied the eviction order. While initially lax in enforcing evictions, National Guard troops eventually began to remove residents by force.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} English Church {{had been}} a matter for great debate in the {{years prior to the}} 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had {{traditionally}} exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> centralising authority in Rome.|$|E
5|$|In {{later years}} Warner said he regretted his {{decision}} to leave Stanford for Temple, and left because <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the school's changing funding priorities. The university leadership was planning to make Stanford primarily a graduate school; because {{of an increase in}} the number of junior colleges in California, the administration saw less need for undergraduate instruction at Stanford. Because fewer students were admitted, higher grade requirements for incoming students made admission more difficult and student athletes began enrolling at USC and California instead of Stanford. Warner soon realized that he had made the wrong decision; due to the economic effects of the Great Depression, the number of applicants to Stanford decreased significantly and athletes were again admitted. Temple upset the Florida Gators, coached by future Temple coach Josh Cody, 20–12 in Warner's last game.|$|E

25|$|The {{light crude}} oil spilled in the Mega Borg {{incident}} was brown and evaporated much quicker than the {{heavy crude oil}} in spills such as the Exxon Valdez. This means that the oil {{is less likely to}} heavily coat nearby beaches, flora and fauna, however the tanker was carrying more oil than the Exxon Valdez incident spilled in total, so there was a lot <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the oil not being able to evaporate if the slick became too thick.|$|E
25|$|After the {{announcement}} of imminent dam construction the valley became {{the focal point of}} Save Silent Valley, India's fiercest environmental debate of the decade. Because <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the endangered lion-tailed macaque, the issue was brought to public attention. Romulus Whitaker, founder of the Madras Snake Park and the Madras Crocodile Bank, was probably the first person to draw public attention to the small and remote area. In 1977 the Kerala Forest Research Institute carried out an ecological impact study of the Silent Valley area and proposed that the area be declared a biosphere reserve.|$|E

25|$|Parliament {{revised and}} {{expanded}} the Militia Ordinance, {{replacing it with}} the Militia Act 1858. Some of the main changes were clauses enabling volunteers to be included under such terms and conditions as the Governor may specify. The act also outlined the purposes under which Militia could be called upon, including invasion. Debates in Parliament had included expressions <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> Russian naval expansion in the northern Pacific, {{pointed out that the}} sole naval defence consisted of one 24-gun frigate, and the time it would take for Britain to come to the colony's aid.|$|E
25|$|Post-operative {{pain relief}} {{is subject to}} change. Traditionally, pain relief has been {{provided}} by relatively mild narcotic analgesics such as Acetaminophen with codeine, for milder pain, and stronger narcotic analgesics for more severe pain. Recently (January 2011), the FDA reduced the recommended total 24-hour dose because <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> liver toxicity from the Acetominophen component. An alternative {{is the use of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, themselves giving rise to concerns that their effect on platelets might increase the risk of post-operative bleeding. In turn, this has renewed interest in techniques other than traditional 'extra-capsular excision' in the hope that post-operative pain might be reduced.|$|E
25|$|However {{in spite}} of public outrage the Spanish {{government}} has {{made no attempt to}} reform policing and police mistreatment of the public. On the contrary, in July 2016 new reforms to the law on Public Security and the Criminal Code came into force which limit the right to freedom of assembly and give police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a 'lack of respect' towards them. The Law on Public Security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. The UN Human Rights Commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability. Fines for insulting a police officer can be up to €600 euros, and as much as €30,000 for spreading damaging photos of police officers. Amnesty International identifies three main areas <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> police action during demonstrations and assemblies: excessive use of force and inappropriate use of riot equipment, excessive use of force when arresting demonstrators, and ill-treatment of detainees in police custody.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1360s, during the Hundred Years War, {{there was an}} {{increased}} level <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> potential French raids or invasion along the south of England. Canterbury was particularly important for the defence of the south-east, as it formed a potential barrier to any invaders marching on London. An enquiry {{was carried out in}} 1363 into the state of Canterbury's defences, which concluded that the city was in a parlous position, as [...] "the walls of Canterbury are for the most part fallen because of age, and the stones thereof carried away, and the ditches under the walls are obstructed".|$|E
500|$|Rita Dhody and Narendra Kumar {{were chosen}} to style the film's characters. Dhody said it took nearly two months for UTV and Bhandarkar to persuade her to help design the film; she found the job {{challenging}} because {{she had to make}} everything as authentic as possible. Chopra had to wear 137 costumes in the film because her character passed through five phases. Initially, she was a [...] "hep" [...] character with brightly coloured, matching attire. Her make-up becomes lighter as she becomes a model and later a supermodel. When her career falters, Chopra's look becomes softer, demonstrating her character's lack <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> her appearance before she returns to Mumbai. According to Dhody, Chopra's look is [...] "very contemporary and a very much today's look, but my idea was to streamline and take it to the classic side [...] than making it trend-based".|$|E

500|$|In 1997, {{under the}} pretext <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> mad cow disease, Ratsiraka {{obstructed}} Ravalomanana's {{plans to build}} a farm stocked with imported high-yield milk cows. Ravalomanana overcame the objection by breeding high-yield cows locally, thereby further boosting Tiko production. Later that same year, Ratsiraka's daughters began competing with Tiko by importing and reselling vegetable oil under the brand name [...] "Eden". When Norbert Ratsirahonana declared himself a candidate in the 1997 presidential elections against Ratsiraka and Albert Zafy, Ravalomanana provided significant financial contributions to the Ratsirahonana campaign in return for tax exemptions on his edible oil products for a period of five years. The profits he consequently earned were reinvested to create the Magro wholesale company in 1998. By 2001, over a dozen principal warehouses throughout the country enabled widespread distribution of Tiko products to urban and rural areas, with a flagship warehouse in the Akorandrano neighborhood of Antananarivo.|$|E
500|$|When the Archbishop of Canterbury, Hubert Walter, died on 13 July 1205, John became {{involved}} in a dispute with Pope Innocent III {{that would lead to}} the king's excommunication. The Norman and Angevin kings had traditionally exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards, however, successive popes had put forward a reforming message that emphasised the importance of the church being [...] "governed more coherently and more hierarchically from the centre" [...] and established [...] "its own sphere of authority and jurisdiction, separate from and independent of that of the lay ruler", in the words of historian Richard Huscroft. After the 1140s, these principles had been largely accepted within the English church, albeit with an element <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> centralising authority in Rome. These changes brought the customary rights of lay rulers such as John over ecclesiastical appointments into question. Pope Innocent was, according to historian Ralph Turner, an [...] "ambitious and aggressive" [...] religious leader, insistent on his rights and responsibilities within the church.|$|E
500|$|Edge of Darkness {{tapped into}} a {{cultural}} zeitgeist <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> nuclear power and nuclear warfare {{in the early}} to mid 1980s. In 1980, current affairs programme Panorama broadcast “If The Bomb Drops”, a documentary that examined how well prepared Britain was for a nuclear attack; in 1983, The Day After an American TV movie about a nuclear war aired, as well as seeing the release of the feature film WarGames, showing the 'no winner' outcome of nuclear war; in 1984, the BBC broadcast On the Eighth Day, a documentary about the effects of a nuclear winter and Threads, a drama about a nuclear attack on Sheffield while 1985 saw the first screening of Peter Watkins' nuclear war television film The War Game, banned on television since 1965. [...] Edge of Darkness also rode on a wave of preoccupation with the secretive nature of the State in both fact (e.g. This Week’s “Death on the Rock” (1988) about the deaths of three Provisional IRA members in Gibraltar and Secret Society (1987) about undisclosed matters of public interest which led to the sacking of BBC Director General Alasdair Milne) and fiction (e.g. the films Defence of the Realm (1985) and The Whistle Blower (1987) and the television serials A Very British Coup (1988) and Traffik (1989)).|$|E

500|$|Walker {{also took}} an {{interest}} in demographics later in his career, particularly towards the issues of immigration and birth rates. He published The Growth of the United States in 1882 and Restriction on Immigration in 1896 arguing for increasing restrictions out <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the diminished industrial and intellectual capacity of the most recent wave of immigrants. Walker also argued that unrestricted immigration was the major reason behind nineteenth-century Native American fertility decline, but while the argument was politically popular and became widely accepted in mobilizing restrictions on immigration, it rested upon a surprisingly facile statistical analysis that was later refuted. Writing on immigrants from southern Italy, Hungary, Austria, and Russia in The Atlantic, Walker claimed, [...] "The entrance into our political, social, and industrial life of such vast masses of peasantry, degraded below our utmost conceptions, is a matter which no intelligent patriot can look upon without the gravest apprehension and alarm. These people have no history behind them which is of a nature to give encouragement. They have none of the inherited instincts and tendencies which made it comparatively easy to deal with the immigration of the olden time. They are beaten men from beaten races; representing the worst failures in the struggle for existence. Centuries are against them, as centuries were on the side of those who formerly came to us. They have none of the ideas and aptitudes which fit men to take up readily and easily the problem of self-care and self-government, such as belong to those who are descended from the tribes that met under the oak-trees of old Germany to make laws and choose chieftains." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 22, 2013, The Hollywood Reporter {{announced}} the casting of Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman. [...] On January 17, 2014, {{it was announced}} that the film had been delayed from its original July 17, 2015 release date to May 6, 2016, in order to give the filmmakers [...] "time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story". The film's release was moved again to March 25, 2016, [...] "avoiding a high-profile showdown with [...] on May 6, 2016". At some point prior to the events of the film, Wayne Manor was burnt down, with Bruce and Alfred relocating to a smaller glass house above the Batcave. During the film, Bruce is subtly manipulated by Lex Luthor into perceiving Superman as an alien being too removed from humanity to be fully trusted, with Luthor intending to provoke a conflict between the two that will either force Superman to kill or see Batman defeat 'God'. Bruce's dark views are implied {{to be the result of}} the Joker killing Jason Todd in some past confrontation, with Batman showing a lack <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> whether or not he kills his opponents in battle and branding certain criminals with the mark of the Bat. However, when he faces Superman with kryptonite weapons, he realises how far he has fallen when Superman asks him to 'save Martha' (Luthor using Martha Kent as a hostage to provoke Superman into confronting Batman), the reminder of his own mother helping Batman realise what he has become and acknowledge that Superman is fundamentally human despite his powers. After Batman saves Martha Kent from Luthor's minions, he fights alongside Superman and new hero Wonder Woman to contain the Kryptonian deformity Luthor created to kill Superman, a battle that results in Superman's death when he stabs the deformity with the kryptonite spear and is impaled himself. Taking Luthor's metahuman files, Bruce states that he intends to gather the metahumans to prepare for an implied future threat that Luthor made reference to.|$|E
