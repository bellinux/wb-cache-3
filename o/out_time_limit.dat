40|$|This paper {{describes}} the cycle time reduction approach of {{injection moulding machine}} for DVD manufacturing. Optimizing {{the parameters of the}} injection moulding machine is critical to improve manufacturing processes. This research focuses on the optimization of injection moulding machine parameters. Suggestions for processimprovements are made {{based on the results of}} a designed experiment. The objective of this experiment is toprovide statistical evidence for optimizing parameters of an injection moulding machine. The machine parameters to be investigated include cooling time, holding time, and robot take <b>out</b> <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b> These parameters are evaluated against the problem of decreasing the cycle time for each part. Experimental data were collected following the designed experiment procedures, and a statistical analysis was erformed to give a basis for process improvement recommendations. The results of the experiment showed a way to achieve the goal of ptimizing the injection moulding machine in a sensible and cost efficient way...|$|E

40|$|The {{best way}} to {{evaluate}} community health services remains {{the subject of much}} argument and debate. This paper explores difficulties encountered in the management of a randomized controlled trial of physiotherapy in a primary health care setting, and discusses conflicts which arose when carrying <b>out</b> a <b>time</b> <b>limited</b> commissioned evaluation of a carer support scheme. Although randomized controlled trials are still regarded as the gold standard in medical research, they can be difficult to coordinate, and often cannot be applied when patient problems are chronic or incurable and require multidisciplinary intervention. There are many cultural and organizational barriers that have to be overcome for evaluation to be successful and meaningful. If these barriers are underestimated or ignored, the quality of evaluation is compromised...|$|R
5000|$|The prior patent {{must provide}} enough {{information}} to allow the subsequently claimed invention to be performed without undue burden. When considering whether there is undue burden, {{the nature of the}} invention must be taken into account. For example, if the invention takes place in a field of technology in which trials and experiments are generally carried out, the threshold for undue burden will tend to be higher than in circumstances in which less effort is normal. If inventive steps are required, the prior art will not be considered as enabling. However, routine trials are acceptable and would not be considered undue burden. But experiments or trials and errors are not to be prolonged even in fields of technology in which trials and experiments are generally carried <b>out.</b> No <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> on exercises of energy can be laid down; however, prolonged or arduous trial and error would not be considered routine.|$|R
50|$|All dinosaurs {{start from}} level one. The higher the level, {{the more money}} they earn. When a dinosaur reaches the halfway mark, it matures into its adult form. To level up a dinosaur, the player must feed it. When a dinosaur reaches level 10, it can be evolved. Evolving a dinosaur allows it to reach the next level tier, which allows it to make more money. Evolving a dinosaur also changes its skin, which only serves for visual appeal and does not affect gameplay. Choosing the evolve option is {{irreversible}} and makes the evolving dinosaur unavailable until it is fully evolved. No money can be earned from it during this time. When the dinosaur is fully evolved, it will revert to an egg form, and the player must wait <b>out</b> the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> until it hatches again. The process can be repeated up to level 40 and can be done for every dinosaur. The player then invests money to evolve it when more amber is found. It varies in cost for each time. It takes ten strands of DNA to finish the process.|$|R

500|$|In Final Fantasy XII, {{a mysterious}} {{phenomenon}} known as [...] "Mist" [...] is the key energy which allows characters to cast summoning magic and perform [...] "Quickenings". After defeating an Esper in combat, the player {{will be able to}} summon it to the battlefield. Similar to Final Fantasy X, the summoned creatures become active participants in battle, as opposed to the cinematic attacks seen in previous games in the series. Unlike Final Fantasy X, however, Espers follow hidden gambits, rather than the player's direct command. The summoner remains an active member in the fight, able to attack and cast support magic, instead of leaving the party or standing idle while the summoned creature fights. An Esper will leave the battle if either the summoner or itself is knocked <b>out,</b> its <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> expires, or it executes its special attack. Some Espers have origins in Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and others are derived from the final bosses of previous Final Fantasy games such as Chaos, the final boss of the first Final Fantasy, and Zeromus, the final boss of Final Fantasy IV.|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} how the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> {{on a test}} can be set to control the {{probability}} of a test taker running <b>out</b> of <b>time</b> before completing it. The probability is derived from the item parameters in the lognormal model for response times. Examples of curves representing the probability of running <b>out</b> of <b>time</b> on a test with given parameters {{as a function of the}} <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> are presented. Unlike the traditional methods of dealing with test speededness, which assess the degree of speededness after the test has been administered, the curves enables us to set a desired degree in advance. The method is demonstrated using an empirical data set...|$|R
5|$|After the {{contestant}} decides {{for which}} amount to play, the prize money is {{displayed on the}} gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves {{one step closer to}} the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked <b>out</b> by the <b>time</b> <b>limit.</b>|$|R
40|$|For leased equipment, the lessor {{carries out}} the {{maintenance}} of the equipment. Usually, the contract of lease specifies the penalty for equipment failures and for repairs not being carried <b>out</b> within specified <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> This implies that optimal preventive maintenance policies must take these penalty costs into account and properly traded against the cost of preventive maintenance actions. The costs associated with failures are high as unplanned corrective maintenance actions are costly and the resulting penalties due to lease contract terms being violated. The paper develops a model to determine the optimal parameters of a preventive maintenance policy that takes into account all these costs to minimize the total expected cost to the lessor for new item lease. The parameters of the policy are (i) the number of preventive maintenance actions to be carried out over the lease period, (ii) the time instants for such actions, and (iii) the level of action.

40|$|In {{increasing}} number, {{victims of}} business fraud are bringing lawsuits under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Since the statute does not set <b>out</b> a <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for bringing suit, the courts must determine the appropriate statute of limitations. Malley-Duff 2 ̆ 6 Associates, Inc. v. Crown Life Insurance Co. illustrates the difficulties Congress creates {{for the courts}} when it fails to provide a limitations period. RICO makes it illegal {{to engage in a}} 2 ̆ 2 pattern of racketeering activity 2 ̆ 2 for certain illegal purposes. A 2 ̆ 2 pattern of racketeering activity 2 ̆ 2 consists of at least two acts of 2 ̆ 2 racketeering activity 2 ̆ 2 within a ten-year period. 2 ̆ 2 Racketeering activity 2 ̆ 2 is defined in terms of a number of state and federal offenses, commonly referred to as predicate offenses. In addition to criminal penalties, RICO provides that any person injured in business or property by reason of a RICO violation may recover treble damages and attorneys 2 ̆ 7 fees. In this case, the Supreme Court will determine the statute of limitations for a RICO treble damages claim. To answer this question, the Court must decide a numberof related issues: Should the courts borrow a statute of limitations from state or federal law? Should there be a uniform statute of limitations for all RICO claims, or should the limitations period vary from case to case, depending upon the underlying offenses? If there should be a uniform period, what is the most appropriatecharacterization for a private RICO claim...|$|R
40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> for Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> for tax assessment.
