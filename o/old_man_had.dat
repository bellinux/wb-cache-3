5|$|The Old Man is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists {{at the point where the}} Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> <b>had</b> been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E
25|$|Peter, Walabonsus, Sabinian, Wistremundus, Habentius and Jeremiah - June 7, 851. Peter was a priest; Walabonsus, a deacon; Sabinian and Wistremundus, monks of St Zoilus in Córdoba in Al-Andalus; Habentius, a monk of St Christopher's; Jeremiah, a very <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> <b>had</b> {{founded the}} monastery of Tábanos, near Córdoba. For {{publicly}} denouncing Muhammad they were executed under Abderrahman in Córdoba. Jeremiah was scourged to death; {{the others were}} beheaded.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus {{discovered}} that his old school master and foster father, Silenus, had gone missing. The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been drinking, and had wandered away drunk, {{and was found}} by some peasants, who carried him to their king (alternatively, he passed out in Midas' rose garden). Midas recognized him, and treated him hospitably, entertaining him for ten days and nights with politeness, while Silenus entertained Midas and his friends with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, he brought Silenus back to Dionysus. Dionysus offered Midas his choice of whatever reward he wanted.|$|E

500|$|Sanh {{returned}} to southern Vietnam, and began dressing as a Buddhist monk. He travelled through the six provinces of the Mekong Delta region. His associates Hiep and Tri found {{an elderly man}} from Cholon in Saigon, and presented the senior citizen to the populace as a [...] "living Buddha". After some local elders objected to their activities, they moved to the centre of Cholon. The old man took up residence with Sanh, and peasants and tradespeople soon began flocking to their makeshift temple, located {{in a house in}} Cholon's Thuan Kieu Street. As their temple was located in a prominent commercial area, the group began to collect more funds. The donors made offerings of gold and silver, with some individual donations being worth as much as 1,500 piastres. When the [...] "living Buddha" [...] unexpectedly died in February 1912, he was interred in the family shrine of a notable follower. Sanh's strategists declared that before the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> died, he named Sanh as the rightful Emperor of Vietnam. In the meantime, the old man's remains became the object of veneration, providing further cover for political plotting and fundraising when visitors came to pay their respects. After the completion of the funeral rites, Sanh and his followers staged an impromptu coronation ceremony at Battambang in October 1912. Sanh took on the name Phan Xích Long and was also known as Hồng Long, both of which mean [...] "red dragon".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> gained {{respect for}} his son's {{integrity}} and courage and told him, [...] "Let nothing in this world tempt you to wrong your conscience." [...] The Admiral also knew that after his death young Penn would become more vulnerable in his pursuit of justice. In an act which not only secured his son's protection, but also set the conditions for the founding of Pennsylvania, the Admiral wrote to the Duke of York, the successor to the throne.|$|E
2500|$|The first witness {{called by}} the {{prosecution}} was Colonel Jefferson Jones, who had interviewed Celia in her cell after her indictment and arrest. He recounted {{the details of his}} conversation with Celia, wherein she had told him [...] "the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been having sexual intercourse with her," [...] and that {{on the night of the}} murder, she had [...] "told him not to come, that if he came she would hurt him." [...] Jones then described the manner in which Celia had killed Newsom and disposed of his body, as Celia herself had described it to him.|$|E

2500|$|... "It was Sunday. Flying Hawk's {{leave of}} absence was about up and his visit to his white brother {{was coming to an}} end. The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> arisen with the sun and had taken a long walk in the woods to see the {{squirrels}} and hear the birds sing, he said. After breakfast, the Chief said that {{he wanted to go to}} church. A car was brought around, loaded to capacity, and the old Chief, in full dress and just a little paint on his face to cover his wrinkles, took place beside his host for a trip of two miles to the big Catholic edifice on State Street in the city's First Ward. Throughout the service the Chief responded with dignity to every detail of the long and solemn ceremony--and it may be said too that he attracted the gaze of everyone present. When formal service ended, the popular Father McGivney came to take his hand in welcome and gave his blessing, but it was long before the Chief was permitted to take leave of his friends and neighbors gathered about him to shake hands. The Chief was visibly agitated and frequently referred to his disappointment in having to go. He said he would not likely ever come again; he felt that he would soon go to join his friends in the Sand Hills." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 11, 1927, 3-year-old Billy Beaton and his 12-year-old {{brother were}} {{playing in the}} {{apartment}} hallway in Brooklyn with 4-year-old Billy Gaffney. When the 12-year-old left for his apartment, both younger boys disappeared; Beaton was found later {{on the roof of}} the apartments. When asked what happened to Gaffney, Beaton said [...] "the bogeyman took him." [...] Gaffney's body was never recovered. Initially, serial killer Peter Kudzinowski was a suspect in the boy's murder. Then, Joseph Meehan, a motorman on a Brooklyn trolley, saw a picture of Fish in a newspaper and identified him as the old man whom he saw February 11, 1927; the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> been trying to quiet a little boy sitting with him on the trolley. The boy was not wearing a jacket, was crying for his mother, and was dragged by the man on and off the trolley. Beaton's description of the [...] "bogeyman" [...] matched Fish. Police matched the description of the child to Billy Gaffney. Detectives of the Manhattan Missing Persons Bureau were able to establish that Fish was employed as a house painter by a Brooklyn real estate company during February 1927 and that on the day of Billy Gaffney's disappearance he was working at a location a few miles away from where the boy was abducted. Fish claimed the following in a letter to his attorney: ...|$|E

In a fury the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> <b>had</b> driven Jansen out into the road.|$|E
