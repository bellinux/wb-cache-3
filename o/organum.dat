25|$|Chant was {{normally}} sung in unison. Later innovations included tropes, {{which is}} a new text sung to the same melodic phrases in a melismatic chant (repeating an entire Alleluia-melody on a new text for instance, or repeating a full phrase with a new text that comments on the previously sung text) and various forms of <b>organum,</b> (improvised) harmonic embellishment of chant melodies focusing on octaves, fifths, fourths, and, later, thirds. Neither tropes nor <b>organum,</b> however, belong to the chant repertory proper. The main exception to this is the sequence, whose origins lay in troping the extended melisma of Alleluia chants known as the jubilus, but the sequences, like the tropes, were later officially suppressed. The Council of Trent struck sequences from the Gregorian corpus, except those for Easter, Pentecost, Corpus Christi and All Souls' Day.|$|E

25|$|Gregorian chants were {{organized}} initially into four, then eight, and finally 12 modes. Typical melodic features include a characteristic ambitus, and also characteristic intervallic patterns {{relative to a}} referential mode final, incipits and cadences, the use of reciting tones at a particular distance from the final, around which the other notes of the melody revolve, and a vocabulary of musical motifs woven together through a process called centonization to create families of related chants. The scale patterns are organized against a background pattern formed of conjunct and disjunct tetrachords, producing a larger pitch system called the gamut. The chants can be sung by using six-note patterns called hexachords. Gregorian melodies are traditionally written using neumes, an early form of musical notation from which the modern four-line and five-line staff developed. Multi-voice elaborations of Gregorian chant, known as <b>organum,</b> were an early stage {{in the development of}} Western polyphony.|$|E

500|$|Francis Bacon (no direct {{relation}} to Roger, who lived 300 years earlier) was a seminal figure in philosophy {{of science at}} the time of the Scientific Revolution. In his work Novum <b>Organum</b> (1620) – a reference to Aristotle's Organon – Bacon outlined a new system of logic to improve upon the old philosophical process of syllogism. Bacon's method relied on experimental histories to eliminate alternative theories. In 1637, René Descartes established a new framework for grounding scientific knowledge in his treatise, Discourse on Method, advocating the central role of reason as opposed to sensory experience. By contrast, in 1713, the 2nd edition of Isaac Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica argued that [...] "...hypotheses... have no place in experimental philosophy. In this philosophy propositions are deduced from the phenomena and rendered general by induction. [...] " [...] This passage influenced a [...] "later generation of philosophically-inclined readers to pronounce a ban on causal hypotheses in natural philosophy." [...] In particular, later in the 18th century, David Hume would famously articulate skepticism about the ability of science to determine causality and gave a definitive formulation of the problem of induction. [...] The 19th century writings of John Stuart Mill are also considered important in the formation of current conceptions of the scientific method, as well as anticipating later accounts of scientific explanation.|$|E

On several occasions he mentions that to keep his judgment as unprepossessed as might be {{with any of the}} modern theories of philosophy, until he was [...] "provided of experiments" [...] to help him judge of them, he refrained from any study of the Atomical and the Cartesian systems, and even of the Novum <b>Organum</b> itself, though he admits to [...] "transiently consulting" [...] them about a few particulars. Nothing was more alien to his mental temperament than the spinning of hypotheses. He regarded the acquisition of knowledge as an end in itself, and in consequence he gained a wider outlook on the aims of scientific inquiry than had been enjoyed by his predecessors for many centuries. This, however, did not mean that he paid no attention to the practical application of science nor that he despised knowledge which tended to use.|$|E

2500|$|Credited as {{the first}} to use a {{diminutive}} of organ (i.e., little organ) for cellular structures was German zoologist Karl August Möbius (1884), who used the term organula (plural of organulum, the diminutive of Latin <b>organum).</b> In a footnote, which was published as a correction in the next issue of the journal, he justified his suggestion to call organs of unicellular organisms [...] "organella" [...] since they are only differently formed parts of one cell, in contrast to multicellular organs of multicellular organisms.|$|E

2500|$|Dudley Fenner helped popularize Ramist logic, a {{reaction}} against Aristotle. Another influential work was the Novum <b>Organum</b> by Francis Bacon, published in 1620.

In this work, Bacon rejects the syllogistic method of Aristotle {{in favor of an}} alternative procedure [...] "which by slow and faithful toil gathers information from things and brings it into understanding". This method is known as inductive reasoning, a method which starts from empirical observation and proceeds to lower axioms or propositions; from these lower axioms, more general ones can be induced.

2500|$|All that {{is known}} about him comes from the {{writings}} of a later student at the cathedral known as Anonymous IV, an Englishman who left a treatise on theory and who mentions Léonin as the composer of the Magnus Liber, the [...] "great book" [...] of <b>organum.</b> [...] Much of the Magnus Liber is devoted to clausulaemelismatic portions of Gregorian chant which were extracted into separate pieces where the original note values of the chant were greatly slowed down and [...] a fast-moving upper part is superimposed. [...] Léonin {{might have been the}} first composer to use the rhythmic modes, and maybe he invented a notation for them. According to W.G. Waite, writing in 1954: [...] "It was Léonin's incomparable achievement to introduce a rational system of rhythm into polyphonic music for the first time, and, equally important, to create a method of notation expressive of this rhythm." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel belongs {{not only}} to the {{religious}} tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage. It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophesy but as a historical book, [...] "a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man". In the early modern period the physicist Isaac Newton paid special attention to it, and Francis Bacon borrowed a motto from it for his work Novum <b>Organum.</b> Philosophers, such as Baruch Spinoza drew on it. In the 20th century its apocalyptic second half attracted the attention of Carl Jung. The book has also inspired musicians, from medieval liturgical drama to the 20th century compositions of Darius Milhaud.

2500|$|Gregorian melodies {{provided}} musical {{material and}} served as models for tropes and liturgical dramas. Vernacular hymns such as [...] "Christ ist erstanden" [...] and [...] "Nun bitten wir den Heiligen Geist" [...] adapted original Gregorian melodies to translated texts. Secular tunes such as the popular Renaissance [...] "In Nomine" [...] were based on Gregorian melodies. Beginning with the improvised harmonizations of Gregorian chant known as <b>organum,</b> Gregorian chants became a driving force in medieval and Renaissance polyphony. Often, a Gregorian chant (sometimes in modified form) would {{be used as a}} cantus firmus, so that the consecutive notes of the chant determined the harmonic progression. The Marian antiphons, especially Alma Redemptoris Mater, were frequently arranged by Renaissance composers. The use of chant as a cantus firmus was the predominant practice until the Baroque period, when the stronger harmonic progressions made possible by an independent bass line became standard.|$|E
2500|$|Bacon's seminal work Novum <b>Organum</b> was {{influential}} in the 1630s and 1650s among scholars, in particular Sir Thomas Browne, who in his encyclopaedia Pseudodoxia Epidemica (1646–72) frequently adheres to a Baconian approach to his scientific enquiries. This book entails {{the basis of the}} Scientific Method as a means of observation and induction. During the Restoration, Bacon was commonly invoked as a guiding spirit of the Royal Society founded under Charles II in 1660. During the 18th-century French Enlightenment, Bacon's non-metaphysical approach to science became more influential than the dualism of his French contemporary Descartes, and was associated with criticism of the ancien regime. In 1733 Voltaire introduced him to a French audience as the [...] "father" [...] of the scientific method, an understanding which had become widespread by the 1750s. In the 19th century his emphasis on induction was revived and developed by William Whewell, among others. He has been reputed as the [...] "Father of Experimental Philosophy".|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the rationalists, the [...] "empiricists", took their orientation from Francis Bacon, whose arguments for methodical science were earlier than those of Descartes, and less directed towards mathematics and certainty. Bacon {{is known for his}} doctrine of the [...] "idols of the mind", presented in his Novum <b>Organum,</b> and in his Essays described normal human thinking as biased towards believing in lies. But he was also the opponent of all metaphysical explanations of nature, or over-reaching speculation generally, and a proponent of science based on small steps of experience, [...] experimentation and methodical induction. So while agreeing upon the need to help common sense with a methodical approach, he also insisted that starting from common sense, including especially common sense perceptions, was acceptable and correct. He influenced Locke and Pierre Bayle, in their critique of metaphysics, and in 1733 Voltaire [...] "introduced him as the [...] "father" [...] of the scientific method" [...] to a French audience, an understanding that was widespread by 1750. Together with this, references to [...] "common sense" [...] became positive and associated with modernity, in {{contrast to}} negative references to metaphysics, which was associated with the ancien regime.|$|E
2500|$|Peptide hormones have {{important}} influences upon the hypothalamus, {{and to do}} so they must pass through the blood–brain barrier. The hypothalamus is bounded in part by specialized brain regions that lack an effective blood–brain barrier; the capillary endothelium at these sites is fenestrated to allow free passage of even large proteins and other molecules. [...] Some of these sites are the sites of neurosecretion - the neurohypophysis and the median eminence. However, others are sites at which the brain samples the composition of the blood. Two of these sites, the SFO (subfornical organ) and the OVLT (<b>organum</b> vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) are so-called circumventricular organs, where neurons are in intimate contact with both blood and CSF. These structures are densely vascularized, and contain osmoreceptive and sodium-receptive neurons that control drinking, vasopressin release, sodium excretion, and sodium appetite. They also contain neurons with receptors for angiotensin, atrial natriuretic factor, endothelin and relaxin, each of which important in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance. Neurons in the OVLT and SFO project to the supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus, and also to preoptic hypothalamic areas. The circumventricular organs may also be the site of action of interleukins to elicit both fever and ACTH secretion, via effects on paraventricular neurons.|$|E
2500|$|Bacon {{proposed}} a great reformation of all process of knowledge {{for the advancement}} of learning divine and human, which he called Instauratio Magna (The Great Instauration). For Bacon, this reformation would lead to a great advancement in science and a progeny of new inventions that would relieve mankind's miseries and needs. His Novum <b>Organum</b> was published in 1620. He argued that man is [...] "the minister and interpreter of nature", that [...] "knowledge and human power are synonymous", that [...] "effects are produced by the means of instruments and helps", and that [...] "man while operating can only apply or withdraw natural bodies; nature internally performs the rest", and later that [...] "nature can only be commanded by obeying her". Here is an abstract of the philosophy of this work, that by the knowledge of nature and the using of instruments, man can govern or direct the natural work of nature to produce definite results. [...] Therefore, that man, by seeking knowledge of nature, can reach power over it – and thus reestablish the [...] "Empire of Man over creation", which had been lost by the Fall together with man's original purity. In this way, he believed, would mankind be raised above conditions of helplessness, poverty and misery, while coming into a condition of peace, prosperity and security.|$|E
