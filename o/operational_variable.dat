A typical NDE system comprises of an energy source, a test specimen and a sensor array. <b>Operational</b> <b>variables</b> include uncontrollable changes in source signal strength and/or frequency, variations in the sensitivity of the sensor and alterations in the material properties of the test specimen. These <b>operational</b> <b>variables</b> can confuse subsequent signal interpretation schemes, such as those relying on artificial neural networks.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Small {{building}} contractors in South Africa often {{struggle to}} produce quality work {{on time and}} have {{a high rate of}} business failure. In an effort to improve the effectiveness and viability of smaller construction firms in South Africa, this research investigates key <b>operational</b> <b>variables</b> affecting their corporate financial performance. <b>Operational</b> <b>variables</b> relevant to financial performance were identified through a literature review. A questionnaire was then designed to assess {{the extent to which these}} variables are perceived to influence the financial performance of construction companies. The study participants were technical and management staff at small and medium-sized building and civil engineering construction companies categorized from grades 2 to 6 on the South African Construction Industry Development Board (cidb) registers, in four provinces of South Africa. Sixty-two valid responses were received. Based on how the respondents rated the variables in the study, it appears that contractors generally perceive four factors as having the greatest impact on corporate performance: technical ability (the possession and effective use of plant and equipment), financial management skills (in order to accumulate financial capital), training of staff in organizational knowledge in skills transfer and networking with industry stakeholders. Contractors across the five cidb grades did not differ significantly in their ratings of the importance of the <b>operational</b> <b>variables</b> and their indicators. The study also found that the perceived importance of three key <b>operational</b> <b>variables</b> (technical ability, financial capacity and networking) was positively related to the actual financial performance of companies, as measured by turnover, net assets and profit margin. The study concludes that construction companies need to prioritize the development of these key factors to improve their corporate performance. The findings will be of significance to contractors, industry practitioners, project managers and members of the research community in understanding the key <b>operational</b> <b>variables</b> that are crucial to construction firms’ success and effective project delivery...|$|R

To study the deformation of the cornea after the operation and provide some valuable references for clinical practice.  METHODS—The expression of the correction ratio has been deduced, which can be directly represent as the deformation ratio of the corneal radius after the operation. This allows for the numerical simulation of the RK operation. On the basis of the known biomechanical property of the cornea, by means of the finite element method, a series of computerised geometric and biomechanical models for the simulation of refractive surgery have been established. Some <b>operational</b> <b>variables</b> in the RK operation were analysed, and their influence on the operational outcome has been computed and systematically analysed.  RESULTS AND CONCLUSION—All of the four variables {{have a positive effect on}} the operational outcome. The greater the four variables are the more correction effects of myopia can be obtained. Because the four variables are interinfluential, the <b>operational</b> <b>variables</b> can be optimised to get the best result in order to meet patients' differing requirements. ...|$|R

This modeling approach resulted in an isomorphous expression for all configurations consisting of a parameter beta*(s) (characterizing the maximum fraction of VOC transferable from the gas to the aqueous phase) and the gradient established between the gas and the aqueous phase. The models were validated against experimental data (at empty bed residence times, EBRT, of 120, 60 and 40 s) exhibiting an overall goodness of fit of 0. 98, 0. 98 and 0. 70 for the two-liquid phase STR, BTF and ALR, respectively. The two-liquid phase BTF exhibited the maximum value of beta*(s) (0. 87 - 0. 58), followed by the STR (0. 77 - 0. 49) and the ALR (0. 23 - 0. 19).

In such configuration, the main <b>operational</b> <b>variable</b> is the Tag Loss Probability (TLP).

In this paper we focus on the EPCglobal Class- 1 Gen- 2 standard, which specifies an anti-collision protocol based on Framed Slotted Aloha. Our work is aimed at evaluating the TLP for the different configurations of such protocol, and selecting the right scenario configuration to guarantee a TLP below a given limit. This issue has not been studied yet, despite of its relevance in real-world scenarios based on assembly lines or other dynamic environments.
