5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> {{danger to}} Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} {{was unable to}} put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E

In particular, the lattice constants of the analogous lanthanum and actinium compounds differ by only a few percent.|$|E

5|$|The {{permanganate}} {{exhibits a}} higher toxicity than the manganese(II) compounds. The fatal dose is about 10g, and several fatal intoxications have occurred. The strong oxidative effect leads to necrosis of the mucous membrane. For example, the esophagus is affected if the permanganate is swallowed. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> amount is {{absorbed by the}} intestines, but this small amount shows severe effects on the kidneys and on the liver.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|Although fortifications {{could still}} be {{valuable}} in times of war, they had played <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> role during the Wars of the Roses and, when Henry VII invaded and seized the throne in 1485, he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during the campaign. Henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and had few reasons to fear an external invasion from the continent; he invested little in coastal defences {{over the course of}} his reign. Modest fortifications existed along the coasts, based around simple blockhouses and towers, primarily in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but they were very limited in scale.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> amount of heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|As much as 80% of {{therapeutic}} doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver. Conjugation with glycine forms salicyluric acid, and with glucuronic acid to form two different glucuronide esters. The conjugate with the acetyl group intact {{is referred to}} as the acyl glucuronide; the deacetylated conjugate is the phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to gentisic acid. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as metabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1970s Kneale {{was once again}} {{regularly}} writing for the BBC, who announced plans to produce a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. This ultimately was not made by the BBC, but Kneale's scripts were produced in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television, titled Quatermass. This time John Mills played Quatermass in an expensive and high-profile production, which was screened on the ITV network. The production company Euston Films also released a 100-minute film version titled The Quatermass Conclusion or Quatermass IV, for distribution abroad. There was, however, little interest among film distributors, and it received <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds {{become part of a}} system in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{directed}} {{and starred in}} White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an adaptation of Peter Viertel's roman à clef, about John Huston {{and the making of}} the classic film The African Queen. Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989, the film received some critical attention but with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> release earned just $8.4million. Later in 1990, Eastwood {{directed and}} co-starred with Charlie Sheen in The Rookie, a buddy cop action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.|$|E

5|$|Flash memory can be {{programmed}} and erased <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of times. This {{is often referred}} to as the maximum number of program/erasecycles (P/Ecycles) it can sustain over the life of the flash memory. Single-level cell (SLC) flash, designed for higher performance and longer endurance, can typically operate between 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. , multi-level cell (MLC) flash is designed for lower cost applications and has a greatly reduced cycle count of typically between 3,000 and 5,000. Since 2013, triple-level cell (TLC) flash has been available, with cycle counts dropping to 1,000 program-erase (P/E) cycles. A lower write amplification is more desirable, as it corresponds to a reduced number of P/Ecycles on the flash memory and thereby to an increased SSD life.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{gave the}} four {{recognized}} parties free air time for political statements. The television broadcasts's audio tracks served also {{for use on}} radio. The three opposition parties gave their party leader all of the broadcast time, though Diefenbaker, who did not speak French well, played <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> role in the Tories' French-language broadcasts. In one, he introduced party president Léon Balcer, a Quebecer, who gave the speech. Diefenbaker had no objection to makeup and, according to Meisel, was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective. A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that Diefenbaker made the strongest impression of the four leaders.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the coup, Taraki and other party leaders initiated other radical Marxist policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. However, he ruled over a nation with a deep Islamic religious culture and {{a long history of}} resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control, and consequently many of these reforms were not actually implemented nationwide. Popular resentment of Taraki's drastic policy changes triggered surging unrest throughout the country, reducing government control to <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> area. The strength of this anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the Afghan civil war.|$|E
