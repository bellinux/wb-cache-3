40|$|Pathogenic {{strains of}} Escherichia coli produce {{a number of}} toxins that belong to the AB 5 toxin family, which {{comprise}} a catalytic A-subunit that induces cellular dysfunction and a B-pentamer that recognizes host glycans. Although the molecular actions {{of many of the}} individual subunits of AB 5 toxins are well understood, how they self-associate and the effect of this association on cytotoxicity are poorly understood. Here we have solved the structure of the holo-SubAB toxin that, in contrast to <b>other</b> <b>AB</b> 5 toxins whose molecular targets are located in the cytosol, cleaves the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP. SubA interacts with SubB in a similar manner to <b>other</b> <b>AB</b> 5 toxins via the A 2 helix and a conserved disulfide bond that joins the A 1 domain with the A 2 helix. The structure revealed that the active site of SubA is not occluded by the B-pentamer, and the B-pentamer does not enhance or inhibit the activity of SubA. Structure-based sequence comparisons with <b>other</b> <b>AB</b> 5 toxin family members, combined with extensive mutagenesis studies on SubB, show how the hydrophobic patch on top of the B-pentamer plays a dominant role in binding the A-subunit. The structure of SubAB and the accompanying functional characterization of various mutants of SubAB provide a framework for understanding the important role of the B-pentamer in the assembly and the intracellular trafficking of this AB 5 toxin.

40|$|Compares the {{prevalence}} of disability among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous people, {{using data from the}} 2012 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers. Introduction Over the last decade there has been an increased awareness of the disparity that exists between the socioeconomic circumstances of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and non-Indigenous populations of Australia. With Government and community initiatives aimed at ‘Closing the Gap’ in outcomes between the two populations, there has been a corresponding interest in comparative data related to both groups. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with disability may be especially vulnerable to disadvantage. This article compares {{the prevalence}} of disability among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous people, using data from the 2012 Survey of Disability, Ageing and Carers (SDAC) which provides the most comprehensive measure of disability.

40|$|The fate of {{antibody}} (Ab) LL 1, which {{reacts with}} the invariant chain (Ii) subunit of the immature MHC class-II antigen (CD 74) after binding {{to the surface}} of B-cell lymphomas was investigated. This Ab was internalized and catabolized very rapidly, much faster than <b>other</b> <b>Abs</b> that are considered to be rapidly internalized, such as CD 19, CD 22 and anti-(transferrin receptor). Such internalization did not depend on Ab cross-linking. The capacity of this uptake process was determined in long-term experiments by increasing the Ab concentration: in 1 day, approx. 8 x 10 (5) Ab molecules per cell were catabolized. This analysis was facilitated by the use of radiolabels that are trapped within cells after catabolism of the Abs to which they were conjugated. If the Ab is a reliable marker for the Ii antigen, which is likely, we can conclude that Ii directed to the cell surface appears to be sufficient, indeed more than sufficient, to account for the cell content of mature class-II molecules...|$|E

40|$|Antibodies to {{individually}} specific antigenic determinants (idiotypes) of immunoglobulins {{are generally}} raised in animals that differ genetically {{from the individual}} that produces the immunoglobulin (Ig) used as immunogen: i. e. heteroantisera (1) and alloantisera (2), from xenogeneic and allogeneic animals respectively, are the usual sources of anti-idiotypec antibodies (Abs).

Isologous anti-idiotypes (produced in the syngeneic strain) have been particularly interesting because they imply that an individual might be capable of forming Abs to idiotypes of some of his own Igs; and it has, indeed, been recently demonstrated that a rabbit can produce Abs against the idiotypes of <b>other</b> <b>Abs</b> made previously in the same animal (8).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the lack of characterization on the relative hydrophobicity of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), the partition of three alkaloids as alternative probes was evaluated {{in a series of}} biocompatible ABS composed of cholinium-based salts or ionic liquids (ILs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The caffeine partitioning in ABS was first addressed to infer the effect of the phase-forming components composition. In all systems, caffeine preferentially concentrates in the lower water content PEG-rich phase. Additionally, a linear dependence between the logarithmic function of the partition coefficients and the water content ratio was found. To confirm this linear dependency, the partition coefficients of caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline were determined in <b>other</b> <b>ABS</b> formed by different cholinium-based salts/ILs. In most systems, it is shown that all alkaloids partition to the most hydrophobic phase. To support the experimental results, COSMO-RS (Conductor-like Screening Model for Real Solvents) was used to compute the screening charge distributions of the salts/IL components of ABS and alkaloids, excess enthalpy of mixing, and activity coefficients at infinite dilution. It is here demonstrated that the partition trend of alkaloids can be used to address the relative hydrophobicity of the coexisting phases in polymer-salt/IL ABS...|$|E
40|$|Overview The Summer 2017 {{edition of}} the NSW Economic Update {{presents}} a current snapshot of the NSW economy and provides relevant points of comparison with other Australian States and Territories. For the fourth consecutive quarter, New South Wales {{has been the best}} performing State in Australia. Commsec 2 ̆ 7 s January 2017 State of the States Report found that NSW remains the top State for business investment, retail trade, and dwelling starts; recently became top-ranked on unemployment and economic growth; and is in second place for construction work and population growth. Nevertheless, a range of trends relating to employment should remain of concern to policymakers. As reported by the Reserve Bank of Australia, recent employment growth in Australia has come almost entirely from part time employment rather than full time jobs. However, ABS employment data may understate these problems, with observers arguing that, {{because of the way the}} ABS Labour Force Survey defines  2 ̆ 7 employment 2 ̆ 7, the Bureau underreports the true level of unemployment.

Here we propose {{a novel approach}} to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of strongly degenerate non-ideal fermions at finite temperature by combining a fourth-order factorization of the density matrix with antisymmetric propagators, i. e., determinants, between all imaginary time slices. To efficiently run through the modified configuration space, we introduce a modification of the widely used continuous space worm algorithm, which allows for an efficient sampling at arbitrary system parameters. We demonstrate how the application of determinants achieves an effective blocking of permutations with opposite signs, leading to a significant relieve of the fermion sign problem. To benchmark the capability of our method regarding the simulation of degenerate fermions, we consider multiple electrons in a quantum dot and compare our results with <b>other</b> <b>ab</b> initio techniques, where they are available. The present permutation blocking path integral Monte Carlo approach allows us to obtain accurate results even for $N= 20 $ electrons at low temperature and arbitrary coupling, where no <b>other</b> <b>ab</b> initio results have been reported, so far...|$|R

40|$|Myelin basic protein (MBP) {{is highly}} {{immunogenic}} and a known autoantigen capable of inducing {{experimental allergic encephalomyelitis}} (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis. We have previously described a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb), F 28 C 4, directed against the encephalitogenic MBP peptide acetyl (Ac) 1 - 9, which contains a V lambda x light chain. Considering the rarity of V lambda x usage, we determined whether <b>other</b> <b>Abs</b> having V lambda x light chains shared similar antigen (Ag) specificity. We screened a panel of V lambda x-containing monoclonal and polyclonal Abs, of unknown specificity for reactivity with MBP. All such Ab, but not heavy chain isotype matched controls, bound MBP but were not polyreactive with other potential self Ags. The binding of a recombinant form of V lambda x alone to MBP demonstrated the important contribution of the V lambda x light chain to the reaction. With the exception of mAb F 28 C 4 which recognizes MBP Ac 1 - 9, the epitope specificity of all other V lambda x-bearing Abs was localized to MBP residues 25 - 34. These results demonstrate a unique association between V lambda x expression and MBP reactivity. Given that V lambda x shares sequence homology with T cell receptors (TCR) from encephalitogenic T lymphocytes, these results imply a potential role for V lambda x in the pathogenesis of EAE...|$|E
40|$|Human {{epidermis}} shows a non-neuronal {{cholinergic system}} including keratinocyte (kc) acetylcholine (Ach) axis which is composed by enzymes and two families of Ach receptors (muscarinic and nicotinic receptors). The activity {{of these two}} receptors can regulate the interkeratinocytes and kcs-extracellular matrix adhesion modifying the regulation of intercellular adhesion molecules like cadherins and integrins. Some authors demonstrate that acantholysis in pemphigus depends not only on anti desmogleins antibodies (abs) (mostly IgG) but even on <b>other</b> <b>abs</b> directed against kc membrane antigens (e. g. anti Ach receptors Abs). In the early phase of pemphigus pathogenesis, anti Ach receptors Abs block Ach signaling essential for cell shape and intercellular adhesion and increase the phosphorylation of adhesion molecules. Combined with the action of abs antidesmogleins, anti Ach receptors Abs cause the acantholytic phenomenon. In vitro experiments show that high doses of Ach in acantholytic kcs can rapidly reverse this pathologic event. In vivo experiments using neonatal mice model of Pemphigus have demonstrated that cholinergic agonists reduce these lesions. Therapy with pyridostigmine bromide and Nicotinamide per os or pilocarpine used topically, drugs that present cholinomimetic effects, has lead to encouraging results in patients affected by Pemphigus disease. Cholinergic agents could have a strategic role in the therapy of pemphigus since they could {{be responsible for the}} early stage of acantholytic diseases...|$|E

There are groups in the Australian community who are food insecure, including low income families with children, the elderly, and other marginalised and disadvantaged groups. However, low income does not equate to food insecurity and urban infrastructure can ameliorate or exacerbate food access issues. This paper describes environmental aspects of urban food access in Wollongong NSW, using GIS software. It presents layered data on food outlets by type, food aid distributors, sociodemographic profiles (including SEIFA indices and <b>other</b> <b>ABS</b> data), transport routes, and aspects {{of the social and}} built environments.

The visual demonstration of infrastructural aspects of the environment can be used to advocate to local government for consideration of infrastructure and planning impacts on food access and health. Mapping also can provide information to local food aid providers in planning for the appropriate distribution of food aid and as an advocacy tool through comparison with other Australian data.
