At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E

30|$|The {{analyses}} {{of compassion and}} hating evil revealed that the instantiation of values {{is not only a}} matter of the relation, the relata, and the context, but also of the higher-order property <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> value. The property <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> value is a second-order property, instantiable by first-order properties and relations. As was suggested, there are properties and relations that may instantiate the property <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> value to various degrees or intensity. Moreover, certain properties and relations may instantiate both the property <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> value and <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> disvalue. Thus, it is possible to argue that whereas love is a pure value, enjoyment is perhaps not entirely such; pain and suffering are overwhelmingly disvalues, but may take on value aspects as well 22. More ambiguous value properties and relations include ‘originality, ‘provocativeness’ as well as ‘competes with’ or ‘is excited by 23.’ The ambiguity results from the ontological fact that the property <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> value/disvalue does not fully saturate, so to speak, the respective properties or relations.|$|R

In 1987, he won $45,303 from the show, {{which he used}} to pay law school debt, to pay taxes and to buy a used car. The total winnings came from $40,303 in prize money during his five-contest streak and $5,000 for a first round win on the Tournament of Champions. His campaign for public office in 1990 precluded him from participating in the Super Jeopardy! elimination tournament of champions. ABC, the network that carried the tournament, had a policy against political contestants appearing on the show (excluding Celebrity Jeopardy!). He did, however, compete in the Battle of the Decades tournament, appearing in the show aired February 5, 2014, but finished second to aerospace consultant Tom Nosek. Because of his duties as a federal employee, however, he turned down the $5,000 consolation money he won in the match.|$|E
5|$|Eladio escapes as he {{is being}} deported, killing a truck driver in the process. A {{clinical}} exam on the driver shows his death {{was caused by a}} rapid growth of Trichophyton — the Athlete's foot fungus. Scully brings samples of the fatal fungi to a mycologist who discovers that their abnormally rapid growth was caused by an unidentifiable enzyme. This revelation leads Scully to suspect Eladio <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> unwitting carrier of the enzyme, necessitating his immediate capture. Eladio, seeking to return to Mexico, meets with his cousin Gabrielle to ask for money. He works with a construction foreman for the day to make the money. Soledad comes after him, seeking to kill him, but finds the foreman dead. Eladio escapes in the foreman's truck and heads to the grocery store where Gabrielle works, spreading the fungal growth. The agents later confront Soledad at the supermarket, discovering another dead victim of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|Gangtok's economy {{does not}} have a large {{manufacturing}} base, but has a thriving Cottage industry in watch-making, country-made alcohol and handicrafts. Among the handicrafts are the handmade paper industry made from various vegetable fibres or cotton rags. The main market in Gangtok provides many of the state's rural residents a place to offer their produce during the harvest seasons. The majority of the private business community is made up of Marwaris and Biharis. As part of Sikkim, Gangtok enjoys the status <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> income-tax free region as per the state's 1948 Income tax law. As Sikkim is a frontier state, the Indian army maintains a large presence in the vicinity of Gangtok. This leads to a population of semi-permanent residents who bring money into the local economy. The Sikkim government started India's first online lottery Playwin to boost government income, but this was later closed by a ruling from the Sikkim High Court.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with {{a study of the}} main character's, Colonel Jacque's, misconception of the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> complete gentleman in Daniel Defoe's The History of Colonel Jacque. In this thesis, the thesis writer needs to know the factor that causes Colonel Jacque's misconception of the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> complete gentleman, and his idea about what a gentleman is. To analyze the novel, the thesis writer uses library research, consists of critics' opinions, the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> gentleman and also some data about the novel and the author; and literary approach concerning characterization. In the analysis, the thesis writer assumes that Colonel Jacque's innocence is the factor that leads him to his misconception of the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> complete gentleman. Because of his innocence, he knows nothing of the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> gentleman. His misconception of the idea <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> complete gentleman is shaped as {{he wants to be a}} gentleman; while on the other hand, he does not know the proper manners owned by a complete gentleman. His innocence makes him take every action he considers as the attitude possessed by a gentleman. He does not know whether the action is really not the proper attitude possessed by a true gentleman...|$|R
5|$|In 1986, Bernd Eichinger of Constantin Film {{acquired}} the film {{rights of the}} Fantastic Four from Marvel Comics. In 1992, Eichinger hired Roger Corman to produce a low-budget film {{in order to keep}} the rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled The Fantastic Four, had its trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license. Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors had no idea of the situation, instead believing they were creating a proper release. Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so 20th Century Fox could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.|$|E
5|$|In Retford, MacMillan was {{introduced}} to ballet by a local dance teacher, Jean Thomas. He had already had lessons in Scottish dancing in Dunfermline and tap dancing in Great Yarmouth, and he took to ballet immediately. In 1942 his mother died, which caused him acute and lasting distress. His father was a distant figure, and the boy's only close family relationship was with an elder sister. His obituarist in The Times suggests that the feeling <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> outsider, displayed in many of MacMillan's ballets, had its roots in his childhood.|$|E

Northern Tamil society is generally categorised into two groups: those who are from the Jaffna peninsula in the north, {{and those who are}} residents of the Vanni to the immediate south. The Jaffna society is separated by castes. Historically, the Vellalar, who form approximately fifty percent of the population, were involved in agriculture, using the services of castes collectively known as Panchamar (Tamil for group of five). The Panchamar consisted of the Nalavar, Pallar, Parayar, Vannar, and Ambattar. Others such as the Karaiyar, existed outside the agriculture-based caste system. The caste of temple priests known as Iyers were also held in high esteem.|$|E

5|$|Jean Baptiste Point du Sable (or Point de Sable, Point au Sable, Point Sable, Pointe DuSable) (before 1750 – August 28, 1818) is {{regarded}} as the first permanent resident of what became Chicago, Illinois. Little is known of his life prior to the 1770s. In 1779, he was living on the site of present-day Michigan City, Indiana, when he was arrested by the British military on suspicion <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> American sympathizer in the American Revolutionary War. In the early 1780s he worked for the British lieutenant-governor of Michilimackinac on an estate at what is now the city of St. Clair, Michigan, before moving to settle {{at the mouth of the}} Chicago River. He is first recorded living in Chicago in early 1790, having apparently become established sometime earlier. He sold his property in Chicago in 1800 and moved to St. Charles, Missouri, where he died in 1818.|$|E
5|$|Monarchs often pledged various {{items of}} state regalia as {{collateral}} for loans throughout the Middle Ages. At {{some point in}} the 14thcentury, all of the state regalia were moved to the White Tower at the Tower of London due to a series of successful and attempted thefts in a part of Westminster Abbey that housed state regalia. The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey. Arches topped with a monde and cross were added to images of StEdward's Crown by the time of HenryIV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor HenryV. Known as a closed or imperial crown, the arches symbolised the king's pretensions <b>of</b> <b>being</b> <b>an</b> emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Germans {{who were}} {{responsible}} for the operation of the camp were captured and brought to trial.
