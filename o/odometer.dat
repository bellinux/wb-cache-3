5|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{accurately}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical <b>odometer.</b> The Chinese <b>odometer</b> was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by {{the rotation of the}} carriage's wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th century <b>odometer</b> were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the <b>odometer</b> vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels turned about. The concept of the differential gear that was used in this navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply an equal amount of torque to a car's wheels even when they are rotating at different speeds.|$|E
5|$|Ferris and {{his friends}} collect the Ferrari and depart for home, but shortly {{discover}} many miles {{have been added to}} the <b>odometer,</b> and Cameron becomes catatonic. Back at Cameron's garage, Ferris sets the car on blocks and runs it in reverse to try to take miles off the <b>odometer</b> without success. Cameron finally snaps, and lets out his anger against his controlling father by repeatedly kicking the car. This causes it to fall off the blocks and race in reverse through the back of the garage and into the ravine below. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will stand up against his father.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107), the Chamberlain Wu Deren {{presented}} specifications of the south-pointing carriage and the carriage with the li-recording drum (<b>odometer).</b> The two vehicles were made, and were first used that year at the great ceremony of the ancestral sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. As observed in Han miniature tomb models, but not in literary sources, the crank handle was used to operate the fans of winnowing machines that separated grain from chaff. The <b>odometer</b> cart, invented during Han, measured journey lengths, using mechanical figures banging drums and gongs to indicate each distance traveled. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century AD, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century AD. Modern archaeologists have also unearthed specimens of devices used during the Han dynasty, for example a pair of sliding metal calipers used by craftsmen for making minute measurements. These calipers contain inscriptions of the exact day and year they were manufactured. These tools are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
5|$|Pigozzi {{maintained}} {{a schedule of}} year-to-year model revisions, much like US manufacturers. For 1956, an estate version called the Simca Vedette Marly joined the line-up and the whole range was revised. A new license plate holder {{was added to the}} front bumper and the rear license plate now concealed the fuel tank filler. A peculiar addition was a pedal-operated windscreen washer, while other more ordinary changes included a second <b>odometer,</b> also known as a 'trip meter', for measuring partial distances. The Versailles and Régence were made even more comfortable with the addition of central armrests (Versailles in the rear only, Régence in front and rear), while the Trianon was simplified, losing bumper guards and chrome windscreen decor. In 1957, an option of the Gravina automatic clutch was added, along with better brakes and more direct steering. The Trianon regained the chrome decor around the windscreen, while the other models acquired slimmer tail lights and the front ornament was replaced with a new design. Fender-mounted V8 badges were introduced but, although the whole range featured the same V8 engine, the new badges appeared on the fenders of only the Régence and Marly.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the windlass. To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the <b>odometer</b> cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E

The critical dimension was shown to be an invariant of metric isomorphism; this invariant was calculated for two-point product <b>odometers</b> and shown to coincide, in certain cases, with the average coordinate entropy. In this paper we extend the theory to apply to all product <b>odometers,</b> introduce upper and lower critical dimensions, and prove a Katok-type covering lemma...|$|R

Road signs solely use metric measurements, {{as do the}} speedometers and <b>odometers</b> in motor {{vehicles}} produced after 1974; There was no requirement for pre-1974 vehicles to have their speedometers and <b>odometers</b> converted to metric, so any remaining vehicles of this vintage will show miles. Privately imported vehicles, such as classic cars, also {{do not need to}} be so converted. The sale of oil and petrol is by the litre. However, vehicle tyre pressures are still commonly talked about in pounds per square inch.|$|R

25|$|For 15 years, Wayne Schmuck of Harvard, Illinois, {{owner of}} Big Foot Auto Sales, had sold used cars {{he had bought}} in his state, where vehicle titles did not then require a {{statement}} on {{the title of the}} <b>odometer</b> reading {{at the time of the}} transaction, to dealers in Wisconsin, which did. Unbeknownst to the dealers, he had in some cases hired someone to roll back the odometers on them, making the vehicles appear to have less mileage than they actually did. Thus they commanded an artificially higher price, both when the dealer paid Schmuck and when they sold it to a customer. In order for the retail transaction to take place, the dealers needed to mail a title application, including the falsified <b>odometer</b> reading, to the state Department of Transportation.|$|E

40|$|For {{dynamical}} {{systems with}} the shadowing property, we {{provide a method}} of approximation of invariant measures by ergodic measures supported on <b>odometers</b> and their almost 1 - 1 extensions. For a topologically transitive system with the shadowing property, we show that ergodic measures supported on <b>odometers</b> are dense {{in the space of}} invariant measures, and then ergodic measures are generic in the space of invariant measures. We also show that for every c≥ 0 and ε> 0 the collection of ergodic measures (supported on almost 1 - 1 extensions of <b>odometers)</b> with entropy between c and c + ε is dense in the space of invariant measures with entropy at least c. Moreover, if in addition the entropy function is upper semi-continuous, then for every c≥ 0 ergodic measures with entropy c are generic in the space of invariant measures with entropy at least c.

25|$|The most {{important}} precedent {{in the case}} was recent. Three years earlier, in United States v.

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the MOT inspection provides an irrefutable record of a vehicle's mileage. However, although the mileage is recorded during the test, {{no part of the}} inspection requires the test station to verify that this is indeed the actual mileage.

25|$|Around 1981 his {{scheme was}} {{discovered}} when suspicious regulators {{wrote to the}} vehicles' previous owners, whose addresses were on the dealer's applications, and learned what the odometers had {{said at the time}} of sale. He was arrested by federal authorities and indicted on 12 counts of mail fraud, a felony, for cars he had sold to five different dealers, some as many as five times over a two-year period. At his trial, presided over by district judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb, he admitted that he had rolled back the odometers, but denied that he had committed mail fraud since the dealers had sent the applications after they had bought the cars from him, therefore it wasn't necessary that they do so for him to have realized the proceeds of the <b>odometer</b> tampering. Before his trial in United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, his attorney, Peter Lewis Steinberg, moved that the jury be instructed that they could convict Schmuck on the lesser included charge of <b>odometer</b> tampering, at the time a misdemeanor, if they did not feel his actions constituted mail fraud.|$|E
30|$|The WLAN {{connection}} is used only to control speed {{and direction of}} the vehicle. In the future, a dedicated algorithm to autonomous navigation will be implemented and thus the WLAN connection will be used to achieve only the system monitoring. A coprocessor (ATMega 168) takes care of data acquisition. It controls the robot speed and its direction using two pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals. It decodes signals coming from the <b>odometers</b> embedded in the rear wheels. It communicates with the main board using an I 2 C interface. This interface allows the main processor to retrieve <b>odometers</b> data and to send instructions corresponding to speed and direction.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new fast histogram matching algorithm for tracking {{the position and}} orientation of robots {{without the help of}} any <b>odometers.</b> Histogram avoids extracting geometrical primitives from the sensor data, acts independently from <b>odometers,</b> and is easy to be implemented. Here, the authors employ it to analyze laser scan data. A new concept named "hierarchical histogram structure" is introduced for constructing and matching histograms. This structure makes full use of the information in a laser scan and speeds up the histogram matching to a satisfying level. Computational complexity analysis and experiments show the feasibility of the new algorithm both mathematically and factually. IEE...|$|R
5000|$|A form {{of fraud}} is {{to tamper with}} the reading on an mileometer/odometer and {{presenting}} the incorrect number of miles/kilometers traveled to a prospective buyer; this {{is often referred to}} as [...] "clocking" [...] in the UK and [...] "Busting miles" [...] in the US. This is done to make a car appear to have been driven less than it really has been, and thus increase its apparent market value. Most [...] new cars sold today use digital <b>odometers</b> that store the mileage in the vehicle's engine control module making it difficult (but not impossible) to manipulate the mileage electronically. With mechanical <b>odometers,</b> the speedometer can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back, or the drive cable can be disconnected and connected to another odometer/speedometer pair while on the road. Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage, a property that provides the premise for a classic scene late in the comedy film Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but modern <b>odometers</b> add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward, thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle.|$|R
25|$|Trains are {{programmed}} {{to stop at}} certain station positions with a precise <b>odometer</b> (accurate to plus or minus five centimetres). They receive their braking program and station stop positions orders (one-third, two-thirds, or end of station) from track beacons prior to entering the station, with additional beacons in the station for ensuring stop precision. The last beacon is positioned at precisely 12 turns of wheels {{from the end of}} the platform, which help improve the overall precision of the system.|$|E
25|$|In March 1989 the Court {{handed down}} its ruling.

Scalia wrote for himself and the other three dissenters, William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Sandra Day O'Connor. His opinion exclusively concerned the first question and did not reach the second.|$|E
