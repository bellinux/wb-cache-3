5000|$|Usually the {{claimant}} is actually making, using, selling, offering {{to sell or}} importing or is prepared to actually make, use or sell, offer to sell or import an allegedly infringing device or method, and usually the patent <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> claimed that such activities by claimant will result in patent infringement. [...] An express threat of litigation is not needed, {{nor is it a}} guarantee that jurisdiction will be granted. [...] Some factors courts have considered in this analysis are whether a patent <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> asserted its rights against an alleged infringer in a royalty dispute, whether the <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> sued a customer of an alleged infringer, or whether an <b>owner</b> <b>has</b> made statements regarding its patents in trade magazines.|$|R
5|$|A {{gun in the}} Czech Republic is {{available}} to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun <b>owners</b> <b>have</b> concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to replace}} Anfield {{with a new}} 60,000-capacity stadium in {{adjacent}} Stanley Park were initiated in 2002.

5|$|The {{implementation}} of SBS on the Woodhaven/Cross Bay corridor {{has been supported}} by transit advocates and bus riders, particularly those in the Rockaways. However, many residents of the communities north of the Rockaways, particularly car users and business <b>owners,</b> <b>have</b> opposed the Select Bus Service project. Much of the opposition has been due to the {{implementation of}} bus lanes {{down the center of the}} boulevard, which could cause increased traffic congestion.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} defacement, fans rushed to the sites of the installments as soon as they are announced. A group of men took advantage of this and threatened to deface a stencil painting of a beaver in East New York, charging money for people to take photographs. Some took {{matters into their own hands}} by guarding the works, others restoring them once defaced. In part because of the defacement, but also because of the great value of the artworks, property <b>owners</b> <b>have</b> also gone to extreme measures to protect the art. Some hired security guards, others covered the art with acrylic glass, and yet others installed metal roll-down gates.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong had two {{licensed}} terrestrial broadcasters – ATV and TVB, {{the former}} {{of which has}} now been defunct. There are three local {{and a number of}} foreign suppliers of cable and satellite services. The production of Hong Kong's soap dramas, comedy series, and variety shows reach audiences throughout the Cantonese-speaking population. Magazine and newspaper publishers in Hong Kong distribute and print in both Chinese and English, with a focus on sensationalism and celebrity gossip. The media in Hong Kong is relatively free from official interference compared to Mainland China, although the Far Eastern Economic Review pointed to signs of self-censorship by media whose <b>owners</b> <b>have</b> close ties to or business interests in the People's Republic of China and states that even Western media outlets are not immune to growing Chinese economic power.|$|E

5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and <b>owners</b> <b>have</b> the option to choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP {{will be required to}} be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E
5|$|J. W. McFadden Inc. was the building's {{original}} owner. Subsequent <b>owners</b> <b>have</b> included C. C. and Leedy Maude, J. S. Middleton, Oregon Theatre Co., Mary Watt, and Ernest Bass. The theater's {{front doors}} and ticket office were altered by J. W. McFadden Inc. in 1930, {{along with the}} construction of a new ticket booth. In 1949, when the Waverly Heights Congregational United Church of Christ was reconstructing a new church building on its property at Southeast 33rd and Woodward, church services were held at the Oregon Theatre. According to the Puget Sound Theatre Organ Society, the organ was repossessed by the William Wood Organ Co. and re-installed at radio station KXL's studios in Portland. The theater's front entrance, including its doors and 1930s ticket booth, were remodeled by Ferguson Cassady Co. in 1954.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} American horse breeds with leopard {{coloring}} and Appaloosa ancestry. These include the Pony of the Americas and the Colorado Ranger. Appaloosas are crossbred with gaited horse breeds {{in an attempt}} to create a leopard-spotted ambling horse. Because such crossbred offspring are not eligible for ApHC registration, their <b>owners</b> <b>have</b> formed breed registries for horses with leopard complex patterns and gaited ability. In 1995 the Nez Perce tribe began a program to develop a new and distinct horse breed, the Nez Perce Horse, based on crossbreeding the Appaloosa with the Akhal-Teke breed from Central Asia. Appaloosa stallions have been exported to Denmark, to add new blood to the Knabstrup breed.|$|E

5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that <b>owners</b> <b>have</b> to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E
