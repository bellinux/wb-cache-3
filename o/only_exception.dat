5|$|The <b>Only</b> <b>Exception</b> is Paramore's third EP, {{released}} {{exclusively to}} the iTunes Store on September 28, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{covers for}} almost every issue of Air Wonder, Science Wonder, Wonder Stories and Wonder Stories Quarterly were painted by Frank R. Paul, who had {{followed}} Gernsback from Amazing Stories. The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> was a cover image composed of colored dots, which {{appeared on the}} November 1932 issue.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example is}} the city of Berkeley, California. The tree {{protection}} ordinance prohibits the removal of coast live oak trees and any excessive pruning that can cause harm to the tree is also prohibited. The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> is if the tree is poses a danger to life or limb and danger to the property.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> {{are where}} the opcodes of {{meaningless}} operations {{are used for}} other purposes: ...|$|R
5000|$|IEBUPDTE {{uses the}} same job control {{statements}} required by most IEB-type utilities. The <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> are as follow: ...|$|R
50|$|Politically {{the seat}} has {{generally}} elected left wing representatives, the <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> being {{the elections of}} 1968 and 1993.|$|R
5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way from}} Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains can choose to use this line instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well as all freight trains. The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> to this are trains hauling jet fuel to the airport, who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E
5|$|Centuries later, {{the region}} around Salerno was the <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> {{to the rule}} that (except for {{skipping}} units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries' ounce was subdivided down to the scruple {{in exactly the same}} way as in the Roman system: It divided the ounce into 10drachms.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the <b>only</b> <b>exception).</b> The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put in check but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E
3000|$|... b. CRAMP {{appears to}} have lower error than ARVUE {{throughout}} most of the experiment, with the <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> being due to underutilization.|$|R
50|$|Letcher County is a dry county, {{with the}} <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> being the Highland Winery, {{the city of}} Whitesburg, {{and the city of}} Jenkins.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Complete graphs {{need one}} more color than their maximum degree. They {{and the odd}} cycles are the <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> to Brooks' theorem.|$|R
5|$|His {{works have}} been {{translated}} into Belorussian, Bulgarian, Czech, Esperanto, Finnish, German, Hungarian, Russian and Slovenian. Almost none of his works have {{been translated into}} English; the <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> is the short story Wyjątkowo trudny teren ("Particularly Difficult Territory") that Zajdel wrote for the English language Tales from the Planet Earth anthology edited by Frederik Pohl and Elizabeth Anne Hull.|$|E
5|$|Most solids {{used are}} {{engineering}} materials consisting of crystalline solids {{in which the}} atoms or ions are arranged in a repetitive geometric pattern which {{is known as a}} lattice structure. The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> is material that is made from glass which is a combination of a supercooled liquid and polymers which are aggregates of large organic molecules.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2015, it was {{announced}} that Khabar Agency, a major media outlet in Kazakhstan, had been accepted into the EBU as an Associate member, but that it's still not eligible {{to take part in the}} contest under the current rules. Only countries who are part of the European Broadcasting Area are eligible to participate, with Australia being the <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> after being an associate member for over 30 years.|$|E
25|$|Eltham {{is served}} by 15 Transport for London bus routes. Most pass through Eltham High Street, the <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> being the 122 and 178.|$|R
50|$|Huron {{county has}} {{traditionally}} been strongly Republican. Since 1936 it has voted every Republican presidential candidate with the <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> of 1964 and 1996.|$|R
5000|$|... "West End Girls" [...] and [...] "It's a Sin" [...] {{were the}} <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> to the rule, and were {{reworked}} {{to integrate the}} orchestra.|$|R
5|$|The moons of Neptune can {{be divided}} into two groups: regular and irregular. The first group {{includes}} the seven inner moons, which follow circular prograde orbits lying in the equatorial plane of Neptune. The second group consists of all seven other moons including Triton. They generally follow inclined eccentric and often retrograde orbits far from Neptune; the <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> is Triton, which orbits close to the planet following a circular orbit, though retrograde and inclined.|$|E
5|$|The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> to this {{arrangement}} was Operation Commando Bolt, a real-time, LORAN-based technique which utilized sensor strike zones derived from predicted target locations. These missions were coordinated by Task Force Alpha's Sycamore control center against targets that passed through strike modules (four strings {{of three to}} six sensors each). Air controllers at Sycamore then directly delivered the correct course, altitude, and speed necessary for the strike aircraft to deliver their ordnance to the correct coordinates.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-eight {{artificial}} isotopes of zirconium {{have been}} synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 78 to 110. 93Zr is the longest-lived artificial isotope, with a half-life of 1.53×106years. 110Zr, the heaviest isotope of zirconium, {{is the most}} radioactive, with an estimated half-life of 30milliseconds. Radioactive isotopes at or above mass number 93 decay by electron emission, whereas those at or below 89 decay by positron emission. The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> is 88Zr, which decays by electron capture.|$|E
50|$|Wari’ syllables {{range in}} {{complexity}} from CV to CVVC. The <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> {{appear to be}} final consonant clusters involving a glottal stop (see below).|$|R
5000|$|The {{court has}} general appellate {{jurisdiction}} over the state district courts and certain state agencies. The <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> to this grant of jurisdiction are: ...|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{gambling}} {{was banned}} almost everywhere in Russia. The <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> are four specially arranged zones in the Altai, Krasnodar, Kaliningrad, and Primorsky regions.|$|R
5|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill passed the Senate, but the House did not vote on it. The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E
5|$|A {{defining}} and best-known {{feature of the}} Mortal Kombat series is its finishing move system called Fatality. An original idea behind it was to give gamers a free hit {{at the end of}} the fight. The basic Fatalities are finishing moves that allow the victorious characters to end a match in a special way by murdering their defeated, defenseless opponents in a gruesome manner, usually in the predefined ways exclusive for the given character. The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> from this is Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, which instead features the Kreate-A-Fatality, allowing the players to perform their own Fatalities by conducting a series of violent moves chosen from a pool that is common for all characters.|$|E
5|$|A {{promethium}} atom has 61 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f56s2. In forming compounds, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and one of}} the 4f-electrons, which belongs to an open subshell. The element's atomic radius is the third largest among all the lanthanides but is only slightly greater than those of the neighboring elements. It is the <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> to the general trend of the contraction of the atoms with increase of atomic radius (caused by the lanthanide contraction) that is not caused by the filled (or half-filled) 4f-subshell.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> {{were the}} [...] and [...] groups (Li's [...] and [...] ), {{in which the}} {{traditional}} analysis already distinguished the syllables with entering tone contacts.|$|R
5000|$|Both men {{and women}} may be {{expected}} to go completely naked, with decorative objects such as collars, diapers, bands, tiaras, and cuffs as the <b>only</b> <b>exceptions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|As the map below {{shows the}} vast {{majority}} of Top 14 and D2 clubs are located in the south of France. For 2017–18, the <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> to this are: ...|$|R
5|$|At federal level, Hamersley {{is within}} the Division of Stirling, a {{marginal}} seat which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996.|$|E
5|$|At the {{completion}} of the regular season, the top four teams progressed to the postseason. It was contested over three weeks, following the Page playoff system. Each stage was decided by a best–of–three game series. Unlike regular season games, which made use of a variation of the International Baseball Federation's mercy rule after seveninnings, no such rule was in place for postseason games; all games went the full nineinnings, with the <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> being two games that were tied after nineinnings, therefore requiring extra innings.|$|E
5|$|In the Local Supercluster it is {{possible}} to see star clusters, and current telescopes could in principle observe faint individual stars in the Local Group (see Cepheids). However, outside the Local Supercluster of galaxies, neither individual stars nor clusters of stars have been observed. The <b>only</b> <b>exception</b> is a faint image of a large star cluster containing hundreds of thousands of stars located at a distance of one billion light years—ten times further than the most distant star cluster previously observed.|$|E
50|$|KTH Royal Institute of Technology is {{the highest}} ranked {{university}} of technology in northern mainland Europe, with the <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> being the best technical universities of Germany and the Netherlands.|$|R
5000|$|All {{characters}} {{names are}} puns on words ending in [...] "-able", e.g. inflatable is Inflataball etc. The <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> being Pam & Dan, spoofs of BBC News 24 sports reporters.|$|R
5000|$|... "For most {{frequent}} customer programs, 1,000 Membership Rewards points will equal 1,000 miles, points or credits {{and must be}} transferred in 1,000-point increments unless otherwise noted. The <b>only</b> <b>exceptions</b> are:" ...|$|R
