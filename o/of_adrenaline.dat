5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. The actions <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase in blood pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences a reaction from a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E

Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the rush <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness.

While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following a bite, there are case reports from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or months after a bite, however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E

25|$|Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the {{sympathetic}} nervous system stimulate the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> precursors by enhancing the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase, two key enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis. ACTH also stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, which increases the expression of PNMT in chromaffin cells, enhancing adrenaline synthesis. This is most often done in response to stress. The {{sympathetic nervous system}}, acting via splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla, stimulates the release <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline.</b> Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the exocytosis of chromaffin granules and, thus, the release <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> (and noradrenaline) into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Use is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} on nonselective β-blockers, because severe hypertension and even cerebral hemorrhage may result.

25|$|Unlike {{many other}} hormones {{adrenaline}} (as with other catecholamines) does not exert negative feedback to down-regulate its own synthesis. Abnormally elevated levels <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> {{can occur in}} a variety of conditions, such as surreptitious epinephrine administration, pheochromocytoma, and other tumors of the sympathetic ganglia.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{epinephrine}} secretion {{is observed}} in pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, myocardial infarction {{and to a}} lesser degree in benign essential familial tremor. A general increase in sympathetic neural activity is usually accompanied by increased adrenaline secretion, but there is selectivity during hypoxia and hypoglycaemia, when the ratio <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> to noradrenaline is considerably increased. Therefore, there must be some autonomy of the adrenal medulla {{from the rest of the}} sympathetic system.|$|E
40|$|In male Wistar rats {{the effect}} of {{adrenalectomy}} on pituitary activation by the 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT), was studied. Rats were injected intravenously with 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 10 mg/kg) in their home cages. Blood samples were withdrawn from freely moving cannulated rats for determination <b>of</b> plasma <b>adrenaline</b> and plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). Adrenalectomized rats showed almost no measurable amounts <b>of</b> plasma <b>adrenaline,</b> but these animals had elevated baseline plasma ACTH levels as compared to sham-operated rats. 8 -OH-DPAT treatment led to a large plasma adrenaline response in the sham-operated animals, which was abolished after adrenalectomy. The plasma ACTH response to 8 -OH-DPAT was significantly diminished in the adrenalectomized rats as compared to sham animals. This blunted ACTH response in adrenalectomized rats, however, was still considerable in magnitude. The present data thus indicate that the plasma ACTH response to 8 -OH-DPAT is due to at least two different mechanisms. First, via 5 -HT 1 A receptor-mediated adrenaline release, which may consequently stimulate the pituitary. Second, a direct action of 8 -OH-DPAT on hypothalamic 5 -HT 1 A receptors is assumed, independent <b>of</b> peripheral <b>adrenaline</b> release. ...|$|R

25|$|Racemic {{epinephrine}} {{has historically}} been used {{for the treatment of}} croup. Regular epinephrine however works equally well. Racemic adrenaline is a 1:1 mixture of the dextrorotatory (D) and levorotatory (L) isomers <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline.</b> The L-form is the active component. Racemic adrenaline works by stimulation of the alpha adrenergic receptors in the airway, with resultant mucosal vasoconstriction and decreased subglottic edema, and by stimulation of the β adrenergic receptors, with resultant relaxation of the bronchial smooth muscle.|$|E
25|$|Research on the catecholamines was {{interwoven}} {{with research}} on their receptors. In 1904, Dale became {{head of the}} Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratory in London and started research on ergot extracts. The relevance of his communication in 1906 ″On some physiological actions of ergot″ lies less in {{the effects of the}} extracts given alone than in their interaction with adrenaline: they reversed the normal pressor effect <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> to a depressor effect and the normal contraction effect on the early-pregnant cat’s uterus to relaxation: adrenaline reversal. The pressor and uterine contraction effects of pituitary extracts, in contrast, remained unchanged, as did the effects <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> on the heart and effects of parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Dale clearly saw the specificity of the ″paralytic″ (antagonist) effect of ergot for ″the so-called myoneural junctions connected with the true sympathetic or thoracic-lumbar division of the autonomic nervous system″ – the adrenoceptors. He also saw its specificity for the ″myoneural junctions″ mediating smooth muscle contraction as opposed to those mediating smooth muscle relaxation. But there he stopped. He did not conceive any close relationship between the smooth muscle-inhibitory and the cardiac sites of action of catecholamines.|$|E
25|$|Although {{nicotine}} does {{play a role}} {{in acute}} episodes of some diseases (including stroke, impotence, and heart disease) by its stimulation <b>of</b> <b>adrenaline</b> release, which raises blood pressure, heart and respiration rate, and free fatty acids, the most serious longer term effects are more the result of the products of the smouldering combustion process.

This can help the heavily dependent smoker to quit gradually, while discontinuing further damage to health.|$|E
