50|$|Clear cutting {{areas for}} even-aged timber {{management}} can also benefit many wildlife species. The abundance of coarse woody debris {{added to the}} forest floor is beneficial to salamander and snake species, while the release of understory shrubs provides an increase of berry-foraging opportunities for bear and songbirds. In general, the immature, grassy forest regenerated after a clear cut fulfills specific habitat requirements for many species that cannot be found in mature forests. In the boreal forest, for example, wildfire has been suppressed by humans, resulting in many <b>overmature</b> <b>stands.</b> Even aged timber management restores the successional cycle and allows early successional species to recolonize immature habitat.|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the regeneration system in <b>overmature</b> <b>stands</b> in the fenced area Žehušická obora. The stands, where veteran big trees are located, were selected for evaluation in this thesis. The main tree species is oak with admixed lime and ash.. The circular sample plots, each one with the area 0, 1 ha, were placed into two stands 37 E 17 b/ 15 a/ 5 and 35 D 17 a. The basic mensurational characteristics were found out, such as diameter in breast height, tree height, height of first green branch, number of big dead branches and number of hollows. In the stand 37 E 17 b/ 15 a/ 5, the stock volume is 500, 07 m 3 /ha, the density is 0, 9 and the oak composition reaches 74 %. In the stand 35 D 17 a, the stock volume is 761, 59 m 3 /ha, the density is 1, 14 and the oak composition reaches 71 %. The stands seems to be neglected from tending {{point of view and}} they rather fulfill aesthetic function, regarding their existence in the fenced area. The regeneration will be carried out by the system of clearcuts with longer regeneration period and the certain number of reserved trees will be left on place. Moreover, forest edges will be left without intervention...|$|R
40|$|Catastrophic tree {{mortality}} {{is a natural}} process in beech (Nothofagus spp.) forest ecology. Managers must accept that periodically large areas of forest will die, accompanied by outbreaks of insects and disease. In accepting the inevitability of these changes, managers also need to recognise an educational responsibility to forest users in offering {{an explanation of the}} processes occurring and their probable consequences. It is well known that small disturbances in beech forest usually initiate change over much greater areas, especially in mature or <b>overmature</b> <b>stands.</b> Forest managers can take action to reduce the impact of new tracks, camp sites, and picnic areas and retain healthy forest cover. Pinhole borers (Platypus spp.) are the primary agents in extending damage, and action to reduce populations and prevent their build-up can be very effective. Cleared trees and logs should be cut into short lengths to dry and become unsuitable for attack. Residual trees should not be stressed by root or stem damage or have spoil heaped on their roots. Trees that subsequently do become attacked should be felled and also cut into short lengths before brood emerge, i. e., within 2 years of attack. Care in planning tracks and camp sites and in the treatment of adjacent trees {{can go a long way}} towards preserving the essential character of the area. Conversely, the development of high populations of Platypus spp. can lead to prolonged and extensive stand decline...|$|R
40|$|Possible {{solutions}} to the restoration of <b>overmature</b> forest <b>stands</b> in the Lány game enclosure [...] {{this is a problem}} that generations of foresters in the Křivoklátsko region have been faced with. The restoration has often been postponed; as a result, there has been a remarkable {{increase in the number of}} such stands in the game enclosure. Currently, almost a third of the game enclosure is covered by stands, predominantly beech, older than 160 years, and the suggestions on how to restore these stands are by no means unified, not only within the framework of the relevant authorities, but also among the management of the Lány forestry administration. In the past, the disintegration of stands in the highest age class was dealt with by a massive planting of large-sized plants in the whole area of the game enclosure, which has brought and will continue to bring about a remarkable increase in the forest protection costs. The aim of this PhD thesis is to answer the questions concerning the restoration of the local beech stands and to propose a solution that would be efficient in the long term. The basic questions have been phrased as follows: In what condition are the extensive large-sized plant plantings? What is the number of <b>overmature</b> forest <b>stands</b> in the Lány game enclosure and what will their future development be? Are these stands still capable of producing a sufficient number of beech seeds to ensure successful natural regeneration? In what way should we restore these <b>overmature</b> forest <b>stands?</b> How should we protect them from the game damage? It was necessary to find some of the answers within the framework of intermediate scientific tasks; however, the finding of a conceptual solution to the restoration of the game enclosure remained the main goal of this work. To fulfil the goals of this thesis, it was necessary to perform the inventory of large-sized plant plots; it was found out that the total number of individuals planted in the Lány game enclosure until the end of 2011 was 28, 994 at 840 plots. The plantings established in 2011 were surveyed as to their vitality and height increment between the years 2011 and 2014. In 2015, a sample was selected on which the condition of the root system was analysed according to the type of a container used for the raising of large-sized plants. It is evident from the results that despite considerable investment in fencing, the large-sized plant plantings are very often damaged by game and have to be repeatedly reinforced. The root system analysis revealed that a significant number of individuals show serious root system deformations. Consequently, the optimization of large-sized plant planting was proposed. The condition of the beech stands at PRP was ascertained with the aid of the FieldMap technology; the stand development prediction was carried out by the growth simulator SIBYLA. The verification of the fertility of the <b>overmature</b> beech <b>stands</b> took place at smaller plots demarcated within PRP. The results show that the occurrence of game eliminates natural regeneration in these stands; thus, it is necessary to find a way which will not be only efficient, but also economical. The fertility verification proved that despite their advanced age, the beech stands preserve their ability to produce seed material, which could be used for regeneration under a shelterwood. Finally, a model regeneration block presenting two possible reproduction methods (with maximum utilization of natural regeneration and accelerated one) was designed on the basis of both the differentiation of the game enclosure and the localization of stands with the highest degree of regeneration urgency...|$|R
40|$|Northwest Russia is {{the most}} {{important}} forest industry district producing 34 % of the merchantable wood, 32 % of the sawn wood, and 64 % of the paper in Russia in 2007. The combination of the rich and diverse forest resources, rather developed forest infrastructure, long forest industy history, and geographical location close to Western markets and the major domestic markets of St. Petersburg and Moscow increase its attractiveness both from the economic and ecological point of view. The purpose was therefore to overview the development of forest management and to describe the main tendencies of forest use, regeneration, and nature conservation for Russia in general and the Northwest in particular towards an intensive model of forest management for this area, which would cover the period from just {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union up to the passage of the new Forest Code in 2007. In the Northwest, forest use has been rather extensive during the period 1993 2006, on average, about 40 % of the allowable annual cut, which applies solely to final felling, was utlized. The actual volume of intermediate felling has been insignificant in comparison to what is needed to increase the quality of stands; in 2005 and 2006, it comprised about a tenth of the area and a third of the volume. In the area, during the period 1999 2006, almost every fifth hectare of clear felling was left without active forest regeneration measures. This development threatens the sustainability of forest management by reducing the quality of newly forming stands. The age-class structure is skewed due to this and other past forest management. More than half of the total area of coniferous forests is still composed of mature and <b>overmature</b> <b>stands.</b> These types of coniferous stands prevail in the Komi republic, and the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk regions, this is because of the economically limited accessibility and the significantly low productivity of these forest resources. Although the forests of Northwest Russia are of great economic importance, the issues of nature conservation and biodiversity in these forests are still highly recognised. In 2002, 28 % of the forested area belonged to different forest conservation categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Relationships between stand {{growth and}} {{structural}} diversity {{were examined in}} spruce-dominated forests in New Brunswick, Canada. Net growth, survivor growth, mortality, and recruitment represented stand growth, and tree species, size, and height diversity indices were used to describe structural diversity. Mixed-effects second-order polynomial regres-sions were employed for statistical analysis. Results showed stand structural diversity had a significant positive effect on net growth and survivor growth by volume but not on mortality and recruitment. Among the tested diversity indices, the integrated diversity of tree species and height contributed most to stand net growth and survivor growth. Structural diver-sity showed increasing trends throughout the developmental stages from young, immature, mature, and <b>overmature</b> forest <b>stands.</b> This relationship between stand growth and structural diversity {{may be due to}} stands featuring high structural di-versity that enhances niche complementarities of resource use because trees exist within different horizontal and vertical layers, and strong competition resulted from size differences among trees. It is recommended to include effects of species and structural diversity in forest growth modeling initiatives. Moreover, uneven-aged stand management in conjunction with selective or partial cutting to maintain high structural diversity is also recommended to maintain biodiversity and rapid growth in spruce-dominated forests.

40|$|Dynamics of {{the forest}} {{ecosystems}} connects closely with the natural and anthropogenic changes (succession processes, forest fires, windfalls, forest insects, forest diseases, forest harvesting, reforestation, the infrastructure development associated and not associated with forestry and so forth). Authors do not consider the up-to-day problem of global warming on the Earth, as opinions of scientists are controversial. Retrospective analysis of forest dynamics of the Krasnoyarsk Territory for the last 50 years has allowed {{to assess the impact}} of these changes on condition of forests. The univocal conclusion of deterioration of forest quality has been drawn. Area of coniferous forests has decreased by 9 %, including the 25 % reduction of mature and <b>overmature</b> forest <b>stands.</b> To forecast forest dynamics, modelling of natural and anthropogenic processes in the forest ecosystems has been applied, taking into account that the existing system of measures for reforestation and tending care of forest actually does not affect dynamics {{of the forest}}s. The provision about increase in forest harvesting volume to 37. 6 million м 3 of the Development Strategy of the Krasnoyarsk Forest Industrial Complex has been used for forecasting. It has been proved that such scale of forest harvesting will inevitably lead to the over-cutting of ecological and economic accessible allowable cut that will negatively affect the forest condition in 50 years. Our forecast of forest dynamics of the Krasnoyarsk Territory for the next 50 years has showed that negative changes will continue at the same pace under the current extensive form of forest management. What is more, the maximum decrease of forest area might be in pine forests (32. 9 %) with the significant increase of broadleaves forests – 22. 7 %. To improve the situation in the Russian forest sector, a radical change in the system of forest management is needed...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} management and utilization of hybrid poplars and native deciduous broadleaved tree species (hardwoods) in British Columbia. This paper examines aspects of mineral nutrition and fertilization which are currently important or which may become important as management and utilization {{of the most important}} species increases. Gaps in knowledge about hardwood nutrition are also identified. Maintaining nutrition to achieve the highest growth rates possible is more critically important for the culture of hybrid poplars than of native hardwoods. Hybrid poplars are grown under intensive management regimes, mainly to produce pulp, with rotations of 15 years or less. Plantations can be established where moisture is clearly sufficient. Under such management regimes, adequate nutrition and appropriate fertilization are essential for maximizing productivity and shortening rotations. The nutrition of native hardwoods is less important simply because native hard-wood species are not heavily used at present. However, much of the standing volume of hardwood species in interior and coastal British Columbia is in near-mature, mature, or <b>overmature</b> <b>stands.</b> Therefore, it is prudent to assess how nutrient availability affects growth and whether fertilization may be useful in the long-term management of hardwood and mixed-wood stands. Topics addressed in the review were: (1) the ecological roles and potential growth responses of hardwood species to fertilization as compared with the species 2 ̆ 7 coniferous associates; (2) elements likely to be deficient in hardwoods; (3) growth responses of hardwoods to fertilization as affected by site conditions; (4) effects of fertilization on stress tolerance and mycorrhizal associates; and (5) tactics for ameliorating elemental deficiencies. Species-specific nutritional issues and operational contexts in which fertilization might be beneficial were also reviewed, and priority areas for research identified. There is a considerable body of literature on the responses to fertilization by conifers, but virtually no published field studies of hardwood responses to fertilization in British Columbia. While principles developed from studies of conifer nutrition apply to hardwoods, site-specific growth responses to fertilization are likely much different in hardwoods than in conifers. The hardwood species of greatest importance generally predominate earlier in succession on wetter and more fertile sites than do coniferous species. These hardwood species also typically have greater growth rates when young, shorter lifespans, and greater annual nutrient requirements than do conifers of similar size. To achieve maximum growth rates, hardwoods may require greater quantities of nutrients than do conifers growing on sites of similar fertility. Ongoing fertilization trials of hybrid poplar on Vancouver Island suggest that both N and P may limit growth. Growth responses may be considerable. A greater variety of options exist for delivery of nutrients than exist for native hardwood stands. Intensive breeding is producing numerous clones that differ in their growth rates and may differ in their abilities to grow on nutrient- and moisture-limited sites. Important still to do are the following: (1) relating site characteristics and fertilization response; (2) assessing {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} establishment-year fertilization vs. later (3 rd -year) fertilization; (3) determining which forms of nutrients are most appropriate (e. g., organic vs. inorganic); and (4) predicting how clones vary in response to site fertility and to added nutrients. Stands of native hardwoods are much less likely to be managed at the same intensity as are hybrid poplar plantations. Virtually nothing is known of native hardwood growth responses to fertilization in British Columbia, except with respect to black cottonwood in the southwestern part of the province. It will be important to confirm what elements are deficient, to predict how growth responses to fertilization will vary with soil moisture and soil nutrient regimes, and to identify at what stand ages it is appropriate to fertilize in order to maximize tree value at harvest. Ongoing fertilization studies of red alder and trembling aspen may provide some of this information. Studies of aspen, alder, and paper birch are of the highest priority because of their extent and potential product value, while studies of black cottonwood, balsam poplar, and bigleaf maple are of lower priority...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSetting aside {{overmature}} planted forests {{is currently}} {{seen as an}} option for preserving species associated with old-growth forests, such as those with dispersal limitation. Few data exist, however, on the utility of set-aside plantations for this purpose, or {{the value of this}} habitat type for biodiversity relative to old-growth semi-natural ecosystems. Here, we evaluate the contribution of forest type relative to habitat characteristics in determining species richness and composition in seven forest blocks, each containing an ancient old-growth stand (> 1000 yrs) paired with a set-aside even-aged planted stand (ca. 180 yrs). We investigated the functionally important yet relatively neglected ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), a group for which the importance of forest age has not been assessed in broadleaved forests. We found that forest type was not an important determinant of EMF species richness or composition, demonstrating that set-aside can be an effective option for conserving ancient EMF communities. Species richness of above-ground EMF fruiting bodies was principally related to the basal area of the stand (a correlate of canopy cover) and tree species diversity, whilst richness of below-ground ectomycorrhizae was driven only by tree diversity. Our results suggest that <b>overmature</b> planted forest <b>stands,</b> particularly those that are mixed-woods with high basal area, are an effective means to connect and expand ecological networks of ancient old-growth forests in historically deforested and fragmented landscapes for ectomycorrhizal fungi...|$|R
