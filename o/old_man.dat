Later, Lisa sets to work at the cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> replied. The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> The <b>old</b> <b>man</b> allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique of the <b>old</b> <b>man</b> and requested that he become his student.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reflect on the process of {{participating}} in a long-term collective memory work group of <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> focusing on the making/unmaking of <b>older</b> <b>men</b> and masculinities, and the potential of memory work with <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Participant review and reflection on collective memory work with a group of <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> Findings: Collective memory work provides a novel way to explore ageing, gendering, men, and masculinities. Its potential for working with <b>older</b> <b>men</b> is examined critically in relation to gender politics, power and (in) equalities, interconnections and contradictions of men’s ageing and gendering, the personal and the political, as well as working with <b>older</b> <b>men</b> more generally, including those in transition and crisis. Originality/value: There is little previous writing on this approach to ageing, men, and masculinities. The paper aims to stimulate wider applications of this approach...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} serum Omentin- 1 levels {{and the presence of}} osteoporosis in <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> MethodsSerum Omentin- 1, bone turnover biochemical markers, and bone mineral density (BMD) were determined in 45 <b>older</b> <b>men</b> with osteoporosis or 45 <b>older</b> <b>men</b> without osteoporosis (65 – 70 years old). ResultsOmentin- 1 levels were increased in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> with osteoporosis, and the differences remained significant after controlling for fat mass. Omentin- 1 was negatively correlated with BMD. In a multiple linear stepwise regression analysis, Omentin- 1, lean mass, but not fat mass, were independent predictors of BMD for the combined group. Significant negative correlations between Omentin- 1 and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and bone cross-linked N-telopeptides of type Ⅰ collagen (NTX) were found. Omentin- 1 was also independently associated with BMD and bone turnover markers in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> with osteoporosis and control groups that were considered separately. ConclusionsOmentin- 1 is an independent predictor of BMD in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> with osteoporosis, and it is negatively correlated with bone turnover biochemical markers. It is suggested that Omentin- 1 may exert a negative effect on bone mass through the regulation of the osteoblast differentiation in the <b>older</b> <b>men</b> with osteoporosis...|$|R

5|$|The next day, Black finds a {{group of}} obelisks in the woods. He is about to examine one when Beebe appears, chased by dogs. The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> also arrives, and Black asks him to call off his dogs. The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> denies the dogs are his, but they retreat regardless.

He visits the Old Man's home, where the two speak about the Group and its symbolism, and the coming millennium. The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> then brings Black to a {{clearing}} full of the wild dogs, where the latter realizes they are embodiments of the evil in the world. He approaches them as stands his ground, being struck by several visions as he does so. The <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> then explains that the world's balance between good and evil is being lost as the millennium approaches, and that Beebe's home, built on sacred ground, {{is one of the many}} small things upsetting this balance.|$|E

40|$|After {{nearly a}} full century of decline, the Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR) of <b>older</b> <b>men</b> in the U. S. leveled {{off in the}} 1980 s, and began to {{increase}} in the late 1990 s. We use synthetic panel data from 1962 to 2005 to model the LFPR of <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> {{with the aim of}} accounting for these trends. We find that the decline in the LFPR of <b>older</b> <b>men</b> cannot be explained by demographic trends, changes to Social Security and private pension rules, health, or availability of employer provided retiree health insurance. We attribute the increase in the LFPR in recent years mainly to changes in the distribution of education among <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> The share of high school dropouts among <b>older</b> <b>men</b> declined from 65 % in 1970 to 19 % in 2005, and dropouts have a much lower LFPR than more educated men. Our results also suggest that increases in the Social Security delayed retirement credit, increased employment of the wives of <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> and the shift from Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution pension plans all {{may have contributed to the}} recent LFPR gains. ...|$|R

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy <b>old</b> <b>man</b> with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an <b>old</b> <b>man</b> was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor.

40|$|The {{number of}} hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and endothelial {{progenitor}} cells (EPC) {{is thought to}} be a marker for neovascularization and vascular repair. Because physical inactivity and aging are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, these factors may influence the numbers of HSCs and EPCs. Therefore, we examined baseline and exercise-induced levels of HSCs and EPCs in sedentary and trained young and <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> To study the role of aging in eight sedentary young (19 - 28 years) and eight sedentary <b>older</b> <b>men</b> (67 - 76 years), baseline and acute exercise-induced numbers of HSCs (CD 34 +-cells) and EPCs (CD 34 +/VEGFR- 2 +-cells) were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. To examine the effect of chronic training, eight age-matched trained young men (18 - 28 years) were compared with sedentary young <b>men,</b> whereas <b>older</b> <b>men</b> performed an 8 -week endurance training. Older men showed significantly lower baseline and exercise-induced levels of HSCs/EPCs than the young men (P < 0. 05). In young and <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> acute exercise significantly increased HSCs (P < 0. 01), but not EPCs. The absolute increase in numbers of HSCs was attenuated in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> (P = 0. 03). Apart from the lower baseline numbers of EPCs after chronic training in <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> training status did not alter baseline or exercise-induced levels of HSCs/EPCs in young and <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> We concluded that advancing age results in lower circulating numbers of HSCs and EPCs and attenuates the acute exercise-induced increase in HSCs. Interestingly, in young as well as in <b>older</b> <b>men</b> chronic endurance training does not affect baseline and exercise-induced numbers of HSCs and EPCs...|$|R

40|$|In the UK, {{one in five}} of the {{population}} is an <b>older</b> <b>man,</b> many of whom live alone. Loneliness and social isolation is a growing issue for many of these <b>older</b> <b>men,</b> one that has been associated with elevated blood pressure, poor physical health, increased mortality and mental ill-health, including depression, suicide and dementia. Social isolation thus presents new challenges for the physical and mental wellbeing of <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> This is not unique to the UK. Yet whilst inclusionary social spaces and supportive social ties can be important for enhancing physical and mental wellbeing amongst older people, evidence suggests that lone-dwelling <b>older</b> <b>men</b> can experience greater difficulty in accessing effective social support, relative to older women. Understanding those spaces of communal activity that are likely to be successful in promoting health and wellbeing amongst <b>older</b> <b>men</b> is thus important if we are to improve their quality of life. In this paper, we draw on an evaluation of a 'Men in Sheds' intervention in the UK, to illustrate how everyday spaces within local communities can be designed to both promote and maintain the physical and mental wellbeing of <b>older</b> <b>men.</b> In doing so, we engage with the geographical concept of the therapeutic landscape offering new insights into how Sheds, as created therapeutic landscapes, may offer gendered spaces in which <b>older</b> <b>men</b> can perform their masculinity and which hold real potential for the maintenance of their health and wellbeing...|$|R
