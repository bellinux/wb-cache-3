For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks for the presence <b>of</b> <b>water</b> was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight.

5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets <b>of</b> <b>water</b> ice or hydrated minerals have been tentatively identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has the least amount <b>of</b> <b>water</b> of any known body in the Solar System. This lack <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of}} the Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede {{also has}} polar caps, likely {{composed}} <b>of</b> <b>water</b> frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude. These polar caps were first {{seen by the}} Voyager spacecraft. Theories on {{the formation of the}} caps include the migration <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to higher latitudes and bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from Galileo suggests the latter is correct. The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution <b>of</b> <b>water</b> molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.|$|E
