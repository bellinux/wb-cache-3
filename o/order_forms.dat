5|$|Despite the {{problems}} of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday. Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, this prediction was wildly optimistic; less than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> – which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer customers – were returned with fresh orders. Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of {{implementing}} a standardized <b>order</b> <b>form</b> on the prescribing and monitoring of gentamicin sulfate at a nonteaching Veterans Affairs Medical Center, we prospectively evaluated the prescribing and monitoring of gentamicin for 14 months after {{the use of such}} a form was implemented. The data collected included dosing, initial serum gentamicin concentrations, and serum creatinine measurements. These data were compared with similar data obtained during a period of 6 months before the <b>order</b> <b>form</b> was used. A total of 76 patient records were reviewed, 39 before the use of the <b>order</b> <b>form</b> and 47 after the <b>order</b> <b>form</b> was implemented. Gentamicin peak concentrations were statistically higher in the group treated after the <b>order</b> <b>form</b> was implemented. No differences were seen in gentamicin trough concentrations. The timely measurement of serum gentamicin concentrations and serum creatinine levels was improved in the group for whom the <b>order</b> <b>form</b> was used.

500|$|In May 2000, Bethesda set {{the first}} {{expected}} PC release date in late 2001. On May 5, 2001, Bethesda announced an additional Morrowind release for Microsoft's Xbox. The project was, {{according to the}} same release, something that Bethesda {{had been working on}} with Microsoft since they had first known of the console. Morrowind had an impressive showing at E3 2001, demonstrating a beta build to the public. The same beta build was demonstrated to the staff of PC Gamer for another preview and was kept around the office as late as June 19 as the subject of later previews, while another test build was developed alongside. Later <b>order</b> <b>forms,</b> such as those by Electronics Boutique, set the date in November. On October 10, 2001, GameSpot reported that Morrowinds release date had been set back to March 2002. On October 12, a press release from Bethesda gave the date of [...] "Spring 2002", confirming GameSpot's supposition of delay without agreeing on the more specific date of [...] "March". Though no rationale behind the delay was given at the time, developer Pete Hines later attributed the delay to a need for game testing and balancing. Although the PC version of Morrowind had gone gold by April 23, 2002, and was released on May 1 in North America, the Xbox release was delayed further. On April 15, GameSpot suggested an Xbox release date sometime in May and a scheduled [...] "going gold" [...] date for the Xbox version {{in the first week of}} the same month. In contradiction of GameSpot's supposition, a June 4 Bethesda press release set June 7 as the Xbox release date.|$|E

The council duly {{passed a resolution}} declaring its inability to set a rate, and John Austin-Walker accepted that his refusal to cut spending [...] "may place us beyond the law". The council brought its own proceedings for judicial review against the government's decision to cap its budget, which was set down for initial hearing on 12 April with the main hearing not until 19 June.

2500|$|However, in 2007 the U.S. District Court {{struck down}} even the reauthorized NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional as courts could still {{not engage in}} {{meaningful}} judicial review of these gags. On August 28, 2015, Judge Victor Marrero of the federal district court in Manhattan ruled the gag order of Nicholas Merrill was unjustified. In his decision, Judge Marrero described the FBI's position as, [...] "extreme and overly broad," [...] affirming that [...] "courts consistent with the First Amendment, simple accept the Government's assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk." [...] He {{also found that the}} FBI's gag order on Mr. Merrill [...] "implicates serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability of the government to the people." [...] Initially, the ruling was released in redaction by Judge Marrero. The FBI was given 90 days to pursue any other alternative course of action, but elected not to do so. Upon release of the unredacted ruling on November 30, 2015, it was revealed {{for the first time the}} extent to which the FBI's NSL accompanied by a gag order sought to collect information. Through the court documents, it was revealed for the first time that through an NSL, the FBI believes it can legally obtain information including an individual's complete web browsing history, the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with, and all the records of all online purchases within the last 180 days. The FBI also claims via the extension of a NSL, it can obtain cell site location information. In the landmark case of Nicholas Merrill the FBI in specific sought to seek the following information on an account: DSL account information, radius log, subscriber name and related subscriber information, account number, date the account opened or closed, addresses associated with the account, subscriber day/evening telephone numbers, screen names or other on-line names associated with the account, <b>order</b> <b>forms,</b> records relating to merchandise orders/shipping information for the last 180 days, all billing related to the account, internet service provider (ISP), all email addresses associated with the account, internet protocol address assigned to the account, all website information registered to the account, uniform resource locator address assigned to the account, any other information which you consider to be an electronic communication transactional record. This was the first time it was revealed the extent to which an NSL under the Patriot Act could request communication information.|$|E
60|$|The correspondence, thus {{arranged}} in chronological <b>order,</b> <b>forms</b> an almost continuous record of Mrs. Browning's life, {{from the early}} days in Herefordshire to her death in Italy in 1861; but in order to complete the record, it has been thought well to add connecting links of narrative, which should serve to bind the whole together into the unity of a biography. It is a chronicle, rather than a biography in the artistic sense of the term; a chronicle of the events of a life in which there were but few external events of importance, and in which the subject of the picture is, for the most part, left to paint her own portrait, and that, moreover, unconsciously. Still, this is a method which may be held to have its advantages, in that it can hardly be affected by the feelings or prejudices of the biographer; and if it does not present a finished portrait to the reader, it provides him with the materials from which he can form a portrait for himself. The external events are placed upon record, either in the letters or in the connecting links of narrative; the character and opinions of Mrs. Browning reveal themselves in her correspondence; and her genius is enshrined in her poetry. And these three elements make up all that may be known of her personality, all with which a biographer has to deal.|$|E

40|$|Normally <b>ordered</b> <b>forms</b> of {{functions}} of boson operators {{are important in}} many contexts mainly concerning quantum field theory and quantum optics. Beginning with the seminal work of Katriel [Lett. Nuovo Cimento 10 (13) : 565 – 567, 1974], {{in the last few}} years, normally <b>ordered</b> <b>forms</b> have been shown to have a rich combinatorial structure [see P. B̷lasiak, quant-ph/ 0507206]. In this paper, we apply the linear representation of noncrossing partitions to contractions of normally <b>ordered</b> <b>forms.</b> In this way, we define the notion of noncrossing normal ordering. This appear to be a natural mathematical concept and it results indeed to be linked with well-known combinatorial objects. We explicitely give the noncrossing normally <b>ordered</b> <b>form</b> of the functions (a r (a †) s) n) and (a r + (a †) s) n, plus various special cases.

60|$|It {{has been}} before {{noticed that the}} {{progress}} of Nature is more truly represented by the ladder, than by the suspended chain, and that she expands as by concentric circles. This is, indeed, involved in the very conception of individuation, whether it {{be applied to the}} different species or to the individuals. In what manner the evident interspace is reconciled with the equally evident continuity of the life of Nature, is a problem that can be solved by those minds alone, which have intuitively learnt that the whole actual life of Nature originates in the existence, and consists in the perpetual reconciliation, and as perpetual resurgency of the primary contradiction, of which universal polarity is the result and the exponent. From the first moment of the differential impulse—(the primæval chemical epoch of the Wernerian school)—when Nature, by the tranquil deposition of crystals, prepared, as it were, the fulcrum of her after-efforts, from this, her first, and in part irrevocable, self-contraction, we find, in each ensuing production, more and more tendency to independent existence in the increasing multitude of strata, and in the relics of the lowest orders, first of vegetable and then of animal life. In the schistous formations, which we must here assume as in great measure the residua of vegetable creations, that have sunk back into the universal life, and in the later predominant calcareous masses, which are the caput mortuum of animalized existence, we ascend from the laws of attraction and repulsion, as united in gravity, to magnetism, electricity, and constructive power, till we arrive at the point representative of a new and far higher intensity. For from this point flow, as in opposite directions, the two streams of vegetation and animalization, the former characterised by the predominance of magnetism in its highest power, as reproduction, the other by electricity intensified—as irritability, in like manner. The vegetable and animal world are the thesis and antithesis, or the opposite poles of organic life. We are not, therefore, to seek in either for analogies to the other, but for counterpoints. On the same account, the nearer the common source, the greater the likeness; the farther the remove, the greater the opposition. At the extreme limits of inorganic Nature, we may detect a dim and obscure prophecy of her ensuing process in the twigs and rude semblances that occur in crystallization of some of the copper ores, and in the well-known arbor Dianæ, and arbor Veneris. These latter Ritter has already ably explained by considering the oblique branches and their acute angles as the result of magnetic repulsion, from the presentation of the same poles, &c. In the CORALS and CONCHYLIA, the whole act and purpose of their existence seems to be that of connecting the animal with the inorganic world by the perpetual formation of calcareous earth. For the corals are nothing but polypi, which are characterised by still passing away and dissolving into the earth, which they had previously excreted, {{as if they were the}} first feeble effort of detachment. The power seems to step forward from out the inorganic world only to fall back again upon it, still, however, under a new form, and under the predominance of the more active pole of magnetism. The product must have the same connexion, therefore, with azote, which the first rudiments of vegetation have with carbon: the one and the other exist not for their own sakes, but in order to produce the conditions best fitted for the production of higher forms. In the polypi, corallines, &c., individuality is in its first dawn; there is the same shape in them all, and a multitude of animals form, as it were, a common animal. And as the individuals run into each other, so do the different genera. They likewise pass into each other so indistinguishably, that the whole <b>order</b> <b>forms</b> a very network.|$|E
