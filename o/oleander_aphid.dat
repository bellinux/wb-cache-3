50|$|Plant A. syriaca {{in a sunny}} {{location}} {{with good}} drainage and moist soil. In {{a few years after}} one plants A. syriaca, it will start to spread by rhizomes. Simply remove any shoots that are in the wrong place in the garden, leaving at least a few in the garden. This species moves around in its habitat by cloning and sprouting from seeds. In one garden of about 3000 square feet in the Washington, D.C., area, this plant started as a small patch in the garden's southwest corner. In about 20 years, new shoots appeared off and on throughout the garden. Its manager pulled out hundreds of unwanted shoots from 2005-2015, leaving small ones in as monarch food in places where he did not want large shoots. Female monarchs frequently lay their eggs on small, tender shoots, and larvae favor such shoots as food. It is valuable to leave at least a few mature shoots in one's garden until early autumn because shoot leaves produce food used by rhizomes which produce shoots in the next year. The nonnative Aphis nerii (<b>oleander</b> <b>aphid)</b> can become abundant on milkweed shoots and stunt them. One can control this aphid by spraying soapy water on aphid groups, then immediately rinsing the groups with plain water. It might take more than one application to the same shoot on different days to control the aphids. The soapy water also kills aphid predators and parasites. However, the aphid outbreaks can be so large, that they can markedly harm milkweeds before their natural enemies control them. To make the soapy water, use 1 teaspoon of a dish detergent, used for hand-washing dishes, per quart of water. Asclepias syriaca seeds require a period of cold treatment before they germinate. Monarch Watch provides much information on rearing monarchs and their host plants.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} karyotype {{analysis of}} the <b>oleander</b> <b>aphid</b> Aphis nerii focusing on the distribution, molecular composition and epigenetic modifications of heterochromatin was done {{in order to better}} understand the structure and evolution of holocentric/holokinetic chromosomes in aphids. The female karyotype (2 n = 8) consisted of 3 pairs of autosomes and a pair of X chromosomes that were the longest elements in the karyotype and carried a single, terminally located nucleolar organizer region. Males showed 2 n = 7 chromosomes due to the presence of a single X chromosome. Heterochromatin was located in the X chromosomes only and consisted of 4 satellite DNAs that have been identified. A. nerii constitutive heterochromatin was enriched in mono-, di- and tri-methylated H 3 histones and HP 1 proteins but, interestingly, it lacked DNA methylation that was widespread in euchromatic chromosomal regions. These results suggest that aphid heterochromatin is assembled and condensed without any involvement of DNA methylation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{effect of}} aphid {{population}} size on host-plant chemical defense expression {{and the effect}} of plant defense on aphid population dynamics were investigated in a milkweed-specialist herbivore system. Density effects of the aposematic <b>oleander</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis nerii, on cardenolide expression were mea-sured in two milkweed species, Asclepias curassavica and A. incarnata. These plants vary in constitutive chemical investment with high mean cardenolide concentration in A. curassavica and low to zero in A. incarnata. The second objective was to determine whether cardenolide expression in these two host plants impacts mean A. nerii colony biomass (mg) and density. Cardenolide con-centration („g/g) of A. curassavica in both aphid-treated leaves and opposite, herbivore-free leaves decreased initially in comparison with aphid-free controls, and then increased significantly with A. nerii density. Thus, A. curassavica re-sponds to aphid herbivory initially with density-dependent phytochemical reduc-tion, followed by induction of cardenolides to concentrations above aphid-free controls. In addition, mean cardenolide concentration of aphid-treated leave...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Oleander (Nerium oleander L., Apocynaceae) is an {{evergreen}} urbanite shrub, {{widely used}} for ornamental purposes in Egypt. Although this plant is naturally protected from several herbivores by its defensive secondary metabolites, it harbors many phytophagous pests. In the present work, a sampling program was conducted for two years, extended from July 1998 to June 2000, in Giza city, Egypt, {{to study the}} seasonality {{of the most common}} insect pests attacking oleander and to determine some of the major links in the food web based on this plant. Seasonal fluctuations were determined for two pests: the <b>oleander</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis nerii (Homoptera: Aphididae), and the striped mealybug, Ferrisia virgata (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae). The highest population level of the former species, A. nerii, was reported between No-vember and March, with two peaks in December and February; the most vulnerable level of aphid popula-tion was reported in late spring and during summer months. This contrasted with the population of th...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Maternal {{effects have}} the {{potential}} to affect population dynamics and evolution. To affect population dynamics, maternal effects must inßuence offspring vital rates (birth, death, or movement). Here, we explore the magnitude of nongenetic maternal inßuence on the vital rates of an insect herbivore and explore predictability of maternal effects with reference to published studies. We experimentally studied the effects of maternal age, host plant species (two Asclepias spp.), and density on offspring vital rates in Aphis nerii, the <b>oleander</b> <b>aphid.</b> Older mothers produced offspring that lived shorter lives, consistent with the “Lansing Effect. ” Older mothers also produced offspring that matured at a younger age. As maternal age increased, offspring mass at maturity decreased when mothers were on Asclepias syriaca. However, offspring mass was highest from intermediate aged mothers on A. viridis. The absence of maternal density effects seems to exclude maternal density as a potential source of delayed density dependence inA. nerii. Our results indicate thatmaternal effects have some inßuence onA. nerii vital rates. However, references to published studies suggest that only the Lansing Effect is a predictable response to maternal age in insects. Moreover, the magnitude of observed effects was generally low.

40|$|The {{prevalent}} way aphids accomplish colony {{defense against}} natural enemies is a mutualistic relationship with ants or {{the occurrence of}} a specialised soldier caste typcial for eusocial aphids, or even both. Despite a group-living life style of those aphid species lacking these defense lines, communal defense against natural predators {{has not yet been}} observed there. Individuals of Aphis nerii (<b>Oleander</b> <b>aphid)</b> and Uroleucon hypochoeridis, an aphid species feeding on Hypochoeris radicata (hairy cat’s ear), show a behavioral response to visual stimulation in the form of spinning or twitching, which is often accompanied by coordinated kicks executed with hind legs. Interestingly, this behaviour is highly synchronized among members of a colony and repetitive visual stimulation caused strong habituation. Observations of natural aphid colonies revealed that a collective twitching and kicking response (CTKR) was frequently evoked during oviposition attempts of the parasitoid wasp Aphidius colemani and during attacks of aphidophagous larvae. CTKR effectively interrupted oviposition attempts of this parasitoid wasp and even repelled this parasitoid from colonies after evoking consecutive CTKRs. In contrast, solitary feeding A. nerii individuals were not able to successfully repel this parasitoid wasp. In addition, CTKR was also evoked through gentle substrate vibrations. Laser vibrometry of the substrate revealed twitching-associated vibrations that form a train of sharp acceleration peaks {{in the course of a}} CTKR. This suggests that visual signals in combination with twitching-related substrate vibrations may play an important role in synchronising defense among members of a colony. I...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{importance}} of genetic diversity in successful biological invasions is unclear. In animals, {{but not necessarily}} plants, increased genetic diversity is generally associated with successful colonization and establishment of novel habitats. The <b>Oleander</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis nerii, though native to the Mediterranean region, is an invasive pest species {{throughout much of the}} world. Feeding primarily on Oleander (Nerium oleander) and Milkweed (Asclepias spp.) under natural conditions, these plants are unlikely to support aphid populations year round in the southern US. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe the genetic variation within and among US populations of A. nerii, during extinction/recolonization events, to better understand the population ecology of this invasive species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used five microsatellite markers to assess genetic diversity over a two year period within and among three aphid populations separated by small (100 km) and large (3, 700 km) geographic distances on two host plant species. Here we provide evidence for A. nerii "superclones". Genotypic variation was absent in all populations (i. e., each population consisted of a single multilocus genotype (MLG) or "clone") and the genetic composition of only one population completely changed across years. There was no evidence of sexual reproduction or host races on different plant species. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Aphis nerii is a well established invasive species despite having extremely low genetic diversity. As this aphid appears to be obligatorily asexual, it may share more similarities with clonally reproducing invasive plants, than with other animals. Patterns of temporal and geographic genetic variation, viewed in the context of its population dynamics, have important implications for the management of invasive pests and the evolutionary biology of asexual species...|$|E
40|$|Following its {{introduction}} into Europe (EU), the common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) has been free of most specialist herbivores that {{are present in}} its native North American (NA) range, except for the <b>oleander</b> <b>aphid</b> Aphis nerii. We compared EU and NA populations of A. nerii on EU and NA milkweed populations {{to test the hypothesis}} that plant-insect interactions differ on the two continents. First, we tested if herbivore performance is higher on EU plants than on NA plants, because the former have escaped most of their herbivores and have perhaps been selected for lower defence levels following introduction. Second, we compared two A. nerii lines (one from each continent) to test whether genotypic differences in the herbivore may influence species interactions in plant-herbivore communities in the context of species introductions. The NA population of A. nerii developed faster, had higher fecundity and attained higher population growth rates than the EU population. There was no overall significant continental difference in aphid resistance between the plants. However, milkweed plants from EU supported higher population growth rates and faster development of the NA line of A. nerii than plants from NA. In contrast, EU aphids showed similar (low) performance across plant populations from both continents. In a second experiment, we examined how chewing herbivores indirectly mediate interactions between milkweeds and aphids, and induced A. syriaca plants from each continent by monarch caterpillars (Danaus plexippus) to compare the resulting changes in plant quality on EU aphid performance. As specialist chewing herbivores of A. syriaca are only present in NA, we expected that plants from the two continents may affect aphid growth in different ways when they are challenged by a specialist chewing herbivore. Caterpillar induction decreased aphid developmental times on NA plants, but not on EU plants, whereas fecundity and population growth rates were unaffected by induction on both plant populations. The results show that genetic variation in the plants {{as well as in the}} herbivores can determine the outcome of plant-herbivore interactions. © 2014 Gesellschaft für Ökologie...|$|E
