5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The {{most common form}} of URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E
5|$|Resource Guides {{are offered}} for the art, economics, {{language}} and literature, music, science/social science, and Super Quiz events. The Super Quiz Resource Guide is {{a compendium of}} previously published articles, whereas the other Resource Guides are composed by individual writers under contract with USAD. The aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Resource</b> Guide is to assist students {{in their study of}} the topics listed in the subject area outlines. As an example, in 2003 the music topic was Romantic music. Subsequently the Music Resource Guide focused on the development of Romantic music, its characteristics and the influence of the Classical era on the Romantic era. A large part of the guide focused on information about that year's composers: Beethoven, Berlioz, Rossini, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Verdi, Mussorgsky, Wagner, Bizet, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Mahler and Strauss. Similarly, the art topic assigned was Romantic art in the European tradition. The Art Resource Guide included sections detailing the lives and works of relevant artists such as Joseph Mallord William Turner, Claude Monet, Albert Bierstadt, and Camille Pissarro.|$|E

25|$|Exploitative competition, also {{referred}} to as resource competition, is a form of competition in which one species consumes and either reduces or more efficiently uses a shared limiting resource and therefore depletes the availability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> for the other species.

25|$|The metaphor {{illustrates}} {{the argument that}} free access and unrestricted demand for a finite resource ultimately reduces the resource through over-exploitation, temporarily or permanently. This occurs because the benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals or groups, each of whom is motivated to maximize use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> to the point in which they become reliant on it, while {{the costs of the}} exploitation are borne by all those to whom the resource is available (which may be a wider class of individuals than those who are exploiting it). This, in turn, causes demand for the resource to increase, which causes the problem to snowball until the resource collapses (even if it retains a capacity to recover). The rate at which depletion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> is realized depends primarily on three factors: the number of users wanting to consume the common in question, the consumptiveness of their uses, and the relative robustness of the common.|$|E

25|$|The RDF {{data model}} {{is similar to}} {{classical}} conceptual modeling approaches (such as entityâ€“relationship or class diagrams).

The subject denotes the resource, and the predicate denotes traits or aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource,</b> and expresses a relationship between the subject and the object.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{guaranteed}} public 'ownership' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>resource</b> consents by Central Plains Water Trust, is {{somewhat of a}} fiction, given that a private company, Central Plains Water Limited, has an exclusive licence to operate the consents to take and use water for irrigation, and particularly given that Central Plains Water Limited has already granted a sublicence for the Rakaia River water to Dairy Holdings Limited.|$|E
