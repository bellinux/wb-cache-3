5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} mammals such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, {{walking on the}} whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes,</b> the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E

25|$|The German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union has died down into an endless guerilla war in the Ural Mountains and Siberia.

5000|$|The even-toed {{ungulates}} (Artiodactyla, [...] ) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally {{by the third}} and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear <b>their</b> weight primarily <b>on</b> <b>their</b> third <b>toes.</b> The aquatic cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from within {{even-toed ungulates}}, so modern taxonomic classification sometimes combines the Artiodactyla and Cetacea into the Cetartiodactyla.|$|R

25|$|The Itchi–Soretsu {{controversy}} was of {{no interest}} to outsiders, but it kept Nichiren theologians <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> and forced them to define their positions with more clarity. It did result {{in the formation of}} new sub-sects, but these gave impetus to missionary enterprises which expanded Nichiren Buddhism and helped spread it throughout the country. The number of adherents to Nichiren's teachings grew steadily during the 14th and 15th century to the extent that whole communities became followers. By 1400, and only being outnumbered by Zen, Nichiren temples had been founded all over Kyoto and although the various sects of Nichiren Buddhism were administratively independent they met in a council to resolve common problems.|$|E
25|$|Frank and Lillian Gilbreth {{often used}} their large family (and Frank himself) as guinea pigs in experiments. Their family {{exploits}} are lovingly detailed in the 1948 book Cheaper by the Dozen, written by son Frank Jr. and daughter Ernestine (Ernestine Gilbreth Carey). The book inspired two {{films of the}} same name. The first, in 1950, starred Clifton Webb and Myrna Loy. The second, in 2003, starred comedians Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt, and bears no resemblance to the book, except that it features a family with twelve children, and the wife's maiden name is Gilbreth. A 1952 sequel titled Belles <b>on</b> <b>Their</b> <b>Toes</b> chronicled the adventures of the Gilbreth family after Frank's 1924 death. A later biography of his parents, Time Out For Happiness, was written by Frank Jr. alone in 1962.|$|E

50|$|In life, mesonychids {{are thought}} to superficially {{resemble}} to canids. Early mesonychids had five digits <b>on</b> <b>their</b> feet, which probably rested {{flat on the ground}} during walking (plantigrade locomotion), but later mesonychids had four digits that ended in tiny hooves <b>on</b> all of <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> and were increasingly well adapted to running.

500|$|The {{surprise}} {{appearance of}} the Flood during Halo: Combat Evolved {{was seen as an}} important plot twist and a scary moment even after repeat playing of the game. Gamasutra, writing about video game plots, gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of Halo, but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in the plot. Mark Binelli of Rolling Stone credited the {{appearance of the}} Flood as an excellent way to keep players <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> by forcing them to adjust their strategies, as well as being a twist as radical [...] "as if, several levels into a game of Pac-Man, the dots suddenly began to attack you".|$|E
500|$|Cats, like dogs, are digitigrades. They walk {{directly}} <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes,</b> {{with the}} bones of their feet making up {{the lower part of}} the visible leg. Cats are capable of walking very precisely because, like all felines, they directly register; that is, they place each hind paw (almost) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain. Unlike most mammals, when cats walk, they use a [...] "pacing" [...] gait; that is, they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. This trait is shared with camels and giraffes. As a walk speeds up into a trot, a cat's gait changes to be a [...] "diagonal" [...] gait, similar to that of most other mammals (and many other land animals, such as lizards): the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously.|$|E
500|$|The album's songs placed {{emphasis}} on vocals and melody over the heavy guitar riffs {{that were found}} on the band's earlier LPs. It also features a rawer sound than Soundgarden's previous album Superunknown, as the band members produced the record themselves. Cornell summed up the changes with [...] "What we've lost in sonic precision we've gained so much in terms of feeling." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that Soundgarden [...] "retained their ambitious song structures, neo-psychedelic guitar textures, and winding melodies but haven't dressed them up with detailed production." [...] The songs vary in tempo throughout the course of the album, with Thayil describing the album as having a [...] "dual nature". He stated, [...] "It keeps listeners <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> and lets them know they're not getting the same album over and over." [...] Shepherd called the album [...] "the most accurate picture of what Soundgarden actually sounds like", stating, [...] "It's way more raw. It's way more honest. It's way more 'responsible.'" ...|$|E
50|$|A talon is the claw {{of a bird}} of prey, {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws <b>on</b> <b>their</b> inner <b>toe</b> (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits.|$|R
50|$|There is {{some debate}} about whether a dewclaw helps dogs to gain {{traction}} when they run because, in some dogs, the dewclaw makes contact when they are running and {{the nail on the}} dewclaw often wears down {{in the same way that}} the nails <b>on</b> <b>their</b> other <b>toes</b> do from contact with the ground. However, in many dogs, the dewclaws never make contact with the ground. In this case, the dewclaw's nail never wears away and it is then often trimmed to keep it to a safe length.|$|R
5000|$|There is also {{a belief}} that the sport became popular due to the horse-mounted {{soldiers}} charging enemy camps {{at the crack of dawn}} removing the pegs which held the tents in place, with the tips of their sharp spears. The Vice President of the Mudgeeraba Troop, Australia Arthur Domain, who is also training his officers for tent pegging explains that tent pegging is actually a sport, [...] "It came about from the Pakistani and Indian armies when they had time <b>on</b> <b>their</b> hands up <b>on</b> the borders; to break the boredom, they invented the sport we now call tent pegging. In the early days they used the wooden pegs that they used to drive in the ground to hold the tents up; and then the other forms of the sport evolved from that. It just gives the riders good hand-eye coordination and makes them better horsemen. But most equestrian sports authorities are of the opinion that tent-pegging originated in these areas since ancient times in the battlefields as a tactic used by the horsed cavalry against elephant mounted troops. The soldiers discovered that the best way to make the elephants ineffective was to attack them <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> nails with sharp spears from the back of a galloping horse. In order to perfect this technique, the cavalry started the practice of tent-pegging which eventually turned into the modern sport.|$|R
500|$|Adult woolly mammoths could {{effectively}} {{defend themselves}} from predators with their tusks, trunks and size, but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as wolves, cave hyenas and large felines. The tusks {{may also have}} been used in intra-species fighting, such as territorial fights or fights over mates. Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females, and to intimidate rivals. Because of their curvature, the tusks were not suitable for stabbing, but may have been used for hitting, as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades. The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail, enabling its use as a flyswatter, similar to the tail on modern elephants. As in modern elephants, the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb-like organ with many functions. It was used for manipulating objects, and in social interactions. The well-preserved foot of the adult male [...] "Yukagir mammoth" [...] shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths walked <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> and had large, fleshy pads behind the toes.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the game's dialogue is provided by Tom Gottlieb, brother of Harry, who had voiced the emcee [...] "Cookie" [...] Masterson in the earlier games, and had been {{considered one of the}} more popular emcees by players. Lacking any professional studio, most of the 100-200 hrs of game dialog were recorded in a makeshift soundproofed closet. Tom Gottlieb was also involved in the writing process, as Jellyvision Games credits much of the [...] "Cookie" [...] persona to his own performance of the character. Other sound effects include fake commercials that are heard before and after a game; some of these include commercials used in previous iterations of the You Don't Know Jack series. Prior to each questions, the game includes short musical interstitials with animated numbers to introduce the question via its number. These were designed as to get the music for these stuck in the players' heads as something they would remember throughout the day; to avoid making these become too routine, certain episodes featured variations on the interstitial that would be unexpected, keeping players <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> throughout playing the game.|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{introduced}} Angelina as: [...] "the Jersey girl {{daughter of}} mob boss Angelo Veneziano (Mike Starr). She comes to Genoa City with dreams {{of being a}} chart-topping vocalist. And what Angelina wants, Angelina gets!" [...] Fred Bronson of The Hollywood Reporter noted that DeGarmo already had experience of playing {{the part of a}} [...] "Jersey Girl" [...] because she had once starred in the musical The Toxic Avenger, which is set in New Jersey. Bronson also noted that she was having a fun time playing the part. Describing Angelina, DeGarmo labeled her as [...] "over-the-top" [...] and a [...] "gum-smacking, tone-deaf princess whose hair is as large as her attitude." [...] She said [...] "I'm having a blast! Angelina believes she's Barbra Streisand mixed with Celine Dion." [...] The character is described as an alter ego by DeGarmo. DeGarmo revealed that she was having a [...] "blast" [...] picking out costumes for the over-the-top part: [...] "Her hair and make-up are icing on the cake" [...] she stated. Additionally, she noted that [...] "Angelina’s style has taken a few notes from the cast of Jersey Shore." [...] Comparing Angelina to herself, she said: [...] "There are some things that I, Diana, would be too terrified to walk out of the house wearing, but Angelina is not afraid." [...] She is also described as a [...] "mafia princess". DeGarmo said: [...] "You never know what she's going to do, which keeps everyone <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes.</b> One minute she's nice, the next she snaps". According to DeGarmo, Angelina is fully aware that her father is a mob boss and: [...] "she doesn't mind. She likes throwing around her weight at any time. She loves the perks of being a mob boss's daughter. She lives for it." [...] Also, her character was probably based off of Angela Viracco, in the 1985 movie The Last Dragon.|$|E
50|$|The {{powers of}} the {{different}} hosts/prisoners of the Penance form vary, but the hollow Penance form's powers are red diamond-hard skin and extended super-long razor-sharp claws <b>on</b> <b>their</b> fingers, <b>toes,</b> and hair follicles. Because of {{the density of the}} skin, it is quite durable, as well as resistant to psychic intrusion. Hollow also possesses animalistic agility (as she usually moves around by crouching and padding and leaping on all fours) and dexterity (as she has been shown on occasion to use her feet to grab and grip objects and people, as if they were just like her hands).|$|R

Their eyes are large, and their night vision is good, reflecting their primarily nocturnal or crepuscular mode of living.|$|R
500|$|To hunt fish, {{the eagle}} swoops {{down over the}} water and snatches the fish {{out of the water}} with its talons. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have {{structures}} <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. Osprey also have this adaptation. Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a [...] mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawn. This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird. It has been estimated that the gripping power (pounds by square inch) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human. Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. It may swim to safety, in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims, but some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions. On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey. When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to [...] of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable. Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it. While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.|$|E
2500|$|The first dancers {{to rise up}} <b>on</b> <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> did so {{with the}} help of an {{invention}} by Charles Didelot in 1795.
