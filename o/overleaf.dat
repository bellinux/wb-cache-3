Clark {{produced}} some beautiful garments with shoulder details based on sea shells but according to his diaries was then sacked by Radley that same year. A note written by Clark to the DHSS (p. 147) says: [...] "I did not leave my position as a dress designer with Firwool of my own accord, as stated <b>overleaf.</b> It was put to me that as my designs weren't selling they couldn't continue to invest in me and I was given two weeks notice on the 19th of October 1984.

[...] This version of events is backed up by a friend, the artist Guy Burch, who recalls that Clark told him Radley had found the complicated shell patterns impossible to make commercially.|$|E

[...] "Germany"--I usually figured this mythical {{malignant}} creature as a corseted stiff-mustached Emperor enhanced by heraldic black wings and a large sword--had insulted our flag. That was {{the message of the}} New Paper, and the monster towered over me, threatening fresh outrages, visibly spitting upon my faultless country's colors. Somebody had hoisted a British flag on the right bank of some tropical river I had never heard of before, and a drunken German officer under ambiguous instructions had torn it down. Then one of the convenient abundant natives of the country, a British subject indisputably, {{had been shot in the}} leg. But the facts were by no means clear. Nothing was clear except that we were not going to stand any nonsense from Germany. Whatever had or had not happened we meant to have an apology for, and apparently they did not mean apologizing.|$|E

[...] "I'll do my writing now," [...] she said, in a quiet resigned way. [...] "Perhaps I may improve enough, some day, to keep your accounts for you." [...] She chose her pen a little absently, and began to write. Amelius looked over her shoulder, and laughed; she was writing his name. He pointed to the copper-plate copy on the top line, presenting an undeniable moral maxim, in characters beyond the reach of criticism:--Change Is A Law Of Nature.

5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the preface is that Dryden did not understand Chaucer's Middle English prosody and dismissed his versification as irregular, because Middle English pronunciation was not properly understood at the time. In fact, since Dryden was working with Thomas Speght's extremely corrupt edition of Chaucer (printed <b>overleaf</b> from the translations in the California edition), and [...] "The Flower and the Leaf" [...] is prosodically unlike the poems by Chaucer, he couldn't possibly have scanned Chaucer {{even if he had}} assigned the correct Middle English values.|$|E
50|$|The {{first volume}} was {{released}} September 1829, {{at the price}} of $2.50, and quickly sold out. When completed in 1833, the first edition comprised 13 volumes. Despite the success of the Encyclopedia, the Panic of 1837 led the Careys to scale back their catalog and concentrate on medical works. Nevertheless, this work continued to return profits to its owners on a regular basis. Publishing houses across the United States, and even in Canada, would rent or purchase Carey stereotype plates and publish Encyclopedia editions with their own imprints {{at the foot of the}} title pages, while retaining the Carey copyright notes on the <b>overleaf,</b> through 1858.

The counters are large and marked with an arrow to indicate the location of the character or object they represent when placed on the game map. All the superhero and supervillain counters illustrate the character's secret identity on one side, and the super identity on the other. The map shows a few blocks of a generic city on one side, and interior details of a few buildings on the other.|$|E
