40|$|<b>Olfactometric</b> <b>analysis</b> {{showed that}} both, fresh UFA/CLA butter and fresh {{conventional}} butter had similar aroma profiles. After 6 – 8 weeks of storage, UFA/CLA butter showed stronger fatty (butanoic and 3 -methyl butanoic acid), metallic [(E,E) - 2, 4 -nonadienal], green [(E) - 2 -hexenol] and creamy (2 -pentanone) notes {{compared with the}} conventional samples. A sensory panel described the two fresh butter types as having a similar sensory profile, except for a stronger creamy aroma, a less intense cooked milk aroma and a significantly higher spreadability of the UFA/CLA butters.

40|$|New hybrid {{types of}} cocoa beans are {{attractive}} to insects in storage, however {{some of the}} insects feed little, if at all, on these beans compared {{to those of the}} traditional type (mixed genotypes). Based on a sniffing test using GCMS, differences in flavour volatiles in these types of beans have been determined and from these, six major volatiles of cocoa beans were selected for <b>olfactometric</b> <b>analysis</b> using a Pettersson olfactometer to determine which of them contributed to the attraction of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) to the cocoa beans. The behaviour of Tribolium was affected by dose of 2 -phenyl ethanol, acetophenone, 3 -methyl butyraldehyde, ethyl butyrate, ethyl 3 -hydroxybutyrate and butyl 2 -methacrylate. Compared to beans of the new hybrid varieties, beans of the traditional type cocoa contained less 3 -methylbutyraldehyde but more ethyl butyrate and acetophenone. In future breeding programmes, reducing the amount of acetophenone and ethyl butyrate but increasing the amount of 3 -methylbutyraldehyde in cocoa beans may deter Tribolium from feeding on beans in storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidative}} {{stability of}} butter enriched with unsaturated fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acids (UFA/CLA butter) was evaluated by chemical, sensory and microbiological analyses during 8 weeks of storage at 6 °C and {{compared with that}} of conventional butter. The odour-active compounds were analyzed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry combined with olfactometry, using solid phase microextraction. <b>Olfactometric</b> <b>analysis</b> showed that both, fresh UFA/CLA butter and fresh conventional butter had similar aroma profiles. After 6 – 8 weeks of storage, UFA/CLA butter showed stronger fatty (butanoic and 3 -methyl butanoic acid), metallic [(E,E) - 2, 4 -nonadienal], green [(E) - 2 -hexenol] and creamy (2 -pentanone) notes compared with the conventional samples.

40|$|Milk samples, {{collected}} from nine healthy mid-lactation Holstein cows, were analysed organoleptically by two sensory panels, and chromatographically using mass spectrometry/flame ionization (MSD/FID) and olfactometric detectors. The sensory panels {{found that the}} samples collected after the cows were forage-starved for approximately 12 h were of good flavour quality, whereas at least 89 % of the samples collected after they were fed baled grass silage were tainted with off-flavour characterized as "feed". The corresponding MSD/FID chromatograms revealed that 30 min post-feeding samples had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher concentrations of ethanol, propane- 2 -one, dimethyl sulphide, butane- 2 -one, hexanal, heptanal and octane- 2, 3 -dione, whereas 3 h post-feeding samples showed higher concentrations of four of these compounds (propane- 2 -one, dimethyl sulphide, butane- 2 -one and hexanal). <b>Olfactometric</b> <b>analysis</b> performed on five milk samples (four off-flavoured and one of good flavour quality) revealed approximately 75 aroma-active compounds. Nearly all these compounds were common to all the analysed milk extracts (both off-flavoured and good quality samples), suggesting that off-flavour originated from the concentration differences of {{a common set of}} compounds rather than from the absence or presence of specific compounds. ...|$|E
40|$|In many foods, lipids {{are present}} as {{droplets}} dispersed {{in an aqueous}} matrix. This dispersed state favours the oxidation of unsaturated lipids and leads to the degradation of sensory and nutritional qualities of the foods. This work was aimed to (1) investigate the influence on lipid oxidation of physico-chemical characteristics of the lipid-water interface and the aqueous phase in oil-in-water emulsions, designed to mimic dispersion state of lipids in foods, and (2) evaluate the sensory impact of the produced volatile compounds. Analysis of oxidation kinetics of emulsions varying {{by the nature of}} the emulsifier, the pH of the aqueous phase or the presence of a hydrosoluble metal chelator, demonstrates the key roles of metal location and reactivity of the emulsifying protein on oxidation initiation and on relative proportions of produced volatile compounds. Most of the volatiles exhibit an odour activity. Their formation lead to an early detection of an odour, which was characterised by cut grass, mushroom, oilseeds, rancid, crushed wood bug, deep fried and painty descriptors. The odour evolved with time as shown by changes in the relative contributions of the intensities of these descriptors. The contribution to the odour of volatile compounds perceived alone or as mixtures was investigated by <b>olfactometric</b> <b>analysis.</b> This work contradicts models based on the charge of the interface and suggests new interpretations for oxidative stability of lipids in complex dispersed media. It also gives practical information about formulation of foods containing unsaturated lipids...|$|E
40|$|Poplar is a {{tree species}} with a {{considerable}} growth {{rate and the}} ability to produce high yield {{in a short period of}} time, and is one of the main sources of wood in Iran. Considering its importance, the identification of poplar pests could have a significant effect on improving production and forest management. The gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lymantriidae: Lepidoptera), is an important pest of forest trees in Guilan province, northern Iran. Therefore, host preference of this pest on the clones of Populus deltoids Bartram ex Marsh., P. euramericana (Dode), and P. caspica (Bornm.) was analyzed. The host preference of the pest was analyzed by <b>olfactometric</b> <b>analysis,</b> and the multiple choice method was also utilized to determine the rate of feeding and its effect on different clones. Some nutritional indices of 4 (th) instar larvae, such as consumption rate (CR), frass production rate (FR), approximate digestibility of food (AD), growth rate (OR), and efficiency of conversion of ingested and digested food (ECI and ECD) were measured on these clones. The data obtained demonstrate that 4 th instar larvae had the greatest host preference for P. e. triple (P > 0. 5). Additionally, the lowest level of larval preference was for P. caspica and P. d. 72 / 51 clones, as the highest feeding level was observed on P. e. triple. The results show that the local species P. caspica not only has low palatability for this pest, but also due to an interruption in larval food intake, low larval biological performance...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the oligolytic {{treatment}} of piggery slurry on a lab-scale level is discussed. A comparison is {{made between the}} results obtained with the oligolytic treatment and non-treatment. Oligolysis, developed by Muller in 1982, is an electrolytic treatment in which small quantities of metal ions (esp. Cu-ions) are dissolved in the slurry. At least two copper electrodes, working alternatively as anode and cathode, are installed in the manure storage tank below the slatted floor or in the external treatment tank. The oligolytic treatment unit has to be fed by a constant current intensity. If necessary, copper resorption can take place by activating two iron electrodes. Two identical barrels, each of them placed in separated places, are filled with 150 l liquid piggery manure. One barrel acts as reference while the other contains two copper electrodes between which a current intensity of 0. 9 A is maintained. Every 30 secondes migration movement inversion of the copper ions occurs. The oligolytic treatment lasts for 91 days. Afterwards the copper electrodes are replaced by an iron electrode couple. A microbiological and chemical analysis of the manure is carried out. During this experiment oligolysis does not cause a significant reduction of the pathogenic charge indicators. It has however been found that the manure treated with oligolysis is much less offensive than the untreated piggery slurry. Both gaschromato-graphic and <b>olfactometric</b> <b>analysis</b> of manure samples confirm this statement. Furthermore, the treated manure shows smaller releases of the total and NH- 4 +-N than the reference. This {{is reflected in the}} NH- 3 -concentrations measured in the surrounding air...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} odour {{evaluation}} of a dairy farm with anaerobic digestion, located in the Luxembourg province (Belgium). This study pursues three main goals: 1. - To evaluate {{the effect of the}} anaerobic digestion process on the odour level in the farm, 2. - To compare field and laboratory odour measurement techniques and 3. -To study the influence of the meteorological observation frequency on the odour plume, through the use of dispersion models. Three different approaches were used to characterize the odour: dynamic and field olfactometry and sniffing team method. Odour emissions from all sources were measured by duplicated through dynamic chamber and <b>olfactometric</b> <b>analysis</b> in two different situations: in normal conditions and after stirring the odour source. Two odour field measurement campaigns were conduced in the surroundings of the farm, and meteorological conditions were recorded two times per minute with a weather station. After comparing odour emissions with field measurements through dispersion modeling, we concluded that the best results were obtained using minimum and averaged odour emission rates. Emission rates measured in stirring conditions overestimated the reach of odour perceived in the field in three field campaigns. Overall odour emitted from the farm increased with the anaerobic digestion process. Although odour emission from digested manure is reduced in comparison with non-treated manure, the presence of agricultural wastes increases global odour emission. Finally, meteorological data were averaged each one, five and fifteen minutes. Odour shape was thinner and more extended with 15 -minutes data, whereas it was larger and shorter with 30 -secondes records. One minute and 5 -minute values showed intermediate situations. In conclusion, different techniques to measure odours were compared in this study and, according to the results, field techniques seemed to be more realistic than dynamic olfactometry.
