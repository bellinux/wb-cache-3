5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, France was in turmoil {{following}} {{the failure of the}} harvest, which threatened the country with starvation. In order to secure food supplies, France turned to its American colonies and the United States, which assembled a large grain convoy in Hampton Roads. To ensure the security of this convoy, the French Navy dispatched most of its Atlantic Fleet to sea during May 1794, <b>operating</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of large squadrons, independent cruisers and one major fleet under Villaret de Joyeuse. On 5 May, two French ships operating independently, the 36-gun frigate Atalante under Captain Charles Linois and the corvette Levrette, spied a British convoy sailing south-west, three days out from Cork, and closed to investigate.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships are}} fully fitted with flag facilities, {{such as their}} {{capability}} of <b>operating</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> NBC environment, and also Radar cross-section reduction is presumed to be minimal, {{to the extent that}} some sharp angles are flattened. For primary air defence, a pair of two 3S-90 launchers (one forward of the bridge and the other atop the dual helicopter hangar) are fitted with the Shtil SAM system. The system consists of 24 Russian Shtil missiles in a below-deck magazine. The launchers elevate up to 70°, with a firing arc of 30° within the centreline. The launcher groups, which require a 20-man crew, weigh about 50 tons.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the first}} months of 1918, the {{composition}} of Battleship Division Nine changed to reflect the lessons learned from <b>operating</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> war zone with the Grand Fleet. It soon became apparent that with only four ships, the division could not maintain the level of preparedness required by the constant need to be ready to sail at limited notice. The inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced the squadron to three ships, a development considered unacceptable given the Division's important position {{at the tail end of}} the battle line. The British—faced with the same problem—responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons. In this way, each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} {{geographic}} media markets. Media enterprises <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> specific geographic markets. Some firms <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> national market while other companies, for example, local radio stations <b>operate</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> regional area. So {{the marketplace of}} a media enterprise consists of the product media markets (consumer market, advertisement market and procurement market) and the geographic media market.|$|R
5|$|As a result, the fielding of {{a respectable}} hoplite army without mercenaries or freed helots was difficult. Cleomenes {{increased}} the number of full citizens again and made the Spartan army operate with an increased reliance on more lightly armored phalangites of the Macedonian style. However, many of these restored citizens were killed in the Battle of Sellasia and Nabis' politics drove the remainder of them into exile. In consequence, the heavy troops were no longer available in sufficient numbers. This led to a serious decline in Sparta's military power, and the aim of Nabis reforms was to reestablish a class of loyal subjects capable of serving as well-equipped phalangites (<b>operating</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> close and deep formation, with a longer spear than the hoplites'). Nabis' liberation of the enslaved helots {{was one of the most}} outstanding deeds in Spartan history. With this action, Nabis eliminated a central ideological pillar of the old Spartan social system and the chief reason for objection to Spartan expansion by the surrounding poleis (city-states). Guarding against helot revolt had been, until this time, the central concern of Spartan foreign policy, and the need to protect against internal revolt had limited adventurism abroad; Nabis' action abolished this concern with a single stroke. His freed helots received land from him and were wedded to wealthy wives of the exiled Spartan demos (all former full citizens) and widows of the rich elite, whose husbands had been killed at his orders.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of 1961, the Food for Peace program was <b>operating</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly {{expanded}} school lunch program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope John XXIII warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Customers' {{reactions}} to the merger varied. Most of the public understood {{the need for the}} merger of two small companies, which were both <b>operating</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> very limited market and trying to challenge the mass producers. Some loyal Vanaja customers were astounded at the decision to discontinue the make. Some customers were upset because the last long-nosed Vanajas were equipped with cabins from Jyry-Sisu; they said they would never buy Sisu and moved to imported vehicles. Many proven technical solutions used in Vanajas were soon implemented on Sisus. The drop in the truck market was short-lived and sales soon returned to the levels experienced by Vanaja and Sisu combined in the mid-1960s. The last Vanaja vehicles were mobile cranes produced at the end of 1971; subsequently all vehicles made in the SAT Hämeenlinna works were badged as Sisus.|$|E

5|$|Star Cops is a British {{science fiction}} {{television}} series first broadcast on BBC2 in 1987. It was devised by Chris Boucher, {{a writer who}} had previously worked on the science fiction television series Doctor Who and Blake's 7 as well as crime dramas such as Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. Set in the year 2027, a time where Interplanetary travel has become commonplace, it starred David Calder as Nathan Spring, commander of the International Space Police Force—nicknamed the “Star Cops"—who provide law enforcement for the newly developing colonies of the Solar System. The series follows Nathan Spring {{and the rest of}} his multinational team as they work to establish the Star Cops and solve whatever crimes come their way. <b>Operating</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relatively accurately realised hard SF, near-future, space environment, many of the cases that the Star Cops investigate arise from opportunities for new crimes presented by the technologically advanced future society the series depicts and from the hostile frontier nature of the environment that the Star Cops live in.|$|E
5|$|The People's Committees {{led to a}} high {{percentage}} of public involvement in decision making, within the limits permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They also served as a surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. <b>Operating</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E
