5|$|The {{alveolar}} bone is the bone of the jaw which forms the alveolus around teeth. Like any other bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar bone}} is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through <b>orthodontics,</b> an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.|$|E
5|$|As he was {{preparing}} to begin post-graduate studies in <b>orthodontics</b> at Loyola University in Chicago, Cannon {{received a call from}} Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram. Stram signed Cannon to a one-year contract and he played in six games for the Chiefs in 1970, catching two touchdowns before a season-ending injury convinced him to retire. He ended his eleven-year professional career with 2,455 yards rushing, 3,656 receiving yards, and 64 touchdowns on offense. He also threw one touchdown pass and returned a kickoff for a touchdown. Cannon holds the NFL record for the most yards from scrimmage in a non-overtime game (330 against the New York Titans in 1961) and is tied with four other players for the most touchdown receptions by a running back in a season (nine in 1961).|$|E
5|$|Initial {{studies of}} the mummy were first thought to reveal {{a man in his}} 50s, but {{subsequent}} examinations have shown that he was instead likely to have been in his mid-30s when he died. The identity of this mummy (Cairo Museum catalog n° 61057) was called into question in 1980 by the published results of Dr. James Harris, a professor of <b>orthodontics,</b> and Egyptologist Edward Wente. Harris had been allowed to take x-rays of all of the supposed royal mummies at the Cairo Museum. While history records Ahmose I as being the son or possibly the grandson of Seqenenre Tao, the craniofacial morphology of the two mummies are quite different. It is also {{different from that of the}} female mummy identified as Ahmes-Nefertari, thought to be his sister. These inconsistencies, and the fact that this mummy was not posed with arms crossed over chest, as was the fashion of the period for male royal mummies, led them to conclude that this was likely not a royal mummy, leaving the identity of Ahmose I unknown.|$|E

25|$|Craniofacial {{anomalies}} - Includes craniosynostosis, plagiocephaly, and syndromes {{associated with}} these defects. In cases of craniosynostosis where surgical intervention is necessary, the involvement {{of a team of}} multi-disciplinary professionals is of utmost importance. Team members often come from departments of plastic surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery, audiology, dentistry, <b>orthodontics,</b> and speech and language pathology. These professionals often assist not only in operational procedures, but in developing coordinated care plans for the child throughout their life.|$|E
25|$|The Invisalign system {{grew from}} 80,000 {{patients}} in 2002 to 175,000 in 2004. It won several awards for stereolithography, medical design and fast growth. Align Technology was profitable {{for the first}} time in 2003. In 2005 the company expanded into Japan, and acquired General Orthodontic, an <b>orthodontics</b> firm that supported doctors prescribing the Invisalign system. Later that year the Harvard School of Dental Medicine began requiring that its orthodontic graduate students complete Invisalign certification before they graduate.|$|E
25|$|Invisalign is {{manufactured}} by Align Technology, a multinational medical-device company headquartered in San Jose, California. The company {{was founded in}} 1997 by Zia Chishti. Chishti conceived of the basic design of InvisAlign while an adult <b>orthodontics</b> patient. During his treatment with a retainer intended to complete his treatment, he posited that a series of such devices could effect a large final placement {{in a series of}} small movements. He partnered with Kelsey Wirth to seek developers.|$|E
25|$|Prognathism is the {{positional}} {{relationship of the}} mandible or maxilla to the skeletal base where either of the jaws protrudes beyond a predetermined imaginary line in the coronal plane of the skull. In general dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery and <b>orthodontics,</b> this is assessed clinically or radiographically (cephalometrics). The word prognathism derives from Greek pro ("forward") and γνάθος gnáthos ("jaw"). One or more types of prognathism may result in the common condition of malocclusion, in which an individual's top teeth and lower teeth do not align properly.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} bone {{in the human}} body, {{alveolar}} bone is modified throughout life. Osteoblasts create bone and osteoclasts destroy it, especially if force is placed on a tooth. As is the case when movement of teeth is attempted through <b>orthodontics</b> using bands, wires, or appliances, an area of bone under compressive force from a tooth moving toward it has a high osteoclast level, resulting in bone resorption. An area of bone receiving tension from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has {{a high number of}} osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation. Thus, the tooth or teeth are slowly moved along the jaw so as to achieve a dentition that works in harmony. In this way, the width of the space between the alveoli and the root is kept about the same.|$|E
25|$|Dental {{school is}} four {{academic}} years in duration and {{is similar in}} format to medical school: two years of basic medical and dental sciences, followed by two years of clinical training (with continued didactic coursework). Before graduating, every dental student must successfully complete the National Board Dental Examination Part I and II (commonly referred to as NBDE I & II). The NBDE Part I is usually taken {{at the end of}} the second year after the majority of the didactic courses have been completed. The NBDE Part I covers Gross Anatomy, biochemistry, physiology, microbiology, pathology, and dental anatomy and occlusion. The NBDE Part II is usually taken during winter of the last year of dental school and consists of operative dentistry, pharmacology, endodontics, periodontics, oral surgery, pain control, prosthodontics, <b>orthodontics,</b> pedodontics, oral pathology, and radiology. NBDE Part I scores are Pass/Fail since 2012.|$|E
25|$|Mixed {{dentition}} starts {{when the}} first permanent molar appears in the mouth, usually at six years, and lasts until the last primary tooth is lost, usually at eleven or twelve years. Permanent teeth in the maxilla erupt in a different order from permanent teeth on the mandible. Maxillary teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) first premolar, (5) second premolar, (6) canine, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Mandibular teeth erupt in the following order: (1) first molar (2) central incisor, (3) lateral incisor, (4) canine, (5) first premolar, (6) second premolar, (7) second molar, and (8) third molar. Since there are no premolars in the primary dentition, the primary molars are replaced by permanent premolars. If any primary teeth are lost before permanent teeth are ready to replace them, some posterior teeth may drift forward and cause space to {{be lost in the}} mouth. This may cause crowding and/or misplacement once the permanent teeth erupt, which is usually referred to as malocclusion. <b>Orthodontics</b> may be required in such circumstances for an individual to achieve a straight set of teeth.|$|E
500|$|In <b>orthodontics,</b> small {{diameter}} dental implants, {{referred to}} as Temporary Anchorage Devices (or TADs) can assist tooth movement by creating anchor points from which forces can be generated. [...] For teeth to move, a force must be applied {{to them in the}} direction of the desired movement. The force stimulates cells in the periodontal ligament to cause bone remodeling, removing bone in the direction of travel of the tooth and adding it to the space created. In order to generate a force on a tooth, an anchor point (something that will not move) is needed. Since implants do not have a periodontal ligament, and bone remodelling will not be stimulated when tension is applied, they are ideal anchor points in <b>orthodontics.</b> Typically, implants designed for orthodontic movement are small and do not fully osseointegrate, allowing easy removal following treatment.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{alternative}} to simply reactively repairing the damage to teeth and conforming to the existing occlusal scheme, occasionally some dentists will attempt to reorganize the occlusion {{in the belief that}} this may redistribute the forces and reduce the amount of damage inflicted on the dentition. Sometimes termed [...] "occlusal rehabilitation" [...] or [...] "occlusal equilibration", this can be a complex procedure, and there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved, including the indications and the goals. It may involve <b>orthodontics,</b> restorative dentistry or even orthognathic surgery. Some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base, and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism.|$|E

2500|$|By February 1980, {{evidence}} of widespread metastasis was found. While {{he tried to}} keep the condition a secret, the National Enquirer disclosed that he had [...] "terminal cancer" [...] on March 11, 1980. In July, McQueen traveled to Rosarito Beach, Mexico, for unconventional treatment after US doctors told him they could do nothing to prolong his life. Controversy arose over the trip, because McQueen sought treatment from William Donald Kelley, who was promoting a variation of the Gerson therapy that used coffee enemas, frequent washing with shampoos, daily injections of fluid containing live cells from cattle and sheep, massage, and laetrile, an anticancer drug available in Mexico, but described as canonical quackery by mainstream scientists. McQueen paid for Kelley's treatments by himself in cash payments which were said to have been upwards of $40,000 per month ($ today) during his three-month stay in Mexico. Kelley's only medical license (until revoked in 1976) had been for <b>orthodontics.</b> Kelley's methods created a sensation in the traditional and tabloid press when it became known that McQueen was a patient.|$|E
