Co-administration of antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone) can increase the plasma concentration of <b>opipramol.</b> Barbiturates and anticonvulsants can reduce the plasma concentration of <b>opipramol</b> and thereby weaken the therapeutic effect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opipramol,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Insidon among others, is an {{anxiolytic}} and antidepressant which is used throughout Europe. Although it {{is a member of}} the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), <b>opipramol</b> is atypical among TCAs and its primary mechanism of action is much different in comparison. Most TCAs act as monoamine reuptake inhibitors, but <b>opipramol</b> does not, and instead acts primarily as a sigma receptor agonist. It is a dibenzazepine (iminostilbene) derivative. <b>Opipramol</b> was developed by Schindler and Blattner in 1961.|$|E

50|$|<b>Opipramol</b> {{acts as a}} high {{affinity}} sigma receptor agonist, {{primarily of}} the σ1 subtype, {{but also of the}} σ2 subtype with lower affinity. In one study of σ1 receptor ligands that also included haloperidol, pentazocine, (+)-3-PPP, ditolylguanidine, dextromethorphan, SKF-10,047 ((±)-alazocine), ifenprodil, progesterone, and others, <b>opipramol</b> showed the highest affinity (Ki = 0.2-0.3) for the guinea pig σ1 receptor of all the tested ligands except haloperidol, which it was approximately equipotent with. The sigma receptor agonism of <b>opipramol</b> is thought to be responsible for its therapeutic benefits against anxiety and depression.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opipramol</b> {{is rapidly}} and {{completely}} {{absorbed by the}} gastrointestinal tract. The bioavailability of <b>opipramol</b> amounts to 94%. After single oral administration of 50 mg, the peak plasma concentration of the drug is reached after 3.3 hours and amounts to 15.6 ng/mL. After single oral administration of 100 mg the maximum plasma concentration is reached after 3 hours and amounts to 33.2 ng/mL. Therapeutic concentrations of <b>opipramol</b> range from 140 to 550 nmol/L. The plasma protein binding amounts to approximately 91% and the volume of distribution is approximately 10 L/kg. <b>Opipramol</b> is partially metabolized in the liver to deshydroxyethylopipramol. Metabolization occurs through the CYP2D6 isoenzyme. Its terminal half-life in plasma is 6-11 hours. About 70% is eliminated in urine with 10% unaltered. The remaining portion is eliminated through feces.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opipramol</b> is {{typically}} {{used in the}} treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and somatoform disorders.

50|$|Many {{tricyclic}} antidepressants (TCAs) including clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, imipraminoxide, lofepramine, metapramine, <b>opipramol,</b> quinupramine, and trimipramine contain saturated dibenzazepine moieties {{in their}} chemical structures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opipramol</b> is a well-tolerated {{drug and}} {{is said to}} produce fewer side effects than {{selective}} serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs).|$|E
50|$|The {{frequently}} (≥1% to <10%) reported {{adverse reactions}} with <b>opipramol</b> {{especially at the}} beginning of the treatment include fatigue, dry mouth, blocked nose, hypotension, and orthostatic dysregulation.|$|E
50|$|Sigma receptors are {{a set of}} {{proteins}} located in the endoplasmic reticulum. σ1 receptors play key role in potentiating intracellular calcium mobilization thereby acting as sensor or modulator of calcium signaling. Occupancy of σ1 receptors by agonists causes translocation of the receptor from endoplasmic reticulum to peripheral areas (membranes) where the σ1 receptors cause neurotransmitter release. <b>Opipramol</b> {{is said to have}} a biphasic action, with prompt initial improvement of tension, anxiety, and insomnia followed by improved mood later. Hence, it is an anxiolytic with an antidepressant component. After sub-chronic treatment with <b>opipramol,</b> σ2 receptors are significantly downregulated but σ1 receptors are not.|$|E
50|$|The {{therapy with}} <b>opipramol</b> {{indicates}} an additional therapy with antipsychotics, hypnotics, and other anxiolytics (e.g. barbiturates, benzodiazepines). Therefore, {{it should be}} noted that some specific reactions, particularly central nervous system depressant effects, could be intensified and an intensification of common side effects may occur. If necessary the dosage may be reduced. Co-administration with alcohol can cause stupor.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other TCAs, <b>opipramol</b> {{does not}} inhibit the reuptake of {{serotonin}} or norepinephrine. However, it does {{act as a}} high affinity antagonist of the histamine H1 receptor and as a low to moderate affinity antagonist of the dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2, and α1-adrenergic receptors. H1 receptor antagonism accounts for its antihistamine effects and associated sedative side effects.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of these receptors is poorly understood though an exogenous ligand, dimethyltryptamine, {{was found to}} interact with σ1. Activation of σ-receptors by an agonist ligand may induce hallucinogenic effects and also {{may be responsible for}} the paradoxical convulsions sometimes seen in opiate overdose. Drugs known to be σ-agonists include cocaine, morphine/diacetylmorphine, <b>opipramol,</b> PCP, fluvoxamine, methamphetamine, dextromethorphan, and the herbal antidepressant berberine. However the exact role of σ-receptors is difficult to establish as many σ-agonists also bind to other targets such as the κ-opioid receptor and the NMDA glutamate receptor. In animal experiments, σ-antagonists such as rimcazole were able to block convulsions from cocaine overdose. σ-antagonists are also under investigation for use as antipsychotic medications.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 1990s, {{research}} has uncovered multiple {{limitations of the}} monoamine hypothesis, and its inadequacy has been criticized within the psychiatric community. For one thing, serotonin system dysfunction cannot be the sole cause of depression; antidepressants usually increase synaptic serotonin very quickly, but it often takes at least two to four weeks before mood improves significantly. One possible explanation for this lag is that the neurotransmitter activity enhancement {{is the result of}} auto receptor desensitization rather which can take weeks. Intensive investigation has failed to find convincing evidence of a primary dysfunction of a specific monoamine system in patients with major depressive disorders. The antidepressants that do not act through the monoamine system, such as tianeptine and <b>opipramol,</b> have been known for a long time. There has also been inconsistency with regards to serum 5-HIAA levels, a metabolite of serotonin. Experiments with pharmacological agents that cause depletion of monoamines have shown that this depletion does not cause depression in healthy people. [...] Another problem that presents is that drugs that deplete monoamines may actually have antidepressants properties. Furthermore, some have argued that depression may be marked by a hyperserotonergic state Already limited, the monoamine hypothesis has been further oversimplified when presented to the general public.|$|E

In the present study we confirm this observation and provide additional evidence for the involvement of these sites in the pharmacological effects of the drug. Inhibition experiments using a series of trimetazidine derivatives revealed the presence of three classes of binding sites. An N-benzyl substituted analogue of trimetazidine exhibited a very high affinity (Ki= 7 [*]nM) for one of these classes of sites. Compounds from different pharmacological classes were evaluated for their ability to inhibit [3 H]-trimetazidine binding. Among the drugs tested pentazocine, ifenprodil, <b>opipramol,</b> perphenazine, haloperidol, and to a lower extent prenylamine, carbetapentane and dextromethorphan competed with high affinity, suggesting a similarity of high affinity [3 H]-trimetazidine sites with sigma receptors.
