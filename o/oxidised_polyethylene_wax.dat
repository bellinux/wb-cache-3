40|$|The {{importance}} {{of the use of}} waxes in the wood industry has been increasing, par-ticularly in Europe, since consumers, due to their increased environmental aware-ness, avoid using biocidally treated wood and wood from tropical forests. In this research two water-repellent emulsions in various concentrations were used: poly-ethylene and <b>oxidised</b> <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wax</b> emulsion. The performance of wax treated Norway spruce (Picea abies) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood was tested in two sorption experiments: conditioning in high relative air humidity (vapour diffusion) and non-continuous dipping (liquid flow). The sorption properties of oven and va-cuum dried impregnated specimens were determined. During conditioning, wax treated Norway spruce specimens, vacuum and oven dried, had the same moisture content as control specimens; while treated vacuum dried beech had up to 25 % lo-wer moisture content than the parallel control specimens. An even higher difference was evident in volume changes of vacuum and oven dried beech specimens during the sorption test...|$|E
40|$|Waxes are {{a widely}} used {{chemical}} commodity {{throughout the world}} due to certain intrinsic properties. Applications vary widely, including such obvious ones as candles and polishes, less obviously coatings, ink, and cosmetics, and more obscurely, hot melt adhesives, textile processing and chewing gum. The waxes used are obtained {{from a variety of}} sources, natural, mineral, and synthetic. The properties of the wax determine its suitability for a particular application. For certain of the latter, a wax containing Oxygen groups is often the most appropriate type. While {{there are a number of}} such waxes that occur naturally, there are also many more in which the raw wax has undergone oxidation by chemical processes. Generally, this is done utilising elevated temperatures, and passing air or oxygen through the wax. Oxidation then takes place via a free radical process. Singlet molecular oxygen is a higher-energy state species of oxygen, in which the two electrons in the π* 2 p antibonding molecular orbitals, while remaining unpaired, are excited to antiparallel spin. Reactions of singlet oxygen are very site-speciﬁc, resulting in more speciﬁc products compared to the free radical process. It was considered that oxidation of waxes by reaction with singlet oxygen might produce different products compared to the thermal oxidation, and also compared to oxidation using ozone. An apparatus was set up to test this theory. The singlet oxygen was generated by passing a stream of oxygen through a microwave beam to form a plasma, the resulting singlet oxygen-containing gas being reacted with molten wax. Optimisation of the setup was performed before performing reactions, using several different waxes. The experiments were duplicated by ones with the microwave switched off, so that any results could be ascribed to the presence of singlet oxygen, and not normal oxygen. A similar apparatus was set up to react the same waxes with ozone, the latter being generated by passing oxygen through an electrical discharge-type generator. Blank runs with the electric discharge apparatus switched off, were also carried out to be able to distinguish any reaction due to the unozonised oxygen. The results showed that the singlet oxygen only reacted with a particular type of wax, namely <b>oxidised</b> <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wax</b> (AC 6 - 29), although other effects were caused by the heat of the plasma. The ozone, on the other hand, reacted readily with all types of waxes tested. Other experiments were also conducted to investigate the use of microwave technology for chemical purposes, including development of an analytical method for saponification value determination in which microwaves replaced conventional heating...|$|E

40|$|Boron {{biocides}} {{belong to}} {{the most frequently used}} ingredients of commercial wood preservatives. They are very effective fungicides and insecticides, but they do not react with wood and thus leach from it in wet applications. This fact signifi cantly limits use of boron compounds in the field of wood preservation. In order to reduce leaching of boric acid, the emulsion of polyethylene (WE 1) and an emulsion of oxidized <b>polyethylene</b> (WE 6) <b>wax</b> were combined with boric acid (cB = 0. 1 % or 0. 5 % of boron). Spruce wood specimens were vacuum impregnated and afterwards leached according to the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1, EN 1250 - 2 and EN 84 procedures. The results showed that the boron leaching is predominantly infl uenced by moisture content of wood during leaching, and furthermore by the concentration gradient (frequency of water replacement). The fact that the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1 leaching procedure is less severe than other two methods is also refl ected in the results. The results of the EN 84 and ENV 1250 test are comparable, while the results of the prCEN/TS 15119 - 1 testing are not in line with the other two methods.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} address {{pertinent}} issues {{in relation to the}} use of Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) in pavement construction, it is imperative to understand the effects that such additives have on rheological and failure properties in service. In this study, two commercial WMA additives, a proprietary siloxane-based compound and an oxidized <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wax,</b> were added to a soft Roofing Asphalt Flux (RAF), a soft Recycled Engine Oil Bottom (REOB) tainted binder, and a somewhat harder binder containing 20 % oxidized asphalt derived from Recycled Asphalt Pavement (RAP). Binders were aged according to standard Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO) and Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV) protocols. Selected compositions were subjected to a period of extended PAV aging for 40 h. Standard and advanced rheological and failure tests were used to predict the performance of these binders in service. Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) tests according to Superpave™ protocols were done to determine performance grades. Extended BBR (EBBR) and Double-Edge-Notched Tension (DENT) tests were done to provide further insights into durability and strain tolerance, properties of utmost importance to assure long term pavement performance. The findings of this study show that the addition of the oxidized <b>polyethylene</b> <b>wax</b> WMA additive to REOB and/or RAP tainted systems can provide binders that are unstable and likely prone to premature and excessive low temperature failure in service.
