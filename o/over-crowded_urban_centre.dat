40|$|In this paper, the {{dynamics}} of migration and commuting into the <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of Slovenia in 2000 – 2011 is presented. The influence of the attractiveness of <b>urban</b> <b>centres,</b> {{the influence of the}} emissiveness of migration and commuting flows in the origin and the influence of the distance between origins and destinations on migration and commuting flows into the <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> in Slovenia were analysed in a spatial interaction model. The dynamics of the parameters were analysed for the period before (2000 - 2007) and in the economic crisis (2008 - 2011). According the Spatial Development Strategy of Slovenia, the <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of Slovenia were considered at four levels: national <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of international importance, <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of national significance, <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of inter-regional significance and <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of inter-municipal significance...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Art. et Scien. (Town and Regional Planning)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 This {{study was}} {{initiated}} to potentially provide an encompassing Index of Vitality for <b>urban</b> <b>centres.</b> The Vitality Index’s {{goal is to}} evaluate and measure <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> in terms of growth and general performance on various levels. This will enable measurement of the general economic, social, physical, environmental, institutional and spatial performance of towns within a region, ultimately reflecting the spatial importance of the <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> in the region. The main problem statement reveals a lack of integrated and encompassing indicators that reflect on the urban structure as an organic entity. This demands {{for the inclusion of}} a number of existing indicators into an encompassing index. Towns have been measured in terms of numerous indicators, mostly in connection with social and economic conditions, {{over an extended period of}} time. The lack of typical spatial indicators is identified as a shortcoming in the measurement of <b>urban</b> <b>centres.</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>centres</b> exist and function within a larger region, consequently all <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> are interrelated. This study proposes the utilisation of a comprehensive index to measure the importance of an <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> within a specific region. The proposed Vitality Index reflects on a city’s vitality.. vitality describes the ability of an organism to stay alive or work effectively. The proposed Vitality Index was developed on the basis of which an <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> is measured by means of a number of indicators, indicating the ability of that <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> to continue to exist, be viable, and function satisfactorily in order to provide for the basic needs of the community and to improve the lives of all residents in the long run. This Vitality Index includes social, economic, satisfaction and spatial indicators. The Vitality Index is consequently tested in the proposed study area situated in the Northern Cape Province. The Northern Cape Province is sparsely populated and has very few large <b>urban</b> <b>centres.</b> The <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> also occur at irregular intervals and the geography of the area is fairly homogeneous. The area is, therefore, ideal for a study project such as this one since the geography will have less influence on the settlement of people. The specific study area is represented in each of the levels of the urban system, and thus includes <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> in the natiunal regional, and daily urban systems. This contributes greatly to the study, due to the inclusion of Spatial Indicators in the Vitality Index. The study area furthermore fits into the core-periphery model (which is central to this study), with certain centres forming part of the core, while other centres and development corridors are included in the transition zone, and the periphery. A main town is identified within each Local Municipality by means of the central place index and the functional classification of towns with regard to population size. The results obtained for each municipality is consequently related to the main town within the specific <b>urban</b> <b>centre.</b> The results allowed for interurban comparison and measurement as identified within the aims of the study. From the empirical study it is disclosed that Kimberley acquires prominence as the <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> of greatest spatial importance within the study area, followed by Kathu, Kuruman, Barkley West, Jan Kempdorp, Bothithong and Warrenton. This study contributes in a number of ways to the measurement of <b>urban</b> <b>centres,</b> including the classification of urban indicators into four broad categories, i. e. normative welfare, satisfaction, descriptive social and spatial indicators. This study also proposes the sifting of possible indicators by measuring them against certain prerequisites. Methods are proposed for calculating the Vitality Index, including the ranking and scoring of <b>urban</b> <b>centres.</b> It is proposed that shortcomings that are identified for the <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> be addressed by policy initiatives, comprising a set of objectives and strategies to correct imbalances. The Vitality Index also provides a basis for structuring national and provincial growth policies, in the identification of <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> with sustainable growth potential and vitality.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} how distance to <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> influences necessity and opportunity-based firm start-ups. The results show that closeness to <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> is not necessarily beneficial for firm start-ups. On the contrary, regions further away from <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> of any size experience more firm start-ups. One explanation of this result is that regions experience spatial protection from urban competition. However, regions located further away from larger-sized <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> experience less firm start-ups due to such remoteness. One explanation of this finding is that remote regions cannot access the agglomeration benefits that larger cities offer. This supports the view that rural regions draw on urban resources but only on those from larger agglomerations...|$|R

40|$|Urbanization and {{regional}} development are closely associated. Allocation of higher and lower order facilities and specialization of business influence urban growth which diffuses its {{benefits to the}} surrounding countryside. Subsequently, socio-economic development of the region comes into being. The continuous increase of urban size can not be sustained rather declining growth will certainly set in long run. Optimum level of its growth depends on the capacity of an <b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> to provide required facilities {{to the people in}} fair manner. Hierarchical growth of <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> in association with location of civic amenities induces regional development in hierarchical dimension which is the common problem in developing economy. Subsequently, few of the <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> are having large number of facilities while others are lacking corresponding to their population size.

It is an attempt to analyze the hierarchical growth of <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> associated with their functional potentiality and diffusion of urban developmental impulses to the surrounding rural part.
