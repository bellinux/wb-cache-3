5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1985 by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick, {{who sought to}} tell a comedic story based on horror film and B-movie clichés. They mapped out the project as a paper-and-pencil game before coding commenced. While earlier adventure titles had relied on command lines, Gilbert disliked such systems, and he developed Maniac Mansions simpler point-and-click interface as a replacement. To speed up production, he created a game engine called SCUMM, which was used in many later LucasArts titles. After its release, Maniac Mansion was ported to several platforms. A port for the Nintendo Entertainment System had to be reworked heavily, in response to complaints by Nintendo <b>of</b> <b>America</b> <b>that</b> the game was inappropriate for children.|$|E

On May 5, 2008 (after the success of Iron Man), Marvel announced the film The First Avenger: Captain America (the working title) for release in May 6, 2011 (before being pushed back to July 22). Louis Leterrier, director of The Incredible Hulk, viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services, but Marvel turned him down. Johnston finally signed on in November 2008, and he hired Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to rewrite. Feige cited Johnston's directorial work on October Sky and The Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy {{to explain why he}} was an appropriate choice. Raiders of the Lost Ark was an influence on the film, because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 18th century, {{northern}} elephant seals were hunted extensively, {{almost to}} extinction {{by the end}} of the 19th century, being prized for oil made from their blubber, and the population may have fallen as low as only 20 individuals. In 1874, Charles Melville Scammon recorded in Marine Mammals of the Northwestern Coast <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> <b>that</b> an 18-ft-long bull caught on Santa Barbara Island yielded 210 gallons of oil. They were thought to be extinct in 1884 until a remnant population of eight individuals was discovered on Guadalupe Island in 1892 by a Smithsonian expedition, who promptly killed seven of the eight for their collections. The elephant seals managed to survive, and were finally protected by the Mexican government in 1922. Since the early 20th century, they have been protected by law in both Mexico and in the United States. Subsequently, the U.S. protection was strengthened after passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, and numbers have now recovered to over 100,000.|$|E

This changed gradually as very positive reviews appeared in the newspapers. When it closed on March 8 the exhibition had had a total of 169,000 visitors to see Sorolla's work. Encouraged by the overwhelming response, a slightly modified collection was also shown in Buffalo and Boston. During his stay in the United States Sorolla received 20 portrait commissions, including that of the just-elected US President William Howard Taft, whom he visited in the White House in Washington, D.C. In May 1909, as Sorolla left the United States, he had sold a total of 195 images - including two works to the Metropolitan Museum of Art - and taken in the enormous sum of 181,760 US dollars.|$|E

The organization transmuted further from other war fighting groups like The General Society of the War of 1812, The Grand Army of the Republic and The Order of Indian Wars. All these had the same general philosophy, so had a common ground. By 1886, it was realized that these organizations would naturally become extinct due to deaths of the veterans if something wasn’t done to give them new life. The idea came about to restructure all these individual organizations into one permanent organization.

He further commented that it would be impossible for a third party candidate to win an election without ballot access in all fifty states.

500|$|The Civil War, and {{the period}} {{following}} it, saw a general flowering of American art, literature and music. Amateur musical ensembles of this era {{can be seen}} as the birth of American popular music. Music author David Ewen describes these early amateur bands as combining [...] "the depth and drama of the classics with undemanding technique, eschewing complexity in favor of direct expression. If it was vocal music, the words would be in English, despite the snobs who declared English an unsingable language. In a way, it was part of the entire awakening <b>of</b> <b>America</b> <b>that</b> happened after the Civil War, a time in which American painters, writers, and 'serious' composers addressed specifically American themes." [...] During this period the roots of blues, gospel, jazz, and country music took shape; in the 20th century, these became the core of American popular music, which further evolved into the styles like rhythm and blues, rock and roll, and hip hop music.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two schools}} of thought {{surrounding}} the decision to scuttle the battlecruiser. The first is that sinking Australia was a major blow to the nation's ability to defend herself.

The battlecruiser {{had served as a}} deterrent to German naval action against Australia during the war, and with growing tensions between Japan and the United States <b>of</b> <b>America,</b> <b>that</b> deterrence might have been required if the nations had become openly hostile towards each other or towards Australia. The opposing argument is that, while an emotive and symbolic loss, the ship was obsolete, and would have been a drain on resources. Operating and maintaining the warship was beyond the capabilities of the RAN's post-war budgets, necessitating the ship's reduction in status in 1920 and assignment to reserve in 1921. Ammunition and replacement barrels for the main guns were no longer manufactured. To remain effective, Australia required major modernisation (including new propulsion machinery, increased armour and armament, and new fire control systems) at a cost equivalent to a new [...]|$|E
