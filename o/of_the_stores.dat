She later admitted that the couple were naive about {{what it takes to make}} a successful fashion enterprise. Edun encountered problems with both quality of goods and delivery times from their African suppliers, and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> originally carrying the line dropped it. It lost €9.7 million in 2007 and €12.8 million in 2008, suffering along with the rest of the apparel sector from the credit crisis of 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores,</b> specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E

They ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores,</b> where they were unrecognized because of their nurses' uniforms.

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control of a silent protagonist that can be named and whose personality is determined by dialogue choices made in the game. Navigation is split into two types: standard navigation through the game's three-dimensional (3D) dungeons in a first-person view, and navigation around the protagonist's home of Hirasaki City using a 3D overworld map. During dungeon navigation, the player's route is automatically mapped, and the map can be viewed in the menu screen. Non-playable characters (NPCs) are represented in first-person navigation with 2D sprites, and their speech is represented with head-and-shoulder portraits above dialogue boxes. Quests are available at a location called the House of Divination, which the player can choose to accept in exchange for rewards. Various stores are scattered throughout Hirasaki City for buying items, weapons and armor, and healing the player's party and reserves. A key currency in the game is Magnetite, which is used for summoning demons and as currency in some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores.</b>|$|E

As the students sat at the counters, crowds of white youths gathered in several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores.</b> Police kept a watchful eye on all five locations, but no incidents of violence occurred.

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{hallmark}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new <b>store</b> designs was <b>the</b> arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> aisles, {{which was}} developed and introduced as the company was emerging from bankruptcy. Half <b>the</b> <b>store</b> had aisles that ran from <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> to <b>the</b> back in straight rows. Seasonal merchandise, food, greeting cards, baby supplies, hardware and office supplies were in this half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> <b>The</b> other half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> <b>the</b> health and beauty sections, had their aisles slanted so customers could see down the aisles as they walked {{from the front door}}s to the pharmacy, which was in <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> A very wide main aisle led from the front door to the pharmacy, and this aisle separated the slanted aisles from the [...] "straight aisles". While many drug <b>stores</b> in <b>the</b> U.S. have variations of this design today, it was a departure at the time from the usual all front-to-back, straight aisles. In Revco's free standing <b>stores,</b> <b>the</b> slanted aisles had an open ceiling above them; the other aisles had a drop ceiling over them. In these stores today, which are now CVS <b>stores,</b> <b>the</b> open ceiling and drop ceiling are still in place (though all the aisles are now aligned in a traditional manner).|$|R
5|$|The uniform {{used by the}} Confederate States Marine Corps resembled that {{prescribed}} for the Confederate Army. However, there is controversy {{about some of the}} exact details of the uniform, since the CSMC was not as large, and many of its records were destroyed. In 1865, right after the war's end, Lloyd J. Beall, commander of the CSMC, had a fire at his home which destroyed most of the CSMC's records. It is clear, however, that the Marines were often equipped out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> of whichever garrison was nearest their location. One description has the Marines dressed in frock coats of a particular (and undetermined) shade of gray, and dark blue or black trousers. It appears that Confederate Marines wore forage caps although it is unclear if there was any ornamentation on the cover. Much of the gear worn by the CSMC was imported from Russia, and from Great Britain and its empire, mainly Canada. This created a fairly unusual look.|$|E
5|$|When Mackintosh and the depot-laying party {{finally reached}} Cape Evans in mid-June, {{they learned that}} Aurora, with 18 men on board and {{carrying}} most of the shore party's supplies and equipment, had broken loose from its winter mooring during a gale. Ice conditions in McMurdo Sound {{made it impossible for}} the ship to return; the shore party of ten was effectively marooned, with drastically depleted resources. However, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> required for the depots had been landed. Mackintosh therefore resolved that the following season's work would be carried out to the full: depots would be laid across the Great ice Barrier {{all the way to the}} Beardmore Glacier. The party would seek to make up its lack of supplies and equipment by salvaging the stores left by earlier expeditions, particularly from Captain Scott's recent sojourn at Cape Evans. The entire party pledged its support to this effort, though it would require, wrote Mackintosh, a record-breaking feat of polar travel to accomplish it. However, the long months of preparation were difficult for Mackintosh. The only officer in the party, he found it hard to form close relationships with his companions. His position became increasingly isolated, and subject to the frequent vocal criticisms of Joyce in particular.|$|E

25|$|Retail {{designers}} {{pay close}} attention to <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> which is known as the decompression zone.

30|$|Situated in <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> CS {{workers and}} cashiers were broadly {{categorized}} as service providers.

Sharing a supervising manager, cashiers and CS workers attended the same shift meetings and rotated between posts in <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> Food workers, dressed in white lab jackets stained with the food they prepared toiled at <b>the</b> back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>store</b> where they prepared cuisine and doled out meals to waiting customers.
