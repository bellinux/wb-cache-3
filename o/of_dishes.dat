5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} {{lives on}} muddy and sandy bottoms, grazing on algae and detritus. It is gonochoristic and sexually dimorphic, depending on internal fertilization for spawning. Larvae {{of this species}} spend several days as plankton, undergoing a series of transformations until they reach complete metamorphosis. The maximum life span is 2 to 2.5 years. Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also humans, who consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} <b>of</b> <b>dishes.</b>|$|E

The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs. Although the classic Malagasy meal of rice and its accompaniment remains predominant, over the past 100 years other food types and combinations have been popularized by French colonists and immigrants from China and India. Consequently, Malagasy cuisine is traditional while also assimilating newly emergent cultural influences.|$|E

While there are a large number <b>of</b> <b>dishes</b> that can be considered Welsh due to their ingredients and/or history, dishes such as cawl, Welsh rarebit, laverbread, Welsh cakes, bara brith and the Glamorgan sausage have all been regarded as symbols of Welsh food. Some variation in dishes exists across the country, with notable differences existing in the Gower Peninsula; an historically isolated rural area which developed self-sufficiency in food production.

5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{came close}} to going bankrupt, Blumenthal sold his house, his car {{and many of his}} possessions {{in order to keep the}} restaurant afloat. After four years, the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin star in the 1999 list. Blumenthal worked with Professor Peter Barham of the University of Bristol, and developed a menu <b>of</b> <b>dishes</b> through experimentation such as slow-cooked lamb which avoids shocking the fibres in the meat and causing them to seize. By 2000, techniques were being used such as cooking vegetables in mineral water after discovering that the levels of calcium in tap water causes their discolouration, and freezing cuttlefish to break down the molecules in them in order to increase their tenderness. In 2001 it was awarded a second Michelin star, and was also named Restaurant of the Year by The Automobile Association.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>dishes</b> and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

40|$|Objective Diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) {{is characterized}} by ossification of different entheseal sites. Several metabolic factors have been suggested {{to be involved in}} DISH development. We assessed the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>DISH</b> and its relationship to traditional vascular risk factors in a cohort of patients diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases. Methods Among the 521 consecutive patients admitted to the heart diseases rehabilitation program in our Rehabilitative Cardiology Unit, only those (n = 436) with recent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), a heart valve replacement (HVR), or congestive heart failure (CHF) were enrolled (45 CHF, 338 CABG, and 53 HVR). All patients underwent a rheumatologic examination, blood sample collections, and chest radiographs. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and information about sex, age, smoking habit, and other vascular risk factors were recorded. DISH was established according to the Resnick and Niwayama criteria. Results In the setting (77. 1 % men), the mean ± SD age was 65. 44 ± 9. 66 years and the overall prevalence <b>of</b> <b>DISH</b> was 30. 3 %. A logistic regression analysis showed that both age (odds ratio [OR] 1. 076, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI] 1. 044 - 1. 109; P < 0. 001) and obesity (OR 2. 28, 95 % CI 1. 33 - 3. 89; P = 0. 003) were significant predictors of the presence <b>of</b> <b>DISH.</b> An increasing OR for the presence <b>of</b> <b>DISH</b> was found for increasing tertiles of age and BMI. No difference resulted according to other traditional vascular risk factors. BMI and age directly correlated with C-reactive protein levels. Conclusion The overall prevalence <b>of</b> <b>DISH</b> was 30. 3 %. This is expected because of the study population.
