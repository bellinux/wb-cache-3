25|$|The {{most recent}} {{innovation}} in Chinese agriculture is a push into <b>organic</b> <b>agriculture.</b> This rapid embrace of organic farming simultaneously serves multiple purposes, including food safety, health benefits, export opportunities, and, by providing price premiums for the produce of rural communities, {{the adoption of}} organics can help stem the migration of rural workers to the cities. In the mid-1990s China became a net importer of grain, since its unsustainable practises of groundwater mining has effectively removed considerable land from productive agricultural use.|$|E
25|$|Recently, chloroplasts {{have caught}} {{attention}} by developers {{of genetically modified}} crops. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and <b>organic</b> <b>agriculture.</b> While the reliability of this mechanism {{has not yet been}} studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{the event}} of a {{petroleum}} shortage (see peak oil for global concerns), <b>organic</b> <b>agriculture</b> can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields equal to or higher than those available from conventional farming. In the aftermath of the fall of the Soviet Union, with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including biopesticides, plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace. However, organic farming may be more labor-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas. The reconditioning of soil to restore organic matter lost during the use of monoculture agriculture techniques is important to provide a reservoir of plant-available nutrients, to maintain texture, and to minimize erosion.|$|E
25|$|The Greens {{base their}} health {{policies}} on prevention, and claim to consider health {{in areas such}} as <b>organic</b> <b>agriculture,</b> active transportation, urban planning, and education. In particular, party policy closely links the areas of disease prevention and environmental health, with policies such a ban on cosmetic pesticides, a Cancer Prevention Act, and doubling funding for the Ministry of Health Promotion. Policies on health care include expanding the Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) system, increasing support for multidisciplinary clinics (those with doctors, nurses, psychologists, dieticians, and other health care professionals), and increasing support for midwifery, along with a number of administrative reforms. GPO policy emphasizes a reduction in health care costs through avoidance of illness and expansion of alternative access models (such as CCACs), rather than simply closing facilities or increasing expenditures.|$|E

2500|$|John Hamaker {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri, United States and {{graduated}} from Purdue University in Mechanical Engineering. Concerned for the environment, he became a student of ecology and agriculture and was influenced by books such as Bread From Stones, which showed plants grow better in soils generated by mimicking natural soil-forming processes that take millennia, such as the advance and retreat of glaciers scouring over the Earth’s crust, or rock weathering of volcanic lava. In the 1960s, Hamaker cultivated {{a strong interest in}} soil and climate issues, and began publishing articles about how the health of an individual, society and planetary ecology only thrive as an integrated interdependent whole. For 30 years, he wrote and campaigned for <b>organic</b> <b>agriculture</b> based on soil remineralization, and was the first to call for the remineralization of the Earth to forestall the next glacial period within the current ice age cycle. Hamaker produced a notable book The Survival Of Civilization in 1982, republished in 2002 by Remineralize The Earth.|$|E
