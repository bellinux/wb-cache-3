Based on a survey of 1044 students it is demonstrated that some consumers may suffer from a "price differentiation bias", i. e., {{a fair number of}} consumers may overestimate the savings that result from reduced on-net and/or off-net charges, as they do not appear to weigh the prices with the probabilities of placing <b>off-net</b> and on-net <b>calls.</b> This may help to explain why it have been the smaller operators in various countries who have introduced on-net/off-net price differentiation. The paper also discusses the implications that such a consumer bias may have for market competition. Mobile telecommunications Price discrimination...|$|R

We apply innovative implementation approach of utilizing high performance CUDA computing devices which allows us to consider population of up to 1 million consumers.

We discover that boundedly rational subscribers, who exploit simple decision heuristics to coordinate network choice within closed user groups, exert much stronger pressure on suppliers than fully rational ones. This leads to lower average calling costs, increased welfare and decreased monopolistic power of operators.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study {{different}} regulatory effects on termination charges and social welfare. We employ a framework with a fixed network and two mobile networks competing in a market to study the following regulatory regimes: collusive and social welfaremaximising reciprocity, uniform termination charge, asymmetric regulation, and direct calling price. We incorporate the idea of partial consumer ignorance when calling to a mobile user and allow the network operator to discriminate between on-net and <b>off-net</b> <b>calls</b> by setting differential calling prices. Compared to the uniform termination charge and asymmetric regulation, it is shown in this paper that the regulator can improve social welfare, without too much intervention, by imposing reciprocity on termination charges. We also find that with stronger consumer ignorance the regulator is more capable of improving social welfare. Further we show that, depending upon the extent of consumer ignorance, direct regulation of calling prices may be a welfare-improving alternative over regulation of termination charges.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{competition between}} two asymmetric networks, an incumbent {{and a new}} entrant. Networks compete in non-linear tariffs and may charge different prices for on-net and <b>off-net</b> <b>calls</b> (”on-net pricing"). The incumbent benefits from a larger installed base and consumers face switching costs. With on-net pricing, departing from cost-based access pricing allows the incumbent to foreclose the market in a profitable way. If the incumbent benefits from customer inertia, then it has an incentive to insist in the highest possible access markup even if access charges are reciprocal {{and even if the}} absence of actual switching costs. If instead the entrant benefits from customer activism, then foreclosure is profitable only when switching costs are large enough, and is best achieved through either a limited access markup or through an access subsidy. In all cases, foreclosure is profitable only when it keeps the entrant entirely out of the market. We also show that on-net pricing is a key factor. In its absence, foreclosure is either not profitable (in a caller pays regime) or not feasible (in a receiver pays regime). The analysis supports a qualified call for regulatory authorities to set bounds on access markups (and subsidies) and/or on-net pricing. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} models of network competition with call externalities demonstrate strategic incentives of incumbent providers to reduce receiver benefits in rival network by excessive off-net pricing. Such anti-competitive pricing practices have a potentially damaging impact on financial standing {{of a late}} entrant, leading to non-convergence of long-run market shares 2 ̆ 013 an outcome that has been observed in many European mobile markets. The theoretical reasoning behind call externalities assumes that receiving calls contribute to consumer utility hence, receiver benefits drive subscription choices. So far no {{attempts have been made}} to test this critical assumption in a rigorous manner. We use data elicited from prepaid and postpaid users of mobile telephony in Poland in a discrete choice experiment designed specifically to model subscription choices when operators set termination-based discriminatory tariffs under calling party pays regime. Receiver benefits are controlled with an incoming price 2 ̆ 013 a variable informing about the cost of <b>off-net</b> <b>calls</b> paid by subscribers originating a call from other networks. The model also accounts for switching costs and network effects. We find that call externalities are significant driver of subscription choices, albeit their influence has smaller magnitude than direct price effects. Next, we assess the impact of excessive off-net pricing on the structure of market shares of mobile operators in Poland and estimate customer base stealing effect encountered by the late entrant. Our empirical findings support a widespread view that call externalities might have indeed limited market competition and late entrants' growth in many European countries...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we utilize {{discrete}} choice experiment method {{to identify and}} measure switching costs and network effects in mobile telephony in Poland. Based on hypothetical choices consumers make we construct a conditional random parameters multinomial logit model to analyze their preferences. In our choice design we explicitly account for status quo inertia, number portability, operator brand, network distribution of most frequently called parties and price of on-net and <b>off-net</b> <b>calls.</b> Stated preference approach allows us to calculate marginal rates of substitution and hence implicit prices of the non-price attributes used to describe choices and switching behavior. Results of our study indicate that although choices of mobile operators are largely driven by price of calls, switching costs and network effects have and strong impact on utility of subscribers. In particular users assign positive value to their mobile phone number {{and the size of}} family and friends group in the same network. The monetary value of phone number is significantly higher among individual entrepreneurs then residential subscribers. In our model switching behavior is not discouraged by brand loyalty {{which turned out to be}} insignificant. Instead subscribers follow status quo inertia which reflects uncertainty associated with new operator. Therefore we conclude that despite introduction of mobile number portability, switching costs continue to be an important issue in telecommunications markets. On recommendations level, we argue that regulatory and competition policies should continue to reduce uncertainty associated with changing operator by ensuring service and platform compatibility and reducing tariff complexity. In light of our results we recommend tariffs to be non-discriminatory so that operators are unable to utilize network effects in a way which discourages switching behavior...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{competition among}} asymmetric firms {{in three different}} theoretical frameworks. The first study investigates mobile telecommunications, with a strong focus on access charge on <b>off-net</b> <b>calls.</b> Compared to the symmetric cost-based access charge regulation, whilst the asymmetric cost-based access charge regulation facilitates entry, it dampens social welfare if, relative to the incumbent, the new firm is significantly inefficient in cost, distinctly inferior in reputation, and incapable of clearly differentiating its service from the one provided by the established firm. The second study sheds light on a broader framework of infrastructure sharing among telecommunications firms with asymmetric cost structures. Compared to stand-alone investment, co-investment is deemed to be collusive in quality upgrade, and consequently decreases industry output and consumer surplus when infrastructure sharing does not yield a sufficient amount of cost saving. Even though the fully-distributed-cost regulation can stimulate investment in quality upgrade, it undermines incentives to expand consumer bases, leads to price increases, and eventually dampens consumer welfare. The last study captures the competition beyond only one product market where a multi-product firm competes with its single-product rivals by {{using a variety of}} bundling strategies that impact on firms’ incentives for quality enhancement in different ways. The pure-bundling strategy can encourage the multi-product firm to invest in quality enhancement when the associated costs are comparatively low and the additional utility from quality enhancement is relatively high, but it certainly discourages the single-product firms from improving quality. In the mixed-bundling case, this outcome inevitably occurs in the more competitive market, and {{it is likely to be}} found in the less competitive market when the markets are not too different in competition intensity. Therefore, both bundling strategies threaten consumer welfare when the two markets are significantly different in competition intensity due to the negative influence of the market distortions after tying the two markets...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish mobile {{communications}} {{market has}} been facing telecommunication liberalization since 1993. The telecom regulator has implemented many regulations {{in order to ensure}} that competition in the mobile communication market is intense and consumers have various choices of services with fair prices. At the same time, the mobile carriers adapt their strategies in order to sustain profit and growth. An important strategy that the carriers use is customers’ lock-in, or increasing switching costs for customers, by utilizing their network effects. This phenomenon affects the competition in the mobile market. Thus, it is interesting to investigate how the Swedish telecommunication regulator deals with this issue and to examine the impact of regulation that has been implemented by the regulator. To examine the impact of regulation, econometric models as a quantitative research strategy are used together with primary and secondary data from 2003 - 2009. The results of the thesis show that the implementation of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) is not sufficient to reduce switching costs and increase the level of competition. The switching costs remain high for mobile subscribers of the incumbent. The main reason is the existence of termination-based price discrimination, which can create artificial network effects that favor the larger mobile operators. Artificial network effects can distort the effectiveness of MNP since the existing mobile subscribers of larger operators will not switch to other mobile operators due to cheaper average cost of calling. To overcome this problem, the telecom regulator needs to revise the mobile regulations. The thesis recommends a focus on considering bill-and-keep for mobile termination charges. This would possibly result in a more efficient wholesale and retail price structure. The operators will not have an incentive to set different prices between on- and <b>off-net</b> <b>calls</b> if they cannot utilize termination-based price discrimination to create attractiveness for mobile customers. A bill-and-keep scheme can also be used to avoid the bottleneck monopoly problem that usually appears when the calling party pays. It will also eliminate barriers to entry caused by tariff-mediated network effects, and increase competition and welfare in mobile markets in the longer run...|$|R

We discuss implications for regulating access charges as well as on- and off-net price discrimination. Network competition; non-uniform calling patterns; termination charge...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the nineties, interconnection pricing emerged as a high priority regulatory policy question. As more and more state-owned monopolies were privatized, their essential facility (or simply their network) had to be opened to competition. The most viable practice was call-by-call services in telecommunications markets. Entrants were allowed to buy capacity of the incumbent’s network in order to provide service to customers. Because the incumbent always has an incentive to foreclose the market, these agreements between incumbent and entrant were and still are in the focus of regulatory authorities all over the world. Although this so-called one-way interconnection model is still valid, competition between fully fledged networks has become of growing importance. Today cable providers are also capable of offering telecommunication services. However they dispose of a mature network and can bypass the former incumbent’s essential facility. Early models of network competition, such as Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 a) and Armstrong (1998) highlight the collusive role of interconnection charges in these settings. Hence the regulator is called for. The present thesis looks at instruments that can be used to regulate interconnection markets. It is comprised of three papers on access pricing in one-way as well as in twoway interconnection models. Chapter 2 looks at instruments that can be employed by the regulator, chapters 3 and 4 introduce fully decentralized mechanisms, where the role of the regulator is reduced to a minimum. Chapter 2 introduces a one-way interconnection model with a vertically integrated incumbent and an entrant who uses the incumbent network. Firms produce differentiated services and compete for customers. Traditional literature on interconnection pricing uses primarily per-unit access charges, hence the interconnection payment depends on he overall amount of traffic exchanged. In this paper we present a different approach to pricing interconnection. Because products are differentiated, the demand for end service is directly dependent on both firms’ retail prices. We generalize the access payment function and make it solely dependent on market prices. I show that a per-unit access price is a special case of a contract on both firms’ retail prices. Because such a function uses at east two instruments, we are able to reproduce specific access charge rules. Furthermore, due to the increased number of instruments, the set of possible outcomes is increased compared to a per-unit access charge. By comparing different benchmark cases and computing their respective parameters, we show that they can be used as a preliminary measure of goodness of the access mechanism. Additionally, we show that bill & keep, that is providing access free of charge, yields lower retail prices than regulating a per-unit access charge at cost. Chapter 3 uses the findings of chapter 2 and introduces as particular mechanism based on firms’ retail prices. We use the exact same model of industry structure, i. e. a vertically integrated incumbent and an entrant, that uses network capacity as an essential input. Product market competition is imperfect, i. e. products are differentiated. The access pricing mechanism is fully decentralized, i. e. other than setting up the rules of the game, the regulator does not intervene in the market at all. This is a particular strength of our mechanism, since traditional access pricing rules always require the regulator to dispose of almost full market information 1. The access payment mechanism is modeled as a game between the incumbent and the entrant. Each firm determines a parameter in a linear payment function on firms’ downstream retail prices. We show that this results in lower prices and higher welfare than the regulated per-unit access charge approach. Furthermore we present conditions for which the equilibrium in the model coincides with the optimal Ramsey outcome. Chapter 4 draws on the literature pioneered by Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 a), Laffont, Rey, and Tirole (1998 b) and Armstrong (1998). It uses a two-way interconnection model, with network-based price discrimination, i. e. firms charge different prices for their own and the competitor’s network. The paper of Gans and King (2001) shows, that when firms are able to charge two-part tariffs, a per-unit access charge is used as a collusive device. The optimal equilibrium access charge is below marginal cost, hence customers save on <b>off-net</b> <b>calls.</b> However this is more than offset by an increase in the flat payment and overall welfare is reduced as compared to a regime with access priced at marginal cost Using a consumer’s net-utility function we derive a new retail price mechanism. Instead of competing in flat fees, firms offer net-utility levels. In that case, the monthly payment is derived from the equilibrium net-utility level and the gross utility of making calls to both networks. The paper shows that using such a mechanism eliminates the collusive power of access charge is vanished and overall welfare is increased. Since net-utility is a function of the flat payment, the result is reminiscent of the literature on Bertrand and Cournot Competition with substitutes. We employ a graphical argument used in Cheng (1985) to show that competition in net-utility levels is a dominated strategy. The same is true for price competition when prices are complements...|$|R
