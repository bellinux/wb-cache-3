The average absolute error for the 150 compounds is 0. 43 compared to 0. 56 with Jorgensen and Duffy’s computational method, which utilitizes five fitted parameters. Thus, the revised GSE is simpler and provides a more accurate estimation of aqueous solubility of the same set of organic compounds.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ultrasonic}} conditions and physicochemical properties on the synergistic degradation in synthetic solution were investigated. A {{wide range of}} ultrasound frequencies, including 35, 170, 300, 500 and 700 kHz, and ultrasonic power densities, including 11. 3, 22. 5 and 31. 5 W/L were used. It was revealed that the physical effect of ultrasound {{plays a major role}} in synergistic mechanism and 35 kHz was found to be the most effective frequency due to its more vigorous physical effect induced by high implosive energy released from collapse of cavitation bubbles. The highest ultrasonic power density (31. 5 W/L) showed the highest synergy index as it increases the number of cavitation bubbles and the energy released when they collapse. The synergy indexes of various substituted phenols under identical condition were investigated. These results were correlated with physicochemical properties, namely <b>octanol</b> <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Log K-ow), water solubility (S-w), Henry's law constant (K-H) and water diffusivity (D-w). Among these parameters, Log K-ow and D-w were found to have substantial effects on synergy indexes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} of water pollution is the capability of pollutants to concentrate in aquatic organisms. Bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of such chemicals in fish render it unsuitable for human consumption. Bioconcentration of water pollutants through algae, zooplankton and other organisms, can lead to their accumulation through food. chain, with the fish {{at the top of}} the pelagic food web. The occurrence of elevated residue levels of various xenobiotics with increasing trophic level has been demonstrated in a variety of aquatic environments and organisms. The increased bioconcentration occurs with increasing trophic level. The tendency of a chemical to bioconcentrate has been shown to be strongly related to its lipophilicity. Trophic. level differences in bioconcentration are due largely to increased lipid content and decreased chemical elimination efficiency of organisms occupying increasing trophic levels. The accumulation of pollutant is expressed as the bioconcentration factor (BCF), which is determined as the rate of its uptake to the organism and its elimination from it plus the organism growth rate. Chemical uptake efficiency from water, excretion rate, and chemical assimilation efficiency are variable as a function of the <b>octanol.</b> <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Kow) ...|$|E

40|$|Bioaccumulation {{kinetics}} and bioconcentration factors (BCF) of the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) Naphthalene and Anthracene in {{tissues of}} fish Rasbora daniconius were studied in detail using a continuous fed system. The process of bioconcentration is summarized using a first order uptake model. The steady state BCF is calculated {{on the basis}} of exposure of fish to the PAHs for 30 days. The rate of bioaccumulation was found to be maximum of 0. 331 µg g- 1 wet weight for Naphthalene in intestine tissue and 3. 97 µg g- 1 wet weight for Anthracene in liver tissue in case of Rasbora daniconius. The regression coefficient (R 2) between the PAH concentration and exposure time varied between 0. 874 and 0. 959, indicating high correlation.

40|$|Bioaccumulation models predict {{internal}} contaminant concentrations (ci) using ecological, {{chemical and}} physiological parameters. Here we analyse {{the effect of}} uncertainties on these parameters on bioaccumulation model predictions. Simultaneously considering the uncertainties on all these parameters in a bioaccumulation model resulted in uncertainty ranges of ci that increased with the <b>octanol</b> <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> Kow and reached maxima of up to 1. 25 log units for mesozooplankton and up to 1. 45 log units fish at log Kow= 8. A global sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed to rank the contribution of different parameters to the observed uncertainty. The SA demonstrated that this interspecies difference resulted predominantly from uncertain production rates of fish. The Kow, the water concentration and organic carbon–octanol proportionality constant were important drivers of uncertainty on ci for both species. A tissue based risk quotient (RQtissue) combining uncertainty on ci with realistic tissue based effect thresholds indicated that fish were up to 10 times more probable to have RQtissue> 1 than mesozooplankton, depending on the considered threshold value. Conventional exposure based risk quotients were up to 5 times less probable to exceed one than were corresponding RQtissue, and this for both species. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{maternal}} provisioning of yolk to eggs transfers significant {{quantities of}} {{persistent organic pollutants}} (POPs). As yolk utilization progresses via metabolic activity, {{there is a potential}} to realize further increases in POP concentrations if yolk lipids are depleted at a faster rate than POPs, a condition referred to as bioamplification. This study investigated the bioamplification of POPs in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eggs and larvae. Chinook eggs were sampled from the Credit River, ON, Canada, and brought to an aquaculture facility where they were fertilized, incubated, and maintained posthatch until maternally derived lipid reserves became depleted (approximately 168 days). The loss of chemicals having an <b>octanol</b> <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> (log K-OW) greater than 5. 8 was slow to negligible from days 0 - 135. However, during the increase in water temperatures in early spring, K-OW-dependent elimination of POPs was observed. Bioamplification was maximized for the highest log K-OW POPs, with an approximate 5 -fold increase in lipid equivalents concentrations in 168 day old larvae as compared to newly fertilized eggs. This study demonstrates that later yolk-sac Chinook larvae (before exogenous feeding) are exposed to higher lipid equivalents POP concentrations than predicted by maternal deposition, which could lead to underestimates in the toxicity of critical life stages...|$|E
40|$|The {{functioning}} of anaerobic bacteria in river sediments {{is vital for}} the stability of freshwater ecosystems. The sensitivity of these organisms for pollutants is therefore important {{for the establishment of}} valid sediment quality criteria. Acetate is a key intermediate in the carbon cycle and was chosen as a model substrate for the activity of anaerobic bacteria. The effects of pollutant on the anaerobic mineralization of acetate was studied in sediment microcosms. A small amount (0. 7 mug/l) of 14 radioactive C labelled acetate was added to bottles with fresh anaerobic river sediment. The acetate was converted methane and 14 radioactive carbondioxide with a half-life of 0. 2 - 0. 5 hours. Adding a toxicant decreased the mineralization rate of acetate. The IC 10 is defined as the concentration which decreases the mineralization rate of acetate with 10 %. Addition of mercury or zinc did not inhibit the acetate mineralization. Benzene, pentachlorophenol, 1, 2 -dichloroethane and chloroform inhibited the acetate mineralization and showed IC 10 concentrations of 480, 19, 0. 7 and 0. 04 mg/kg sediment respectively. Benzene, 1, 2 -dichloroethane and chloroform are usually considered to be narcotic toxicants and they have a low <b>octanol</b> <b>water</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The high toxicity of 1, 2 -dichloroethane and chloroform shows that these compounds do not exhibit minimum toxicity on bacteria under these conditions but perform a specific mode of action. This indicates that sediment quality criteria solely based on tests with aerobic organisms will not always be sufficient to protect the anaerobic processes in the sediment. ...|$|R

There is a strong linear correlation between log K-SW and the commonly used log K-OW (<b>octanol</b> - <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient)</b> for PAHs, NPAHs, PCBs, and simple aromatics. The log K-OW values for NPAHs range from 2. 78 to 4. 75, and exhibit a general increase in value with increasing molecular weight.

40|$|Empore SDB disks {{have been}} used as a {{receiving}} phase in passive samplers for polar organic compounds. However, there is uncertainty with respect to the duration of integrative sampling of SDB disks. Thus, using chemicals with an <b>octanol</b> <b>water</b> <b>partitioning</b> <b>coefficient</b> (logKow) between 0 and 4, we explored the duration of integrative sampling in short (one week) and long-term experiments (four weeks). Trials were conducted in a channel system (450 L) that receives a constant input of ambient river water at 20 L/h. Water in the channel system was dosed continuously with a cocktail of chemicals (mainly pesticides and pharmaceuticals) to reach aqueous concentrations of 1000 ng/L. At the start of a trial, the channels were filled with 20 SDB disks. During the trials, water was sampled frequently and disks were removed at intervals and extracted. Using LC/MS/MS, spiked compounds were analysed in SDB extracts and in water samples. Sampling time was plotted against concentrations in SDB disks to determine the duration of integrative sampling. Passive sampling of polar compounds with SDB disks is dependent of environmental factors such as the water flow rate. Unfortunately, this dependency cannot simply be corrected for by using the established performance reference compound (PRC) technique: adsorption and desorption are not isokinetic for SDB. For these reasons we explored the possibilities of a surrogate system to adjust passive sampling data for environmental effects: PDMS disks spiked with PRCs in tandem with SDB disks as the sampling phase. First, we established the diffusion parameters and the desorption kinetics of a cocktail of chemicals from PDMS. Second, we used the channels to assess the effect of flow on sampling by SDB disks in tandem with desorption from PDMS disks...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of aquatic food chain bioaccumulation of organic chemicals in contributing to human dose is derived. It is shown that for chemicals with log octanol water partition coefficients greater than about 3, {{the role of}} food chain transfer to fish consumed by humans becomes the more dominant route over drinking water. Modeling of aquatic food chain bioaccumulation then becomes necessary to accurately estimate dose of such chemicals to humans. The relevant time and space scales for groundwater and surface water also indicate a division of organic chemicals at a log <b>octanol</b> <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> of about 3. For chemicals greater than that level, groundwater transport is minimal, while for chemicals with log octanol water coefficients of less than about 3, detention times are long relative to surface water and biodegradation processes become more significant. An illustration is given of modeling the groundwater transport of two organic chemicals (BCEE and benzene) and a metal (chromium) at a Superfund site. The model indicates that after 10 years only a relatively {{small fraction of the}} chemicals had traveled in the groundwater about 300 m to the point of release from the site to surface water. On the other hand, steady state in the adjacent stream and lake is reached rapidly over a distance of 2000 m, illustrating the difference in spatial and temporal scales for the groundwater and surface water. - Environ Health Perspect 103 (Suppl 5) : 53 - 57 (1995...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of organic micropollutants with {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) can influence their transport, degradation and bioavailability. While this has been well established for natural organic carbon, very little is known regarding the influence of DOC {{on the fate of}} micropollutants during wastewater treatment and water recycling. Dissolved organic carbon-water partition coefficients (K(DOC)) for wastewater derived and reference DOC were measured for a range of micropollutants using a depletion method with polydimethylsiloxane disks. For micropollutants with an <b>octanol</b> <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> (log K(ow)) greater than 4 {{there was a significant difference}} in K(DOC) between reference and wastewater derived DOC, with partitioning to wastewater derived DOC over 1000 times lower for the most hydrophobic micropollutants. The {{interaction of}} nonylphenol with wastewater derived DOC from different stages of a wastewater and advanced water treatment train was studied, but little difference in K(DOC) was observed. Organic carbon characterisation revealed that reference and wastewater derived DOC had very different properties due to their different origins. Consequently, the reduced sorption capacity of wastewater derived DOC may be related to their microbial origin which led to reduced aromaticity and lower molecular weight. This study suggests that for hydrophobic micropollutants (log K(ow) > 4) a higher concentration of freely dissolved and thus bioavailable micropollutants is expected in the presence of wastewater derived DOC than predicted using K(DOC) values quantified using reference DOC. The implication is that naturally derived DOC may not be an appropriate surrogate for wastewater derived DOC as a matrix for assessing the fate of micropollutants in engineered systems.

40|$|Phenol and its {{congeners}} {{are known}} to induce caspase- mediated apoptosis activity and cytotoxicity on various cancer cell lines. Apoptosis, scavenging of radicals, antioxidant, and pro-oxidant characteristics are primarily responsible for the antitumor activities of phenolic compounds. Quantitative structure–activity relationship studies on the cellular apoptosis and cytotoxicity of phenolic compounds have been investigated recently by Selassie and colleagues (J Med Chem; 48 : 7234, 2005) wherein models were developed for various carcinogenic cell lines. These quantitative structure –activity relationship models are based on few experimentally obtained physicochemical parameters such as Verloop’s sterimol descriptor, hydrophobicity, Hammett electronic parameter, and <b>octanol.</b> <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient.</b> The paper deals with structure–activity relationships of phenols and its derivatives {{for the development of}} predictive models from the standpoint of theoretical structural parameters and ridge regression methodology. The quantitative structure–activity relationship studies developed here for the caspase- mediated apoptosis activity and cytotoxicity on murine leukemia cell line (L 1210), human promylolytic cell line (HL- 60), human breast cancer cell line (MCF- 7), parenteral human acute lymphoblastic cells (CCRF-CEM), and multidrug-resistant subline of CCRF-resistant to vinblastine (CEM. VLB) cells utilize physicochemical molecular descriptors calculated solely from the structure of phenolic compounds under investigation along with the descriptors used by Selassie and group. It is seen that such quantitative structure–activity relationships can provide a better quality predictive model for the phenolic compounds. The biological activities of the nine sets of phenolic compounds have been calculated based on ridge regression analysis that clearly gives a better significant correlation compared to the activities predicted by Selassie and co-workers. Counter-propagation arti- ficial neural network studies have been introduced in the present investigation for a better understanding of multidimensional rational patterns in more complex data sets. The counter-propagation artificial neural network studies were performed on the same data set and with the same descriptors as have been carried out in developing ridge regression models and the result of counter-propagation neural network models produces very interesting findings in terms of leave-one-out test. Finally, an attempt has been made for a comparative study of the relative effectiveness of linear statistical methods versus nonlinear techniques, such as counter-propagation neural networks in modeling structure–activity studies of the phenolic compounds. ...|$|E

To evaluate the fate of MTBE in the environment it is necessary to investigate how it interacts with other co-contaminants.   The determination of interactions is crucial to assessing environmental damage.   Using the biosensor response and a model it was possible to investigate the nature of interactions.   For MTBE:benzene mixtures, there was no increase in combined toxicity to E. coli DH 1 and P. fluorescens 10586 r.   E. coli HB 101 response had a different pattern and for low concentrations of MTBE:benzene synergistic interactions were observed.   For MTBE:naphthalene, overall, the effect was additive.   The toxicity of petrol containing MTBE was assessed since this is the major source of introducing MTBE in the environment.   MTBE did not change the toxicity of petrol to the receptor tested.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the criteria governing lymphatic absorption of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract may lead to selective uptake of drugs via this route. Lymphatic absorption may have potential advantages over the portal absorption of drugs; first pass elimination may be avoided as the drug reaches the systemic circulation before it reaches the liver, the absorption of some poorly absorbed drugs may be improved and it may provide a means of targeting anticancer agents directly to the lymphatics. In the present study, the lymphatic uptake {{of a series of}} retinoids was investigated after oral administration. The most important factors which were found to affect lymphatic absorption were, the chemical nature of the compound {{and the nature of the}} oily vehicle in which the retinoid was administered. It was found that the greater the lipophilicity of the retinoid, (as defined by the logarithm of its <b>octanol</b> : <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient,</b> log. P), the greater was its lymphatic absorption. Temarotene, Ro 15 - 0778, (log. P = 8. 7) exhibited a maximum dose adjusted lymphatic absorption rate of 4100 ng/h compared with the less lipophilic Ro 04 - 3780 (log. P = 6. 8) which showed a maximum rate of only 150 ng/h. The oily vehicle in which the retinoid was orally administered strongly influenced the rate of absorption via the lymphatic route. Ro 04 - 3780 demonstrated a 150 fold difference between the selected oils giving the maximum and the minimum lymphatic absorption rate. The best oils in this role appeared to be those in which the retinoid showed the least solubility. Mesenteric lymph flow rate was also shown to vary depending upon the oil. Basal lymph flow rate in the fasted rat, after dosing with saline, was 1. 6 m 1 /h/kg. Cottonseed oil and soyabean oil promoted an increase in this flow rate to greater than 3. 0 ml/h/kg (p < 0. 01) when orally administered with Ro 04 - 3780. Conversely, linoleic acid suppressed the mean lymph flow rate to 0. 8 ml/h/kg (p < 0. 01) after oral administration with Ro 04 - 3780. Lymph turbidity was evaluated as an indication of chylomicron formation and transport in the lymph. Since the chylomicron is the particle in which dietary fats enter the lymphatic system, it was thought that lipophilic drugs, which are soluble in dietary lipid, may be carried into the lymphatic system via this pathway. The mixed long chain fatty tri-acyl glycerol oils, cotton seed oil, soyabean oil and peanut oil, when orally dosed to rats, produced the most turbid lymph (25 - 48 times greater than the turbidity produced after an oral dose of saline). These type of oil also promoted the highest lymphatic uptake rate for the retinoids. Other oils including, oleic acid, linoleic acid and MTS (a Miglyol S 12 based self-emulsifying oil system), demonstrated much wider ranging extents of lymphatic absorption, but produced lymph with similar but lower turbidity (10 - 12 times greater than the turbidity produced after an oral dose of saline).

One tool used for estimated the potential impact of PPCPs in the environment is the life cycle assessment (LCA). PPCPs are being increasingly included in LCAs since they have evidenced ecological and human adverse effects and due to their presence in different environmental compartments, wastewater facilities and industry. In environmental LCAs, CFs (alternatively referred to as equivalency factors) are used to determine the relative importance of a substance to toxicity related impact categories, such as human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity (Huijbregts et al. 2005 a). In this sense, the USEtoxTM model is a powerful tool to calculate CFs. It is an environmental model for characterization of human and ecotoxicological impacts in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and comparative risk assessment (Huijbregts et al., 2010 a). Despite the large number of substances which have been considered in the USEtoxTM database (more than 3000 in the USEtoxTM organic database 1. 01) a small amount of PPCPs have been considered (approximately less than 2 % of the organic database corresponds to this group of compounds). Accordingly, the CFs of many PPCPs have not been calculated. Therefore, the main goal of this research was to estimate CFs of 27 PPCPs widely used worldwide for incorporating these values in LCIA studies or to generate impact score rankings. USEtoxTM software was used for estimating CFs. Methodological procedure and main equations of the concept and model of USEtoxTM of human toxicity and ecotoxicity are widely explained in the literature (Huijbregts et al. (2005 b); Huijbregts et al. (2010 a); Huijbregts et al. (2010 b); Rosenbaum et al. (2008)). An impact score ranking was done for 49 PPCPs using the new CFs calculated and the CFs already available and besides the data of PPCPs occurrence in the environment in Spain from a previously study (Ortiz et al., 2013). Physicochemical properties, degradation rates, bioaccumulation, ecotoxicity and human health effects were collected from experimental data, recognized databases or estimated by EPI SuiteTM. PPCPs from 14 different therapeutic classes have been considered in this study: analgesic/antipyretic, Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blockers, antibiotics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, anxiolytics, blood lipid regulators, cytostatics/cancer therapeutic, H 2 blocker, hormones, Platelet inhibitor, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) /antirreumatics, X-ray contrast media and PCPs. The input parameters that must be supplied by the user for the USEtoxTM program were: molecular weight (MW), <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> between <b>octanol</b> and <b>water</b> (Kow), <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> between organic carbon and water (Koc), Henry law coefficient at 25 ºC (KH), vapor pressure at 25 ºC (Pvap), solubility at 25 ºC (Sol), degradation rate in air (KdegA), degradation rate in water (KdegW), bioaccumulation factor of the chemical (BAF), water ecotoxicity (chronic and acute) and human carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects. There is still lack of experimental data of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects of PPCPs to predict these effects on humans. In ecotoxicology more efforts should be made to know chronic effects and PPCPs mixture effects on different organisms and trophic levels. With these values, the CFs calculation will be more adjusted to reality. Emission to continental freshwater compartment showed the highest CFs for human effects (ranging on 10 - 9 to 10 - 3), following by air (10 - 9 to 10 - 5), soil (10 - 11 to 10 - 5) and sea water (10 - 12 to 10 - 4). These results indicate the relative order of importance of different PPCP emissions and to what grade (magnitude) can affect the human health, being the drug emission to continental freshwater the most important compartment. CFs of the affectation of freshwater aquatic environments were the highest from emission to continental freshwater (between 1 to 104) due to the direct contact between the source of emission and the compartment affected, followed by soil (among 10 - 1 to 104), air (among 10 - 2 to 104) and the lowest were continental sea water CFs (among 10 - 28 to 10 - 3). CFs of continental sea water as emission source are the lowest, probably by the difficulty in the inter-compartment transfer (continental sea water to continental fresh water) and therefore, the low bioavailability of the compounds in fresh water from sea water. Freshwater aquatic ecotoxicological CFs are much higher than human toxicity CFs due to the low tolerance of aquatic organisms to these compounds and the persistence of them in this media, which involves that ecological impact of PPCPs in aquatic environment is a matter of urgent attention. PPCPs with the highest impact scores are hormones, antidepressants, fragrances, antibiotics, angiotensin receptor blockers and blood lipid regulators, which have been already found in other ranking scores. In this study most antibiotics are located in the top 20 of the ecotoxicity impact score and for human toxicity impact score azithromycin and levofloxacin are in the top 10. Although {{it is not surprising that}} some of the compounds studied in this research occupy the top ranking (by previous researches) even their CFs was not known. The estimation of new CFs should be continued, either for compounds that are already marketed as for the new ones. These results, not available until now, are useful to do better LCIAs incorporating these pollutants in these studies or for assessing single hazard/risk environmental impact assessments.

40|$|The {{majority}} of organic pollutants, after their dispersion in water then their ingestion, {{have a strong}} tendency to accumulate in greases. That {{is due to the}} hydrophobic character of these molecules. To have an idea on the capacity of a substance to accumulate in the alive beings according to their lipidic mass, the modeling of the pollutant behaviour was made by considering its <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> between n-octanol (representing the lipidic mass) and water. Its knowledge represents a very significant information for the petrochemical and the pharmaceutical industries. To dissipate any doubt about confidence concerning the obtained results, it is considered useful to check the effectiveness of UNIFAC method on the monomethylbenzoïc acid such as, for example, the 3 -methylbenzoïc acid whose n-octanol – <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficient</b> is already listed in the literature.

The permeability constants obtained for the dyes were compared with octanol/water and skin membrane/ <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The compounds examined were: p-phenylenediamine, o-phenylenediamine, 2 -ni- tro-p-phenylenediamine, 2 -amino- 4 -nitrophenol, 4 - chloro-m-phenylenediamine, and 4 -amino- 2 -nitro- phenol. Skin absorption of the dyes was observed when they were applied in an aqueous solution.

The determination of the partitioning of the hair dyes between water and either stratum corneum or epidermis was more complex. Preliminary stratum corneum/water partition studies resulted in values that were in the reverse order of skin permeation. When binding of the compounds to components of the membrane was saturated, the partition values more closely duplicated the rank order of permeability of the dyes.

40|$|The use of {{solid-phase}} microextraction with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) -coated {{glass fibers}} for the extraction {{and analysis of}} hydrophobic organic analytes is increasing. The literature on this topic is characterized by large discrepancies in <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> and an uncertainty of whether highly hydrophobic analytes are retained by absorption into the fiber coating or by adsorption to the fiber surface. We applied a new method, which minimizes the impact of experimental artifacts, to determine PDMS <b>water</b> <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 17 hydrophobic analytes including chlorinated benzenes, PCBs, PAHs, and p,p′-DDE. These <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> are several orders of magnitude higher than some reported values. Two observations strongly suggest that the retention of hydrophobic organic substances is governed by partitioning into the PDMS coating. (1) The <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients</b> are proportional with octanol/water <b>partition</b> <b>coefficients.</b> (2) The fluorescence of fluoranthene was observed to be homogeneously distributed within the polymer coating when studied by means of fluorescence microscopy.
