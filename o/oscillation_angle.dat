To break up these compacted soil layers using small tractors a deep working oscillatory ripper was developed at the University of South Australia which had two deep working oscillating tines. One of the most important factors for the performance of this oscillatory ripper is the <b>oscillation</b> <b>angle</b> of the tines. To find the optimum <b>oscillation</b> <b>angle</b> a series of field tests were conducted in a sand-loam soil at six different oscillation angles. The tines oscillated at a frequency of 4. 9 Hz and with amplitudes of between ± 60 and 69 mm, with a nominal forward speed of 3 km/h. The trial results were quantified as draft requirement, power saving, power ratio, loosened area and amount of vibration on tractor seat. The greatest draft reduction of 50 % was achieved for negative oscillation angles, where power ratio was less than 1. Power saving was significantly affected by changing <b>oscillation</b> <b>angle.</b> In general, vibration of the driver seat was higher for negative angles. In terms of performance − 22. 5 ° <b>oscillation</b> <b>angle</b> was the optimum for draft reduction and power saving, whereas the least vibration was obtained at an <b>oscillation</b> <b>angle</b> of + 16 ° which was equal to Australian Standard threshold for 8 h continuous work. ...|$|E

For a given disorder in the natural frequencies two different transitions to synchronization are found. For strong natural angle disorder, the two transitions to phase and polarization synchronization are well separated, and we developed an approximated theory to estimate the phase and polarization order parameters.

40|$|Ultracold atoms {{provide a}} {{powerful}} tool for studying quantum control of interacting many-body systems with well-characterized and controllable Hamiltonians. In this thesis, we demonstrate quantum control of a many-body system consisting of a ferromagnetic spin- 1 Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). By tuning the Hamiltonian of the system, we can generate either a phase space with an unstable hyperbolic fixed point or a phase space with an elliptical fixed point. A classical pendulum with a stable oscillation about the "down" position and an inverted pendulum with unstable non-equilibrium dynamics about the "up" position are classical analogs of the quantum spin dynamics we investigate in this thesis. In one experiment, we dynamically stabilize the system about an unstable hyperbolic fixed point, which is similar to stabilizing an inverted pendulum. In a second experiment, we parametrically excite the system by modulating the quadratic Zeeman energy. In addition, we demonstrate rectifier phase control as a new method to manipulate the quantum states of the many-body system. This is similar to parametric excitation and manipulation of the <b>oscillation</b> <b>angle</b> of a classical pendulum.

Together then with the theta-angle in the QCD action, there are in all 7 real unknown parameters.

The anti-phase regime always exists and is stable under variation of the system parameters. The in-phase regime may exist and be stable, exist and be unstable, or not exist at all depending on parameter values.

Two reactors of {{a nuclear power plant}} at the French Chooz village provide a source of electron antineutrinos, whose ux is measured with a near and far detector. While the far detector is sensitive to neutrino oscillation, the near detector minimizes different systematic errors. In spring 2011 the far detector will start collecting data, while the near detector will follow roughly 18 months later. For the sensitivity of the experiment it is crucial to minimize the systematic error. Therefore, knowledge on background events is important. In this thesis the different sources of background are characterized and the eciency of various rejection techniques is investigated. Furthermore, different options to determine the background rate from the experimental data are analyzed. The inuence of different background rates on the sensitivity of Double Chooz is calculated. Another central aspect of this thesis is the directional reconstruction of neutrino events. It is demonstrated that the direction of the two reactors can be resolved with neutrino events within the rst few months.

We analyze the new contributions arising through the exchange of the vectorlike families of ESSM to radiative processes including τ → µγ, µ → eγ, b → sγ, EDM of the muon and the muon (g − 2). We show that ESSM makes significant contributions especially to the decays τ → µγ and µ → eγ and simultaneously to muon (g − 2). For a large and plausible range of relevant parameters, we obtain: a ESSM µ ≈ +(10 − 40) × 10 − 10, with a correlated prediction that τ → µγ should be discovered with an improvement in its current limit by a factor of 3 - 20. The implications for µ → eγ are very similar. The muon EDM is within reach of the next generation experiments.
