2500|$|Power {{plants on}} Maui and the Big Island {{automatically}} shut off power to prevent damage, and generators tripped on Oahu, causing overloads in the electrical grid. [...] The Oahu power outages lasted 14 hours in some locations; {{only half of}} Hawaiian Electric Company's (HECO) Oahu customers had power restored before 9 pm, while outages generally lasted to about 5 pm on Maui and Hawaii. Power was restored to all HECO circuits by 1:55 am; however, there were isolated blackouts due to local problems, such as blown fuses. Power in Laie and Kahuku was not restored until 3 am. [...] In Honolulu and Kahe, HECO generators shut down, and <b>other</b> <b>generators</b> tried to compensate, resulting in uneven loads on Oahu's electrical network and causing the system to shut down to prevent damage.|$|E
