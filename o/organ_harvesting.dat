5|$|Ethan Gutmann, citing Falun Gong {{allegations}} that Liaoning was {{the epicenter of}} <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from practitioners while Bo was governor, suggested {{that he may have}} used his involvement as a way of building up his political power. David Kilgour, who co-wrote the Kilgour–Matas report on <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting,</b> accused Bo of playing a role. Separately, Falun Gong practitioners abroad filed over ten lawsuits against Bo alleging torture and crimes against humanity In 2009, a Spanish court indicted Bo Xilai and four other officials for genocide against Falun Gong.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, in May 2006, The Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong asked David Kilgour {{as well as}} Canadian {{human rights}} lawyer David Matas to {{investigate}} the broader allegations of <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong adherents in China. Kilgour and Matas agreed to investigate.|$|E
5|$|China has had {{an organ}} {{transplantation}} programme since the 1960s. It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations.|$|E

25|$|In December 2006, the Australian Ministry of Health {{revealed}} {{that two of}} the country’s major organ transplant hospitals had banned training of Chinese surgeons, in response to concerns about <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners. On 21 March 2013, the Australian Senate unanimously passed a motion concerning reports of <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> in China. The motion, which was introduced one day after a parliamentary briefing on the subject of <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong prisoners, called on Australia to adopt strict standards to address the practice of international organ trafficking. The same year, Green party lawmakers in New South Wales, Australia, proposed legislation to criminalize and create specific offenses related to trafficking in human organs and tissue.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the Chinese {{embassy in}} Canada intervened {{to cancel the}} {{broadcast}} of a documentary on Falun Gong and <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting,</b> which was scheduled to air on the national broadcast network CBC Television.

5000|$|In a 2016 report, David Kilgour {{found that}} he had underestimated.

Media outlets have extrapolated from this study a death toll of 1,500,000. Ethan Gutmann estimated from this update that 60,000 to 110,000 <b>organs</b> are <b>harvested</b> in China annually noting it is (paraphrasing): [...] "difficult but plausible to <b>harvest</b> 3 <b>organs</b> from a single body" [...] and also calls the harvest [...] "a new form of genocide using the most respected members of society." ...|$|R
25|$|Representatives of the U.S. State Department were {{dispatched}} to the Sujiatun hospital to investigate the claims. They were given {{a tour of the}} facilities and found no evidence to prove the allegations were true, but said they remained concerned over China’s treatment of Falun Gong and the reports of <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting.</b> Soon thereafter, in May 2006, the Coalition to Investigate the Persecution of Falun Gong asked former Canadian parliamentarian David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas to investigate the broader allegations of <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong practitioners in China. Kilgour and Matas agreed to conduct an investigation as volunteers.|$|E
25|$|The European Parliament heard {{testimony}} about <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> in China during a 6 December 2012 session {{on human rights}} in China. One year later, it passed a resolution expressing “deep concern over the persistent and credible reports of systematic, state-sanctioned <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from non-consenting prisoners of conscience in the People’s Republic of China, including from large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners imprisoned for their religious beliefs, {{as well as from}} members of other religious and ethnic minority groups.” The resolution called for the immediate release of all prisoners of conscience, and urged Chinese authorities to respond to United Nations inquiries about the source of organs used in transplants. In March 2014, the European Economic and Social Committee in Brussels convened a follow-up event on organ transplant abuses in China. Participants and speakers at the session endorsed the recommendations of the parliamentary resolution, which recognized that Falun Gong and other minority groups are targets of forced <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> in China. EESC President Henri Malosse called for greater pressure to be put on the Chinese government to end organ transplant abuses.|$|E
25|$|Several {{national}} governments have held hearings in their national legislatures regarding <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong practitioners, {{with some of}} them subsequently adopting resolutions condemning organ transplant abuses in China or developing legislation to ban transplant tourism.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, {{criminal}} {{organizations have}} engaged in kidnapping of people, especially children and teens, who are murdered and their <b>organs</b> <b>harvested</b> for profit. In 2014 an alleged member of the Mexican Knights Templar cartel was arrested for the kidnapping and deaths of minors, after children were found wrapped in blankets and stuffed in a refrigerated container inside a van.|$|R
50|$|The illegal organ {{trade has}} at times led to murder for body parts, {{because of a}} {{worldwide}} demand of organs for transplant and organ donors. At times, criminal organizations have engaged in kidnapping people, especially children and teens, with the victims being killed and their <b>organs</b> <b>harvested</b> for the illegal organ trade. The extent is unknown, and non-fatal organ theft and removal is more widely reported than murder.|$|R

25|$|Allegations about <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong led to renewed {{focus on}} China’s {{transplant}} practices by international medical authorities and professional associations. Medical professionals have raised {{a number of}} concerns stemming {{from the use of}} prisoner organs, and have debated the ethics of conducting exchanges with Chinese transplant hospitals.|$|E
25|$|Similar bills against organ tourism {{have been}} {{proposed}} in the French national assembly (2010) and in Canadian parliament (2007, 2013). The government of Canada has also {{raised the issue of}} <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong practitioners at the United Nations during the Universal Periodic Review process in 2014.|$|E
25|$|Now {{monetary}} {{compensation for}} organ donors is being legalized in Australia, and strictly {{only in the}} case of kidney transplant {{in the case of}} Singapore (minimal reimbursement is offered in the case of other forms of <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> by Singapore). Kidney disease organizations in both countries have expressed their support.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{they note}} that {{during this period of}} rapid {{expansion}} in China’s organ transplant industry, there were no significant improvements to the voluntary organ donation or allocation system, and the supply of death row inmates as donors also did not increase. Although it does not prove the allegations, the parallel between rapid growth in organ transplants and the mass imprisonment of Falun Gong practitioners is consistent with the hypothesis that Falun Gong practitioners in custody were having their <b>organs</b> <b>harvested.</b>|$|R

25|$|In 2016, the {{researchers}} published a joint update to their findings {{showing that the}} number of organ transplants conducted in China is much higher than previously believed, and that the death from illicit <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> could be as high as 1,500,000. The 789-page report is based on an analysis of records from hundreds of Chinese transplant hospitals.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005 and November 2006, China's Deputy Health Minister {{acknowledged}} {{that the practice of}} removing organs from executed prisoners for transplants was widespread. However, Chinese officials deny that Falun Gong practitioners' organs are <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting,</b> and insist that China abides by World Health Organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors.|$|E
40|$|Organ transplants {{may offer}} the best hope of long term {{survival}} for individuals afflicted with certain cancers or other debilitating diseases. The hope that a transplant may inspire in an organ recipient should not, however; be the determinative factor when the proposed source of the organ is incompetent. Competent adults are not compelled to act altruistically by undergoing a surgical invasion {{for the benefit of}} third parties. Children and mentally incompetent adults should likewise be protected from such compelled altruism. Case by case adjudication of petitions to <b>harvest</b> <b>organs</b> from incompetents are inevitably driVen by a concern for the recipient and an unwarranted deference to parental authority, and not by concerns for the autonomy and well being,of the incompetent donor. This Note argues that <b>organ</b> <b>harvests</b> from legal incompetents should be statutorily prohibited...|$|R

25|$|The first {{allegations}} of large-scale <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong practitioners {{were made in}} March 2006 by three individuals claiming knowledge of involuntary organ extractions at the Sujiatun Thrombosis Hospital in Shenyang, Liaoning province.

25|$|The Chinese {{government}} has consistently denied the allegations. However, the perceived failure of Chinese authorities to effectively address or refute the charges has drawn attention and public condemnation from some governments, international organizations and medical societies. The parliaments of Canada and the European Union, {{as well as}} the Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, have adopted resolutions condemning <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. United Nations Special Rapporteurs have called on the Chinese government to account for the sources of organs used in transplant practices, and the World Medical Association, the American Society of Transplantation and the Transplantation Society have called for sanctions on Chinese medical authorities. Several countries have also taken or considered measures to deter their citizens from travelling to China for the purpose of obtaining organs. A documentary on <b>organ</b> <b>harvesting</b> from Falun Gong practitioners, Human Harvest, received a 2014 Peabody Award recognizing excellence in broadcast journalism.|$|E
