25|$|In the United States, {{particularly}} in New York City where qualifying {{children as young}} as 4 are enrolled in enriched kindergarten classes offered by the public schools, a test preparation industry has grown up which closely monitors the nature of tests given to prospective students <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> talented programs. This can result in admission of significant numbers of students into programs who lack superior natural intellectual talent and exclusion of naturally talented students who did not participate in test preparation or lacked the resources to do so.|$|E

2500|$|Separate or {{independent}} schools are schools with a primary mission {{to serve the}} needs of the academically gifted.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{examined}} the parental styles and psychosocial adjustment of adolescents {{and the relationship between}} them in gifted adolescents compared to normal adolescents. Four scales – The Parental Authority Questionnaire, Child Attitude Toward Parents, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale – were administered to 118 <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> 115 normal adolescents in Amol city. The results indicate that parents <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> adolescents tend to be more authoritative and less authoritarian than parents of normal adolescents. The attitudes <b>of</b> the <b>gifted</b> adolescents towards their parents were more positive than those of the normal adolescents. The gifted adolescents displayed a higher self-concept and fewer psychological reactions (depression, anxiety and stress) than the normal adolescents. The authoritative parenting style correlates positively with the psychological adjustment <b>of</b> both <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> normal adolescents, while the authoritarian parenting style impacts negatively on the psychosocial adjustment <b>of</b> the <b>gifted</b> adolescents but not that of the normal adolescents. The study results indicate that the authoritarian parenting style is a crucial factor that influences the well-being <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> children <b>and</b> may affect their mental health...|$|R

40|$|There is {{considerable}} diversity among <b>gifted</b> programs <b>and</b> program availability in the United States. This {{is at least}} in part {{due to the fact that}} there is no national mandate for gifted programming, despite the existence of the Javitts Act. Instead, decisions about gifted programming are left up to the individual states, which may then choose to allow individual counties or districts to set their own standards. This in turn creates a situation in which parents <b>and</b> teachers <b>of</b> the <b>gifted</b> have no ready access to information about the type <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> programming options available in their area. Many of them seek assistance through national organizations such as the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented (NRC/GT), which are not equipped to help them. Thus, a descriptive study of the locations <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> programs <b>and</b> the age ranges they serve will be a useful resource for parents <b>and</b> teachers <b>of</b> the <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> will lay the foundation for future research into the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> programming across regions and settings...|$|R
