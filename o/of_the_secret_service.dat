5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} McClory again {{started working on}} a project to bring a Thunderball {{adaptation}} to production and, with the working title Warhead (a.k.a. James Bond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service)</b> he brought writer Len Deighton together with Sean Connery {{to work on a}} script. The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the Thunderball novel only, and once again the project was deferred. Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name James Bond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> but then producer Jack Schwartzman became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory.|$|E
5|$|As Steinhauer {{noted in}} his autobiography, the UK was a {{dangerous}} environment for a foreign agent. Only five years previously, the country {{had not had a}} dedicated counter-espionage organisation. In 1909 a series of spy scares fanned by the press led to the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> Bureau, jointly headed by Captain Vernon Kell and Lieutenant-Commander Mansfield Cumming. They soon split their responsibilities; Kell took charge of counter-espionage, while Cumming focused on foreign intelligence. These two divisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> Bureau eventually became two independent intelligence agencies, MI5 and MI6. The Bureau quickly identified a list of possible German agents in the UK. Just before the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, Chief Constables across Britain and Ireland were instructed to arrest suspects in their areas. This was done quickly and a number of German agents were caught, crippling German intelligence operations in the UK at a crucial moment in the war. Steinhauer himself had been lucky to escape arrest; he was known by name to the British authorities and he had been spying on the Royal Navy in Scotland as recently as late June 1914.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{characters}} from earlier games in the franchise - both members of the Third Street Saints and former adversaries - make a return in Saints Row IV, many of whom take up the protagonist's Presidential administration. Kinzie Kensington, the socially awkward FBI hacker from Saints Row: The Third becomes the White House's press secretary, often tasked with clearing up the mess {{left behind by the}} President's verbal missteps. Benjamin King, former leader of the Vice Kings gang from the original Saints Row, becomes the President's Chief of Staff, while Pierce Washington has been appointed the Communications Director and Shaundi as the Director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} James Bond's final {{confrontation}} with Ernst Stavro Blofeld, {{while on a}} mission in Japan, a man claiming to be Bond appears in London and demands to meet the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> M. Bond's identity is confirmed, but during his debriefing interview with M, Bond tries to kill him with a cyanide pistol; the attempt fails. The Service learns that after destroying Blofeld's castle in Japan, Bond suffered a head injury and developed amnesia. Having lived as a Japanese fisherman for several months, Bond travelled into the Soviet Union to learn his true identity. While there, he was brainwashed and assigned to kill M upon returning to England.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez {{pleaded guilty}} to one count of {{property}} destruction and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence, thereby avoiding the charge of attempting to assassinate the President. In March 2014, {{he was sentenced to}} 25 years' imprisonment. In September 2014, The Washington Post published an investigative report detailing errors that the Secret Service made {{on the night of the}} shooting that led to the crime going undiscovered. A House of Representatives hearing followed and Julia Pierson, director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> resigned the following week. It was the first shooting at the White House since Francisco Martin Duran's attempted assassination of President Bill Clinton in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the 1960s setting <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> Derek Meddings and the {{technicians}} {{of the special}} effects department received few commissions for scale models of vehicles that appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1958 Fleming and his friend, Ivar Bryce, {{began talking}} about the {{possibility}} of a Bond film. Later that year, Bryce introduced Fleming to a young Irish writer and director, Kevin McClory, and the three of them, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, formed the partnership Xanadu Productions, named after Bryce's Bahamian home, but which was never actually formed into a company. In May 1959 Fleming, Bryce, Cuneo and McClory met first at Bryce's Essex house and then in McClory's London home as they came up with a story outline which was based on an aeroplane full of celebrities and a female lead called Fatima Blush. McClory was fascinated by the underwater world and wanted to make a film that included it. Over the next few months, as the story changed, there were ten outlines, treatments and scripts. Numerous titles were proposed for these works, including SPECTRE, James Bond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> and Longitude 78 West.|$|E
5|$|M {{is another}} {{character}} {{who is more}} fully realised {{than in the previous}} novels, {{and for the first time}} in the series he is shown outside a work setting at the Blades club. It is never explained how he received or could afford his membership of the club, which had a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen, all of whom had to show £100,000 in cash or gilt-edged securities. Amis, in his study The James Bond Dossier, considers that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling; Amis points out that in the 1963 book On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay as head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service</b> is £6,500 a year.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 White House {{shooting}} {{occurred on}} November 11, 2011, when Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez, an unemployed 21-year-old man, fired a semi-automatic rifle at the White House, the official {{residence of the}} U.S. President in Washington, D.C. At least seven bullets hit the second floor. Neither the president nor First Lady Michelle Obama were home at the time, although their youngest daughter, Sasha, and the first lady's mother, Marian Shields Robinson, were. No one was injured. It took four days for the Secret Service to realize that bullets had struck the White House. Michelle Obama learned of the shooting from an usher, then summoned Mark J. Sullivan, director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Secret</b> <b>Service,</b> {{to find out why}} the first family had not been informed.|$|E

Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked Tom Mankiewicz, who had rewritten Diamonds Are Forever, to work on the script; however, Mankiewicz declined as he felt he was under a moral obligation to Cubby Broccoli. Connery then hired British television writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.|$|E
