5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, construction of the motorway was further postponed because of onset of the Croatian War of Independence. The decade saw renewed discussion regarding construction of the motorway, including renewed considerations of its route. Soon, the originally devised route running through Bihać was set aside and two new routes were considered: One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> modified version of the original route, bypassing Bihać and running through the Plitvice Lakes region while the other was a completely new route further to the west via Gospić and Zadar, which was eventually accepted for construction. Both of the alternative routes proposed that the Zagreb–Karlovac motorway already completed in 1972 were to be used as the northernmost section of the Zagreb–Split and Zagreb–Rijeka motorways.|$|E
5|$|The 1925 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was an inactive Atlantic {{hurricane season}} during which four tropical cyclones formed. Only one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> hurricane. The first storm developed on August18, {{and the last}} dissipated on December1. The season began at a late date, {{more than two months}} after the season began. The official start of the season is generally considered to be June1 with the end being October31; however, the final storm of the season formed nearly a month after the official end. Due to increased activity over the following decades, the official end of the hurricane season was shifted to November30.|$|E
5|$|The trial resumed on March 4, 2013 with testimonies from expert {{witnesses}} {{in the fields of}} criminal psychology (Tereza Soukupová, appointed by the court) and psychiatry (Alena Gayová, appointed by the defense). Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person, even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence. The two {{expert witnesses}} agreed that Blythe is not aggressive; nevertheless, he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress. The court further heard testimonies from two eyewitnesses. One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall. He testified that when by the exit, he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air. He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage. The ambulance arrived 5–10 minutes later.|$|E

Ruler3 is depicted on the 8th-century AltarQ, but his name glyph has broken away. KuIx was the 4thruler in the succession.

Although this king is also mentioned on a few other fragments of sculpture, no dates accompany his name. The next two kings in the dynastic sequence are only known from their sculptures on AltarQ.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{held its}} {{training}} camp at Bowling Green University, {{as it did}} the year before. The Browns played one preseason game in late August against the Baltimore Colts, a new AAFC team formed to replace the Miami Seahawks after the Seahawks folded. The Browns scored their first points on a drive in the second period. A 14-yard run by fullback Marion Motley set up a 25-yard touchdown throw by quarterback Otto Graham to end Mac Speedie. Cleveland scored three more touchdowns in the game, all of them following Colts passes the Browns intercepted. One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> pass by Graham to end Dante Lavelli in the third quarter, and another was a rush by halfback Edgar Jones. Paul Brown pulled most of the Browns' starters from the game as the team built up a three-touchdown lead. Backup end Bob Cowan scored a fourth Cleveland touchdown in the final quarter on a pass from backup quarterback Ermal Allen, and the Browns won 28–0. Following the victory, the Browns faced the Buffalo Bills in the regular-season opener at Cleveland Stadium to begin their defense of the AAFC championship.|$|E

25|$|The {{first public}} school {{teachers}} of Dipolog, during this time, came also from Bohol, particularly Maribojoc and other towns. Most were only elementary graduates. But they were well-educated by the American soldier-teachers in Bohol. One <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> certain Felisa Ruaya who taught at the American-established schools in Dipolog. She lived first near the beach in Punta Coro. Then she married an Adriatico, a native of Polanco. Because the inhabitants converted to Christianity, it cannot be determined {{whether or not the}} residents were of Subanen heritage. Felisa Ruaya was the mother of former Zamboanga del Norte vice governor Concordio Ruaya Adriatico.|$|E

According to the Library of Congress, the book was a valuable guide to California for prospective settlers that includes a survey of agriculture, hints on gold mining, a guide to San Francisco, and a chapter on California's Hispanic residents and Native American tribes.|$|E
25|$|King Mohammed VI customarily pardons {{large numbers}} of convicted prisoners on {{national}} holidays. In 2009 he pardonned as much as 24,865 of Morocco's ~60,000 inmate's population. In 2005 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the country's independence, he pardoned 10,000 convicts, among-which 336 foreigners (one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> convicted French pedophile as a Wikileaks cable would reveal). As he was celebrating the 14th-anniversary of his enthronement on 30 July 2013, he issued a pardon for 1200 inmates. The MAP—Morocco's state news agency—released a statement declaring that among the pardoned figured 48 Spanish prisoners, which were released as a gesture demonstrating the good relations between the Mohammed VI and King Juan Carlos of Spain who had just visited the country a week earlier.|$|E

25|$|The early {{efforts at}} news sheets and {{periodicals}} were spotty. Roger L'Estrange produced both The News and City Mercury, but neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sustained effort. Henry Muddiman {{was the first}} to succeed in a regular news paper with the London Gazette. In 1665, Muddiman produced the Oxford Gazette as a digest of news of the royal court, which was in Oxford to avoid the plague in London. When the court moved back to Whitehall later in the year, the title London Gazette was adopted (and is still in use today). Muddiman had begun as a journalist in the Interregnum and had been the official journalist of the Long Parliament (in the form of The Parliamentary Intelligencer). Although Muddiman's productions are the first regular news accounts, they are still not the first modern newspaper, as the work was sent in manuscript by post to subscribers and was not a printed sheet for general sale to the public. That had to wait for The Athenian Mercury.|$|E
25|$|After the {{two large}} freight ships were {{completed}} the workload went down. There were no new orders for new ships or rolling stock.

The {{other one was}} for completing a semi-finished icebreaker, which had been started at Boecker & Co. shipyard in Tallinn. The Finnish state needed new icebreakers to ensure year-round access to its harbours, and had purchased the hull via John Nurminen company. The icebreaker was named Voima and completed and {{handed over to the}} state in 1924. The project was challenging, but the outcome was excellent; it demonstated the company's capability to undertake demanding projects. However, after these projects the company suffered again lack of work. Due to the poor situation, the company had to discontinue the lease contract for the new shipbuilding area and sell the buildings and equipment.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, twenty-six {{people came}} out of the church. IDF {{spokesman}} Olivier Rafowicz said one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> senior Palestinian security official. He was taken away for questioning. On May 2, ten international activists, including members of the International Solidarity Movement, were successful in their attempts to bypass soldiers and enter the church, where they announced they intended to remain until the IDF lifted the siege. The next day, another group of international activists delivered food and water, which were in short supply among those inside. On May 5, British and American diplomats arrived. It was suggested that about ten of the militants would be exiled to Jordan. Meanwhile, the IDF said it had found a large amount of explosives in an apartment about 200 meters from the church. Between six and eight of the militants were to be exiled to Italy, while as many as forty others were to be sent to Gaza. The remaining were to be freed. The agreement fell through on May 8, after Italy refused to accept thirteen militants. The Italian government said it had received no formal request to take them.|$|E
