5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably {{have come to the}} conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as to the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E
25|$|The Arizona Supreme Court {{affirmed the}} {{conviction}} and sentence. With {{respect to the}} finding that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, the court observed that under its prior case law, the murder was cruel in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Powell had some uncertainty as to his ultimate fate, and the murder was depraved in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Walton had relished the killing. Reviewing the death sentence independently, it found that the death sentence was appropriate on these facts.|$|E

25|$|Many radical {{views of}} transsaccadic memory exist. Some are favoured {{more than others}} because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> {{supports}} them. One less-accepted theory, Breitmeyer's spatiotopic fusion hypothesis, suggested that successive images are fused based on environmental coordinates and not retinal ones. In other words, our memory stores a sequence of images from our surroundings, and joins the images together {{to give us a}} full representation in our brain. The orientation of our retinas do not have an influence on this form of memory. This theoretical form of memory supposedly stores highly detailed representations of the world in a high capacity spatial buffer. Research and experiments by other psychologists provide empirical evidence against these claims.|$|E

500|$|Watson's {{work was}} met with some early scepticism, {{including}} from historians such as Jeremy Johns in 1984. Johns noted that Watson's selection of 18 plants in his book Agricultural Innovation in the Early Islamic World was [...] "peculiar", since the banana, coconut, mango and shaddock were unimportant in the Islamic region at the time, detracting from {{the discussion of the}} staple crops. Johns further noted that the evidence of diffusion of crops was imperfect, that Watson made [...] "too many minor slips and larger errors" [...] such as getting dates wrong or claiming that a 1439 document was Norman, and had failed to make best use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> was available, such as of the decline of classical agriculture, or even to mention the changing geomorphology. Johns however concluded that [...] "The hypothesis of an 'Abbasid agricultural revolution is challenging and may well prove useful".|$|E
500|$|The exact {{reasons for}} Belcher's {{dismissal}} {{have been a}} recurring subject of scholarly interest, due to the many colonial, imperial, and political factors at play. [...] Two principal themes within these analyses are Belcher's acquisition of many local enemies, {{and the idea that}} good imperial governance in London eventually required his replacement. [...] Before the issues of 1739 most of the efforts to unseat Belcher had failed: Belcher himself noted that year that [...] "the warr I am ingag'd in is carrying on in much the same manner as for 9 years past." [...] Historian Stephen Foster further notes that someone as powerful as Newcastle was at the time generally had much weightier issues to deal with than arbitrating colonial politics. [...] In this instance, however, imperial and colonial considerations coincided over the need for Massachusetts to provide a significant number of troops for Newcastle's proposed West Indies expedition. [...] In April 1740 Newcastle in effect offered Shirley the opportunity to prove, in the light of Belcher's political difficulties, that he could more effectively raise troops than the governor could. [...] Shirley consequently engaged in recruiting, principally outside Massachusetts (where Belcher had refused his offers of assistance, understanding what was going on), and deluged Newcastle with documentation of his successes while Belcher was preoccupied with the banking crisis. [...] Newcastle handed the issue off to Martin Bladen, secretary to the Board of Trade and a known Belcher opponent. [...] The Board of Trade then apparently decided, based on the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evidence,</b> <b>that</b> Belcher needed to be replaced. [...] In April 1741 the Privy Council approved William Shirley's commission as governor of Massachusetts, and Benning Wentworth's commission as governor of New Hampshire was issued the following June.|$|E
