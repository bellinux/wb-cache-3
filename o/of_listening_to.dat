5|$|Shortwave listening, or SWLing, is {{the hobby}} <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> shortwave radio {{broadcasts}} located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists {{immersed in the}} technical aspects of radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters. In 2002, the number of households that were capable of shortwave listening was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions.|$|E
5|$|The {{only reason}} the Nazis put on {{prisoner}} broadcasts {{is to get}} people justifiably anxious about relatives reported missing at the front {{to listen to their}} propaganda. Although many of the messages undoubtedly are true, they represent but a small fraction of our prisoners and we have no assurance that many of them are not faked from papers picked up on the battlefield. What concerns some of us is the consequences <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Nazi broadcasts unless you are a well-trained listener (and often, even if you are). Nazi arguments often sound plausible. A person may listen to them with all the skepticism in the world, knowing that every word is a lie. But if the content is sufficiently sensational (and it often is) the source may be forgotten in time, and out pops the Nazi lie, all unsuspecting.|$|E

25|$|Medical {{transcription}} editing is {{the process}} <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> a voice-recorded file and comparing that to the transcribed report of that audio file, correcting errors as needed. Although speech recognition technology has become better at understanding human language, editing is still needed to ensure better accuracy. Medical transcription editing is also performed on medical reports transcribed by medical transcriptionists.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s, {{the whole}} family seated around a set {{in the living room}} was the typical way <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> radio. Stations tried to {{be all things to all}} people, and {{specialised}} programming was not really thought about at this stage (it did not come in until the late 1950s). Because of this, programming on most stations was pretty much the same.|$|E

25|$|Bohm {{discussed}} the experience <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> music. He believed {{the feeling of}} movement and change that make up our experience of music derive from holding the immediate {{past and the present}} in the brain together. The musical notes from the past are transformations rather than memories. The notes that were implicate in the immediate past become explicate in the present. Bohm viewed this as consciousness emerging from the implicate order.|$|E
25|$|The applause, {{by which}} the orator had been {{frequently}} interrupted, at this point became so vociferous and long continued {{that it was impossible}} for him to proceed. He at last desisted from his attempts to do so and descended from the platform.

25|$|Boulez {{likened the}} {{experience}} <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> pre-recorded electronic {{music in the}} concert hall to a crematorium ceremony. His real interest lay in the instantaneous transformation of live instrumental sounds but the technology did not become available until the late 1970s and the founding of IRCAM. Before then he composed two short pieces on tape (the Deux Etudes of 1951, withdrawn) and a large-scale piece for live orchestra with tape, Poésie pour pouvoir (1958), but he disliked {{the fact that the}} orchestra was straitjacketed by the need to follow the tape and never returned to the piece.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{indigenous}} languages, German was the dominant language in Estonia and Latvia in academics, professional life, and upper society from the 13th century until World War I. Polish served a similar function in Lithuania. Numerous Swedish loanwords {{have made it}} into the Estonian language; it was under the Swedish rule that schools were established and education propagated in the 17th century. Swedish remains spoken in Estonia, particularly the Estonian Swedish dialect of the Estonian Swedes of northern Estonia and the islands (though many fled to Sweden as the Soviet Union invaded and re-occupied Estonia in 1944). There is also significant proficiency in Finnish in Estonia owing to its closeness to the native Estonian and also the widespread practice <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Finnish broadcasts during the Soviet era. Russian also achieved significant usage particularly in commerce.|$|E
25|$|Sindhu (Suhasini), {{working as}} a music teacher in a school, attends one of the concerts of JKB, where he is {{performing}} a Tyagaraja keerthanam which is in Telugu Language and she finds some the audience speaking to each other instead <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the music. Hence, she asks JKB to translate the song he is singing into Tamil, which everybody in the audience can understand. He then gets angry and challenges her to demonstrate. She successfully demonstrates it and is applauded by the audience. In a few days, Sindhu apologizes to JKB and he finds out that she is an intellectual equal and admires her knowledge of music. However this intellectual attraction is misunderstood based on the cultural limitations. Gajapathi, who has promised not to lie, informs Bhairavi that her husband is going out with Sindhu.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the birth}} {{and growth of}} the {{cassette}} began in the 1960s, its cultural moment {{took place during the}} 1970s and 1980s. The cassette's popularity grew during these years as a result of being a more effective, convenient and portable way <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> music. Stereo tape decks and boom boxes became some of the most highly sought-after consumer products of both decades. Portable pocket recorders and high-fidelity ("hi-fi") players, such as Sony's Walkman (1979), also enabled users to take their music with them anywhere with ease. The increasing user-friendliness of the cassette led to its popularity around the globe. The body of the Walkman was not much larger than the cassette tape itself, with mechanical keys on one side, or electronic buttons or a display on the face. Sony's WM-10 was even smaller than the cassette itself, and expanded to hold and play a cassette.|$|E

25|$|In 1979, Willy DeVille {{took his}} band {{in a new}} {{direction}} and recorded an album in Paris called Le Chat Bleu. For the album, DeVille wrote several songs with Doc Pomus who had previously seen the band play in New York City. DeVille hired Jean Claude Petit to supervise string arrangements, and he dismissed the members of the band except for guitarist Louis X. Erlanger in favor of new musicians: Accordionist Kenny Margolis, Jerry Scheff (bass), Ron Tutt (drums) and, once again, Steve Douglas (saxophone), who also served as producer. Capitol Records was not happy with Le Chat Bleu, believing that American audiences were incapable <b>of</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> songs with accordions and lavish string arrangements; consequently they initially released the album only in Europe, in 1980. However, the album sold impressively in America as an import and Capitol finally released it in the United States later the same year. Ironically, Rolling Stone yearly critic’s poll ranked Le Chat Bleu the fifth best album of 1980, and music historian Glenn A. Baker declared it the tenth best rock album of all time.|$|E
