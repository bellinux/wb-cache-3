5|$|Because the {{advancement}} of his legal career had been hindered by his marriage to Jane, Hogg hoped to receive a legal appointment from a politically connected acquaintance. This was not an immediate option because the Whig party was in opposition, but {{in the summer of}} 1827 Henry Brougham promised Hogg a future position as a professor of civil law at the newly created University College London. Hogg embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> of study in preparation, but the professorship was not established owing to a lack of funds. This setback upset Hogg greatly, and he became very bitter about it. A lecture that he had intended to give at his inauguration was published in 1831.|$|E

The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses.

5|$|The key to Ferdinand was {{the threat}} to Genoa. Intelligence {{intercepts}} showed that the Abwehr (German military intelligence) listed {{it as one of}} the main areas they expected an Allied attack. It was not possible to hide the buildup of naval and amphibious forces in the region, which were easily accessible to German aerial reconnaissance. German commanders identified both Genoa and southern France as the only logical targets, so the task for Allied double agents was to convince them that the former was the true goal. The deception was maintained on the invasion date itself, with a tactical deception. The Dragoon fleet travelled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> toward Genoa until late at night on 14 August, when they turned west toward their real target.|$|E
5|$|To {{make matters}} worse for the government, {{industrial}} unrest was a persisting problem, particularly in the economically key states of New South Wales and Victoria.

Scullin forecast that the Australian economy was highly vulnerable given its indebtedness, and was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> for severe depression if government finances were not turned around dramatically.|$|E
5|$|By 1815 Jennings and the {{territorial}} legislature {{were ready to}} embark <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> for statehood. In December 1815 Jennings's introduced a petition from {{the territorial}} legislature to Congress that requested statehood for Indiana. The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63,000, more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. The House began a debate on the measure and passed the Enabling Act on April 11, 1816. The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution. The territorial governor, Thomas Posey, {{expressed concern that the}} territory was too under-populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government. In a letter to President Madison, he recommended that the president veto the bill and delay statehood for another three years, which would allow him to finish his term as governor. Madison signed the bill, ignoring Posey's plea.|$|E

5|$|Nick Petrides (Damien Fotiou) informs Paul {{that he has}} leukaemia and {{he starts}} him <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> of chemotherapy. Paul hires Naomi as his {{assistant}} and she helps to keep his diagnosis a secret. When Paul collapses, he calls Karl for help and tells him about his diagnosis. Nick tells Paul that his body has stopped responding to the chemotherapy. Paul wants Karl to succeed him as mayor and he asks Naomi to find his daughter Amy. While Naomi is encouraging Paul to be more positive, she kisses him. She apologises, but they both develop feelings for each other. Paul asks Naomi to shave his head when his hair starts falling out, and he sells Lassiter's to the Quill Group. Paul collapses from pneumonia and is hospitalised. Nick tells Paul that his cancer is in remission, but Georgia claims that Paul never had cancer and Nick is found to have doctored Paul's patient files. He is arrested soon after. Paul tries to forget about his feelings for Naomi, by pushing her and Brennan back together. However, Naomi discovers their plan and breaks up with Brennan. The Quill Group sell Lassiter's back to Paul and he and Naomi kiss. Amy (Zoe Cramond) turns up at the penthouse and is angered when Paul does not immediately recognise her, she later leaves town.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 June 1969, Melbourne and her escorts were {{involved}} in anti-submarine training exercises in the South China Sea. In preparation for launching a Tracker, Stevenson ordered Evans to the plane guard station, reminded the destroyer of Melbournes course, and instructed the carrier's navigational lights {{to be brought to}} full brilliance. Evans had performed the manoeuvre four times {{over the course of the}} night. Evans was positioned on Melbournes port bow, but began the manoeuvre by turning starboard, towards the carrier. A radio message was sent from Melbourne to Evans bridge and Combat Information Centre, warning the destroyer that she was on a collision course, which Evans acknowledged. Seeing the destroyer take no action and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> to place herself under Melbournes bow, Stevenson ordered the carrier hard to port, signalling the turn by both radio and siren blasts. At approximately the same time, Evans turned hard to starboard to avoid the approaching carrier. It is uncertain which ship began to manoeuvre first, but each ship's bridge crew claimed that they were informed of the other ship's turn after they commenced their own. After having narrowly passed in front of Melbourne, the turns quickly placed Evans back in the carrier's path. Melbourne hit Evans amidships at 3:15am, cutting the destroyer in two.|$|E

5|$|The chase {{continued}} through a second night, the French frigate making significant gains over her pursuers but {{still unable to}} escape them completely. At 10:30 on 10 February, two sails appeared in the southeast, set <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> that would cut {{in front of the}} French frigate. These were the British frigate HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver. With enemies on all sides, Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio: a swift victory would enable him to outrun pursuit from the east, travelling westwards into the Atlantic. Rapidly closing with the new arrivals, Junon opened fire at 12:36. Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau could respond. Drawing close, the frigates exchanged broadsides at point blank range for 40 minutes. The heavier weight of the French ship soon told, with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged. Unable {{to keep up with the}} French frigate, whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged, Horatio fell back.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} {{plan called for}} strict radio silence to ensure surprise could be maintained. This required Meendsen-Bohlken to have total tactical and operational control of his ship; shore-based commands {{would be unable to}} direct the mission. On 16 August, Admiral Scheer and her destroyer escort left Narvik <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> to pass to the north of Novaya Zemlya. Upon entering the Kara Sea, she encountered heavy ice; in addition to searching for merchant shipping, the Arado floatplane was used to scout paths through the ice fields. On 25 August, she encountered the Soviet icebreaker Sibiryakov. Admiral Scheer sank the icebreaker, but not before she sent a distress signal. The German ship then turned south, and two days later, arrived off the port of Dikson. Admiral Scheer damaged two ships in the port and shelled harbor facilities. Meendsen-Bohlken considered sending a landing party ashore, but firing from Soviet shore batteries convinced him to abandon the plan. After breaking off the bombardment, Meendsen-Bohlken decided to return to Narvik. She reached port on 30 August without having achieved any significant successes.|$|E

The TARDIS, which originally was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>course</b> set for Las Vegas, materialises inside the submarine and the Doctor and Clara tumble out. The Doctor convinces Captain Zhukov (Liam Cunningham) to maneuver the submarine to the side, landing it safely and preventing it from imploding. During this the TARDIS inexplicably dematerialises. They then encounter the escaped Ice Warrior, Grand Marshal Skaldak (Spencer Wilding, voiced by Nicholas Briggs). The Doctor encourages the crew to be peaceful, but the ship's executive officer Stepashin (Tobias Menzies) knocks out Skaldak with a cattle prod, suspecting {{that he is not}} an alien but part of a Western plot. Knowing that Skaldak will desire vengeance for being attacked, the Doctor and the crew chain Skaldak, who sends out a distress call for others of his race to find him.|$|E
