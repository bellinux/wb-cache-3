The prior at San Frediano exercised some episcopal authority {{over half the}} city, as well as control of the Lateran's religious houses. As at his earlier post in Spoleto, the monks of the San Frediano monastery {{as well as the}} clergy of Lucca were known for moral laxity, which led to an <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new Lutheran religion there. Vermigli saw his task as one of education as well as moral correction. He set up a college based on humanist principles of education and modeled on the newly founded St John's College, Cambridge, and Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Instruction was in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew. Among the professors were the humanists Immanuel Tremellius, Paolo Lacizi, Celio Secondo Curione, and Girolamo Zanchi, all of whom would later convert to Protestantism. The Congregation recognized Vermigli's work by appointing him to a disciplinary commission of seven canons in May 1542.|$|E

The Residence Environment Survey of the National Study of Living-Learning Programs is used to understand how living-learning programs contribute to 12, 241 students' <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> diversity from several different perspectives, by examining differences in students' perceptions by (a) thematic types of living-learning programs, (b) structural elements of living-learning programs, and (c) involvement in living-learning programs nested within a comprehensive conceptual model of college impact on <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> diversity. <b>The</b> study uses mean differences, cluster analyses, and multiple regression analyses <b>to</b> examine <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> diversity from these perspectives. The study determines that students in upper-division living-learning programs have higher perceived growth in <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> diversity than students in most other program types on <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> diversity. <b>The</b> cluster solution distinguishes among the groups of living-learning programs, but there are no mean differences in <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> diversity among <b>the</b> cluster types. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis indicates several items successfully contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> model for <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> diversity. They include gender; standardized test scores (negative relationship); socially supportive residence halls; majors in applied social sciences; class level; peer interaction; undergraduate students as mentors in living-learning programs; multicultural programming in living-learning programs, critical thinking; and civic engagement. The primary implication is that student affairs and higher education professionals contribute to student learning by creating environments that are conducive to positive, meaningful interaction among diverse peers. Resources should be allocated to facilitate meaningful, purposeful peer interaction in living-learning environments primarily during {{the first two years of}} college...|$|R

25|$|The {{impact of}} the charismatic {{movement}} was far reaching in the AOG. It was initially celebrated by classical Pentecostals {{as a sign that}} Pentecostalism was influencing traditional churches; however, there were also concerns over the influence the charismatic movement was exerting within the AOG.

Because of its <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Latter Rain Movement of the 1950s, the AGNZ was quick to accept the charismatic renewal than the more conservative Australian movement. New Zealand pastors such as Robert Midgley, Frank Houston, and Phil Pringle would significantly influence Australian Pentecostalism, and all ultimately moved their ministries to Australia.|$|E
25|$|Western {{criticism}} of Hu, particularly regarding human rights, exposes his hypersensitivity to social stability {{but does not}} lay as much emphasis on his fresh commitment to address China’s multi-faceted social problems. Hu’s pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values—maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, he seems to want more <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China's news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. He also cancelled many events that are traditionally seen as communist extravagances, such as the lavish send-off and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under Hu also focused on such problems as the {{gap between rich and}} poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on GDP growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.|$|E

25|$|Such a {{conclusion}} led Heidegger {{to depart from}} the phenomenology of his teacher Husserl and prompt instead an (ironically anachronistic) return to the yet-unasked questions of Ontology, a return that in general did not acknowledge an intrinsic distinction between phenomena and noumena or between things in themselves (de re) and things as they appear (see qualia): Being-in-the-world, or rather, the <b>openness</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> process of Daseins becoming was to bridge the age-old gap between these two. In this latter premise, Heidegger shares an affinity with the late Romantic philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche, another principal forerunner of post-structuralist and postmodernist thought. Influential to thinkers associated with Postmodernism are Heidegger's critique of the subject–object or sense–knowledge division implicit in Rationalism, Empiricism, and methodological naturalism, his repudiation {{of the idea that}} facts exist outside or separately from the process of thinking and speaking them (however, Heidegger is not specifically a nominalist), his related admission that the possibilities of philosophical and scientific discourse are wrapped up in the practices and expectations of a society and that concepts and fundamental constructs are the expression of a lived, historical exercise rather than simple derivations of external, a priori conditions independent from historical mind and changing experience (see Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Heinrich von Kleist, Weltanschauung, and social constructionism), and his instrumentalist and negativist notion that Being (and, by extension, reality) is an action, method, tendency, possibility, and question rather than a discrete, positive, identifiable state, answer, or entity (see also process philosophy, dynamism, Instrumentalism, Pragmatism, and Vitalism).|$|E
