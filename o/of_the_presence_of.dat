5|$|All 29 {{items of}} gold {{jewellery}} were analysed, with silver and copper {{found to be}} present. Results were typical for Roman silver in hoards of the period, in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> copper alloyed with the silver to harden it, and trace elements. One repaired bowl showed a mercury-based solder.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} there were {{conflicting}} reports {{that she had not}} and allegations that she had warned a nearby convoy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a U-boat. The British nationality of her captain became an issue in the Irish general election of June 1943, there were diplomatic exchanges between the United States and Ireland, and questions raised in the British House of Commons. In Germany, the U-boat's captain received a mild reprimand.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can {{be applied}} as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of {{seedlings}} of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it {{was used as a}} folk cure for tuberculosis, though it had no effect. In more recent times, it has been found that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> darts in many superfamilies of the Stylommatophora, {{it seems}} likely that love darts {{appeared}} during the early evolution of the Pulmonata, and that the ancestors of the Stylommatophora possessed darts already.|$|E
5|$|French tirailleurs {{occupied}} the dominant positions, especially {{one on a}} knoll overlooking {{the square of the}} 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the tirailleurs. That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two-thirds of their strength within that three or four hours.|$|E

5|$|Geochemical {{observations}} {{may help}} to deduce the global level of biological activity, or the affinity of certain fossils. For example, geochemical features of rocks may reveal when life first arose on Earth, and may provide evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> eukaryotic cells, the type from which all multicellular organisms are built. Analyses of carbon isotope ratios {{may help to}} explain major transitions such as the Permian–Triassic extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> star spots combined with {{the rotation of the}} star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E
40|$|From <b>the</b> {{perspective}} <b>of</b> early modernity, <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> {{writing is}} linked to its visibility and legibility. This may be a questionable assumption, and it was especially problematic for writers in the premodern era, for whom concealment and veiling played such an important role. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this book is to critically examine <b>the</b> category <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “restricted <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> writing,” from an interdisciplinary and transcultural perspective...|$|R

5|$|In 1998, a fragmentary fossil {{of another}} species of this {{same group of}} oryzomyines was found in eastern Argentina. It was {{initially}} identified as a possible second species of Noronhomys on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a crest on the upper first molar, the mesoloph, but the specimen is different from Noronhomys vespuccii in other respects, and in 2008 it {{was described as a}} new genus and species, Carletonomys cailoi, related to Noronhomys and associated genera.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} {{action was}} taken: Ireland was exporting food to Britain at the time. Also, Paul Emrys-Evans {{revealed that the}} convoy knew about the U-boat; the British stance was that, as it already knew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> both Irish Oak and U-607, {{there was no need}} for Irish Oak to have warned the convoy.|$|E

5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, {{is judged}} to be Maya (if genuine) based upon the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices and because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of the iconography may simply be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya iconography during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of many red flags are poorly supported by evidence. The most useful for detecting a fracture are: older age, corticosteroid use, and significant trauma {{especially if it}} results in skin markings.

5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|Da Matta, Andretti, and Franchitti contended {{for third}} {{position}} until the field closed up because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> slower cars. The third caution was shown fourteen laps later when Adrián Fernández lost engine power driving {{into the second}} turn, {{and he went to}} the bottom of the track on the backstretch to retire. Oil was laid on the track heading into turn two, and marshals were required to clean it. It was announced on lap 90 that Kniefel had reduced the number of laps to be run from 168 to 140 because of the danger from fading sunlight. All of the leaders (including Bräck) chose to make pit stops for fuel and tyres under caution on lap 100. Castroneves passed da Matta and Andretti around the inside in the pit lane and Newman/Haas Racing believed he had committed an infraction. The team informed CART of Castroneves' passing, which was observed by their co-owner Paul Newman.|$|E
