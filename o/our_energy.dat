25|$|Gingrich also {{published}} Drill Here, Drill Now, Pay Less: A Handbook for Slashing Gas Prices and Solving <b>Our</b> <b>Energy</b> Crisis, which outlines {{a plan for}} reducing both gas prices and America's dependence on foreign oil. Throughout the book, Gingrich argues that gas prices and overall rising energy costs are a reflection of bad government policy rather than a scarcity of resources. Gingrich proposes tapping into American oil reserves along with pursuing other energy resources including nuclear, coal and renewable energy resources.|$|E
25|$|To create lasting {{climate change}} mitigation, the {{replacement}} of high carbon emission intensity power sources, such as conventional fossil fuels—oil, coal and natural gas—with low-carbon power sources is required. Fossil fuels supply humanity with {{the vast majority of}} <b>our</b> <b>energy</b> demands, and at a growing rate. In 2012 the IEA noted that coal accounted for half the increased energy use of the prior decade, growing faster than all renewable energy sources. Both hydroelectricity and nuclear power together provide the majority of the generated low-carbon power fraction of global total power consumption.|$|E

25|$|The Energy {{transition}} is the shift by several countries to sustainable economies {{by means of}} renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development. This trend has been augmented by the decentralization process of energy generation which is starting to allow average homeowners and small companies to generate their own electricity, allowing everyone to install solar panels on their rooftops and, in many markets, sell their excess electricity back on to the grid. This trend continues to grow and could in the future lead to a majority of <b>our</b> <b>energy</b> coming from decentralized solar panels and wind turbines scattered across the country rather {{than a handful of}} coal and nuclear power plants. The final goal of German proponents of a nuclear power phase-out is the abolishment of coal and other non-renewable energy sources.|$|E
25|$|Based on REN21's 2014 report, {{renewables}} contributed 19 {{percent to}} <b>our</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and 22 percent to our electricity generation in 2012 and 2013, respectively. This energy consumption is divided as 9% coming from traditional biomass, 4.2% as heat energy (non-biomass), 3.8% hydro electricity and 2% electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Worldwide investments in renewable technologies amounted {{to more than}} US$214 billion in 2013, with countries like China and the United States heavily investing in wind, hydro, solar and biofuels. Renewable energy resources exist over wide geographical areas, in contrast to other energy sources, which are concentrated in {{a limited number of}} countries. Rapid deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency is resulting in significant energy security, climate change mitigation, and economic benefits. In international public opinion surveys there is strong support for promoting renewable sources such as solar power and wind power. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20 percent of energy supply. National renewable energy markets are projected to continue to grow strongly in the coming decade and beyond.|$|E

On the way to this concert the three {{discussed}} Buddhist philosophy, and Joe Credit III {{told the story of}} the lute player and the Buddha. [...] This parable describes how the Buddha taught a lute player how using <b>our</b> <b>energies</b> to find enlightenment is like bringing the lute's strings to just the right tautness so that the instrument will be in tune, and so, as we keep <b>our</b> <b>energies</b> in balance we will be in tune and find enlightenment.|$|R

Written in the key of E minor, the track is set in common time at a moderate tempo of 70 beats per minute. [...] Lyrically, [...] "DNA" [...] uses scientific vocabulary to portray themes of love and obsession. Fiona Shepherd of The Scotsman wrote that the song lionises a strong man. 4Music's Trent Maynard said that it paints a moody picture of love and deep seated biological compatibility. The chorus includes the lyrics, [...] "It's in his DNA, D-D-D-DNA / It's in his DNA / And he just takes my breath away, b-b-b-breath away / I feel it every day / And that's what makes a man, not hard to understand / Perfect in every way, I see it in-his-face / Nothing more to say, it's in his D-D-D-D-DNA". Leigh-Anne Pinnock does the song's half-spoken half-rapped middle eight in a spooky tone, mentioning, [...] "It's all about his kiss, contaminates my lips, <b>our</b> <b>energy</b> connects, it's simple genetics, I'm the X to his Y". Music website, Popjustice, likened the song to British girl group, the Spice Girls, writing, [...] "'DNA' is the 'Say You'll Be There' to the 'Wannabe' of 'Wings'".|$|E

The reality is that wind power is too costly and can never meet <b>our</b> <b>energy</b> needs; but it will destroy the countryside".
