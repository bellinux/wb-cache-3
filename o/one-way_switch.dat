40|$|MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs {{that play}} an {{important}} role in many key biological processes, including development, cell differentiation, the cell cycle and apoptosis, as central post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs can act as oncogenes and tumor suppressors depending on the context. The present work focuses on the physiological significance of miRNAs and their role in regulating the switching behavior. We illustrate an abstract model of the Myc/E 2 F/miR- 17 - 92 network presented by Aguda et al. (2008), which is composed of coupling between the E 2 F/Myc positive feedback loops and the E 2 F/Myc/miR- 17 - 92 negative feedback loop. By systematically analyzing the network in close association with plausible experimental parameters, we show that, in the presence of miRNAs, the system bistability emerges from the system, with a bistable switch and a <b>one-way</b> <b>switch</b> presented by Aguda et al. instead of a single <b>one-way</b> <b>switch.</b> Moreover, the miRNAs can optimize the switching process. The model produces a diverse array of response-signal behaviors in response to various potential regulating scenarios. The model predicts that this transition exists, one from cell death or the cancerous phenotype directly to cell quiescence, due to the existence of miRNAs. It was also found that the network involving miR- 17 - 92 exhibits high noise sensitivity due to a positiv...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: miRNAs {{are small}} noncoding RNAs capable of {{regulating}} gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. A {{growing body of}} evidence demonstrated that let- 7 family of miRNAs, as one of the highly conserved miRNAs, {{plays an important role in}} cell differentiation and development, as well as tumor suppressor function depending on their levels of expression. To explore the physiological significance of let- 7 in regulating cell fate decisions, we present a coarse grained model of let- 7 biogenesis network, in which let- 7 and its regulator Lin 28 inhibit mutually. The dynamics of this minimal network architecture indicates that, as the concentration of Lin 28 increases, the system undergoes a transition from monostability to a bistability and then to a <b>one-way</b> <b>switch</b> with increasing strength of positive feedback of let- 7, while in the absence of Lin 28 inhibition, the system loses bistability. Moreover, the ratio of degradation rates of let- 7 and Lin 28 is critical for the switching sensitivity and resistance to stimulus fluctuations. These findings may highlight why let- 7 is required for normal gene expression in the context of embryonic development and oncogenesis, which will facilitate the development of approaches to exploit this regulatory pathway by manipulating Lin 28 /let- 7 axis for novel treatments of human diseases...|$|E
40|$|We provide quasi-analytical {{solutions}} to real options embedded in flexible facilities which have stochastic {{inputs and outputs}} with switching costs. We show the facility value and the optimal switching input and output triggers, when {{there is the possibility}} for multiple switching between operating and not operating. The facility value and optimal shut down triggers are also calculated, when there is only a <b>one-way</b> <b>switch</b> between operating and suspension (which amounts to abandonment). An illustration is provided for a heavy crude oil field production which requires natural gas as an input, with shut-down and start-up switching costs. More general applications in the energy field include the operational spark spread with switching costs. It may be appropriate to extend these models to many manufacturing, distribution and transportation activities. 2 REAL INPUT-OUTPUT SWITCHING OPTIONS Input-output switching options are often embedded in facilities, or situations, sometimes developed by an alert manager. For instance, in Manchester, when “trade was very slack; cottons could find no market ” cotton mill owners Messrs. Carson “were no hurry about the business…the weekly drain of wages, useless in the present state of the market, was stopped”. 1 We provide quasi-analytical solutions for basic two factor multiple switching option models, switching from an operating state with an option to suspend operations, or from a suspended state to an operating state, when both output price and input cost are stochastic. As a simplification, a single switch from operating to suspension (abandonment) is also considered. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} several continuous-variable quantum key distribution protocols {{in the presence of}} fading channels. These are lossy channels whose transmissivity changes according to a probability distribution. This is typical in communication scenarios where remote parties are connected by free-space links subject to atmospheric turbulence. In this work, we assume the worst-case scenario where an eavesdropper has full control of a fast fading process, so that she chooses the instantaneous transmissivity of a channel, while the remote parties can only detect the mean statistical process. In our study, we consider coherent-state protocols run in various configurations, including the <b>one-way</b> <b>switching</b> protocol in reverse reconciliation, the measurement-device-independent protocol in the symmetric configuration and a three-party measurement-device-independent network. We show that, regardless of the advantage given to the eavesdropper (full control of fading), these protocols can still achieve high rates. Comment: REVTeX. 7 pages. 9 figure...|$|R

5000|$|On release, Yosemite {{received}} generally positive reviews, with users {{praising the}} simplified user interface. Programmer John Siracusa, who had reviewed every OS release, wrote for Ars Technica that [...] "Yosemite is an aesthetic <b>one-way</b> valve... <b>switching</b> back to Mavericks {{after a week}} or two in Yosemite is like returning to iOS 6. Everything looks embarrassingly chunky, glossy, and gaudy." [...] Macworld's review generally praised Yosemite for its design, but noted that it had found WiFi network issues and that Continuity had proved unreliable. [...] While many reviews in the press praised the new design aesthetic, users were often left baffled with these statements. Widespread disagreement and contention could be found in the comment sections of articles discussing the design of the revamped interface. While some praised the changes as new and fresh, others complained about flattened, hard to distinguish buttons reducing usability. Other critiques concluded the new look to be generally ugly, bright, overly saturated, childlike, or comparing the aesthetic to 'Fisher-Price'.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Lithium-ion {{rechargeable}} batteries have enabled {{the proliferation of}} mobile electronics based on its high energy density, negligible memory effect and relatively high cycling capability. Unfortunately, while small scale deployment in consumer-level electronics has been successful, larger scale deployment for Electric Vehicles (EVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) have been handicapped by the uncertainty of its long-term reliability, power density and safety. Physical long-term testing requires months {{of waiting for the}} charge and discharge of the cells, and while the electrochemistry models for the cells are well-documented, {{there is a lack of}} modeling technique that bridges to the application level for electrical engineering designs. This thesis addresses the modeling issue by presenting a novel method to use the detailed electrochemistry-based model in real-world scenarios. The goal is to allow the simulations to be sequentially run in different states based on the change in the physical parameters of the cells, rather than switching between states using fixed time intervals. The method makes use of the highly efficient partial differential equation solver in COMSOL to simulate digital, <b>one-way</b> <b>switching</b> based on specific physical parameters. The other issue this thesis addresses is the reduction of degradation in the long-term cycling of lithium-ion batteries in larger-scale multi-cell applications. Using the detailed pseudo- 2 D electrochemistry models, different discharge currents were simulated in a popular cell (Sony 18650) and the optimal current, and how this optimal current decreases as the cell cycles, is presented. A 2 -stage discharge method, used in conjunction with the penalty based switching algorithm, was developed based on the modeling results of the low current degradation which increases the per cycle discharge capacity by 5 - 10 % while reducing the degradation on the anode of the cell by approximately four times when compared to non-optimized discharge methods. Overall, this research makes advances in the fields of sequential computer simulation of physical systems and electrical engineering design for lithium ion battery systems in larger-scale applications. The modeling method contributes to research opportunities in many fields, and the determination of the optimal discharge current further enables the implementation of lithium-ion batteries as the power source for EVs and HEVs...|$|R
40|$|Progression {{through the}} {{eukaryotic}} cell cycle {{is characterized by}} specific transitions, where cells move irreversibly from stage i- 1 of the cycle into stage i. These irreversible cell cycle transitions are regulated by underlying bistable switches, which share some common features. An inhibitory protein stalls progression, and an activatory protein promotes progression. The inhibitor and activator are locked in a double-negative feedback loop, creating a <b>one-way</b> toggle <b>switch</b> that guarantees an irreversible commitment to move forward through the cell cycle, and it opposes regression from stage i to stage i- 1. In many cases, the activator is an enzyme that modifies the inhibitor in multiple steps, whereas the hypo-modified inhibitor binds strongly to the activator and resists its enzymatic activity. These interactions are {{the basis of a}} reaction motif that provides a simple and generic account of many characteristic properties of cell cycle transitions. To demonstrate this assertion, we apply the motif in detail to the G 1 /S transition in budding yeast and to the mitotic checkpoint in mammalian cells. Variations of the motif might support irreversible cellular decision-making in other contexts...|$|R

40|$|Clustering {{neighbouring}} nodes of an all-optical {{core network}} into medium-sized rings {{controlled by a}} master node allows two-way reservation-based control to aggregate bursts destined for other clusters in a lossless way with tolerable delay. The densely packed bursts can then be sent over static or switched light paths and be received in the destination cluster ring without the delay of end-to-end reservations. This hybrid approach where two-way reservations are geographically limited inside clusters only avoids both the handicap of heavy loss of <b>one-way</b> Optical Burst <b>Switching</b> (OBS) and the intolerable delay and multiplexing gain of end-to-end reservations. In addition, the number of multi-port space-switching all-optical nodes is reduced delegating part of this function to the distributed control of the laser sources of the ring {{under the guidance of}} the medium access protocol.

40|$|To avoid road congestion, we are {{developing}} a highly automated underground transport system using automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) around Schiphol Airport. It is unique in its scale, incorporating 16 to 25 km tubes connecting five to 20 terminals, and it includes 200 to 400 AGVs to transport an estimated 3. 5 million tons of cargo in 2020 with different ordering priorities. According to the current plans, the system will run from 2006 on. Since 1997, we have used object-oriented simulations to plan {{the dimensions of the}} system (number of AGVs, terminal sizes) and to design the layout (network, terminals). We showed that an investment reduction of plus or minus 20 percent is feasible using periodically <b>switched</b> <b>one-way</b> tube sections.

40|$|The highly {{successful}} architecture and supporting protocols of today’s Internet operate poorly {{when faced with}} operating environments such as very long delays, excessive loss, network partitioning, or short node lifetimes. Such properties are typically found in extreme environments which lack infrastructure or operate under severe constraints such as limited power. To achieve interoperability between such networks, a network architecture and application interface structured around message <b>switching,</b> <b>one-way</b> delivery paths, and limited expectations of end-to-end contemporaneous delivery is suggested. The architecture is intended to operate as an overlay above the transport layers of the networks it interconnects, and provides key services such as innetwork retransmission, interoperable naming, authenticated forwarding and a coarse-grained class of service delivery. The existing TCP/IP based internet operates on a principle of providing end-to-end inter-process communication through a concatenation of dissimilar link-layer technologies. End-to-end connectivity is enabled by the standardization of the IP protocol and its mapping into link-layer data frames at each router as required.

40|$|As {{our economy}} and {{critical}} infrastructure increasingly rely on the Internet, securing routing protocols becomes of critical importance. In this paper, we present four new mechanisms as tools for securing distance vector and path vector routing protocols. For securing distance vector protocols, our hash tree chain mechanism forces a router to increase the distance (metric) when forwarding a routing table entry. To provide authentication of a received routing update in bounded time, we present a new mechanism, similar to hash chains, that we call tree-authenticated oneway chains. For {{cases in which the}} maximum metric is large, we present skipchains, which provides more efficient initial computation cost and more efficient element verification; this mechanism is based on a new cryptographic mechanism, called MW-chains, which we also present. For securing path vector protocols, our cumulative authentication mechanism authenticates the list of routers on the path in a routing update, preventing removal or reordering of the router addresses in the list; the mechanism uses only a single authenticator in the routing update rather than one per router address. We also present a simple mechanism to securely <b>switch</b> <b>one-way</b> chains, by authenticating the next one-way chain using the previous one. These mechanisms are all based on efficient symmetric cryptographic techniques and can be used as building blocks for securing routing protocols...|$|R
