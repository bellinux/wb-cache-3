25|$|After a {{promising}} 13–6 start, the Magic {{began to fall}} apart. First, Weisbrod traded Mobley for Doug Christie from the Sacramento Kings. Christie, because of his emotional ties to the Kings, at first refused {{to play for the}} Magic. Later on, Christie claimed he had bone spurs and was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> after playing only a few games for the Magic. Near the end of the season, with a playoff-push faltering, Weisbrod fired Davis after leading Davis to believe {{he was going to be}} the team's head coach for the entire 2004–05 NBA season. He then promoted Chris Jent to interim head coach. Throughout the season, bolstered by Hill's return, the Magic played spectacularly, defeating top NBA teams. However, led by the erratic play of Francis, the Magic also lost to league teams with losing records. Howard showed great promise, becoming one of the few players to average a double-double. Howard was a consistent rebounder and scorer, becoming the first rookie to start and play all 82 games in a season. In addition, Nelson, after a slow start, developed into a talented player, taking over the starting point guard position. Hill also returned and averaged 19.7 points a game. Hill was chosen an All-Star starter by NBA fans for the 2005 All-Star Game, and Dwight Howard and Jameer Nelson were named to the All-Rookie first and second teams, respectively. Howard was a unanimous selection.|$|E

[...] Redshirt freshman quarterback Sherrod Harris was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> and was not expected to play.

500|$|Throughout the 1991 season it {{was clear}} that the team's defense, which had led the league in points allowed in 1990, was declining. This {{deterioration}} continued in 1992, when the team finished 26th in the league in points allowed. The Giants started 1-3 with Simms at the helm, rallied behind Hostetler to take four of their next five to get to 5-4, but lost their next five after Taylor and then Hostetler joined Simms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list.</b> [...] Six losses out of their last seven games meant a 6–10 record, their first double digit loss season since 1983. The team's pass rush, in particular, struggled after Taylor missed the last six games with a torn Achilles tendon. Handley, who had become unpopular with both players and fans, was fired after the end of the regular season.|$|E

Jackson later said, [...] "I put my career on the line for him, going into the stands and fighting ... I lost $3 million [...] there was no 'thank you' or nothing." [...] After more than a month of inactivity, Indiana traded Artest to the Sacramento Kings for Peja Stojaković. Artest faced Ben Wallace for the first time after the fight in November 2006, and finally made his return to Detroit in January 2007. During the Kings' 91–74 loss to the Pistons, Artest was booed constantly, but there were no unusual incidents. After a year's stop with the Houston Rockets in the 2008–09 season, Artest signed with the Los Angeles Lakers. After winning his first NBA championship in , Artest apologized to Jackson and other Pacers for being [...] "so young and egotistical", stating [...] "sometimes I feel like a coward when I see those guys. I'm on the Lakers, but I had a chance to win with you guys. I feel almost like a coward." [...] On September 16, 2011, Artest legally changed his name to Metta World Peace.|$|E

2500|$|Hancock {{spent the}} 1995 summer {{off-season}} working on expanding his offensive prowess, {{which appeared to}} have some effect on his game during a surprising pre-season start where he averaged 15.5 points over six exhibition games. [...] Starter Scott Burrell entered the season <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>injured</b> <b>list</b> nursing a torn Achilles tendon, forcing the newly acquired shooting guard Glen Rice to switch positions and replace Burrell as the squad's starting small forward. Charlotte took a chance with tapping Hancock to temporarily fill the void at the starting shooting guard position in the meantime. He appeared in four starts {{during the middle of}} November, averaging five points and two rebounds. However Burrell returned to the starting lineup later in the month, relegating Hancock back to the bench. [...] Darrin Hancock saw limited playing time in about half of all regular season games through the end of December [...] but recorded an NBA career high of 16 points during an away game against the Utah Jazz. The now second-year NBA swingman began to see a dramatic increase in playing time after Burrell suffered a season-ending dislocated shoulder on New Year's Eve. This time around Charlotte went with Dell Curry as the team's new replacement starting shooting guard, designating Hancock as the Hornets' primary guard-forward swingman reserve. Hancock finished the season with a total average of 13.3 minutes per game in 63 games. Despite seeing more time on the court, Hancock was unable to carry over his pre-season offensive exploits into the regular season and settled instead for a 4.3 points per game average. The Charlotte Hornets, playing their first year without star Alonzo Mourning, had also seen better times after failing to make the playoffs with a 41-41 record. [...] The Hornets decided not to re-sign Hancock {{at the end of his}} two-year contract, making the former Hornet a marketable free agent soon thereafter.|$|E
