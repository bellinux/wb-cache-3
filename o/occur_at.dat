5|$|Cyclogenesis is the {{development}} or strengthening of cyclonic circulation in the atmosphere. Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes that all result in {{the development}} of some sort of cyclone. It can <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> various scales, from the microscale to the synoptic scale.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to causing damage to buildings, termites can also damage food crops. Termites may attack trees whose resistance to damage is low but generally ignore fast-growing plants. Most attacks <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> harvest time; crops and trees are attacked {{during the dry}} season.|$|E

5|$|The {{length and}} origin these eruptions has also varied. Events last {{anywhere}} between days and years, and <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> {{a number of}} different sites. Half of all eruptions <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> or near Kīlauea's summit caldera. Activity there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century, and after a reprieve between 1894 and 1907, continued onwards until 1924. There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano's relatively southwestern rift zone, and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone, mostly along its upper section.|$|E

5|$|Because the Moon's {{orbit around}} Earth is {{inclined}} by about 5.145° (5° 9') to {{the orbit of}} Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near {{the intersection of the}} two orbital planes. The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18years.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds {{typically}} breed on remote oceanic islands, {{generally in}} colonies {{of up to}} 5000 birds. Within these colonies, they most often nest in groups of 10 to 30 (or rarely 100) individuals.

5|$|In 2013 about 3.3 {{million cases}} of self-harm occurred. Self-harm is most common {{between the ages}} of 12 and 24. Self-harm in {{childhood}} is relatively rare but the rate has been increasing since the 1980s. However, self-harm behaviour can <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> any age, including in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Self-harm is not limited to humans. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming behaviour.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
