Their report showed that between 1980 and 2005, there had been 281 explosions involving combustible dust, resulting in 119 deaths and 718 injuries. The Board found that dust explosions posed a severe risk and made a number <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the concepts {{involved in the}} process <b>of</b> benchmarking <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> systems. Benchmarking <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> systems is used to ensure the quality of a research system or production system in comparison to other systems, whether algorithmically, infrastructurally, or according to any sought-after quality. Specifically, the chapter presents evaluation <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> systems according to recommendation accuracy, technical constraints, and business values {{in the context of a}} multi-dimensional benchmarking and evaluation model encompassing any number of qualities into a final comparable metric. The focus is put on quality measures related to recommendation accuracy, technical factors, and business values. The chapter first introduces concepts related to evaluation and benchmarking <b>of</b> <b>recommendation</b> systems, continues with an overview of the current state of the art, then presents the multi-dimensional approach in detail.

She concludes with a list <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> for how individuals can effect change at government agencies including the FAA, and how to address concerns of conflict of interest between air safety and inspection and the airline industry.|$|E
5|$|A report {{commissioned}} by the Ministry of Defence in 1995 made a number <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> for financial savings in the armed forces' budget, {{one of which was}} the abolition of the five-star ranks. Part of the rationale was that these ranks were disproportionate {{to the size of the}} forces commanded by these officers and that none of the United Kingdom's close allies, such as the United States (which reserves the rank of general of the army for officers who have commanded large armies in major wars), used such ranks. The recommendation was not taken up in full, but the practice of promoting service chiefs to five-star ranks was stopped and the ranks are now reserved for special circumstances. Sir Peter Inge was, in 1994, the last active officer to be promoted to the rank. Inge relinquished the post of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) in 1997 and his successor, Sir Charles Guthrie, was the first officer not to be promoted upon appointment as CDS.|$|E

He was also an advocate for the mechanisation of the New Zealand Military Forces. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1934, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1935, the same year his term as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces was extended for two years.

5|$|Later in 1790, Hamilton issued {{another set}} <b>of</b> <b>recommendations</b> in his Second Report on Public Credit. The report {{called for the}} {{establishment}} of a national bank and an excise tax on distilled spirits. Hamilton's proposed national bank would provide credit to fledgling industries, serve as a depository for government funds, and oversee one nationwide currency. In response to Hamilton's proposal, Congress passed the Bank Bill of 1791, establishing the First Bank of the United States. The following year, it passed the Coinage Act of 1792, establishing the United States Mint, and the United States dollar, and regulating the coinage of the United States. Historian Samuel Morison points to Hamilton's Second Report as the event that precipitated Jefferson's change of attitude toward Hamilton and his policies. Jefferson feared that the creation of the national bank would lead to political, economic, and social inequality, with Northern financial interests dominating American society much as aristocrats dominated European society.|$|E
