Low-rate production began in March 1997 with full production beginning in September 1997. Testing continued through 1999, finishing with sea trials and aerial refueling demonstrations.

25|$|Very short headways are controversial. The UK Railway Inspectorate has {{evaluated}} the ULTra design {{and is willing}} to accept one-second headways, pending successful completion of initial <b>operational</b> <b>tests</b> at more than 2 seconds. In other jurisdictions, existing rail regulations apply to PRT systems (see CVS, above); these typically calculate headways in terms of absolute stopping distances, which would restrict capacity and make PRT systems unfeasible. No regulatory agency has yet endorsed headways below one second, although proponents believe that regulators may be willing to reduce headways as operational experience increases.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Marine Corps was {{interested}} in the Cobra and ordered an improved twin-engined version in 1968 under the designation AH-1J. This would lead to more twin-engine variants. In 1972, the Army sought improved anti-armor capability. Under the Improved Cobra Armament Program (ICAP), trials of eight AH-1s fitted with TOW missiles were conducted in October 1973. After passing qualification tests the following year, Bell was contracted with upgrading 101 AH-1Gs to the TOW-capable AH-1Q configuration. Following AH-1Q <b>operational</b> <b>tests,</b> a more powerful T53 engine and transmission were added from 1976 resulting in the AH-1S version. The AH-1S was upgraded in three steps, culminating with the AH-1F.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to analyze current <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> and to alert the reader to how testing will be conducted in the future. This analysis is conducted from a tester's {{point of view and}} is targeted at program offices so that Program Managers will be able to ensure that beneficial <b>operational</b> <b>testing</b> is conducted on their programs. The thesis also provides a detailed description of current and future systems used to instrument development systems, analyze the test data, and produce a final test report. It also provides a detailed analysis of a testing tool called Model-Test-Model (M- T-M). The goal of M-T-M is to save the Army time and money by using a validated model to provide <b>operational</b> <b>test</b> data. Finally, the thesis provides an analysis of the changes that will need {{to be made in the}} T&E community as a result of a new defense environment. These areas include the need for minimizing duplication between development and <b>operational</b> <b>testing,</b> using modeling and simulation, and taking advantage of other areas where testing costs can be reduced. <b>Operational</b> <b>testing,</b> User testing, Model-test-model, Test instrumentation, Real-time casualty assessment, Future testing[URL] United States Arm...|$|R

The Warrigal I {{was delivered to}} RAAF base Point Cook on 29 January 1929 after a seven-hour cross-country flight with stops at Golburn and Cootamundra. On 31 January the aircraft was christened by Mrs. Ettie Williams, {{the wife of the}} Chief of Air Staff Richard Williams and handed over to the Commonwealth Air Board for a series of performance, handling and <b>operational</b> <b>tests.</b> Numerous RAAF pilots were invited to test the handling of the aircraft, including Charles Eaton, who described an alarming incident when he was unable to recover from an intentional spin until the last moment possible, almost resulting in the loss of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|From mid-1943, Fw 190s {{were also}} used as night fighters against the growing RAF Bomber Command offensive. In mid-1943, one of the {{earliest}} participants in the single-engine, ground controlled, night-fighting experiments was the Nachtjagdkommando Fw 190 (Night Fighter Command Fw 190), operated by IV. Gruppe (4 Group), Jagdgeschwader 3, (Fighter Wing 3, or JG 3). The main Nachtgeschwader (Night Fighter Wings) were keen to adopt a new fighter type as their twin-engine fighters were too slow for combat against increasing numbers of de Havilland Mosquito night fighters and bombers. Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (NJG 1) and NJG 3 kept a pair of Fw 190s on standby to supplement the Messerschmitt Bf 110 and Junkers Ju 88. The considerable performance advantage of the Fw 190 over the other two types was more than offset by the difficulties of operating at night. Few, if any, aerial successes can be attributed to these <b>operational</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|E

During the summer of 1979, helicopters were briefly used to airlift some major components. Unlike the original construction project in 1937, {{there was no need}} to erect a freight tramway since the existing tramway could be used as the work-horse for moving materials up the mountain.

The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's (RNNAS) goal for the type was to have one aircraft based at each of the three Norwegian naval air stations, leading to the delivery of two new aircraft, one in 1932 and another in 1933. The two new-built aircraft were delivered with Armstrong Siddeley Cheetah engines and a steel tube hull instead of F.200's wooden hull. Designated as M.F.10Bs and numbered F.202 and F.204, the two aircraft were modified with a new type balance rudder which greatly improved their flying characteristics. When F.202 was written off [...] after a May 1935 crash a replacement aircraft was built and delivered in March 1936 as the fourth and last of the type. The same year F.200 had its wooden hull replaced with a steel tube one. In addition to its training role the M.F.10 was also used for <b>operational</b> <b>tests,</b> such as seaplanes' ability to land on and take off from snow and ice on frozen lakes. Successful tests were carried out in March 1933 with F.202 both on Borresvannet lake and on the snow-covered Kjeller air station.|$|E
