5|$|Plas yn Rhiw, {{owned by}} the National Trust, is an early 17th-century house that was {{restored}} by the Keating sisters in 1939, with advice from Clough Williams-Ellis. It is believed that the house is <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> site of an earlier defended house, built by Meirion Goch in the 10th century to prevent incursions by Vikings into Porth Neigwl.|$|E

50|$|Groundfish are {{fish that}} live <b>on,</b> in, <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of the}} body of water they inhabit. Some typical {{saltwater}} groundfish species are cod, flounder, halibut, and sole.|$|R
5|$|Takalik Abaj {{was one of}} {{a series}} of early sites <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Pacific coastal plain that were {{important}} commercial, ceremonial and political centres. It is apparent that it prospered from the production of cacao and from the trade routes that crossed the region. At the time of the Spanish Conquest in the 16th century the area was still important for its cacao production.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD and VHS on October 31, 2005 (Halloween), in the UK and Ireland, on November 1, 2005 in the United States and Canada on DVD and on November 3, 2005, in Australia. It was also released in most major territories <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> same day. The DVD was a two-disc set, with picture and sound mastered from the original digital source material.|$|E
5|$|The golden swallow is {{victim to}} various {{mammalian}} nest predators, including the introduced Indian mongoose, feral cats, and multiple species of rats. These predators {{are thought to}} be linked to the extinction of the nominate subspecies. Nests <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> ground in mines are especially vulnerable.|$|E

40|$|Closed {{kinematic}} chains (parallel architectures) {{allow the}} actuators {{to be located}} <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> to <b>the</b> frame which makes them much lighter and faster than their serial counterparts. Due to their multi-loop topology, these advantages are usually accompanied by reduced workspaces and complex kinematics. The reduction of the closed-loop number could be a design rule to attenuate these drawbacks, provided the resulting architectures still keep the above-mentioned advantages. Here, some single-loop architectures for parallel wrists are presented which still allows the actuators to be located <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> to <b>the</b> frame. Moreover, the kinematic analysis of these architectures is studied in depth...|$|R

5|$|The later 4th-century army {{contained}} {{three types}} of army group: (a) Imperial escort armies (comitatus praesentales). These were ordinarily based near the imperial capitals (Milan in the West, Constantinople in the East), but usually accompanied the emperors on campaign. (b) Diocesan field armies (comitatus). These were based in strategic regions, <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> frontiers. (c) Border armies (exercitus limitanei).|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} receivers are {{the wide}} receivers (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide receivers line up <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main {{goal of the}} wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback, but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.|$|E
5|$|There are {{municipal}} {{parks in}} all four boroughs of Juniata County. There are also five boat launches in the county, {{all of which are}} <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> Juniata River. There are two golf courses in {{the central part of the}} county and one campground in the southern part of the county.|$|E

5|$|Bottom-dwelling and inactive, {{the tiger}} {{catshark}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fishes and invertebrates from <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> sea floor. An oviparous species, the female retains her eggs internally until the embryos are at an advanced state of development, resulting in a relatively short hatching time after laying. Between 12 and 22 encapsulated eggs are produced at a time, which the female attaches to the bottom. The tiger catshark is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers but has no economic value. It has been listed as Data Deficient by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), pending more information.|$|E
5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs also make up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E

2500|$|Vallejo has a mild {{mediterranean}} climate {{that is a}} mix between the cooler coastal climate and the hotter-summer interior areas. Vallejo is influenced by its position on the east shore of San Pablo Bay, but is less sheltered from inland heatwaves than areas directly <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>nearer</b> <b>the</b> Pacific such as San Francisco and Oakland. Although slightly less marine, average temperatures range between [...] in January and [...] in July. However, summer is very long with July–September being almost equal in historical average temperatures. This seasonal lag sees October averages being higher than in May in spite of it being after the Equinox (meaning less daylight than darkness).|$|R

5|$|Despite {{suffering}} significant persecution {{from their}} peers and the state, Baptists erected their first chapel in Taunton in 1670, <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> current site. This was replaced in 1712 with the building that still stands today. During the 18th century, probably during the ministry of Joseph Jeffries, the chapel's form of worship became Unitarian, although this was forbidden by Parliament until 1813. The Presbyterians of Taunton merged with the Unitarian church in 1814, and later that century the chapel underwent significant renovation.|$|E
5|$|Egg-laying {{takes two}} {{different}} forms {{depending on the}} species. The female in some families has a sharp-edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> water, so she can push her eggs inside. In other families such as clubtails (Gomphidae), cruisers (Macromiidae), emeralds (Corduliidae), and skimmers (Libellulidae), the female lays eggs by tapping {{the surface of the}} water repeatedly with her abdomen, by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along, or by placing the eggs on vegetation. In a few species, the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water, and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed.|$|E
5|$|Found <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There {{is little evidence}} for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. Other studies though have found no such pattern. It is possible that {{areas such as the}} waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
50|$|Benthos is the {{community}} of organisms that live <b>on,</b> in, <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> seabed, {{also known as the}} benthic zone. This community lives in <b>or</b> <b>near</b> marine sedimentary environments, from tidal pools along the foreshore, out to the continental shelf, and then down to the abyssal depths.|$|R

5|$|It is a migratory {{passerine}} which {{winters in}} southern and western Europe, southern Asia and north Africa. Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named onomatopoeically for its simple chiff-chaff song. It {{has a number}} of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends his territory against rivals, and attacks potential predators.|$|E
5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> continental margin (perhaps {{as a result}} of transcurrent extension, or of a slab window). All current models then have Siletzia rifting away from the continental edge about a northern pivot.|$|E
5|$|The Presidential Inaugural Committee {{and members}} of the 111th U.S.Congress {{distributed}} invitations and color-coded tickets to both dignitaries and ordinary citizens for the reserved sections <b>on</b> <b>or</b> <b>near</b> <b>the</b> U.S.Capitol grounds to view the swearing-in ceremony. Invitations and tickets were sent to ambassadors and chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses, but not to other representatives of foreign countries, and invitations were distributed to U.S.politicians and an array of dignitaries across the spectrum of business and industry. House and Senate congressional members distributed free tickets for the inaugural ceremony to the public by lottery or on a first‑come, first served basis because of overwhelming requests to attend the event.|$|E
