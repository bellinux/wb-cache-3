After fitting-out in Rhode Island, she set <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> maiden voyage 6 January 1800 sailing in company with Essex to escort merchant ships to the East Indies.

In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human.

500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to be doing is to be <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. And she {{might not even be}} killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some of those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

On the way, Meteor struck a coral reef off Gonâve Island, though she was able to get <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> own power.

500|$|Sir Timothy Shelley {{gave his}} {{grandson}} Percy Florence {{an increase in}} his allowance for his twenty-first birthday, allowing Mary Shelley and Percy Florence to plan a second, longer trip to the Continent. In June 1842, Mary Shelley and her son left for a fourteen-month tour. They were accompanied by {{a few of his}} friends: Alexander Andrew Knox, a poet and classicist, whom Emily Sunstein, a biographer of Mary Shelley, describes as [...] "reminiscent of [...] Shelley"; Henry Hugh Pearson, a musician who had written musical accompaniments for several of Percy Shelley's poems; and Robert Leslie Ellis. Mary Shelley hoped that the easy manners of the other young men would rub <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> awkward son, but instead they became petty and jealous of each other. The group visited Liège, Cologne, Coblenz, Mainz, Frankfurt, Kissingen, Berlin, Dresden, Prague, Salzburg, the Tyrol, Innsbruck, Riva, Verona, Venice, Florence, and Rome. In Rome, Mary Shelley toured museums with the French art critic Alex Rio; Percy Florence was unimpressed with the culture and refused to see the art, infuriating his mother, who spent an increasing amount of her time seeing the country with Knox instead. She also paid numerous visits to Percy Bysshe Shelley's grave in Rome. After two months in the Sorrento Peninsula, the group was short of money; Percy Florence and his friends returned home while Mary Shelley went on to Paris.|$|E

She is often embarrassed and disapproving of her eccentric family: of her father's poor parenting skills and buffoonish personality; her mother's stereotypical image and social ineptitude; and her brother's delinquent and low-brow nature. She is also concerned that Maggie may {{grow up to be}} {{like the rest of the}} family and tries to teach her complex ideas. Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that [...] "Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit [...] but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in: her family. It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability, meaning, contentment." [...] Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] (season six, 1995), in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fiancé. In the episode [...] "Mother Simpson" [...] (season seven, 1995) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time. Mona is also well-read and articulate, and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa's intelligence.|$|E
