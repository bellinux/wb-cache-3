Among the examined complexes, the Ru-complex 1 [*]a, RuCl(4) (dppb), showed the best activity, reducing N-aryl and N-alkyl imines to the related amines in high yields (up to 100 [*]%) with a catalyst loading of 0. 1 - 1  mol% and under mild conditions (5  atm H 2, 40 - 70 [*]°C). The Os-complexes exhibited a lower activity than their ruthenium analogues. Despite this, the Os-complex 2 [*]a, <b>OsCl(4)</b> (dppb), was successful in the reduction of N-benzylideneaniline at 70 [*]°C, affording a rare example of application of osmium complexes in the catalytic hydrogenation of imines...|$|E
