5|$|As the Mk. XIV could {{calculate}} {{the effects of}} a shallow climb or dive (or glide as it is referred to in bombing), the computor included its own levelling mechanism. This was added to the range angle calculated by the computor to move the sight head. Levelling the system required adjustment of both the computor and the sight head. Since these were in a fixed relationship to each other, levelling could be carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and then left alone. Any adjustments required were recorded on a card fixed {{to the front of the}} computor.|$|E
5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore them <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> He continued to experience jams and his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E

Mulder and Scully arrive at Theresa's house {{to find it}} being {{investigated}} by police, with Billy informing them that Theresa was taken {{in the night and}} that nobody knows what happened. Scully suddenly feels nauseous, much to Billy's concern, but she quickly shakes it off. Later, while investigating the reported crash site, Scully is lifted and shaken just as Gary was. Mulder finds her nearly passed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first {{prototype}} pylon {{was developed}} by Martin Jehart of Bellutti Protection Systems, an Austrian engineering firm specializing in the manufacturing of technical materials and tarpaulin. They initially used a latex balloon for crash tests and aerodynamic studies and after many tests and research settled {{on the use of}} a combination of different materials, the crucial component being spinnaker ripstop nylon, an extremely lightweight and flexible material used for making sails for boats. This would prove to be a breakthrough {{in the development of the}} Air Gates producing a pylon that would rip instantaneously when hit by a plane. Over 70 tests of the pylon were carried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> using a car with a wing strapped on the roof before they were ready to undergo tests with a real plane. Eight different cars were used in these tests as well as a trailer and truck. Hungarian pilot, Péter Besenyei worked closely with the team and attempted the first deliberate pylon hit in early 2003 with positive results. The first Air Gates, which were cylindrical, were finally ready to be used at the very first Red Bull Air Races held in Austria and Hungary later that year.|$|E

25|$|Retrograde orbit: An orbit with an {{inclination}} of {{more than}} 90°. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit, few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them {{is much greater than}} for a prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} Anglo-Saxon {{cremation}} is still debated; {{based on an}} examination of cremated remains at Illington, Calvin Wells speculated that at that site, the bodies had been laid <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> with a pyre then built {{on top of them}} before being set alight. Wells believed that this would explain why the shoulder tips of corpses at the site were not always properly cremated. This idea was criticised by Jacqueline McKinley, who argued that such a process would lack sufficient oxygen to cremate the entire body. Instead she argued that Anglo-Saxon cremation pyres were most likely a criss-cross of timbers filled with brushwood, with the corpse laid on top. The process of cremating the body would likely have been visible to onlookers, creating a connection between living and dead.|$|E
25|$|Each team {{consisted}} of 40 to 50 men. The best players were highly prized, and villages gave them houses, planted their fields for them, and overlooked their misdeeds {{in an effort}} to keep such players on their teams. Players scored one point if they hit the goalpost with the ball, and two points if the ball landed in the nest. Eleven points won the game. Play was rough: players would pile on fallen players, walk on them, kick them, including in the face, pull on arms and legs and stuff dirt in each other's mouths. Players were told to die before letting go of the ball. They would try to hide the ball in their mouths; other players would choke them or kick them in the stomach to force the ball out. Arms and legs were broken. Players laid <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> would be revived by a bucket of cold water. There were occasional deaths. According to Father Paiva, five games in a row had ended in riots.|$|E
500|$|The Detroit Free Press {{noted that}} Ohio State's players sought {{to slow the}} pace of Michigan's [...] "hurry up" [...] style of play. [...] The paper noted: [...] "On almost every {{scrimmage}} some Ohio man would stretch <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> and take his full time. This playing for wind was so apparent that the Michigan players finally burlesqued it. The Ohio men could not stand the gaff, and their doctors and trainer ran more yards than both teams put together." [...] After the game, coach Yost commented on Ohio State's tactic: [...] "Their laying down for time took much of the vim out of our team, and rested their tired out players." ...|$|E

500|$|Each ten foot {{diameter}} balloon {{was filled}} with one-third oxygen and two-thirds hydrogen. To do this, the empty balloon was spread <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> with plenty of room around it. It was then attached to a hose to start filling with oxygen gas. The {{other end of the}} hose went to a retort that {{was filled with}} chlorinate of potassium and a small amount of manganese oxide. The retort was heated to a high temperature through a gasoline burner. Oxygen gas, generated at 600 cubic feet per hour, went through a lime-water wash and from there to fill the balloon. The balloon was filled up one third of the way. The hose was then connected to the hydrogen gas generator and filled up the remaining two-thirds of the way. The oxygen and hydrogen balloon was referred to as an [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloon. Each gas had an electric fuse detonator inside, which made it a type of [...] "bomb" [...] when triggered electrically. Wires were used that led from the ground to the balloon and when an electrical charge was made by a dynamo, it passed through the wires to set off the detonator causing an explosion that was brighter than the sun. This caused the oxygen and hydrogen to react, creating water (H2O). This man-made water then acted as a nucleus for making rain out of the atmosphere.|$|E
