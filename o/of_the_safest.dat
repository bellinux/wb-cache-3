The park provides more than 10,000 jobs to over 500 students and thousands of alumni. Main Campus is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> branches nationally in comparison of all branches in the US. The percent of crimes in Main Campus decreased from 0.12% (in 2010) to 0.07% (in 2014) crimes per year. The most often crimes detected on Main Campus were burglary, motor vehicle theft, and aggravated assault.|$|E

5|$|The {{seat was}} made more {{competitive}} in the 1997 boundary review by {{the formation of the}} North West Cambridgeshire seat, which incorporated the rural land outside Peterborough and several Conservative-inclined wards from the city. Since its formation, North West Cambridgeshire has been one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> Conservative seats in the country, whilst Peterborough was ranked 93rd in the Conservatives's one hundred most vulnerable seats (the ones which the other parties must take {{if there is to be}} a change of government) and 73rd on Labour's target list; these factors led Mawhinney to stand in North West Cambridgeshire instead.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch is {{represented}} by a single parliamentary constituency in the House of Commons. The seat was created in 1983 from parts of the Christchurch and Lymington, North Dorset and New Forest constituencies. It had been held by Robert Adley (Conservative) since its creation {{until his death in}} 1993. At the by-election Diana Maddock (Liberal Democrat) was elected in one of the largest ever swings (35.4%) against the sitting party. The seat was retaken by Conservative candidate Christopher Chope in 1997 and retained in 2001 and 2005. In the 2010 general election, Chope retained his seat with a considerable majority of 15,410 and 56.4% of the vote, making Christchurch one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> Conservative constituencies in the country. The Liberal Democrats won 25.3% of the vote, Labour 9.8% and the Independence Party 8.5%. Christchurch is part of the South West England constituency for elections to the European Parliament.|$|E
5|$|St. John's has {{traditionally}} been one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> cities in Canada to live; however, in recent years crime in the city has steadily increased. While nationally crime decreased by 4% in 2009, the total crime rate in St. John's saw an increase of 4%. During this same time violent crime in the city decreased 6%, compared to a 1% decrease nationally. In 2010 the total crime severity index for the city was 101.9, an increase of 10% from 2009 and 19.2% above the national average. The violent crime severity index was 90.1, an increase of 29% from 2009 and 1.2% above the national average. St. John's had the seventh-highest metropolitan crime index and twelfth-highest metropolitan violent crime index {{in the country in}} 2010.|$|E

5|$|Statistics {{regarding}} {{crime rates}} in the Bay Area generally fall into two categories: violent crime and property crime. Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also {{the source of the}} most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, which was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>safest</b> large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City.|$|E
