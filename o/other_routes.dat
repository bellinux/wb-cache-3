5|$|In 1898, {{the first}} motor bus service in Buckinghamshire began running between Newport Pagnell and Olney, {{followed}} by numerous <b>other</b> <b>routes,</b> which took traffic {{away from the}} railway line. Despite this, the LNWR considered electrification of the line in 1904, believing such a scheme would bring about considerable savings, but the idea never materialised.|$|E
5|$|NY270 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.

5|$|The NY9N {{designation}} {{was originally}} created {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to replace New York State Route9W, a route assigned to an alternate routing of US9 from Elizabethtown to Keeseville. NY9N was extended southward to Lake George in March1936 and to Saratoga Springs in the early 1950s, supplanting several <b>other</b> <b>routes</b> (including New York State Route9K) in the process.|$|E
5|$|The train {{entered the}} regular revenue service on November 11, 1934, between Kansas City, Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; and Lincoln, Nebraska. It {{operated}} this and <b>other</b> <b>routes</b> until its retirement in 1960, {{when it was}} donated to Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry, where it remains on public display. The train is generally regarded as the first successful streamliner on American railroads.|$|E

5|$|This highway {{has been}} {{associated}} with emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Sher Shah Suri, the latter became synonymous with this route due to his role in ensuring the safety of the travelers and the upkeep of the road. Emperor Sher Shah widened and realigned the road to <b>other</b> <b>routes,</b> and provided approximately 1700 roadside inns through his empire. These inns provided free food and lodgings to the travelers regardless of their status.|$|E
5|$|A 1985 {{government}} committee, led by State Secretary Per Arne Watle, {{recommended that}} more route be flown by both Braathens SAFE and SAS, and that additional airlines {{be allowed to}} start <b>other</b> <b>routes.</b> On 5 September 1985, Braathens SAFE applied for the route Trondheim – Bodø – Harstad/Narvik – Tromsø and Tromsø–Longyearbyen. SAS had stated that it was fine with them if other airlines started flying international routes they did not, and on 17 October Braathens SAFE also applied for the routes Bergen–Stavanger–Paris, Bergen–Stavanger–Manchester, Oslo–Stavanger–Brussels and Trondheim–Bergen–Newcastle. The applications were rejected and it was agreed upon that SAS would retain all rights to fly internationally between Oslo, Bergen, Stavanger, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Århus.|$|E
5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} fly to unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on <b>other</b> <b>routes.</b> With free competition, {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, it was {{anticipated}} that traffic {{through the tunnel}} would rise on {{the completion of the}} M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that <b>other</b> <b>routes</b> in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel. In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels {{would not be able to}} cope with the full demands of a completed M25.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Washington {{unveiled}} a new numbering system for highways. Concurrencies with state primary state highways would be repealed in 1970 and US410 {{would be a}} non-concurrent highway. On June20, 1967, US12 was extended west from Lewiston, Idaho, over White Pass to Aberdeen, eliminating most of the original route of the highway. The remaining sections were split amongst <b>other</b> <b>routes.</b> The segment from Elma to Olympia became State Route8 (SR8). Interstate5 (I-5) took the Olympia–Tacoma segment, and the Tacoma–Naches segment became SR410. The last reassurance markers for US410 were taken down by December 1967.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, {{plans to}} extend the freeway portion of SR 78 east from the Broadway {{interchange}} through Escondido were delayed by Caltrans director Jacob Dekema {{due to a lack}} of funding until 1980. However, in 1970, the community raised concerns about the number of buildings that would need to be destroyed, as the freeway would go through a dense urban area. <b>Other</b> <b>routes,</b> including routing SR78 along I-15 south, were proposed. The majority of the Escondido City Council supported sending representatives to the upcoming California Coastal Commission meeting in January 1971 to expedite the process of construction.|$|E

5|$|Maritime trade {{began with}} safer coastal trade and evolved with the {{manipulation}} of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states buffered it from blockages on <b>other</b> <b>routes.</b> By making use of the maritime trade routes, bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.|$|E
5|$|On March18, 1980, the NY47 {{designation}} {{was eliminated}} and split into four <b>other</b> <b>routes.</b> From NY104 in Greece to I-490, NY47 became NY390. The section from I-490 south to NY383 was designated {{as part of}} I-390; however, it would not connect to the existing portion of I-390 south of Rochester until 1981, when the interchange between I-390 and I-590 was completed. The segment of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue north to the Can of Worms became part of I-590, which continued southwest along the freeway to Winton Road. From the Can of Worms to Lake Ontario, NY47 was redesignated NY590.|$|E
