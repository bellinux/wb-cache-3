5|$|Immediately {{after the}} collapse, help came from mutual {{aid in the}} seven-county Minneapolis–Saint Paul {{metropolitan}} area and emergency response personnel, charities, and volunteers. Within a few days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) planned a replacement bridge, the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge. Construction was completed rapidly, and it opened on September 18, 2008.|$|E

5|$|The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially {{known as}} Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane, steel truss arch bridge that carried Interstate 35W across the Saint Anthony Falls of the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. During the evening rush hour on August 1, 2007, it {{suddenly}} collapsed, killing 13 people and injuring 145. The bridge was Minnesota's third busiest, carrying 140,000 vehicles daily. The NTSB cited a design flaw as the likely cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> noting that a too-thin gusset plate ripped along {{a line of}} rivets, and asserted that additional weight on the bridge at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> contributed to the catastrophic failure.|$|E

5|$|The Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) is {{assisting}} the coroner's office in investigating the two deaths. Once completed, the OPP could launch a criminal investigation, if warranted.

5|$|A {{neutron star}} {{is a highly}} dense remnant of a star that is {{primarily}} composed of neutrons—a particle that is found in most atomic nuclei and has no net electrical charge. The mass of a neutron star is {{in the range of}} 1.2 to 2.1 times the mass of the Sun. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> a newly formed neutron star can have a very rapid rate of rotation; on the order of a hundred rotations per second.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Muslim {{leaders of the}} Caucasus united to create the Transcaucasian Federation {{in the winter of}} 1918. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had drastic {{consequences}} for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia. The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to the proclamation of the Republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The negotiators for Armenia were from the ARF.|$|E
5|$|Black {{takes his}} family to the {{woodland}} cabin, where he and Catherine decide that the dose of vaccine {{should be given to}} Jordan. Black and Catherine discuss how they would handle infection; Catherine asks to be euthanized, Black states he would wander off to die alone. That night, Catherine wakes up, experiencing symptoms of the disease. She quietly leaves the cabin and walks into the forest. The next morning, Black wakes up, and finding blood on Catherine's pillow, realizes she has gone.

30|$|After an earthquake, {{the walls}} and the regular {{geometric}} structure of collapsed buildings are damaged, and <b>the</b> most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings is <b>the</b> ruins, so the dominant scattering mechanism collapsed buildings can be approximately regarded as the volume scattering from randomly oriented dipoles. Because most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings are ruins, there is little POA shift for <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings, and <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> POA compensation cannot greatly change <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> scattering components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings. However, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> POA shift <b>of</b> oriented buildings, <b>the</b> employment <b>of</b> POA compensation can enhance the double-bounce scattering power and weaken the volume scattering power. That is, <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> POA compensation can greatly change <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> scattering components <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oriented buildings. Therefore, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amplitude values <b>of</b> CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oriented buildings are greater than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings. <b>The</b> difference <b>of</b> CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol between <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings and oriented buildings can be used to distinguish them. During <b>the</b> three parameters <b>of</b> CRDbl, CRVol, and CRDbl–Vol, <b>the</b> difference <b>of</b> CRDbl–Vol between <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings and oriented buildings is greatest, so CRDbl–Vol is used to discriminate <b>the</b> <b>collapsed</b> buildings in this paper.|$|R

5|$|In 2009, Favre surpassed {{defensive}} end Jim Marshall for starts at any position with his record-breaking 271st {{start as a}} quarterback as the Vikings played the Lions. His streak ended at 297, with the last start in the streak coming on December 5, 2010 against the Buffalo Bills. Favre was unable to start the Vikings' December 13 game against the New York Giants due to a shoulder injury, despite the game being delayed for a day because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Metrodome roof.|$|E
5|$|On November 25, 1999, {{the date}} that Bonfire would have burned, Aggies instead held a vigil and remembrance ceremony. Over 40,000people lit candles and {{observed}} {{up to two}} hours of silence at the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> before walking to Kyle Field for yell practice. At the stadium, fans spontaneously relit their candles as the Parsons Mounted Cavalry fired the Aggie cannon twelve times, once for each victim. Former President George H. W. Bush, his wife Barbara, Texas Governor George W. Bush, and his wife Laura attended the remembrance ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Since {{its design}} {{does not meet}} current highway bridge standards, Pulaski Skyway is {{considered}} functionally obsolete, In 2007, it was rated structurally deficient. The 2007 collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in Minneapolis raised concerns about {{the stability of the}} skyway, one of eight New Jersey bridges with similar design features. Within days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse,</b> NJDOT announced that it would start a previously planned one-year, $10-million project to make critical repairs. The work was the first phase of a planned 10-year, $200-million interim renovation project, the first significant repairs since 1984.|$|E

5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1999 {{collapse}} of Bonfire was witnessed {{by thousands of}} people around the world. The Texas A Department of Computer Science set up a camera aimed at the Bonfire site that took a picture every 10minutes and posted it on the Internet.

5|$|The Bonfire Memorial Commission {{collected}} {{the hundreds of}} thousands of items that were left by grieving visitors at the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse.</b> At the Systems Building, Texas A leaders erected pictures of the deceased students. There, over a dozen seniors left behind their Aggie rings, permanently donating them to the students who did not live long enough to earn their own. Various organizations also established funds in memory of the victims and to help with expenses incurred because of the accident. In total, the funds received exceeded US$250,000.|$|E
