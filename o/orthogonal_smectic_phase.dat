40|$|The {{fundamental}} parameter of the uniaxial liquid {{crystalline state}} that governs {{nearly all of}} its physical properties is the primary orientational order parameter (S) for the long axes of molecules {{with respect to the}} director. The biaxial liquid crystals (LCs) possess biaxial order parameters depending on the phase symmetry of the system. In this paper we show that in the first approximation a biaxial <b>orthogonal</b> <b>smectic</b> <b>phase</b> can be described by two primary order parameters: S for the long axes and C for the ordering of the short axes of molecules. The temperature dependencies of S and C are obtained by the Haller 2 ̆ 7 s extrapolation technique through measurements of the optical birefringence and biaxiality on a nontilted polar antiferroelectric (Sm-AP A) phase of a homologous series of LCs built from the bent-core achiral molecules. For such a biaxial smectic phase both S and C, particularly the temperature dependency of the latter, are being experimentally determined. Results show that S in the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>smectic</b> <b>phase</b> composed of bent cores is higher than in Sm-A calamatic LCs and C is also significantly large...|$|E
40|$|Antiferro- and ferro-electric {{ordering}} {{has been}} discovered in orthogonal smectic phases composed of nonchiral bent-core molecules. These systems are the only proper fluid ferroelectrics confirmed experimentally so far. We consider a molecular theory of proper ferroelectric ordering in isotropic, nematic and smectic A phases and conclude that the delicate balance between the tendencies for local parallel and antiparallel ordering of molecular electric and steric dipoles is strongly shifted in restricted geometries. This is a reason why dipolar ordering {{is more likely to}} occur within a smectic layer. We derive model interaction potentials for polar bent-core molecules and present the results of the mean-field theory of ferroelectric ordering in the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>smectic</b> <b>phase</b> taking into account also the molecular biaxiality. Order parameter profiles have been calculated numerically and phase diagrams are presented which enable one to analyze the relative importance of dipole-dipole interaction and intermolecular attraction modulated by polar bent-core molecular shape...|$|E

Introduction Biaxial nematic phases have been a subject of great interest {{for some time and}} this interest is increasing as the chase for undisputed thermotropic biaxial nematics continues [1]. Part of this focused attention comes from the possibility of technological applications in the fast display area [2], but much of the fascination of the subject certainly originates from the basic research arena and from the hiatus between theoretical [3] and experimental predictions [4, 5]. Biaxial nematics are not theoretically forbidden and indeed have been predicted to exist, and thus to be the most stable phase in a certain range of thermodynamic conditions, by various approximate theories, mainly on the basis of considerations of orientational order and of orientational free energy[3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Monte Carlo simulations of systems of interacting biaxial centers placed on a lattice [11, 12] have essentially confirmed these predictions and the phase diagram obtained [12] has shown a biaxial region where the biaxial phase is stable compared to both the uniaxial nematic and isotropic ones. However, as we have already mentioned, none of the low molecular mass thermotropic biaxial nematics put forward [13] appears to have been universally accepted as such. Indeed various of the compounds classified as biaxial nematics {{on the basis of their}} optical behavior have shown no detectable biaxiality when examined with deuterium NMR [4, 5]. Such a [...] ...|$|E

Two new {{homologous}} series of isomeric achiral five-ring bent-core compounds containing 3, 4 -disubstituted biphenyl moiety have been synthesised and the mesophases that they exhibit characterised.

This change seems to {{have a profound effect on}} the mesophase properties. Interestingly, for compounds of series A containing the long terminal chain, a transition between two polar <b>orthogonal</b> <b>smectic</b> <b>phases</b> has been observed. The observed mesophases have been characterised using a combination of polarised light optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction studies and electro-optical measurements.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{order of}} the mesogens in the smectic liquid-crystalline (LC) and smectic-crystalline phases of different poly(ester imide) s (PEI) with similar chemical structure is investigated by means of X-ray fiber patterns. During the fiber spinning from the melt, the <b>smectic</b> LC <b>phase</b> is frozen. Above the glass transition temperature, a transition into a higher-ordered smectic-crystalline phase occurs. The PEI {{which are based on}} aminobenzoic acid trimellitimide and long aliphatic spacers form exclusively <b>orthogonal</b> <b>smectic</b> <b>phases</b> (SA, SB, SE). In contrast, the PEI based on aminocinnamic acid trimellitimide and those derived from 4 -hydroxyphthalic acid, aminophenol, and aliphatic dicarbon acids form tilted SC phases. The layer line broadening of the X-ray reflections indicates a poor lateral {{order of the}} smectic layers in the LC phase due to a frequent inversion of the staggering direction between adjacent mesogens. As a result of the equatorial smearing of the four-point-pattern, the splitting angle of the reflections is not identical with the tilt angle between the mesogens and the normal of the smectic layer plane. The order of the mesogens in the direction perpendicular to the fiber axis is evaluated {{on the basis of the}} paracrystallinity model. The resulting local tilt angle corresponds to an average staggering amount of the mesogens. Furthermore, the parameter ε, introduced by Porod, is interpreted as a probability for the inversion of the staggering direction...|$|R

40|$|The rich {{mesophase}} polymorhism and {{the phase}} sequence of board-like colloids depends critically on their shape anisometry. Implementing extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we calculated the full phase diagram of sterically interacting board-like particles, {{for a range}} of experimentally accessible molecular dimensions/anisometries of colloids of this shape. A variety of self organized mesophases including uniaxial and biaxial nematics, smectic, cubatic and columnar phases have been identified. Our results demonstrate clearly that the molecular anisometry influences critically not only the structure and the symmetry of the mesophases but also, and perhaps more interestingly, the phase sequence among them. New classes of phase sequences such as nematic-nematic and, for the first time, a direct transition from a discotic and a biaxial nematic to an <b>orthogonal</b> <b>smectic</b> A <b>phase</b> have been identified.

40|$|A {{new series}} of dimeric chiral antiferroelectric {{materials}} using a trisiloxane as the central connecting linker and having fluorinated tails has been synthesized together with their corresponding monomers. Spacer lengths of 3 — 6 and 11 methylene groups were used. As a comparison to see {{the effect of the}} siloxane length on the phase behaviour, one dimer with a tetrasiloxane core was also synthesized. Monomers with 3 — 6 carbons in the spacer showed just <b>orthogonal</b> <b>smectic</b> <b>phases</b> and only the long 11 carbon spacer 7 F 4 PPB 11 showed tilted phases in a very similar way to what was found in the unfluorinated monomers previously studied. All trisiloxanes showed a high temperature antiferroelectric phase and those with a spacer length of 4 or more carbons also showed one or two columnar antiferroelectric phases when decreasing the temperature. The spontaneous polarisation Ps was high, especially in the columnar phases where it ranged from 800 — 1200 nC/cm 2 and upward. The apparent tilt angles were exceptionally high, above 45 degrees for all materials studied. In accordance with the trend described previously, the tetrasiloxane containing dimer showed a ferroelectric phase at high temperature. But in this case the columnar phase was found to be antiferroelectric. Hence, the general idea that trisiloxane cores promote antiferroelectricity and tetrasiloxanes promote the ferroelectric phase is still correct also for these materials in the SmC* phase, but not for the columnar phase. It can also be noted that the phase separation between siloxane, fluorinated tail and mesogenic parts of the molecules was so high that the material became columnar on lowering the temperature...|$|R
