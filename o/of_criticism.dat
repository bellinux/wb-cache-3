5|$|Peter Adamson offered {{several more}} {{possible}} lines <b>of</b> <b>criticism.</b> He {{pointed out that}} Avicenna adopts a piecemeal approach to prove the necessary existent, and then derives God's traditional attribute from it one at a time. This makes each of the arguments subject to separate assessments. Some might accept the proof for the necessary existent while rejecting the other arguments; such a critic could still reject the existence of God. Another type <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> might attack the proof of the necessary existent itself. Such a critic might reject Avicenna's conception of contingency, a starting point in the original proof, {{by saying that the}} universe could just happen to exist without being necessary or contingent on an external cause.|$|E

5|$|As {{the spring}} of 1794 approached, the Committee of Public Safety, led by Robespierre, Couthon, Lebas and Saint-Just, {{exercised}} near complete control over the government. Despite the vast reach of their powers, however, rivals and enemies remained. One of the thorniest problems, at least to Robespierre, came {{in the shape of}} the populist agitator Jacques Hébert, who discharged torrents <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> against bourgeois Jacobinism in his newspaper, Le Père Duchesne. Ultra-radical Hébertists in the Cordeliers Club undermined Jacobin efforts to court and manage the sans-culottes, and the most extreme Hébertists even called openly for insurrection.|$|E
5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism and specifically {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his Anatomy <b>of</b> <b>Criticism.</b> According to this literary theory, contemporary works are not independent but {{are part of an}} underlying pattern that re-invents and adapts a finite number of timeless concepts and structures of meaning. In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization while using contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Josephson took up {{transcendental}} meditation {{and turned his}} attention to issues outside the boundaries of mainstream science. He set up the Mind–Matter Unification Project at the Cavendish to explore the idea of intelligence in nature, the relationship between quantum mechanics and consciousness, and the synthesis of science and Eastern mysticism, broadly known as quantum mysticism. Those interests have led him to express support for topics such as parapsychology, water memory and cold fusion, and have made him a focus <b>of</b> <b>criticism</b> from fellow scientists.|$|E
