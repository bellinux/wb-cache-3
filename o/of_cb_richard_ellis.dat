50|$|The mall {{would receive}} its first serious {{challenge}} in 1996 when First Colony Mall opened in nearby Sugar Land. Though First Colony's opening had done more economic {{damage to the}} Sharpstown and Westwood malls in Southwest Houston (the latter of which would close over one year later), the new mall drew away many of West Oaks' customers from rapidly growing Fort Bend County, but still continued to draw some shoppers from this area due {{to the presence of}} stores that did not have locations at the new mall including Sears and some specialty stores which did not open locations at First Colony Mall. To compete with First Colony, West Oaks underwent a renovation that removed several features including a tall clock at the intersection of the Arcade and the Dillard's/JCPenney concourse, an elevated seating area in the food court used as a smoking area, all of the mall's fountains, and the original dark brown tile in the mall's inline corridor.

Sanford Criner, an executive vice president <b>of</b> <b>CB</b> <b>Richard</b> <b>Ellis,</b> said that the move would negatively affect Greenspoint area.

[...] Drake added that Greenspoint's prime office space is virtually occupied, so if Exxon leaves, it would be replaced by expansion from existing companies and additions of new companies.|$|E
