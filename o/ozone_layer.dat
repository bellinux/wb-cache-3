40|$|Abstract. The air layer {{between the}} nocturnal {{boundary}} layer {{and the top}} of the daily mixing layer in an ozone-polluted area is known to serve as an ozone reservoir since the ozone that is produced in the mixing layer on the pre-ceding day is effectively preserved throughout the night in the air <b>layer.</b> <b>Ozone</b> reservoir <b>layers</b> existing at night can enhance the accumulation of surface ozone on the following day.

5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{reactions}} led to {{the first}} self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted {{in the development of}} complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer,</b> life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} {{has significantly}} altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} ozone transects {{measured}} {{each year from}} 1987 to 1990 over the western Pacific and eastern Indian oceans between mid-November and mid-December shows a prominent ozone maximum reaching 50 - 80 ppbv between 5 and 10 km in the 20 degrees S- 40 degrees S latitude band. This maximum contrasts with ozone mixing ratios lower than 20 ppbv measured at the same altitudes in equatorial regions. Analyses with a global chemical transport model suggest that these elevated ozone values {{are part of a}} large-scale tropospheric ozone plume extending from Africa to the western Pacific across the Indian ocean. These plumes occur several months after the peak in biomass burning influence and during a period of high lightning activity in the Southern Hemisphere tropical belt. The composition and geographical extent of these plumes are similar to the <b>ozone</b> <b>layers</b> previously encountered during the biomass burning season in this region. Our model results suggest that production of nitrogen oxides from lightning strokes sustains the NO(x) (= NO + NO(2)) levels and the ozone photochemical production required in the upper troposphere to form these persistent elevated <b>ozone</b> <b>layers</b> emanating from biomass burning regions...|$|R
40|$|For {{this to be}} true, {{carryover}} of ozone, {{apparent in}} changes of ozone concentrations aloft {{from one day to}} the next, should experience day-of-the-week variations. Without the impact of <b>ozone</b> <b>layers</b> aloft, <b>ozone</b> concentrations at ground level should decline from previous day's level. Two-day old <b>ozone</b> <b>layers</b> aloft should impact ground level ozone concentrations. We report evidence of these three phenomena. During the 1997 Southern California Ozone Study (SCOS 97 -NARSTO), we operated a Dasibi 1003 -AH ultra-violet photometry ozone analyzer at the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) headquarter tower in central Los Angeles [198 meters mean sea level (msl), roughly 90 meters above ground level (agl) ]. On July 18, 1997, ARB audit team invalidated these data because the temperature of the analyzer compartment was not recorded, data logger was inoperative, and the inlet was not 1 meter away from the building; analyzer deviated by 8 % from the true value. For these reasons, the data did not meet federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines. ARB has tested these ozone analyzers at very high temperatures confirming they would not produce erroneous data; we thus have confidence in ARCO tower ozone data. The South Coast Air Qualit...|$|R

5|$|Wesley, aware the Enterprise is in orbit, {{arranges}} for {{the children}} to passively resist. When the Aldeans request Picard's help to resolve the issue with the children, the crew finds a way to beam through the shield, allowing Commander Riker and Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) to sneak onto the planet. Data manages to disable the Custodian, disrupting the Aldean's transporter and planetary shield. Dr. Crusher explains to the Aldeans that their shield has weakened the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> of their planet, exposing the inhabitants to ultraviolet radiation that has left them unable to bear children. The radiation would likely have the same effects on the children from the Enterprise. Without the planetary shield, the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> will naturally return, allowing the Aldeans to reproduce again. The Aldeans recognize the error of their ways and return the children to the Enterprise.

5|$|A near-Earth {{supernova}} is {{a supernova}} {{close enough to}} the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere.

Gamma rays from a supernova would induce a chemical reaction in the upper atmosphere converting molecular nitrogen into nitrogen oxides, depleting the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> enough to expose the surface to harmful ultraviolet solar radiation. This has been proposed as the cause of the Ordovician–Silurian extinction, which resulted in the death of nearly 60% of the oceanic life on Earth.|$|E

Indeed, his focus on humans, and issues of being human, (which include Ethiopia, Chernobyl, <b>ozone</b> <b>layers,</b> global warming, and like matters), gives the sequence an appealing and sobering humility that similar fantasies frequently fail to achieve because of the super-human nature of their characters and their huge deeds.|$|R
5|$|A typical core {{collapse}} supernova at {{the distance}} of Eta Carinae would peak at an apparent magnitude around −4, similar to Venus. A SLSN could be five magnitudes brighter, potentially the brightest supernova in recorded history (currently SN 1006). At 7,500 light-years from the star {{it is unlikely to}} directly affect terrestrial lifeforms, as they will be protected from gamma rays by the atmosphere and from some other cosmic rays by the magnetosphere. The main damage would be restricted to the upper atmosphere, the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer,</b> spacecraft, including satellites, and any astronauts in space. At least one paper has projected that complete loss of the Earth's <b>ozone</b> <b>layer</b> is a plausible consequence of a supernova, which would result in a significant increase in UV radiation reaching Earth's surface from the Sun. This would require a typical supernova to be closer than 50 light-years from Earth, and even a potential hypernova would need to be closer than Eta Carinae. Another analysis of the possible impact discusses more subtle effects from the unusual illumination, such as possible melatonin suppression with resulting insomnia and increased risk of cancer and depression. It concludes that a supernova of this magnitude would have to be much closer than Eta Carinae to have any type of major impact on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere.

Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the <b>ozone</b> <b>layer,</b> a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth.

40|$|Application of {{slightly}} modified off-the-shelf {{automatic celestial navigation}} systems ('star trackers') is considered {{for the purposes of}} monitoring variations in the optical depth of the stratospheric aerosol and <b>ozone</b> <b>layers.</b> The basic principle of the technique is to observe stars from an orbiting station as they are occulted by the stratospheric aerosol layer. Since molecular and refraction extinction are directly calculable, total extinction measurements using a dual-sensor (S 4 and S 20) approach allows us to directly solve for ozone and aerosol extinction and look for correlations between these two parameters.

5|$|The Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{is a key}} factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.
