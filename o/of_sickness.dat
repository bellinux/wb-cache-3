5|$|The {{doctrine}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of personal empowerment, proposing that it is God's will for his people to be happy. The atonement (reconciliation with God) is interpreted to include the alleviation <b>of</b> <b>sickness</b> and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} text from the Northern Wei {{period of the}} Northern Celestial Masters is the Laojun Yinsong Jiejing (New Code). This text was revealed to Kou Qianzhi in 415, and is now mostly lost apart from a few fragments. The surviving text contains thirty-six precepts that outline rules which a Daoist had to abide by.

5|$|The wartime economy {{relied heavily}} upon the {{large-scale}} employment of forced labourers. Germany imported and enslaved some 12 million people from 20 European countries {{to work in}} factories and on farms (approximately 75 percent were Eastern European). Many were casualties of Allied bombing, as they received poor air raid protection and poor living conditions led to high rates <b>of</b> <b>sickness,</b> injury and death, as well as sabotage and criminal activity. The wartime economy also relied upon large-scale robbery, initially through the state seizing the property of Jewish citizens and later by also plundering the resources of occupied territories.|$|E
5|$|While {{the events}} in this episode mostly follow the book, {{differences}} in the screen adaptation include not introducing the council's delegation with Ser Barristan and Lord Renly and the conversation between Robert and Eddard taking place during breakfast instead of on horseback. Some scenes were also created for the series, most notably a conversation between Catelyn and Cersei at Bran's bedside remembering the Queen's first child by Robert that died early <b>of</b> <b>sickness</b> (in the novel, when Ned confronts Cersei about Jaime fathering her children, she hinted that her first pregnancy, which was by Robert, she had aborted), and a confrontation between Jaime and Jon before Jon leaves for the Wall.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{fraction}} <b>of</b> long-term <b>sickness</b> absence periods attributable to physical and psychosocial work environmental risk factors. Method: A random population sample was followed for 18 {{months in a}} national register of social transfer payments. Mutually adjusted hazard ratios for onset <b>of</b> long-term <b>sickness</b> absence and aetiological fractions were computed. Results: After mutual adjustment, no significant effect of psychosocial work environment factors remained. In men, 23 % and 28 % <b>of</b> long-term <b>sickness</b> absence were attributable to working mainly standing or squatting, and lifting or carrying loads, respectively. In women, 27 % <b>of</b> long-term <b>sickness</b> absence was attributable to bending or twisting of the neck or back. Conclusions: Physical work environment exposures explained between 10 % and 30 % <b>of</b> long-term <b>sickness</b> absence. The potential for reducing long-term sickness absence is substantial...|$|R

5|$|Officially, {{the only}} {{acceptable}} religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and Utraquist, but Kepler's {{position in the}} imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts <b>of</b> <b>sickness.</b> Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars (Johannes Matthäus Wackher von Wackhenfels, Jost Bürgi, David Fabricius, Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation <b>of</b> <b>sickness,</b> poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E
5|$|Whatever the {{circumstances}} of Domnall's accession, the Uí Chennselaig regime in Dublin was short-lived. The Annals of Inisfallen, the Annals of the Four Masters, and the fifteenthsixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, all reveal that, within the year, Domnall died after a brief illness, with the latter two sources specifying that he succumbed after three nights <b>of</b> <b>sickness.</b> The Annals of Inisfallen and the Annals of Ulster accord him the title King of Dublin, and make no mention of any connection with the Leinster kingship. Upon Domnall's demise, Toirdelbach had his own son, Muirchertach (died 1119), appointed King of Dublin. In so doing, Toirdelbach reinforced his authority in Dublin, and followed a precedent started by Domnall's grandfather, in which a claimant to the high-kingship of Ireland installed his own heir to the kingship of Dublin.|$|E

5|$|The Campaign for Borders Rail {{claimed in}} February 2016 that only 35½% of {{services}} were arriving on time at Tweedbank, {{which made the}} Borders Railway one of ScotRail's most poorly-performing services. In addition, reliability issues with the Class 158 units and traincrew problems resulted {{in at least one}} train being cancelled on 74 of the 143 days between 31 March 2016 and 20 August 2016. This comprised 14 days of severe disruption due to crew shortages, 18 days as a result of issues with the Class 158s and nine days for signalling failures. Crew shortages came about due to higher than expected levels <b>of</b> <b>sickness</b> as well as the difficulty of replacing staff during a popular period for annual leave. Reliability issues with the Class 158s were encountered during hot weather which caused radiators to overheat, particularly on steep gradients with a heavy load, as coolant systems became stressed. To deal with the problem, ScotRail sought to replace the faulty radiators with superior quality models. Signalling problems were mainly due to water ingress into axle counters as well as a faulty telecommunications link coupled with a failure {{on the part of the}} automated fault-finding system to detect the problem locations.|$|E
5|$|This failure, {{coupled with}} the {{disaster}} of the previous month, further soured {{the relations between the}} French and the Venetians. Cooperation was distinctly lacking in the few operations attempted during the next few weeks, while the bad supply situation, the spread <b>of</b> <b>sickness</b> among their troops and the continuous attrition of their forces in the everyday fighting at Candia made the French commanders especially keen to depart. The French contingent eventually departed on 20 August. Two Ottoman assaults on the 25th were repulsed, but to Morosini, {{it was clear that the}} city could no longer be held. After a council of war on 27 August, but without first consulting Venice, it was decided to capitulate. On 5 September 1669, the city was surrendered to the Ottomans, while the survivors of the garrison, the citizens and their treasures were evacuated. On his own initiative, Morosini concluded a permanent peace agreement with the Ottomans, which, under the circumstances, was relatively generous: Venice would retain the Aegean islands of Tinos and Kythera and the isolated island fortresses of Spinalonga, Gramvousa and Souda off the Cretan coast, as well as the gains made in Dalmatia.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} overview {{deals with}} simulator sickness, for example, why it occurs, the symptoms, and what measures can alleviate the symptoms.

There are also individual differences, including sex and age, which can affect sensitivity to simulator sickness. By excluding tight bends, complex environments, start and stop situations in the scenarios, the frequency <b>of</b> simulator <b>sickness</b> is reduced. In short exposures, there is less risk <b>of</b> simulator <b>sickness</b> occurring. Repeated exposures can result in the trial participants getting used to the simulator environment. Also, persons who do not consider themselves to be at all sensitive as regards motion sickness can be affected by simulator sickness, for which reason, previous experience <b>of</b> motion <b>sickness</b> is not a good predictor <b>of</b> simulator <b>sickness.</b> Experience <b>of</b> simulator <b>sickness</b> in VTI's research simulator is summarised.
