5|$|The Smuts {{family were}} prosperous yeoman farmers, {{long-established}} in the area.

5|$|The {{origin of}} Tropical Storm Nicholas {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave that moved off the coast of Africa on October 9. It moved westward, and developed a broad area of low pressure along the wave on October 10. Convection organized around the low early on October 12 while located 800miles (1300km) southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde islands. As upper level winds became more favorable, the system became better organized, though the circulation center initially remained located {{to the west of the}} area of heavy showers. The surface circulation of the large circulation envelope moved towards a position near the western edge of the deepest convection, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Nineteen late on October 13 while located 1,030miles (1,660km) west-southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde islands.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Danielle {{began as}} a {{vigorous}} tropical wave over Africa. As the wave emerged into the Atlantic, it quickly became more organized due to favorable conditions, including low wind shear. The circulation consolidated and spawned Tropical Depression Four {{on the morning of}} August13 south-southeast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde islands. The system was over somewhat cooler water at first with sea surface temperatures around 79°F (26°C); however, the low shear environment allowed the depression to continue to organize. Late that evening, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Danielle.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Igor {{was first}} {{identified}} as a broad {{area of low pressure}} accompanying a tropical wave over western Africa in early September2010. Tracking nearly due west, the system emerged into the eastern Atlantic Ocean on September6. Gradual development took place as convection– thunderstorm activity– consolidated around its center. At 0600UTC on September8, the low was deemed sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression while situated roughly 90mi (140km) southeast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde Islands. Attaining gale-force winds six hours later, the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was subsequently named Igor by the National Hurricane Center (NHC).|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Colony gave him a lot of experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E

5|$|On October2, a {{tropical}} wave spawned {{a tropical}} depression about 815mi (1310km) west-southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde islands.

As the ship crossed through the center, it reported winds of 80mph (130km/h), indicating Gail attained hurricane status. Initially believed to have dissipated and reformed as a new unnamed storm on October 5, in reality Gail continued northwest and then meandered around the central Atlantic before being absorbed by a front on October 12.|$|E
