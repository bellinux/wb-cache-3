The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia.|$|E

5|$|The Orkhon {{inscriptions}} by the Gokturks {{were critical}} of the Turks that had served the Tang Dynasty, and condemned them for helping the Chinese emperor expand his burgeoning empire.

5|$|The Turkic {{soldiers}} and generals that {{worked in the}} Chinese garrisons <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> spurred Turkic migration into the area.

5|$|Horses occur {{naturally}} on the steppes <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia,</b> {{and their}} domestication, around 3,000 BC in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea region, was originally {{as a source}} of meat; use as pack animals and for riding followed. Around the same time, the wild ass was being tamed in Egypt. Camels were domesticated soon after this, with the Bactrian camel in Mongolia and the Arabian camel becoming beasts of burden. By 1000 BC, caravans of Arabian camels were linking India with Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>Asia.</b> Their range extends from the Caspian Sea through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far afield as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like the}} {{multicultural}} and metropolitan {{atmosphere of the}} earlier Tang capital at Chang'an, the Song capitals at Kaifeng and Hangzhou were home to an array of traveling foreigners and ethnic minorities.

Trade and tribute embassies from Egypt, Yemen, India, Korea, the Kara-Khanid Khanate <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> and elsewhere came to Song China in order to bolster trade relations, while the Chinese sent embassies abroad to encourage foreign trade. Song Chinese trade ships traveled to ports in Japan, Champa in southern Vietnam, Srivijaya in Maritime Southeast Asia, Bengal and South India, and the coasts of East Africa.|$|E
5|$|Qutayba's role in {{the conquest}} and gradual Islamization <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> was crucial, and in later times, a number of {{locations}} in Ferghana where his tomb was supposedly located (Narshakhi and Jamal Qarsh) were venerated by pilgrims. His descendants too continued to hold influential positions: his son Qatan served as governor of Bukhara, Salm, another son, governed Basra and Rayy, and his nephew Muslim was governor of Balkh. His grandsons, especially the numerous sons of Salm, continued in high office under the Abbasids {{until well into the}} 9th century.|$|E

5|$|The Austronesian {{languages}} are spoken by 5.5% of the world's population and stretch from Madagascar to maritime Southeast Asia {{all the way}} to Oceania. It includes such languages as Malagasy, Māori, Samoan, and many of the indigenous languages of Indonesia and Taiwan. The Austronesian {{languages are}} considered to have originated in Taiwan around 3000 BC and spread through the Oceanic region through island-hopping, based on an advanced nautical technology. Other populous language families are the Dravidian languages of South Asia (among them Kannada Tamil and Telugu), the Turkic languages <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> (such as Turkish), the Austroasiatic (among them Khmer), and Tai–Kadai languages of Southeast Asia (including Thai).|$|E

5|$|The Liao dynasty was {{destroyed}} by the Jurchen people of the Jin dynasty in 1125 with the capture of Emperor Tianzuo of Liao. However, the remnant Khitan, led by Yelü Dashi, established the Qara Khitai (Western Liao dynasty), which ruled over parts <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> for almost a century before being conquered by the Mongols. Although cultural achievements associated with the Liao dynasty are considerable, {{and a number of}} various statuary and other artifacts exist in museums and other collections, major questions remain over the exact nature and extent of the influence of the Liao Khitan culture upon subsequent developments, such as the musical and theatrical arts.|$|E
5|$|The Sogdians spoke an Eastern Iranian {{language}} called Sogdian, {{closely related}} to Bactrian, Khwarazmian, and the Khotanese language Saka, widely spoken Eastern Iranian languages <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> in ancient times. Sogdian was also prominent in the oasis city-state of Turfan in the Tarim Basin region of Northwest China (in modern Xinjiang). Judging by the Sogdian Bugut inscription of Mongolia written c. 581, the Sogdian language was also an official language of the Turkic Khaganate established by the Gokturks.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wild {{ancestor of}} Malus pumila was Malus sieversii, found growing wild {{in the mountains}} <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed {{over a long period}} of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.|$|E

The {{population}} and distribution size are large, and no major or widespread threats to the species are known. However, {{the increasing number of}} livestock in the areas of distribution, such as the steppes <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>Asia,</b> some burrows are at a small risk of being destroyed. In arid areas of distribution, the reduction in the amount of water sources is also a minor concern. These hamsters are conserved in protected areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true desert and are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas Desert (and some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia,</b> the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Taizong, {{also known}} by his {{personal}} name Li Shimin, {{was familiar with}} the culture of the steppe nomads and employed military strategies using steppe tactics as a prince. Taizong was a skilled horsemen, and during a celebration of his victory and ascension to the throne, sacrificed a horse in a ritual derived from a Turkic religious practice. He was able to outmaneuver the heavy cavalry of the Sui Dynasty with his light cavalry, a characteristic of steppe warfare. Taizong shared personal relationships with Turkic allies as a prince, reinforced through oaths sworn as blood brothers. His later successes as an emperor against the armies <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>Asia</b> through diplomacy and divide and rule are the result of his early experiences with Turkic culture.|$|E
