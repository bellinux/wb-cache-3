To this end, samples of the different wires were tested up to fracture by means of standard tension tests, and later, all of the fracture surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for high performance engine or suspension components, bainitic steels are receiving interest as potential replacement of their quench and tempered counterparts. Indeed, {{for a number of}} mechanical components, ferrite pearlite microstructures are no longer sufficient in terms of mechanical properties. Bainitic steel grades allow production of <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>bars</b> or forged components exhibiting a homogeneous bainitic microstructure and achieving UTS up to 1200 MPa without the need for additional heat-treatments [1]. During tempering, these V-microalloyed bainitic steels exhibit unusual yield strength variations, with a very pronounced increase around 250 - 300 °C followed by the better known secondary hardening peak for temperatures around 600 - 650 °C. Indeed, after tempering at 250 - 300 °C, some of these steels exhibit an increase in yield strength of up to 200 MPa, concurrent with an increase in impact toughness of up to 25 %. This, however, goes unnoticed if hardness measurements are used to characterize tempering. In the following, results are presented for three different bainitic steel grades, and the origins of the changes in mechanical properties are discussed. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) of hot-rolled Mg 0. 1 Zr, Mg 0. 1 Sr, Mg 1 Mn, Mg 0. 3 Si, Mg 5 Sn, Mg 0. 7 La, Mg 0. 9 Ce, Mg 0. 6 Nd, Mg 6 Al, Mg 5 Gd and Mg 0. 3 Ca in distilled water (DW) was studied using the linearly increasing stress test (LIST). Hot-rolled Mg 1 Mn and Mg 0. 7 La had some SCC susceptibility in DW. All the <b>other</b> <b>hot-rolled</b> Mg-X alloys had little SCC susceptibility in DW. There was no obvious difference of the fractography between the specimens tested in air and in DW. The increase of SCC resistance by hot-rolling was related to improvement of the microstructure.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to evaluate the effect of manufacturing process upon the performance of reinforcing steel bars against atmospheric corrosion. Reinforcing steel bars produced by different manufacturing methods {{were exposed to the}} atmosphere in Athens for different periods of time. The progress of corrosion was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion layer formed {{on the surface of the}} bars. The morphology of the corroded layer was studied by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while X-ray diffraction analysis was used to identify the mineralogical composition of the corrosion products. Independently of the manufacturing process used, the main corrosion product formed was lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH), followed closely by akaganeite (beta-FeOOH) and goethite (alpha-FeOOH). Furthermore, it was found that the surface condition and the initial oxide layer on the steel bars, which is closely related to the manufacturing process, played a major role in the development of corrosion in atmosphere. Work-hardened reinforcing steel bars were found very sensitive to exhibition in the usual atmospheric conditions, followed by the Tempcore steel <b>bars.</b> The <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>bars,</b> either unalloyed or microalloyed with vanadium, presented the best corrosion behavior.

50|$|The works produce billets for pipes; heavy, {{medium and}} light profiles; {{reinforced}} concrete; wire; and special profiles, including mine gallery supports. The focus remains on steel products and long <b>hot-rolled</b> <b>bars.</b> Plans {{exist for the}} installation of a new rolling machine producing up to 400,000 tons of europrofile cylinder locks a year, starting in 2012. The number of employees had fallen to 1260 in 2008, following a wave of compensated early retirements. For several months {{at the end of}} that year and into the next, the works entirely stopped production for the first time in 80 years: most of its output went abroad, and the global financial crisis meant that orders dried up. By 2011, there were 820 employees. That year, eight exhaust chimneys, each over 90 m high and built in 1957, were demolished. These had become a symbol of the city, each of the ovens they served producing 400 tons of steel in one charge prior to 1990, but had become degraded. The chimney of blast furnace #4, itself demolished in 2004, remains standing. In the two years preceding this demolition, around 70% of the disused buildings were taken down, including a 1950s power plant that took seven years of attempts to destroy and was considered cursed. As of 2010, hundreds of individuals were making a living by carting off and selling iron and copper from disused portions of the works.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Longitudinal crack on HRB 335 <b>hot-rolled</b> ribbed <b>bar</b> {{surface in}} cold bending test in HISCO {{was ever a}} problem that caused great {{economic}} losses. To find the main reason, continuous cast product macro-acid etching test，metallographic examination，scanning electron microscope and EDAX are carried out. It is regarded that the defect is mainly caused by serious subsurface blowholes and internal cracks in the cast product，which can run through the surface in the later hot working process and are oxidized. As a result, the inner surface of these defects can not be welded-on in the rolling process and the cracks happen finally. Related measures are suggested to eliminate the defect...|$|R

40|$|Both {{numerical}} analysis based on finite-element (FE) modeling and experimental evidence concerning the secondary oxide-scale failure at {{entry into the}} roll gap are presented and reviewed for {{a better understanding of}} events at the roll-workpiece interface, in turn, leading to better definition of the boundary conditions for process models. Attention is paid to the two limit modes leading to oxide-scale failure, which were observed earlier during tensile testing under rolling conditions. These are considered in relation to the temperature, the oxide-scale thickness, and <b>other</b> <b>hot-rolling</b> parameters. The mathematical model used for the analysis is composed of macro and micro parts, which allow for simulation of metal/scale flow, heat transfer, cracking of the oxide scale, as well as sliding along the oxide/metal interface and spallation of the scale from the metal surface. The different modes of oxide-scale failure were predicted, taking into account stress-directed diffusion, fracture and adhesion of the oxide scale, strain, strain rate, and temperature. Stalled hot-rolling tests under controlled conditions have been used to verify the types of oxide-scale failure and have shown good predictive capabilities of the model. The stock temperature and the oxide-scale thickness are important parameters, which, depending on other rolling conditions, may cause either through-thickness cracking of the scale at the entry or lead to entry of a nonfractured scale when the scale/metal interface is not strong enough to transmit the metal deformation...|$|R
40|$|Steel-to-concrete bond {{is a basic}} {{aspect of}} the {{behaviour}} of reinforced concrete structures both at serviceability and ultimate states. When bond rules were originally developed, experimental results were mainly obtained on normal- strength concrete and a minimum relative rib area (bond index) was required by building codes to ensure good bond properties. The arrival into the market of high-performance concrete and newer structural needs may require different bond indexes. In the present paper, the experimental results of pull-out tests on short anchorages are presented. Several pull-out tests on ribbed bars, embedded in cubes of normal- and high-strength concrete with a concrete cover of 4. 5 times the bar diameter, were carried out {{in order to better}} understand the influence of the relative rib area and bar diameter on the local bond behaviour, {{as well as on the}} splitting crack width generated by the wedging action of ribs. A total of 96 tests were performed on machined bars of three different diameters (12, 16 and 20 mm) with a bond index ranging from 0. 040 to 0. 105. The results of 55 pull-out tests on commercial <b>hot-rolled</b> ribbed <b>bars</b> of four different diameters (12, 20, 40 and 50 mm) are also presented to confirm that the bond response also depends on bar diameter (size effect). Experimental results provide information concerning the influence of the relative rib area on bond strength and on the bursting force due to the rib’s wedge action. As the minimum measured bond strength of rebars was always markedly greater than the minimum bond strength required by building codes even when low bond indexes were adopted, the test results point out the possibility of reducing the minimum value of the relative rib area required by Eurocode 2 without limiting the safety coefficient of bond. The reduction also allows a higher structural ductility that can be achieved due to a greater strain penetration of the rebars from concrete cracks...|$|R
