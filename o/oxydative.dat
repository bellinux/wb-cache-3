40|$|The {{extent of}} {{deposition}} of lipofuscin in 66 nuclei of the aged human brain was classified systematically {{and the data}} were compared with the distribution of certain oxidative enzymes (succinic dehydrogenase, DPN-diaphorase). Nerve cells characterized by strong activity of oxidative enzymes in their perikarya contained more lipofuscin in aged brains than nerve cells characterized by little enzyme activity. The normal gradations of enzymatic (and probably metabolic) activity among cells thus predetermined—to a certain extent—the later deposition of lipofuscin. The lipofuscin in the neuropil (dendrite branchings) did not show the clear-cut relation to enzyme activity which characterized the perikarya; there was some indication of removal of lipofuscin from neuropil. A correlation between functional activity, oxidative enzymatic activity and deposition of lipofuscin was suggested by the findings in two cases in which, following the removal of one eye, alternate layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus showed a marked decrease of DPN-diaphorase activity and decreased presence of lipofuscin. The presence of “wear and tear” pigment, therefore, appeared related to the functional “wear and tear” of a given region which is reflected by the intensity of oxidative metabolism. Cytological studies, on the other hand, did not imply a more specific association of lipofuscin with oxidative enzyme activity.

And from the findings of the studies on RQ., stoichiometry and action of inhibitors, it could not find any difference on the oxidation pathway from glucose to pyruvate, but on the further oxidation pathway of pyruvate. The inhibition on the further oxidation pathway of pyruvate brought about marked accumulation of acetate in the cells of Sal 57 S irradiated to x-ray. 2) As concerns to the oxidation of member of TCA cycle, an inhibition was found at the oxidation of α-ketoglutalate and also of succinate to a slight extent. 3) The inhibition on the oxidation of glucose, pyruvate and α-ketoglutalate could be removed by addition of cysteine.

40|$|All fungi like {{eukaryote}}s possess mitochondria, {{which are}} the sites of the <b>oxydative</b> phosphorylation. As eukaryote evolution depends on oxygenic atmosphere, these organisms are primarily aerobic. Except {{a small group of}} strict anaerobes (those which lost the capacity of <b>oxydative</b> pathways living in special milieu in association with rumen of grass-eating animals) all fungi can utilize various compounds as carbon sources via oxidative phosphorylation pathways resulting in high energy yield. Certain groups of fungi – i. e. most of the yeasts – under anaerobe conditions, are able to supply themselves with lower levels of fermentation energy, too exhibiting a slow growing capacity utilizing the same amount of carbon source. The mutation of mitochondrial genome or mitochondrial functions encoded by nuclear genes of these fungi might result in a so-calledpetitephenotype producing small colonies on solid media due to their slow growing capacity. These mutants can utilize only fermentable carbon sources. Filamentous fungi have only limited possibilities to produce such phenotypes. ExceptZygomycetes(where the shortage of oxygen induces dimorphic transitions) filamentous fungi can grow and develop their vegetative and sexual reproductive structures only in aerobe milieu. However amongNeurosporaspecies there are several mitochondrial mutations resulting in morphological phenotypes. These are due to the lower energy level provided by the reduced capacity of cytochrome-oxidase enzymes. These mutants (e. g. pokystopper) can be considered aspetiteanalogues. The complete loss of mitochondrial functions – such asrho zerocharacter in yeast – cannot be survived by filamentous fungi. Podospora anserinaand some of its close relatives exhibit a so-calledsenescencephenotype, which means that the growing hyphae in the youngest part of the colonies stop growing and start to die within a short period of time.

After 5 min of exercise, the hyperthyroid patients exhibited a more important phosphocreatine depletion (41. 2 +/- 8. 2 vs 31. 1 % +/- 6. 5, p < 0. 02) and a larger pH fall (6. 65 +/- 0. 04 vs 7. 01 +/- 0. 10, p < 0. 001) than the control subjects.

Ultrastructural analyses of the epithelial layer by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed ciliated cells and gland ducts opening on the epithelial surface. Histochemical analyses were performed on ventricular muscles submitted to nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide tetrazolium reductase (NADH-TR), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and myofibrillar adenosine triphosphatase (mATPase) reactions. Based on these reactions, {{it was observed that}} the muscle is formed by three types of muscle fibers: slow-twitch oxidative (SO), fast-twitch <b>oxydative</b> glycolytic (FOG) and fast-twitch glycolytic (FG) fibers distributed in a mosaic pattern. The fiber frequency was 22. 7 %, 69. 9 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. The higher frequency of SO and FOG fibers characterized the muscle as having aerobic metabolism and resistance to fatigue. The ventricular muscle was considered fast. The {{study of the}} neuromuscular junctions performed after nonspecific esterase reaction showed that they are of the en-plaque type and have multiple occurrences in the ventricular muscle...|$|E
40|$|White matter {{comprises}} {{over half}} of the brain, and its role in axonal survival is being reconsidered, consistently with the observation that axonal degeneration follows demyelization. The recent evidence of an extra-mitochondrial aerobic ATP production in isolated myelin vesicles, thanks to the expression therein of the mitochondrial <b>Oxydative</b> Phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery, stands in for myelin playing a functional bioenergetic role in ATP supply for the axon. The observation that subunits of the OXPHOS encoded by the mitochondrial genome are expressed in myelin, suggests that they can be the same as those of the inner mitochondrial membrane. This would mean that the OXPHOS is exportable. Here the hypothesis is exposed that the mitochondrion is the unique site of the assembly of the OXPHOS, so that this is exported to those sub cellular districts displaying high energy demand, such as myelin sheath. There the OXPHOS would display a higher efficiency in oxidative ATP production than inside the mitochondrion itself. In this respect, the role of the glia in the nervous conduction is shed new light and the oligodendrocyte mitochondrial OXPHOS are hypothesized to be delivered to nascent myelin...|$|E
40|$|As part in {{evaluation}} {{of the impact of}} the toxicity of heavy metals on the environment, we led a study the behavior of Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae towards a xenobiotic and more particularly a heavy metal: the Cadmium on the metabolism energetic. This work concerns the influence of second xenobiotic Zinc applied in treatment combined with cadmium in the presence and / or the absence of calcium on the respiratory activity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The obtained results showed inhibition of respiratory activity with an assimilation of oxygen about (52 %) to cells treated with the concentrations 5 mM and 10 mM, whereas the yeast treated with Cd 2 + / Ca 2 + and Cd 2 + / Zn 2 + has a respiratory activity with a high consumption of higher oxygen (56 %) compared with cells of control. This could possibly show that the activity of detoxification involvement would be dependent energy. Therefore, the measure of respiratory activity shows that the accumulation of Cd can be associated with the <b>oxydative</b> stress reflecting the toxic action of the Cadmium, where from the treatment in the presence of the calcium and / zinc can forbid and reduce its unwanted effects...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the effects on <b>oxydative</b> degradation of glucose and practical utility of chloromycetin as inhibitor, the author studied the effect of chloromycetin on O(2) uptake of the microorganisms and the cooperative inhibition by the combined use of chloromycetin and other inhibitor. Sh. flexneri 2 a, Sh. flexneri 3 a, Staphy. aureus and Staphy. albus, all taken from the departmental stock, were used in this work. The following were obtained. 1) The O(2) uptake of organisms were not affected {{in the presence of}} dilute chloromycetin, but the uptakes were decreased in 30 - 40 % with 10 (- 3) M of chloromycetin in either substrates, glucose, lactate. pyruvate or succinate. With the concentration of 3 × 10 (- 3) M the decrease of the uptake reached to 60 - 70 %; moreover, the suppression was most serious on the uptake of pyruvate. 2) In the case of Sh. flexneri 2 a and Sh. flexneri 3 a, the simultaneous use of chloromycetin and NaN 3 showed marked inhibition on the O 2 uptake compared with use of each of them. But in Staphy. aureus and Staphy. albus, it was not observed such cooperative inhibition like this...|$|E
