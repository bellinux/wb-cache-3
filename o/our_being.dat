25|$|Although the {{equivalence}} principle guided {{the development of}} general relativity, {{it is not a}} founding principle of relativity but rather a simple consequence of the geometrical nature of the theory. In general relativity, objects in free-fall follow geodesics of spacetime, and what we perceive as the force of gravity is instead a result of <b>our</b> <b>being</b> unable to follow those geodesics of spacetime, because the mechanical resistance of matter prevents us from doing so.|$|E
25|$|Consumer {{behaviour}} is {{the study}} of the motivations surrounding a purchase of a product or service. It has been linked to the field of psychology, sociology and economics in attempts to analyse when, why, where and how people purchase {{in the way that they}} do. However, little literature has considered the link between our consumption behaviour and the basics of <b>our</b> <b>being,</b> our biology. Segmentation by biological driven demographics such as sex and age are already popular and pervasive in marketing. As more knowledge and research is known, targeting based on a consumers biology is of growing interest and use to marketers.|$|E

25|$|The cosmic {{microwave}} background was first predicted in 1948 by Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman. Alpher and Herman were able to estimate {{the temperature of the}} {{cosmic microwave}} background to be 5K, though two years later they re-estimated it at 28K. This high estimate was due to a mis-estimate of the Hubble constant by Alfred Behr, which could not be replicated and was later abandoned for the earlier estimate. Although there were several previous estimates of the temperature of space, these suffered from two flaws. First, they were measurements of the effective temperature of space and did not suggest that space was filled with a thermal Planck spectrum. Next, they depend on <b>our</b> <b>being</b> at a special spot {{at the edge of the}} Milky Way galaxy and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic. The estimates would yield very different predictions if Earth happened to be located elsewhere in the universe.|$|E
500|$|Contemporaneously, Walter Jackson Bate, {{a critic}} specialising in the English Romantic period, voiced his {{approval}} of Hazlitt's Shakespearean criticism, {{seen in the}} context of that of other Romantics. [...] "Like Coleridge [...] or [...] Keats", wrote Bate, [...] "Hazlitt had the characteristic romantic delight in Shakespeare's ability to unveil character in a single passage or even a single line—in 'flashes of passion' that offer a 'revelation as it were of the whole context of <b>our</b> <b>being.</b>|$|E

To assure white unity, Tillman allowed the election of Conservatives as {{about a third of}} delegates. The convention assembled in Columbia in September 1895, consisting of 112 Tillmanites, 42 Conservatives, and six African Americans. Tillman called black disenfranchisement [...] "the sole cause of <b>our</b> <b>being</b> here".|$|E

500|$|Although Hazlitt {{had seen}} As You Like It on stage, he remembered it most fondly from having read it so {{frequently}} that he practically had it memorised. In Characters of Shakespear's Plays, {{he makes no}} mention at all of any stage performances, treating the play as one primarily meant to be read. What strikes him as most notable about it is its character of a [...] "pastoral drama", one that presents an [...] "ideal" [...] world—that is, a world of thought and imagination, not action. And {{though it is a}} comedy, its interest derives not so much from in <b>our</b> <b>being</b> made to laugh at any particular human follies, but rather, [...] "more out of the sentiments and characters than out of the actions or situations.

500|$|Gordimer remarked that, {{more than}} just a story about white communists in South Africa, Burger's Daughter is about [...] "commitment" [...] and what she as a writer does to [...] "make sense of life". After Mandela and Fischer were sentenced in the mid-1960s, Gordimer {{considered}} going into exile, but she changed her mind and later recalled [...] "I wouldn't be accepted as I was here, even in the worst times and even though I'm white". Just as Rosa struggles to find her place as a white in the anti-apartheid liberation movement, so did Gordimer. In an interview in 1980, she said that [...] "when we have got beyond the apartheid situation—there's a tremendous problem for whites, unless whites are allowed in by blacks, and unless we can make out a case for <b>our</b> <b>being</b> accepted and we can forge a common culture together, whites are going to be marginal".|$|E
500|$|Aware that Imperial {{troops had}} {{breached}} the Schellenberg's defences Marlborough launched a third assault. This time the attackers formed a broader front, requiring d'Arco's men to spread their fire, thus reducing the deadly {{effectiveness of their}} musketry and grenades. But the defenders, including la Colonie, (unaware that the Imperialists had penetrated their left flank, and that d'Arco had retreated to Donauwörth), were still confident {{in their ability to}} repel the enemy– [...] "We remained steady at our post; our fire was regular as ever, and kept our opponents in check." [...] It was not long, however, before the Franco-Bavarian forces fighting on the hill became conscious of Baden's infantry approaching {{from the direction of the}} town. Many of the officers, including de la Colonie, initially thought that the advancing troops were reinforcements from DuBordet's garrison in Donauwörth, but it soon became apparent that they were in fact Baden's troops. [...] "They [...] arrived within gunshot of our flank about 7:30 in the evening, without <b>our</b> <b>being</b> aware of the possibility of such a thing." [...] Wrote de la Colonie. [...] "So occupied were we in defence of our own particular post..." [...] After establishing themselves at the summit of the Heights on the Allied right, Baden's men now fired upon the surprised defenders of the Schellenberg, compelling them to re-align in order to meet this unexpected threat. Consequently, Marlborough's assaulting troops on the Allied left, supported by a fresh echelon of dismounted English dragoons, were able to scramble over the now weakly defended breastwork and push the defenders back to the crown of the hill. The enemy at last fell into confusion.|$|E

2500|$|Schleiermacher saw the ego, the person, as an individualization of {{universal}} reason; {{and the primary}} act of self-consciousness as the first conjunction {{of universal}} and individual life, the immediate union or marriage of the universe with incarnated reason. Thus every person becomes a specific and original representation {{of the universe and}} a compendium of humanity, a microcosmos in which the world is immediately reflected. While therefore we cannot, as we have seen, attain the idea of the supreme unity of thought and being by either cognition or volition, we can find it in our own personality, in immediate self-consciousness or (which is the same in Schleiermacher's terminology) feeling. Feeling in this higher sense (as distinguished from [...] "organic" [...] sensibility, Empfindung), which is the minimum of distinct antithetic consciousness, the cessation of the antithesis of subject and object, constitutes likewise the unity of <b>our</b> <b>being,</b> in which the opposite functions of cognition and volition have their fundamental and permanent background of personality and their transitional link.
