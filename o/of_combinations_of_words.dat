The groups of proof combinations of words are selected on a military subject. It is set that more active display of combination of words of origin is acquired in social and political texts in connection with battle events on East of Ukraine and events in society. It is and linguistic, and religious, wars and wars for internentniy space. It is found out, that addition to the vocal supply is the special vocabulary in a portable value. In verbal registration enter words which present a military sphere, for expression of rivalry, competition.

40|$|Abstract—While it {{is still}} most common for {{information}} visualization researchers to develop new visualizations from a data- or taskdriven perspective, there is growing interest in understanding the types of visualizations people create by themselves for personal use. As part of this recent direction, we have studied a large collection of whiteboards in a research institution, where people make active use <b>of</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>words,</b> diagrams and various types of visuals to help them further their thought processes. Our goal is {{to arrive at a}} better understanding of the nature of visuals that are created spontaneously during brainstorming, thinking, communicating, and general problem solving on whiteboards. We use the qualitative approaches of open coding, interviewing, and affinity diagramming to explore the use of recognizable and novel visuals, and the interplay between visualization and diagrammatic elements with words, numbers and labels. We discuss the potential implications of our findings on information visualization design. Index Terms—Visualization, diagrams, whiteboards, observational study. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{driving force}} behind the recent success of LSTMs has been their ability to learn complex and {{non-linear}} relationships. Consequently, our inability to describe these relationships has led to LSTMs being characterized as black boxes. To this end, we introduce contextual decomposition (CD), an interpretation algorithm for analysing individual predictions made by standard LSTMs, without any changes to the underlying model. By decomposing the output of a LSTM, CD captures the contributions <b>of</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> or variables to the final prediction of an LSTM. On the task of sentiment analysis with the Yelp and SST data sets, we show that CD is able to reliably identify words and phrases of contrasting sentiment, and how they are combined to yield the LSTM's final prediction. Using the phrase-level labels in SST, we also demonstrate that CD is able to successfully extract positive and negative negations from an LSTM, something which has not previously been done.

40|$|The {{classification}} of texts {{and pieces of}} texts uses the occurrence <b>of,</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of,</b> <b>words</b> as an important indicator. Not every word or each combination of words gives {{a clear indication of}} the {{classification of}} a piece of text. Research has been done on methods that select some words or combinations of words that are more indicative of the type of a piece of text. These words or combinations of words are selected from the words and word-groups as they occur in the texts. These more indicative words or combinations of words we call ¿cue-phrases¿. The goal of these methods is to select the most indicative cue-phrases first. The collection of selected words and/or combinations thereof can then be used for training the classification system. To test these selection methods, a number of experiments has been done on a corpus containing cookbook recipes and on a corpus of four-participant meetings. To perform these experiments, a computer program was written. On the recipe corpus we looked at classifying the sentences into different types. Some examples of these types include ¿requirement¿ and ¿instruction¿. On the four-person meeting corpus we tried to learn, using only lexical features, whether a sentence is addressed to an individual or a group. The experiments on the recipe corpus produced good results that showed that, a number of, the used cue-phrase selection methods are suitable for feature selection. The experiments on the four-person meeting corpus where less successful in terms of performance off the classification task. We did see comparable patterns in selection methods, and considering the results of Jovanovic we can conclude that different features are needed for this particular classification task. One of the original goals was to look at ¿addressee¿ in discussions. Are sentences more often addressed to individuals inside discussions compared to outside discussions? However, {{in order to be able}} to accomplish this, we must first identify the segments of the text that are discussions. It proved hard to come to a reliable specification of discussions, and our initial definition wasn¿t sufficient...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to look at the use of formulaic language, i. e. memorized and conventionalized {{combinations}} of words, in essays written by Swedish intermediate level students of English. Drawing on previous research (Cohen and Brooks -Carson 2001) this study will apply a method of “warming up” in Swedish (L 1) before writing in English (L 2). The primary material includes thirty essays written directly in English, and thirty essays starting from an outline in Swedish and then written in English, by the same students but on a different topic. Since there is evidence that native speakers always score the highest on amount of formulaic language in written discourse, the main hypothesis of this study is that by starting from an outline in Swedish and then writing in English the students will make use of more formulaic language than when writing directly in English. The first research question involves the quantity of formulaic language in the students’ essays. The second question concerns the distribution and use of the different categories of FSs (NPs, VPs etc) in the direct and indirect modes of writing. The last question addresses the erroneous attempts made by the students in forming FSs and the possible influence of transfer from L 1 in the essays starting from an outline in Swedish compared to the essays written directly in English. The findings of this study lend support to the main hypothesis. Moreover, the analysis shows that there are significant differences in the distribution and use of the different categories of formulaic language in the direct and indirect modes of writing. Results are suggestive of a more conscious and less uncertain approach in the essays starting from an outline in Swedish, however the findings may be circumstantial. Furthermore, the results indicate that the method of “warming up” in Swedish may encourage the use <b>of</b> <b>combinations</b> <b>of</b> <b>words</b> that are more conventionalized and do not always interact with syntax in a regular way. The findings also indicate that transfer is not more salient in the essays starting from an outline in Swedish if compared to the essays written directly in English, at least not in relation to the erroneous FSs found in the students’ essays...|$|E

Words produced in the compositional process <b>of</b> <b>word</b> formation are characterized by combining a lexical stem/root and affixes/ combining forms. Contrastively, the process <b>of</b> synthetic <b>word</b> formation produces a word from a phrase/sentence by lexical indiomatization. Second, we claim that English has three basic elements for word formation, LF(lexical form), CF(combining form) and AF(affixal form), although they are sometimes difficult to make a clear-cut distinction from each other.

After that, the user checks validity of each candidate using the real document which the system provides and includes the English phrase consisting of a predicate verb V^E and its object n^E. Here, n^E is the translation of n^J and V^E is the candidates for the translation of v^J...|$|R
