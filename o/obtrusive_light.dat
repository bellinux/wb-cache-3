Light pollution commonly refers to excessive or <b>obtrusive</b> artificial <b>light</b> caused by bad lighting design. Light pollution generates significant costs including negative impacts on wildlife, health, astronomy, and wasted energy [...] which in the U. S. amounts to nearly 7 Â billion dollars annually. Current scientific models of light pollution are purely population based. The current paper utilizes unique remote sensing data and economic data from the World Bank to quantify the economic causes of light pollution globally. Fractional logit models show that, similar to other types of pollution, both population and GDP are significant explanatory variables. Light Pollution Remote Sensing DMSP Fractional Logit EKC...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to calculating {{the amount of}} light in a space, AGi32 can create photo-realistic renderings of how an area will look once light fixtures are installed. It can compute {{the amount of energy}} used as well as glare metrics, and can incorporate a variety of situational design needs such as custom aiming, numerous rooms and objects in the same project, and it includes utilities for estimating fixture spacing. The software is designed to determine the amount of light reaching a designated surface or work plane for any type of application. <b>Obtrusive</b> <b>light</b> (exterior) may be calculated and compared against several US and international standards for code compliance.

40|$|Nowadays <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light</b> is {{discussed}} quite often {{and so this}} term has become well-known not only to {{professionals in the field}} of lighting but also to the public, designers and administrators. Quantification of <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light</b> depends on many factors. The biggest factor is the amount of the luminous flux directly emitted into the upper hemisphere. Other factors include the reflection qualities of illuminated surfaces and finally conditions in the atmosphere. Based on knowledge of the amount of luminous flux directly emitted into the upper hemisphere, depending on the surroundings (size of the agglomeration, protected landscape areas – national preserves, observatory, etc.), we can classify <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light</b> into several classes according to the standards EN 12464 - 2 and EN 12 193. These standards use only four environmental zones. For any outdoor lighting system it is possible to calculate the amount of luminous flux emitted into the upper hemisphere and determine if this potential source of <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light</b> is appropriate for the environmental zone. These calculations can also show if the lighting system is a significant contributor to the amount of <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light.</b> This paper tries to describe problems over larger areas where different environmental zones can exist side by side. Adjacent environmental zones should not differ by more than one level (for example E 1 to E 2 only). The aim {{of this paper is to}} establish methodologies for classifying environmental zones. A specific example of classification relates to a 420 [*]kV outdoor electricity distribution substation, which is located in a selected area of the Czech Republic. Web of Science 4621009...|$|E
40|$|Light {{pollution}} is any excessive or <b>obtrusive</b> man made <b>light</b> source which disrupts the natural environment. Hatchling marine turtles are {{adversely affected by}} light pollution and therefore unlit nesting beaches are essential habitats for all marine turtle species. In Broward County, the most significant conservation issue facing nesting and hatchling marine turtles {{is the amount of}} light pollution present on urban sea turtle nesting beaches. The reduction of hatchling mortality from light {{pollution is}} an ongoing conservation goal of the State of Florida, Broward County, and the Broward County Sea Turtle Conservation Project (BCSTCP). Conservation techniques and policies intended to reduce hatchling mortality due to light pollution in Broward County have included: mass nest relocation using restraining and self release hatcheries, limited individual relocation of nests, and lighting ordnances in coastal municipalities. Until the 2006 sea turtle nesting season the BCSTCP utilized a mass relocation scheme which removed nests from unsafe and well lighted beach areas to other hatching areas which were not as severely impacted by light pollution. In 2006 the use of hatcheries was phased out and only limited relocation continued. Along with limited relocation, municipalities were strongly encouraged to reduce light pollution. Comparisons will be made based on the 2003 - 2008 nesting seasons determine which policies and conservation tools were the most effective at reducing hatchling mortality due to light pollution. This study tested the following hypotheses: (1) there has been no significant decrease in light pollution in Broward County, (2) there has been no significant decrease in disoriented hatchlings on Broward County beaches, (3) recent changes to relocation techniques have not improved hatchling production with in Broward County. Results showed that the despite efforts by municipalities no overall reduction in light pollution has occurred. Initially hatchling disorientation events and the number of disoriented hatchlings increased after the policy change but have decreased during the most recent nesting season. Limited relocation yields a higher hatchling success rate then mass relocation. Although some improvements have been made light pollution control and reduction is still needed {{in order to reduce the}} accidental deaths of hatchlings due to disorientation...|$|R

In this method, a nanosecond-scale gate shutter is used to control the exposure time of CCD and reduce the collection of <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light,</b> and a nanosecond-scale pulsed laser is used to illuminate targets and increase signal energy. By matching them, the ratio between signal and <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light</b> will be significantly improved to detect targets against light disturbance. We have analyzed the method in theory, and performed it in experiment. In addition, a stroboscopic time sequence is used, and the setting of temporal parameters is also discussed. ? 2011 SPIE CCC code...|$|E
40|$|Public {{lighting}} as well {{as every}} technical infrastructure has got its own lifetime, so the periodic renovation is needed. Public lighting in the Czech Republic was built during the 70 ´s {{of the last century}} and regular renovations were done only in larger cities. In small cities and villages, the public lighting systems are almost {{at the end of their}} life time and it is necessary to make the overall reconstruction. For a long time, relatively a little attention was paid to public lighting. The situation was changed in the last few years, where thanks to the pressure to lower the energy consumption, the attention was focused also on the public lighting. Solutions of problems with energy efficiency are usually accompanied by financial instruments in the form of subsidies, grants etc. which support the change of technical equipment with low efficiency for technical equipment with high efficiency. However, in above mention steps the considerations of the overall reconstruction of public lighting is missing. With reference to situation in public lighting systems it would be appropriate to combine their energy performance solutions with overall reconstruction. Older lighting systems and unfortunately, also some new lighting systems, are not only energy inefficient but in many cases they also visually disturb public spaces by their location, design or proportions. In addition, they are the sources of <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light</b> too. Public spaces are important part of human settlements and the scale of life quality. The light is an instrument for creating environment with regards to many aspects (cultural, historical, functional, etc.) of urban areas. It is necessary to perceive public lighting comprehensively taking into account not only the traffic safety and energy consumption but also architectural-urban aspects and aspects connected with minimizing of <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light...</b>|$|E
40|$|Light {{pollution}} is an environmental problem occurring with the improper application of artificial lighting systems. Light trespass, one significant type of light pollution, {{is difficult to}} be measured and evaluated in urban areas. In Beijing, a fully glazed office building could become a possible source of <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light</b> except for the street lighting, due to {{a fact that the}} security and nightscape requirements keep the indoor lighting on overnight. This article studied the impact of external overhang on the light trespass risk using Radiance simulation in a multi-story fully glazed office building. Two typical types of external overhang have been investigated: horizontal, tilt angle - 10 degree. For each type, three overhang depths were used: 0. 6 m, 1. 2 m and 1. 8 m. The illuminance levels at a vertical calculation plane (with a 10 m distance to façade) were calculated by Radiance, which express the magnitude of light trespass from the glazed façade. Several important findings have been achieved: averagely, the longest overhang (1. 8 m) reduces a relative illuminance level of 17 % with the bare window as a reference, while the shortest one only has a relative reduction of 5. 6 %; for the protection of trespass light, the overhang works well at a height of around 5 / 7 façade above ground. The methods would be possibly used for the light pollution investigation in a large scale urban area...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Lighting {{advertising}} signs {{not only}} {{play an important}} role in outdoor lighting environment in Taiwan, but also become the main factor of energy consumption in urban areas at night. Light-emitting diode (LED) has been gradually used in advertising signs due to its advantages. However, in order to be conspicuous and legible in the daytime, signs that are excessively bright may result in considerable light pollution and energy waste at nighttime. Therefore, this research aims to measure the luminance of LED signs and traditional internally lighted signs, and analyze the light trespass from each signage. Based on the research results, the energy consumption from a LED full color screen is 12 times more than a traditional internally lighted sign per day. Statistically, all kinds of LED signs are much higher than traditional internally lighted signs in the percentage of excessive brightness and average luminance value. As for the light trespass, since the vertical illuminance on facade facing the signs increases with the increase of the sign area or the decrease of the distance between the sign and the facade, the vertical illuminance on facade facing the signs would exceed the limit of CIE even if the luminance of the signs achieves the standard of CIE in terms of the general conditions in Taiwan. This happens to LED full color screens in particular and thus results in considerable <b>obtrusive</b> <b>light.</b> To sum up, in order to reduce unnecessary energy consumption and improve the nighttime lighting quality for outdoor environment, this research recommends the luminance limitation for light dimming of LED advertising signs should refer to the zoning, time period, and sign area...|$|E
