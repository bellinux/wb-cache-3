5000|$|At {{the start}} of the Dutch Revolt the States General (who were then not {{continually}} in session) remained loyal to the overlord of the Habsburg Netherlands, Philip II of Spain (who did not have the title of king in the Netherlands, but held the title of duke and count in the several provinces). In 1576 the States General as a whole, however, openly rebelled against the Spanish crown. In 1579 the States General split as a number of southern provinces, united in the Union of Arras returned to obedience, while other provinces, united in the Union of Utrecht continued the rebellion. After the Act of Abjuration in 1581 the northern States General replaced Philip II as the supreme authority of the northern Netherlands, which then became known as the United Provinces. This was a confederation in which most government functions remained with the provincial States (and local authorities, like the Vroedschappen). These delegated representatives to the States General as a kind of ambassadors acting with a mandate limited by instruction and <b>obligatory</b> <b>consultation</b> (...) [...] The States General, in which the voting was by province, each of the seven provinces having one vote, took on many executive functions after the Council of State of the Netherlands had temporarily come under English influence, due to the Treaty of Nonsuch. The States General for this reason since 1593 remained continually in session until their dissolution in 1795. The presidency rotated weekly among the senior representatives of the provinces. Under the Union-of-Utrecht treaty the States General formally was the sovereign power, representing the Republic in foreign affairs and making treaties with foreign monarchs. As such the honorific title of the States General collectively was [...] (mightiest, or very mighty, lords).|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Palliative {{sedation}} {{is considered}} a normal medical practice by the Royal Dutch Medical Association. Therefore, consultation of an expert is not considered mandatory. The European Association of Palliative Care (EAPC) framework for palliative sedation, however, is more stringent: it considers the use of palliative sedation without consulting an expert as injudicious and insists on input from a multi-professional palliative care team. This study investigates the considerations of Dutch physicians concerning consultation about palliative sedation with specialist palliative care services. Methods: Fifty-four physicians were interviewed on their most recent case of palliative sedation. Results: Reasons to consult were a lack of expertise and the view that consultation was generally supportive. Reasons not to consult were sufficient expertise, the view that palliative sedation is a normal medical procedure, time pressure, fear of disagreement with the service and regarding consultation as having little added value. Arguments in favour of mandatory consultation were that many physicians lack expertise and that palliative sedation is an exceptional intervention. Arguments against mandatory consultation were practical obstacles that may preclude fulfilling such an obligation (i. e. lack of time), palliative sedation being a standard medical procedure, corroding a physician's responsibility and deterring physicians from applying palliative sedation. Conclusion: Consultation about palliative sedation with specialist palliative care services is regarded as supportive and helpful when physicians lack expertise. However, Dutch physicians have both practical and theoretical objections against mandatory consultation. Based on the findings in this study, {{there seems to be}} little support among Dutch physicians for the EAPC recommendations on <b>obligatory</b> <b>consultation.</b> © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten to twenty years, {{geological}} surveys {{all over the world}} have been entangled in a process of digitisation. Their paper archives, built over many decades, have largely been replaced by electronic databases. The systematic production of geological map sheets is being replaced by 3 D subsurface modelling, the results of which are distributed electronically. In the Netherlands, this transition is both being accelerated and concluded by a new law that will govern management and utilisation of subsurface information. Under this law, the Geological Survey of the Netherlands has been commissioned to build a key register for the subsurface: a single national database for subsurface data and information, which Dutch government bodies are obliged to use when making policies or decisions that pertain to, or can be affected by the subsurface. This requires the Survey to rethink and redesign a substantial part of its operation: from data acquisition and interpretation to delivery. It has also helped shape our view on geological surveying in the future. The key register, which is expected to start becoming operational in 2015, will contain vast quantities of subsurface data, as well as their interpretation into 3 D models. The <b>obligatory</b> <b>consultation</b> of the register will raise user expectations of the reliability of all information it contains, and requires a strong focus on confidence issues. Building the necessary systems and meeting quality requirements is our biggest challenge in the upcoming years. The next step change will be towards building 4 D models, which represent not only geological conditions in space, but also processes in time such as subsidence, anthropogenic effects, and those associated with global change...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this work is first to {{describe}} evolution of the World Trade Organisation dispute settlement system, which originates from the dispute settlement system under the international agreement GATT 47. Originally it was the diplomatic system without explicit legal regulation, which changed into developed system based on legal regulation of the World Trade Organisation. Next part {{of this work}} consists of the analyse of current system regulated by the Dispute Settlement Understanding. The <b>obligatory</b> <b>consultations</b> remain {{a part of this}} system. If the agreement is not reached during the consultations, the two-stage proceeding by the panel of experts and by the Appellate Body takes part. The final part of the proceeding is implementation of the decision. Currently the review of the system is in process and many discussions on this issue takes place under WTO, so far with no conclusion. The last part of this work focuses on Banana case III...|$|R

40|$|Aim of {{the paper}}: The {{aim of the}} paper was to {{evaluate}} gravida's knowledge concerning the harmful effect of smoking on the fetus and the awareness concerning the impact of nicotine {{on the development of}} cervical cancer in women infected with HPV. Material and method: The study covered 127 women – healthy gravidas provided with a pecialist care of K clinic, inhabitants of cities and villages. The study was conducted from March to June 2015 with the utilization of a diagnostic survey. To that end, an author's questionnaire was drafted, which consisted of 23 questions concerning smoking tobacco and respondent's knowledge in terms of the HPV infection. Results: Responses of 127 women were evaluated, out of whom 76 % had never smoked tobacco, 8 % stopped smoking due to pregnancy and 16 % limited smoking in that time or moved to "light" cigarettes, or used nicotine patches and limited smoking simultaneously. The majority of gravidas (94 %) were aware that smoking is harmful to the child and toxic substances penetrate through the placenta; 76 % knew that toxic substances also penetrate to breast milk. The largest group of women (36 %) was exposed to passive smoking in own houses, among the closest family. A problem with motivation may be observed in the group of smoking gravidas – {{it may be necessary to}} consider <b>obligatory</b> <b>consultations</b> with a psychologist related to motivation and addiction for all the smokers being pregnant or planning their pregnancy. Moreover, the survey proved that young women lack basic knowledge in the field of HPV infection...|$|R
