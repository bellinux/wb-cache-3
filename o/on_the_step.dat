5|$|The {{accident}} {{that would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While responding to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E
25|$|In 1867, Bullock {{became a}} {{resident}} of Helena, Montana, where he unsuccessfully ran for the Territorial Legislature. He was subsequently elected as a Republican to the Territorial Senate, serving in 1871 and 1872 and helped create Yellowstone National Park. In 1873, he was elected sheriff of Lewis and Clark County, Montana. During his tenure as sheriff, he killed his first man, Clell Watson. Watson had stolen a horse and engaged in a gunfight with Bullock, in which Bullock was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Watson was then taken into custody. Watson was prepared to be hanged, but a mob appeared and scared off the executioner. Bullock climbed the scaffold and pulled the lever, sending Watson to his death. Bullock then held off the mob with a shotgun. This incident was recreated on HBO's Deadwood, except that Watson was hanged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> of the sheriff's office.|$|E

500|$|The {{architecture}} of the enclosed space suggests a church. The Virgin sits beneath a canopy, perhaps symbolic of the sacred space, and the spatial separation between the celebrant and the , usually by a Rood screen. The small room to the right could symbolize the vesting chamber. The arms of her throne are painted as carved with figures including Adam, Eve and the serpent before the fall from Paradise. [...] The room faces towards an enclosed garden, another emblem of the Virgin's chastity. Though Mary is positioned by a throne and under a canopy, indicating her role as Queen of Heaven, she sits <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> an indication of her humility.|$|E
500|$|An {{enduring}} friendship {{featured in}} EastEnders {{was the one}} shared between the characters Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (played by Gretchen Franklin), first shown on-screen in 1985 and ending with Ethel's death in 2000, though the characters shared a backstory set prior to 1985 and were scripted as neighbours who grew old together in East London, along with Lou Beale (Anna Wing). BBC News has described Dot and Ethel as an [...] "incomparable double-act [...] Occasionally spiky and often hilarious". Dot and Ethel shared few similarities in personality. During an episode that aired in 2008, just under 8 years after Ethel died in the serial, Dot discussed the differences between them: [...] "Ethel was a free spirit, not like me. All bottled up. I remember sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> of the Vic, waiting for me mother. I {{caught a glimpse of}} her through the door. Sitting on top of the piano, her legs spread, showing next week's washing and bawling out [...] "Roll Out the Barrel". Just like a navvy. She didn't seem to have a care in the world. I had enough for both of us. I loved Ethel." [...] Critic for The Guardian, Nancy Banks-Smith, discussed the characters' relationship in 2008, comparing them to the girls written about by Dylan Thomas: [...] "There was always one pretty and pert , and always one in glasses [...]" [...] Banks-Smith adds that theirs was [...] "a symbiotic relationship in which the pretty one looks even prettier by contrast and the plain one is popular by proxy. Which is not to say it is not a real and enduring friendship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Divisional Headquarters Staff set {{up their}} report centre about [...] behind Jericho; when they were sitting down to a morning cup of tea, Chetwode and Chauvel joined them.

2500|$|Works from Raymond Novaco in the 1970s {{have contributed}} {{to many of the}} recent ideas on the {{management}} of anger. These ideas have led to the implementation of different anger management programs. Novaco stressed the importance of looking at the situations that led up to the anger in order to have control over the anger. He stated that anger is an emotional response to situations, and that anger occurs in three modalities, either cognitive, somaticaffective or behavioral. [...] After discovering the anger, there should be discussion and self-examination in order to relieve the anger. This process was thought to help the client identify the situations that lead to anger and deal with the anger depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> that the anger is occurring in. The client is able to use different relaxation skills to reduce their anger before it advances.|$|E
2500|$|... 16 August 1976: {{car bomb}} attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Step</b> Inn, Keady, County Armagh. Catholic civilians Elizabeth McDonald and Gerard McGleenon {{were killed and}} others were injured. Ten days before the bombing, the RUC asked the Army to put Mitchell's {{farmhouse}} under surveillance because they had intelligence that a bomb was being stored there. According to Weir, the bomb was to be detonated at Renaghan's Bar {{across the border in}} Clontibret, County Monaghan. On 15 August, Weir scouted the route to the pub but was stopped by Gardaí, who told him they were mounting extra security due to a warning from the RUC. Weir told the rest of the gang and they decided to attack Keady instead. The Army surveillance operation was ended and the bomb attack went ahead. Weir, Mitchell and the others involved were not arrested by the RUC and were allowed to remain in the force.|$|E
2500|$|Carnac the Magnificent, a turbaned psychic, {{could answer}} {{questions}} before seeing them. Carnac had a trademark entrance {{in which he}} always turned the wrong direction when coming onto stage and then tripped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>step</b> up to Carson's desk. (In one episode, technicians rigged Carson's desk to fall apart when Carnac fell into it.) These comedic missteps were an indication of Carnac's true prescient abilities. Ed McMahon would hand Carnac a series of envelopes containing questions, {{said to have been}} [...] "hermetically sealed in a mayonnaise jar buried under Funk & Wagnall's porch since noon today." [...] Carnac would place each envelope against his forehead and predict the answer, such as [...] "Gatorade". Then, he would read the question: [...] "What does an alligator get on welfare?" [...] Some of the jokes were feeble, and McMahon used pauses after terrible puns and audience groans to make light of Carnac's lack of comic success ("Carnac must be used to quiet surroundings"), prompting Carson to return an equal insult. Pat McCormick wrote some of the zaniest Carnac material. The one that had Ed and Carnac nearly rolling on the floor with sustained laughter was [...] "Siss, boom, bah" [...] Answer – [...] "Describe the sound made when a sheep explodes." [...] McMahon would always announce near the end, [...] "I hold in my hand the last envelope," [...] at which the audience would applaud wildly, prompting Carnac to pronounce a comedic [...] "curse" [...] on the audience, such as [...] "May a flock of wild geese leave a deposit on your breakfast!!", [...] "May your sister elope with a camel!", [...] "May a diseased yak take a liking to your sister", or the most famous: [...] "May the bird of paradise fly up your nose!" ...|$|E
