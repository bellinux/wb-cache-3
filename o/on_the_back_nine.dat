25|$|Irwin is {{the oldest}} player to finish {{in the top five}} in a senior major, with a third-place finish at the 2012 Senior PGA Championship at the age of 66. In the 2012 3M Championship, Irwin shot a score under his age {{for the first time in}} his career. His round of 65 {{included}} an eagle on the 9th hole and six consecutive birdies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hogan {{remains the}} only golfer in history to win the Masters, U.S. Open, and British Open in the same {{calendar}} year (1953). His 14-under par at the 1953 Masters set a record that stood for 12 years, and he remains one of just 10 golfers (Jack Nicklaus, Raymond Floyd, Ben Crenshaw, Tiger Woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson, Charl Schwartzel, Jordan Spieth and Justin Rose) to have recorded such a low score in the tournament. In 1967, at age 54, Hogan shot a record 30 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> at the Masters; the record stood until 1992.|$|E
25|$|Woods {{started the}} 2008 season with an eight-stroke {{victory at the}} Buick Invitational. The win marked his 62nd PGA Tour victory, tying him with Arnold Palmer for fourth on the all-time list. This marked his sixth victory at the event, the sixth time he has begun the PGA Tour season with a victory, and his third PGA Tour win in a row. The {{following}} week, he was trailing by four strokes going into {{the final round of}} the Dubai Desert Classic, but made six birdies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> for a dramatic one-stroke victory. He took home his 15th World Golf Championships event at the Accenture Match Play Championship with a record-breaking 8 & 7 victory in the final.|$|E

25|$|High {{winds and}} {{scattered}} showers pushed the scoring average {{more than two}} strokes higher with just seven sub-par rounds on Friday, compared to fifty on Thursday. The conditions were the worst during the morning, and the round's best of 68 belonging to co-leader Steve Marino and Ross Fisher, tied for fourth place. Retief Goosen shot an even par 70 to share fourth. Veteran Tom Watson continued his excellent performance; he struggled through the front nine, but holed long putts at the 16th and 18th, as he made three birdies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> to tie Marino for the lead at 135 (−5). Nearly sixty, Watson looked to become the oldest winner of a major championship by over a decade.|$|E
25|$|Faldo won {{his second}} major {{championship}} at the 1989 Masters. Starting his fourth round five shots off the lead held by Ben Crenshaw, Faldo's {{final round of}} 65 (consisting of eight birdies, nine pars and one bogey) was the low round of the tournament and enabled him {{to get into a}} playoff with Scott Hoch. Displaying some brilliant putting in his final round, Faldo holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the first hole and followed this up with birdies on the 2nd, 4th and 7th holes. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine,</b> Faldo holed birdie putts of 12 feet at the 13th, 5 feet at the 14th, 15 feet (with an 8-foot break) at the 16th, and 30 feet at the 17th. On the first hole of the ensuing sudden-death playoff, Hoch missed a 2-foot par putt that would have won him the tournament. On the 2nd playoff hole, amid the growing evening darkness, Faldo holed a 25-foot birdie putt to win the tournament.|$|E
2500|$|... 2003 {{proved to}} be a very {{successful}} year for Singh. He won four tournaments, had 18 top-10 finishes and was the PGA Tour's money leader (and had the second highest single-season total in PGA Tour history) with $7,573,907, beating Tiger Woods by $900,494, though Singh played 27 tournaments compared to Woods' 18 tournaments. Singh also tied a 9-hole scoring record at the U.S. Open with a 29 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> of his second round. His victories came at the Phoenix Open, the EDS Byron Nelson Championship, the John Deere Classic and the FUNAI Classic at the Walt Disney World Resort. He narrowly lost the vote for the PGA of America's Player of the Year to Tiger Woods.|$|E
50|$|As {{well as the}} {{standard}} eighteen holes, there are also two alternative ones, 17a and 18a. These allow players to play a reduced round of 11 holes, the front nine and then the two additional holes without having to filter in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> normal <b>back</b> <b>nine.</b> <b>The</b> club also has an extensive practice range, a substantial chipping area with three flags and a putting green.A recent addition are three short par three holes for practice.

This expedition was financed by Sir Percival Willoughby, a prominent member of the Merchant Venturers company formed in 1610 for the plantation of Newfoundland.|$|R

2500|$|Pádraig Harrington {{claimed his}} second {{consecutive}} major championship {{and third in}} the last six majors, two strokes ahead of runners-up Ben Curtis and Sergio García. Harrington shot his second straight 66 (−4), and like his victory three weeks earlier at Royal Birkdale, he won with tremendous play <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine.</b> Harrington birdied three of four holes at one point to erase a three-stroke deficit. He made three critical putts at each of the final three holes to seal the victory, which included an [...] par putt on the 72nd hole to make García's upcoming par putt meaningless. Harrington became the first European since 1930 to win the PGA Championship, and only the fourth golfer to win the Open Championship and PGA Championship in the same year.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Nicklaus capped {{his major}} {{championship}} career by recording his sixth Masters victory under incredible circumstances, posting a six-under par 30 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> at Augusta {{for a final}} round of seven-under-par 65. At the 17th hole, Nicklaus hit his second shot to within [...] and rolled it in for birdie, raising his putter in celebration and completing an eagle-birdie-birdie run. Nicklaus made a solid par-4 at the 72nd hole, {{and waited for the}} succeeding players, several of whom (Tom Kite, Greg Norman) were still in contention, to fall short. Nicklaus played the final ten holes seven under par, with six birdies and an eagle. At age 46, Nicklaus became the oldest Masters winner in history, a record which still stands. On the feat, sports columnist Thomas Boswell remarked, ...|$|E
2500|$|Mickelson's {{first major}} {{championship}} win came in his thirteenth {{year on the}} PGA Tour, when he secured victory in the 2004 Masters with an [...] birdie putt on the final hole. Ernie Els was the runner-up at a stroke back; the two men played in different pairs {{in the final round}} and [...] had traded birdies and eagles <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine.</b> In addition to getting the [...] "majors monkey" [...] off his back, Mickelson was now only the third golfer with a left-handed swing to win a major, the others being New Zealander Sir Bob Charles, who won The Open Championship in 1963, and Canadian Mike Weir, who won The Masters in 2003. (Like Mickelson, Weir is a right-hander who plays left-handed.) A fourth left-handed winner of a major is Bubba Watson, the Masters champion in 2012 and 2014. Unlike Mickelson and Weir, Watson is a natural left-hander.|$|E
50|$|Zach Johnson was {{the first}} round leader after {{shooting}} a 5-under-par 66. Both Johnson and Indian outsider Shiv Kapur reached 6-under during their rounds before dropping shots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tougher <b>back</b> <b>nine,</b> Kapur doing so during difficult afternoon conditions by birdieing six of his first seven holes. Two Spaniards, 49-year-old Miguel Ángel Jiménez and Rafael Cabrera-Bello, had also reached 5-under before late bogeys, as had veteran Mark O'Meara. Two seniors were in the top five: O'Meara (56 years old), the 1998 champion, was tied for second at 67 and Tom Lehman (54), the 1996 champion, was tied for fourth at 68. Defending champion Ernie Els shot 74 (+3), tarnished by a triple-bogey after bunker trouble at the 16th. World number one Tiger Woods, playing in the tough later conditions, opened with a bogey after snap-hooking his tee shot and taking an unplayable lie, but fought {{his way back to}} 69 (−2) in pursuit of his 15th major championship. Out-of-form world number two Rory McIlroy, however, struggled to a 79 (+8) despite an early tee time. Phil Mickelson, four-time major champion and the winner of the previous week's Scottish Open, also had a 69 despite a closing bogey.|$|R

In March 2010, the two met in the final of tournament to crown the inaugural ROH World Television Champion. Edwards won the match, leading to them both seeking more of a singles career and Richards began {{competing}} for the World Championship. In November, Edwards won the Survival of the Fittest tournament, which gave him the right to challenge World Champion Roderick Strong, which he successfully did at Manhattan Mayhem IV in March 2011. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a <b>nine</b> match winning streak in singles competition, Richards was announced as the challenger for Edwards' title at the Best in the World 2011 iPPV in June.

50|$|At {{the date}} of the Armistice, seventy-two of the 147 bombers still in the hands of Regia Aeronautica were CANT Z.1007s. The largest groups were in Perugia (22 aircraft) and in the Aegean sea (19 aircraft). Three days after <b>the</b> armistice, <b>on</b> 11 September, <b>the</b> CANT Z.1007s that were in Perugia, joined by eight more, took off for the base of Alghero in Sardinia, losing two of their number to German flak. On 16 September these bombers {{attacked}} German vessels that were carrying troops and equipment from Sardinia to Corsica, and one more aircraft was lost to flak. <b>On</b> 15 October, <b>the</b> CANT Z.1007s, then based in Sardinia, were grouped with those in Southern Italy to form the Raggruppamento Bombardamento Trasporti (Unit for bombing and transport), under the badge of the Aeronautica Cobelligerante Italiana (ACI or Air Force of the South, Aeronautica del Sud), Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force in English.The worst day for the co-belligerent Z.1007s was 14 May 1944, when Gruppo 88 sent twelve Z.1007s to Tito's forces to deliver supplies. The aircraft dropped 96 food containers on Kolasin, Montenegro, but <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way <b>back</b> <b>nine</b> bombers lost contact with the escort of Macchi C.205s and Reggiane Re. 2001s and were attacked over the Adriatic sea by 7/JG 27 Messerschmitt Bf 109s.

2500|$|Watson's {{first major}} {{championship}} win {{came at the}} 2012 Masters Tournament. He began the final round at six-under-par, three strokes off the lead, held by Peter Hanson. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>nine,</b> Watson bogeyed the par-3 12th hole to return to even par for the round. He then recorded four consecutive birdies for a round of 68 (-4) and tied for the 72-hole lead with fourth-round playing partner Louis Oosthuizen at ten-under-par. In the sudden-death playoff, Oosthuizen and Watson both made par on the uphill 18th hole. On the next hole, the downhill 10th, both drove their tee shots towards the woods {{to the right of}} the hole. Oosthuizen's landed in the rough [...] away, while Watson's ball landed deep in the woods on pine straw, [...] from the pin without a clear shot to the green. Watson executed a miraculous recovery shot with 40 yards of hook on his 52-degree gap wedge and stopped the ball within fifteen feet of the hole. Oosthuizen's approach shot landed short of the green, but he chipped past the hole and narrowly missed his lengthy putt for par. Watson trickled his birdie putt a foot past the hole, took his time on the very short par putt, then made it for the emotional victory. The win took him to a world ranking of four, a career-high at the time.|$|E

6000|$|Well, {{the time}} of the {{appearance}} of the famous tragedy drew near, and my friends canvassed the town to get a body of supporters for the opening night. I am ill at asking favours from the great; but when my Lord Wrotham came to London, I went, with Theo in my hand, to wait on his lordship, who received us kindly, out of regard for his old friend, her father--though he good-naturedly shook a finger at me (at which my little wife hung down her head), for having stole a march <b>on</b> <b>the</b> good General. However, he would do his best for her father's daughter; hoped for a success; said he had heard great things of the piece; and engaged a number of places for himself and his friends. But this patron secured, I had no other. [...] "Mon cher, at my age," [...] says the Baroness, [...] "I should bore myself to death at a tragedy: but I will do my best; and I will certainly send my people to the boxes. Yes!
