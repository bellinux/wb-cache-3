5|$|Current {{thinking}} {{divides the}} albatrosses into four genera. The {{number of species}} {{is a matter of}} debate. The IUCN and BirdLife International recognise 22 extant species (listed below), ITIS recognise 21 (the 22 below minus T. steadi), and <b>one</b> <b>recent</b> paper proposed a reduction to 13 (indicated in parentheses below), comprising the traditional 14 species minus D. amsterdamensis.|$|E
5|$|In {{nearly all}} species of birds, an individual's sex is {{determined}} at fertilisation. However, <b>one</b> <b>recent</b> study demonstrated temperature-dependent sex determination among the Australian brushturkey, for which higher temperatures during incubation {{resulted in a}} higher female-to-male sex ratio. This, however, was later proven to not be the case. These birds do not exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, but temperature-dependent sex mortality.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{does not}} say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but <b>one</b> <b>recent</b> history asserts that Beornwulf was almost {{certainly}} the one who attacked. According to this view, Beornwulf may {{have taken advantage of}} the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia in the summer of 825. Beornwulf's motivation to launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.|$|E
5|$|The female protagonist, Liénor, {{is notable}} {{because of her}} active nature: she herself unmasks the seneschal. She found a quick {{successor}} in the active female protagonist of Tibaut's Roman de la Poire. At least <b>one</b> <b>recent</b> publication states that Liénor might make a justifiable claim to being the romance's true hero.|$|E
5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), <b>one</b> <b>recent</b> example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax {{may turn out to be}} large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E

50|$|Two {{or three}} species were {{generally}} recognized, the Yellow-billed {{and one or}} two black-billed <b>ones.</b> <b>Recent</b> research has cast doubt on the taxonomy of the Pica magpies. P. hudsonia and P. nuttalli are each other's closest relatives, but may not be different species. If they are, however, at least the Korean race of P. pica would have to be considered a separate species, too.|$|R
5|$|Overall, {{the risk}} of sinkholes {{occurring}} in Guatemala City is high and unpredictable. <b>One</b> <b>recent,</b> similar sinkhole had collapsed in 2007, forming a pit 100 metres deep. The 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole was formed by fluid from a sewer eroding uncemented volcanic ash, limestone, and other pyroclastic deposits underlying Guatemala City. The hazards around the pipe have since then been mitigated, by improved handling of the city's wastewater and runoff. Several rainstorms {{also contributed to the}} sinkhole's collapse, as stormwater percolated into the ground, further dissolving the rocks beneath Guatemala City. The 2010 sinkhole was formed for similar reasons.|$|E
5|$|The five {{best known}} appellations in the Languedoc include Languedoc AOC (formerly {{known as the}} Coteaux du Languedoc), Corbières AOC, Faugères, Minervois AOC, and Saint-Chinian AOCs. The vast {{majority}} of Languedoc wines are produced by wine cooperatives which number more than 500. However, the appellation system {{in the region is}} undergoing considerable changes with both new appellations being created and existing ones changing. <b>One</b> <b>recent</b> change is that the Coteaux du Languedoc has changed name to Languedoc and been extended to include also the Roussillon.|$|E
5|$|There existed a {{hierarchy}} of pay between types of auxiliary, with cavalry higher paid than infantry. <b>One</b> <b>recent</b> estimate {{is that in the}} time of Augustus, the annual pay structure was: eques alaris (gregalis) 263 denarii, eques cohortalis 225, and cohors infantryman 188. The same differentials (of about 20% between grades) seem to have existed at the time of Domitian (r. 81-96). However, Goldsworthy points out that the common assumption that rates of pay were universal across provinces and units is unproven. Pay may have varied according to the origin of the unit.|$|E

25|$|However, heterodontosaurs are {{not universally}} {{considered}} to be ornithopods and have been considered {{more closely related to}} the suborder Marginocephalia, which includes ceratopsians and pachycephalosaurs.
