5|$|For years Peckham {{taught at}} Paris, {{where he was}} in contact {{with many of the}} leading {{scholars}} of his time, including Thomas Aquinas. He famously debated Aquinas on at least two occasions during 1269 and 1270, during which Peckham defended the conservative theological position, and Thomas put forth his views on the soul. The Thomist doctrine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of form was condemned after these debates. His theological works later were used by his pupil Roger Marston who in turn inspired Duns Scotus.|$|E
5|$|Public {{perception}} of the anthem is mixed among Russians. The anthem reminds {{some of the best}} days of Russia and past sacrifices, while it reminds others of the violence that occurred under the rule of Stalin. The Russian government maintains that the anthem is a symbol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> of the people, and that it respects the past. A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 25% liked it.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{original}} Mass Effect, where weapons overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods, {{the weapons of}} Mass Effect 2 have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a damage-absorbing shield. When the shield is fully depleted, further damage reduces the hit points of a secondary health meter. Both the shield bar and health meter automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. The player can revive fallen squad members with the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> power. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E

5|$|Pillars of Eternity was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Paradox Interactive. The game uses a modified version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> game engine made specifically for Pillars of Eternity. The game was directed by Josh Sawyer. There were multiple competing pitches for Pillars of Eternitys storyline within the studio, and the one worked on by Eric Fenstermaker and George Ziets ultimately won, after which Fenstermaker, who previously worked as a writer on the company's , was designated the game's lead narrative designer. Also involved in production were Adam Brennecke, Chris Avellone and Tim Cain. The audio director of Pillars of Eternity was Justin Bell, who also composed the game's score. Bell stated he {{was inspired by the}} music of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale when composing the game's music.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like heat or toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members with the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E

From these postulates stems the belief that God periodically reveals his will through divine messengers, whose purpose is to transform <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> humankind and to develop, within those who respond, moral and spiritual qualities. Religion is thus seen as orderly, unified, and progressive from age to age.|$|R

25|$|Apart from Jan Blahoslav, {{other famous}} theologians <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> were Luke of Prague, Jan Augusta or John Amos Comenius. During {{the time of}} the intransigent Counter-Reformation in Bohemia and Moravia after 1620, the leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Unity</b> were forced to leave the country. Comenius tried to lead the Unity in exile but after his death it was in decline. In 1722 the Unity of the Brethren was renewed in Saxony by emigrants from Moravia with support of a local count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf. Since that time the Unity has also been known as the Moravian Church.|$|E
