Neste artigo, propomos uma leitura do processo de escrita de Maria Gabriela Llansol a partir do conceito de dobra, tal como desenvolvido por Deleuze em A Dobra, Leibniz e o Barroco. Este conceito remete a um traço característico do Barroco, mas que pode, contudo, ultrapassar seus limites históricos. No Barroco, a dobra define tanto um recurso estético como uma componente de sua visão de mundo, pois garante um efeito de imanência que contradiz tradicional oposição entre o material e o imaterial, entre o visível e o inteligível. Na escrita da autora portuguesa, a dobra se nos  apresenta como um elemento fundamental, tanto na caracterização de sua visão do  mundo como na técnica que ela desenvolve, opondo a textualidade à narratividade.  Assim, o conceito resumiria a percepção do real através das dobras que esta escrita  evoca, assim como o que a autora caracteriza como a técnica da sobreimpressão, na  qual a linguagem abriria caminho a diversos níveis de realidade, unindo-os e  indiscernindo seus limites, tal como o Barroco faz com o plano divino e o terreno. Procuramos demonstrar ainda como este conceito se aplica à própria escrita, a partir da proliferação de imagens (que a autora opõe a metáfora) que configura as cenas fulgor...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} pinpoints and analyzes {{a series}} of literary texts defined as radical because of their uncompromising attitude towards readers 2 ̆ 7 expectations. Written during the new avant-garde movements (between 1959 and 1974), they are the extreme results of the verbo-visual experiments of the age, and fall into two categories: illegibility and tridimensionality. In {{order to understand the}} reasons for the proliferation of such works, the first and second chapters provide a detailed historic and conceptual framework of the new avant-garde phenomenon and of the hostile reaction of the literary establishment to this flow of innovation. What characterizes these movements (Gruppo 63, Gruppo 70, Parasurrealisti and Continuum, among others) is a new self awareness {{of the role of the}} avant-garde within the capitalist logic. This awareness produced an enormous amount of critical theory within these groups, as well as a strict focus on language experimentation. What emerged due to this research on language was the expansion of the boundaries of literature, which began to include visual elements, objects, and performance. A detailed reading of the heavily negative criticism directed towards the new avant-garde clarifies which literary taboos were broken and defines the characteristics of radical texts, whose primary intention is to disturb the reader, to shake passive attitudes towards art. In chapter three I provide a close analysis of visually illegible texts 2 ̆ 7 dynamics that are divided into <b>over-impressions,</b> erasures, and cutting. Chapter four deals with three-dimensional texts, i. e. texts presented as part of actual objects, a circumstance that immediately alters the normal perception of the writing, here intertwined with the sculptural dimension. ^ Through a combination of historical and theoretical studies and close reading of these texts, this dissertation recovers a literary production often forgotten or repressed, and reveals the importance that extreme experimentations hold in the developments of literary history. ...|$|R
