5|$|Due to the {{rotation}} of the Earth, tropical cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere tend to move from east to west. This causes tropical cyclones to approach the West Coast of the United States infrequently. Another inhibiting factor for a California landfall is the water temperatures. Because of the water currents, the waters off California are rarely above , which is too cold for hurricanes to sustain themselves. This tropical cyclone was rare enough that only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones brought tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States during the twentieth century. The Long Beach Tropical Storm was the only <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> landfall; the other three hit Mexico before moving north.|$|E

This led to him being given one final chance on 6 October, where he rose to the occasion and impressed his CTU teammates enough to continue his association with them. To solidify his status with the stable, Devitt teamed with CTU leader, Jushin Thunder Liger to take on Wataru Inoue and Ryusuke Taguchi. In a huge twist, Devitt was the <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the final cover on Inoue following a stiff brainbuster. From then on he was officially recognized as a member of the CTU.|$|E

5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting for <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, {{and the other}} reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{traveling}} over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing {{to a few}} hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the Midwest and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150–$200 per person. As the trail matured, additional costs for ferries and toll roads were thought to have been about $30 per wagon.|$|E
25|$|Between the 1380s {{and early}} 1510s, many Islamic missionaries {{propagated}} Islam and proselytised the Ladakhi people. Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, Sayyid Muhammad Nur Baksh and Mir Shamsuddin Iraqi were three important Sufi missionaries who propagated Islam to the locals. Mir Sayyid Ali {{was the first}} <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Muslim converts in Ladakh and {{is often described as}} the founder of Islam in Ladakh. Several mosques were built in Ladakh during this period, including in Mulbhe, Padum and Shey, the capital of Ladakh. His principal disciple, Sayyid Muhammad Nur Baksh also propagated Islam to Ladakhis and the Balti people rapidly converted to Islam. Noorbakshia Islam is named after him and his followers are only found in Baltistan and Ladakh. During his youth, Sultan Zain-ul-Abidin expelled the mystic Sheikh Zain Shahwalli for showing disrespect to him. The sheikh then went to Ladakh and proselytised many people to Islam. In 1505, Shamsuddin Iraqi, a noted Shia scholar, visited Kashmir and Baltistan. He helped in spreading Shia Islam in Kashmir and converted the overwhelming majority of Muslims in Baltistan to his school of thought.|$|E

The West Indies finished fifth – their best position at a World Cup ever – to qualify for the 2009 World Cup, and also beat South Africa 2–1 in an ODI series immediately following the World Cup.
