50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of ring A (see Fig. 1) {{begins with}} prephenate {{which is a}} derived from the shikimic acid biosynthetic pathway. The enzyme NovF catalyzes the decarboxylation of prephenate while simultaneously reducing {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADP+) to produce NADPH. Following this NovQ catalyzes the electrophilic substitution of the phenyl ring with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) otherwise known as prenylation. DMAPP can come from either the mevalonic acid pathway or the deoxyxylulose biosynthetic pathway. Next the 3-dimethylallyl-4-hydroxybenzoate molecule is subjected to two <b>oxidative</b> <b>decarboxylations</b> by NovR and molecular oxygen. NovR is a non-heme iron oxygenase with a unique bifunctional catalysis.

This pathway diverges from the canonical {{one at the}} level of uroporphyrinogen III and progresses via a distinct branch, where sirohaem acts as an intermediate precursor being converted into haem b by a set of novel enzymes, named the alternative haem biosynthetic proteins (Ahb). In this work, we report the biochemical characterisation of the Desulfovibrio vulgaris AhbD enzyme that catalyses the last step of the pathway. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that AhbD promotes the cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and converts iron-coproporphyrin III via two <b>oxidative</b> <b>decarboxylations</b> to yield haem b, methionine and the 5 ′-deoxyadenosyl radical. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies demonstrated that AhbD contains two [4 Fe– 4 S] 2 +/ 1 + centres and that binding of the substrates S-adenosylmethionine and iron-coproporphyrin III induces conformational modifications in both centres. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that D. vulgaris AhbD belongs to the radical SAM protein superfamily, with a GGE-like motif and two cysteine-rich sequences typical for ligation of SAM molecules and iron-sulfur clusters, respectively.

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been much {{excitement}} regarding the use of isoacids as a feed additive. In the fall of 1985, isoacids became available as a new FDAapproved feed additive for dairy cows by Eastman® Chemical Co., under the trade name Eastman IsoPlus Nutritional Supplement. News releases in 1986 reported promising results obtained by Dr. Steven Nissen at Iowa State University in research with one of the isoacids, 2 -ketoisocaproic acid.

Isoacids are the branched ketoacids resulting from the natural rumen degradation of their corresponding amino acids. IsoPlus™ is the calcium salt of four volatile fatty acids (isobutyric, isovaleric, valeric, and 2 -methylbutyric). Valeric acid is a straight chain 5 -carbon fatty acid.

The carboxylation reactions which are useful in the formation of carbon-carbon bonds in biological systems seem to fall into two or three groups: those which exhibit an apparent ATP requirement, and those which exhibit a reduced pyridine nucleotide requirement, and those which exhibit no apparent ATP requirement. Of the first group at least four cases, and possibly six or seven, are known, and one interpretation of them involves the preliminary formation of 'active' carbon dioxide, generally {{in the form of a}} carbonic acid-phosphoric acid anhydride.

We grew seedlings of Eucalyptus globulus at 16 and 28 degrees C for four to six weeks, then measured q and R(CO 2) using isothermal calorimetry. Respiratory rate at a given temperature was increased by a lower growth temperature but eta(H) was unaffected. Enthalpy conversion efficiency - and, therefore, carbon conversion efficiency - decreased with increasing temperature from 15 to 35 degrees C. The ratio of oxidative phosphorylation to oxygen consumption (P/O ratio) was inferred in vivo from eta(H) and by assuming a constant ratio of growth to maintenance respiration with changing temperature. The P/O ratio decreased from 2. 1 at 10 - 15 degrees C to less than 0. 3 at 35 degrees C, suggesting that decreased efficiency was not only due to activity of the alternative oxidase pathway. In agreement with predictions from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, growth rate was maximal near 25 degrees C, where the calculated P/O ratio was about half maximum. We propose that less efficient pathways, such as the alternative oxidase pathway, are necessary to satisfy the condition of conductance matching whilst maintaining a near constant phosphorylation potential.
