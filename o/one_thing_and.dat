25|$|Socrates {{admits that}} Protagoras has given an {{excellent}} answer {{and that there}} is only one small thing to clarify which he is certain that the Sophist will do easily. He asks Protagoras as to whether the attributes that form virtue, such as bravery, kindness and wisdom are one or many things, like for example the parts of a golden object which are fused together or that of a face which form a whole while retaining their individual substance (329d). Protagoras answers the second but avoids engaging in dialogue and digresses into a rhetoric which does not answer the question sufficiently but still manages to arouse the excitement of their young public. Socrates complains that Protagoras is long-winded, like a gong that booms when you strike it and won't stop until you lay a hand on it. It is a typical moment of Socrates opposite a Sophist where the latter is using eloquent speech to hide arguments that might not stand logical scrutiny while the former is trying to use his notorious question/answer format that will lead to a logical conclusion in his favour. Protagoras begins to bristle at this and so Socrates supposes that their styles are opposite. He personally doesn't like long-winded speeches like the one Protagoras just delivered, because he is forgetful and cannot follow the train of thought (334d), and Protagoras does not like to be peppered with questions that seem to lead them off track. Socrates gets up to leave, grousing that companionable talk is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> public speaking another (336b). After the intervention of several of the listeners, the men agree to compromise their styles so the discussion can continue.|$|E

500|$|The novel Drive by James Sallis was {{published}} in 2005. Producers Marc Platt and Adam Siegel of Marc Platt Productions optioned the novel after Siegel read a review in Publishers Weekly. The driver intrigued Siegel because he was [...] "the kind of character you rarely see anymore [...] {{he was a man}} with a purpose; he was very good at <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> made no apologies for it". The character interested Platt, because he reminded him of movie heroes he looked up to as a child, characters typically portrayed by Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood.|$|E
500|$|After Robert Koehler of Variety previewed the {{screener}} edit of {{the series}} at the Outfest film festival, he wrote: [...] "What would have been spectacular stuff just 10 years ago is now something closer to a high-quality Oprah special, humanizing in rather simplistic terms complex lives…". Anthony Glassman of the Gay People's Chronicle was also cautious in his assessment: [...] "The word 'groundbreaking' should be used sparingly, and perhaps it does not apply here. TransGeneration does <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> it does it well. It shows the viewer the reality and normality {{of the lives of}} these students and those around them, their family and friends." ...|$|E

Moore judges that the article was neither well written nor particularly persuasive, but notes that other writers at the time made the connection between sport, cricket, the ideology of the British Empire and Fascism.|$|E

500|$|While Jones is {{credited}} with writing the screenplay, the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May.

I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> I wanted it to be about something else."

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork in October 2007, Taylor {{said there would be}} an equal proportion of electronic elements to live material, as the band doesn't [...] "do things by adding <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> taking something else away". The album contained maximalist and minimalist songs; several tracks on the album were influenced by rock and heavy metal music, and the track [...] "Wrestlers" [...] started taking a new direction because the band was [...] "wrestling with the idea of making an R.

He said, [...] "if the press release says it's faster and rockier it doesn't account for {{the fact that there are}} more ballads on this record than any other record."

500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} {{at the start}} of the season when head coach Ralph Friedgen selected senior Jordan Steffy as the starting quarterback over junior Chris Turner. In 2007, when Steffy suffered a concussion against 10th-ranked Rutgers, the relatively untested Turner took over and led Maryland to an upset victory. He then started the remainder of the season, compiled a 4–5 record in games he started, and led another upset against eighth-ranked Boston College. In comparing the practice performances of Steffy, Turner, and third-stringer Josh Portis, offensive coordinator James Franklin said:It gets hard if one quarterback all through spring and all through summer camp was statistically better in almost every single category, it's hard to rationalize not making him the starter ... because your gut feeling is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> the statistics are another. Jordan led by a pretty large amount in completion percentage ... the least interception percentage. He didn't lead in yards per ... percentage of explosive plays. I consider an explosive play a play of 16yards or more ... Portis led in that and Turner was second and Jordan was third.|$|E
500|$|The show {{revolved}} around themes of evolution, {{as well as}} her paranoias represented on The Fame Monster. While developing the tour Gaga spoke about original sin and demons inside human beings; [...] "So we talked about growth, and that led us into this kind of scientific space, and we started talking about evolution and the evolution of humanity and how we begin as <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>and</b> we become another." [...] This theme of monsters and evolution played a part in the fashion for the tour, which according to Gaga was [...] "another level from where we were with the Fame Ball. [...] It's going to be a truly artistic experience that is going to take the form of the greatest post-apocalyptic house party that you've ever been to." [...] Although Gaga stated that she was inspired by the things she and West were doing with the Fame Kills tour, she concluded that {{she did not want to}} use any of the things that they had designed together. Later, she said that Fame Kills was [...] "the great lost tour", but confirmed that some of the elements of it were incorporated into The Monster Ball.|$|E

Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, Beyoncé's former bandmates from the group Destiny's Child provided background vocals along with Stefan Skarbek and Boots. The audio mixing of [...] "Superpower" [...] was completed by Tony Maserati at Mirrorbal Studios and Clockworks Studios and the track was eventually mastered by Tom Coyne and Aya Merrill at Sterling Sound. Beyoncé explained on her iTunes Radio channel that she considered [...] "Superpower" [...] to be a [...] "powerful" [...] song with strong vocals; she went on saying, [...] "he lyrics that Frank Ocean wrote... it's like he thought of <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> the thought just keeps going and going...

500|$|Besides Morrison, {{there is}} {{conflicting}} information about {{who participated in}} the session. In addition to the group's original members (guitarist Billy Harrison, bassist Alan Henderson, drummer Ronnie Millings, and keyboard player Eric Wrixon), others have been suggested: Pat McAuley on keyboards, Bobby Graham on a second drum kit, Jimmy Page on second guitar, and Peter Bardens on keyboards. As Page biographer George Case notes, [...] "There is a dispute over whether it is Page's piercing blues line that defines the song, if he only played a run Harrison had already devised, or if Page only backed up Harrison himself". Morrison has acknowledged Page's participation in the early sessions: [...] "He played rhythm guitar on <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> doubled a bass riff on the other" [...] and Morrison biographer Johnny Rogan notes that Page [...] "doubled the distinctive riff already worked out by Billy Harrison". Music critic Greil Marcus comments that during the song's quieter middle passage [...] "the guitarist, session player Jimmy Page or not, seems to be feeling his way into another song, flipping half-riffs, high, random, distracted metal shavings". Them's blues-rock arrangement is [...] "now regarded justly as definitive", with [...] "much of its appeal emanat from the tingling lead guitar section", according to music writer Adam Clayson.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, Graeme Souness became {{manager and}} {{declared}} his intent {{to build a}} team based on merit {{rather than relying on}} personal restrictions. A year later he signed Rangers' first black player Mark Walters. In 1989, Souness signed Mo Johnston, a former Celtic player and openly Catholic. This was Rangers' first signing of an openly Catholic player since the unwritten policy was introduced, though there had been claims in the media that it was done to counter a FIFA inquiry into Old Firm sectarianism. According to Johnston's agent Bill McMurdo, Souness had been eager to sign a Catholic player, and had negotiated in secret with [...] "four or five" [...] before signing Johnston. At a press conference following his signing, the English Rangers players attended however the Scottish players boycotted it. The chairman of the Rangers Supporters Association stated [...] "It's a sad day for Rangers, {{there will be a lot}} of people handing back their season tickets. I don't want to see a Roman Catholic at Ibrox. Rangers have always stood for <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> the majority of the support have been brought up with the idea of a true blue Rangers team." [...] As he predicted, Rangers fans responded by burning their season tickets; Celtic supporters claimed Johnston had betrayed Catholicism, calling him [...] "Judas". The Rangers kitman refused to lay out Johnston's kit before each match as a protest against a Catholic playing for Rangers.|$|E
500|$|In a 2015 interview, Pierre {{notes that}} fans {{have told him}} that they find Commit This to Memory a [...] "winter album," [...] to which he agrees, noting the unintentional mention {{of the new year}} in several songs. [...] His lyricism on Commit This to Memory centralizes around change and, in his words, [...] "being a {{complete}} fuckup, yet, at the same time, being somewhat successful". On the record, he [...] "addresses the themes of substance abuse, psychological disorders and failing relationships." [...] Pierre penned [...] "Everything Is Alright" [...] as a summary of his OCD (Obsessive–compulsive disorder) tendencies. He intended to utilize his social anxiety and fears in the song's form, which he has since employed in numerous other compositions. [...] "I don’t think the [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] is correct, but it’s something where the verses are <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> then the chorus is another, but it's sort of like giving yourself a pep talk," [...] said Pierre. The song's lyrics include hating such mundane things as [...] "theme parks, flying, strangers, [...] waiting in line," [...] things that Pierre genuinely disliked {{at the time of the}} song's writing. For the record, he intended to simplify his lyrics to enhance storytelling and he drew inspiration from Tom Waits, Ben Folds and John K. Samson's writing styles. Keeping in the Waits/Folds inspiration, Pierre strove to write from another person's point of view; in the case of [...] "Time Turned Fragile", it is sung from the perspective of his father.|$|E

500|$|On December 12, 2007, Keyes {{participated in}} the Des Moines Registers Republican presidential debate, {{televised}} nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks. This {{was the first major}} presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, because I think the most important emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's position on abortion.|$|E
500|$|Another {{challenge}} that the studio {{had to face}} was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky quality. According to principal software engineer Andrew Selle, [...] "'s not really a fluid. It’s not really a solid. It breaks apart. It can be compressed into snowballs. All of these different effects {{are very difficult to}} capture simultaneously." [...] In order to achieve this, software engineers used advanced mathematics (the material point method) and physics, with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles to create a snow simulator software application called Matterhorn. The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in the film, including several key sequences. Software engineer Alexey Stomakhin referred to snow as [...] "an important character in the film," [...] therefore it attracted special attention from the filmmakers. [...] "When you stretch it, snow will break into chunks. Since snow doesn't have any connections, it doesn't have a mesh, it can break very easily. So that was an important property we took advantage of," [...] explained Selle. [...] "There you see [...] walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk up and you see [...] being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces. It's very organic how that happens. You don't see that they're pieces already– you see the snow as <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> then breaking up." [...] The tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow, as it ensured that the snow reacted naturally to each step.|$|E
500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>and</b> we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, so I do what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E
