These fresh Zeros helped defeat the next American air strike from Midway, 11 Vought SB2U Vindicator dive bombers from VMSB-241, which attacked the battleship Haruna starting around 08:30. Haruna escaped damage and 3 of the Vindicators were shot down. Although all the American air strikes had thus far caused negligible damage, {{they kept the}} Japanese carrier forces <b>off-balance</b> as Nagumo endeavored to prepare a response to news, received at 08:20, of the sighting of American carrier forces to his northeast.|$|E

From 1883 the club fielded several Scottish players, after Sudell went on a recruitment expedition to Scotland. The club arranged jobs for the players, and supplemented their income with <b>off-balance</b> sheet payments.

50|$|In {{martial arts}} and combat sports, a {{takedown}} {{is a technique}} that involves <b>off-balancing</b> an opponent and bringing {{him or her to}} the ground, typically with the attacker landing on top. The process of quickly advancing on an opponent and attempting a takedown is known as shooting for a takedown, or simply shooting. Takedowns are usually distinguished from throws by the forward motion and target of advancement (typically the legs); the terms are used interchangeably for techniques. Takedowns are featured in all forms of wrestling and stand-up grappling.|$|R
50|$|Suntukan also borrows {{moves from}} dumog (upright wrestling). Dumog {{is based on}} the concept of “control points” or “choke points” on the human body, which are {{manipulated}} - for example: by grabbing, pushing, pulling - in order to disrupt the opponent’s balance and to keep him off balance. This also creates opportunities for close quarter striking using head butts, knees, forearms and elbows. This is accomplished by the use of arm wrenching, shoving, shoulder ramming, and other <b>off-balancing</b> techniques in conjunction with punches and kicks. For example, the attacker's arm could be grabbed and pulled downward to expose their head to a knee strike.|$|R
5|$|Scootie Randall {{returned}} to the Owls and earned the start, although he only played for six minutes and did not score. The game began with hot shooting by Penn State's Talor Battle, who drained three of his first four threes to put the Nittany Lions up 20–11. A 17-point first half by Juan Fernandez helped Temple Owls take a 35–33 lead at halftime. Jeff Brooks, a starting forward for the Nittany Lions, dislocated his right shoulder a minute into the half and sat {{out the rest of}} the game. In the second half, there were ten lead changes, and neither team led by more than four points. Ramone Moore's 15 foot shot with 1:10 remaining pulled the Owls ahead 62–61. In Penn State's ensuing possession, Battle took the ball to the hoop but was blocked by Rahlir Jefferson, and Temple Owls took possession. Fernandez was fouled, and his pair of free throws with 28 seconds left extended the Owl lead to 64–61. With the clock at 12.2, Battle hit a three pointer from beyond the NBA line to tie the game at 64-64. Fran Dunphy called a timeout, and Khalif Wyatt advised Dunphy to draw up a play for Fernandez. Fernandez was double-teamed and was forced to take an <b>off-balance</b> 18-footer. The ball fell through the hoop with four seconds remaining, and Temple Owls won 66–64. Fernandez and Moore finished with 23 points, a season high for Fernandez.|$|E
5|$|With the {{approval}} of Diệm, Nhu used the declaration of martial law to order armed men into the Buddhist pagodas. Nhu chose {{a time when he}} knew the American Embassy was leaderless. Frederick Nolting had returned to the United States and his successor Lodge was yet to arrive. As the high command of the ARVN worked closely with American military advisers deployed in the country, Nhu used the combat police and Tung's Special Forces, who took their orders directly from him. The men were dressed in standard army uniforms, such as paratroop attire, to frame the regulars for the raids. Nhu's motive was to avoid responsibility for a violent operation— which would anger the Vietnamese public and the American leadership. In falsely implicating the army in the attacks, Nhu intended to dent the confidence of the Vietnamese populace and the Americans in the senior officers who were plotting against him. Nhu evidently hoped the Buddhist majority and the Americans would blame the army for the raids and become less inclined to support a coup by the generals. In the past, Nhu's tactics in playing the generals against one another had kept conspirators <b>off-balance</b> and thwarted coup attempts. The raids were not unexpected, as the Buddhists had prepared themselves for the attacks, as had journalists, who were watching military installations for signs of movement.|$|E

5000|$|A throw, in martial arts, is a {{grappling}} {{technique that}} involves <b>off-balancing</b> or lifting an opponent, and throwing {{them to the}} ground, in Japanese martial arts referred to as nage-waza, 投げ技, [...] "throwing technique". Throws usually involve a rotating motion, the practitioner performing the throw disconnects with the opponent, and ends balanced and on their feet {{as opposed to a}} takedown where both finish on the ground. Throws can however also be followed into a top position, in which case the person executing the throw does not disengage from the opponent. Certain throwing techniques called sacrifice throws (sutemi-waza, 捨身技, [...] "sacrifice technique") involve putting oneself in a potentially disadvantageous position, such as on the ground, in order to execute a throw.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the Rolling Stock Balancing Problem (RSBP). This problem arises at a passenger railway operator when {{the rolling stock}} has to be re-scheduled due to changing circumstances. These problems arise both in the planning process and during operations. The RSBP has as input a timetable and a rolling stock schedule where the allocation of the rolling stock among the stations does not fit to the allocation {{before and after the}} planning period. The problem is then to correct these <b>off-balances,</b> leading to a modified schedule that can be implemented in practice. For practical usage of solution approaches for the RSBP, it is important to solve the problem quickly. Therefore, the focus is on heuristic approaches. In this paper, we describe two heuristics and compare them with each other on some (variants of) real-life instances of NS, the main Dutch passenger railway operator. Finally, to get some insight in the quality of the proposed heuristics, we also compare their outcomes with optimal solutions obtained by solving existing rolling stock circulation models. heuristics;railway planning;integer linear programming;rolling stock re-scheduling...|$|R
40|$|Millimeter wave (mmWave) {{communications}} {{have been}} postulated {{as one of}} the most disruptive technologies for future 5 G systems. Among mmWave bands the 60 -GHz radio technology is specially suited for ultradense small cells and mobile data offloading scenarios. Many challenges remain to be addressed in mmWave communications but among them deafness, or misalignment between transmitter and receivers beams, and interference management lie among the most prominent ones. In the recent years, scenarios considering negligible interference on mmWave resource allocation have been rather common in literature. To this end, interestingly, many open issues still need to be addressed such as the applicability of noise-limited regime for mmWave. Furthermore, in mmWave the beam-steering mechanism imposes a forced silence period, in the course of which no data can be conveyed, that should not be neglected in throughput/delay calculations. This paper introduces mmWave enabled Small Cell Networks (SCNs) with relaying capabilities where as a result of a coordinated meta-heuristically optimized beamwidth/alignment-delay approach overall system throughput is optimized. Simulations have been conveyed for three transmitter densities under TDMA and naive 'all-on' scheduling producing average per node throughput increments of up to 248 %. The paper further elaborates on the <b>off-balancing</b> impact of alignment delay and time-multiplexing strategies by illustrating how the foreseen transition that increasing the number of transmitters produces in the regime of a fixed-node size SCN in downlink operation fades out by a poor choice in the scheduling strategy.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} value {{relevance}} of nuclear decommissioning costs and back end costs (nuclear recycle costs), which are accruals related to {{nuclear power plants}} in electric utilities. We analyze the association between those accruals and stock price levels {{at the end of}} fiscal year, based on earnings capitalization model. The findings of this paper are as follows. (1) Recognizing of decommissioning costs and back end costs contribute to increase the quality of earnings of electric companies. <b>Off-balancing</b> regulation, which compels not to recognize some portion of back end costs, distorts the quality of earnings. (2) Decommissioning costs and back end costs, which are measured by estimating of future payments, are value relevant. However, the contents of information differ each other. The result of OLS regression shows that decommissioning costs (back end costs) are positively (negatively) associated with stock price levels. (3) Though both discretionary decommissioning costs and discretionary back end costs are value relevant, two accruals have different information contents. Moreover, the value relevance of income-increasing (negative signed) discretionary accruals is different form that of income-decreasing (positive signed) discretionary accruals. (4) We cannot observe the signaling effect of discretionary accruals reported in some prior studies. (5) As to the back end costs, although in limited case, we find the conservative behavior of estimating the future payments. In Appendix, we detect the income smoothing strategy of electric companies by discretionary estimation of decommissioning costs and back end costs. ...|$|R
