5|$|Maniac Mansions {{story and}} {{structure}} were designed before coding commenced. The project's earliest incarnation {{was a simple}} paper-and-pencil board game, in which the mansion's floor plan {{was used as a}} game board, and cards represented events and characters. Lines connected the rooms to illustrate pathways by which characters could travel. Strips <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> were used to map out the game's puzzles by tracking which items worked together when used by certain characters. Impressed by the map's complexity, Winnick included it in the final game as a poster hung on a wall. Because each character contributes different skills and resources, the pair spent months working on the event combinations that could occur. This extended the game's production time beyond that of previous Lucasfilm Games projects, which almost led to Gilbert's firing. The game's dialogue, written by David Fox, was not created until after programming had begun.|$|E

500|$|The {{thin section}} {{technique}} was superseded by the now-common liquid-peel technique in 1928. In this technique, peels are obtained by cutting {{the surface of}} a coal ball with a diamond saw, grinding the cut surface on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a smooth finish, and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid. The acid dissolves the mineral matter from the coal ball, leaving a projecting layer of plant cells. After applying acetone, a piece <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> is placed on the coal ball. This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball into the cellulose acetate. Upon drying, the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball with a razor and the obtained peel can be stained with a low-acidity stain and observed under a microscope. Up to 50peels can be extracted from [...] of coal ball with this method.|$|E
500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Little Ferry facility spurred an interest in fire safety as an aspect of film preservation. Unlike previous large nitrate film fires, the spontaneous combustion of decomposing film stock {{was determined to be}} responsible. Investigators suggested that the older nitrocellulose film stored in the archive was of lower quality than then-current film and thus more prone to instability. The Society of Motion Picture Engineers's Committee on Preservation of Film, three months after the vault fire, cited [...] "recent and rather extensive film fires" [...] as evidence that existing preservation efforts had failed to adequately address the [...] "fire problem". More heavily reinforced film vaults were suggested, to prevent fires in a single vault from destroying entire archival facilities. Film storage cabinets with ventilation and cooling systems were also proposed, as was further research into improving the quality <b>of</b> <b>cellulose</b> <b>acetate</b> film to encourage its use as a safer replacement for nitrate film.|$|E
