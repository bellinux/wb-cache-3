5|$|After the {{planning}} approval was granted, local residents hired barristers to consider an appeal against the decision. The activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> permission allowed solicitors {{on behalf of}} a group called Residents United Residents Association (RURA) to launch its Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol, which challenged the council's decision making process. One of the original areas for appeal revolved around historic covenants on parts of the land, but the Charities Commission ruled that the fields are not charitable land.|$|E

5|$|As the Allied armies {{advanced}} into Germany in April 1945, Alsos Mission teams searched Stadtilm, {{where they}} found documentation concerning the German nuclear program, components of a nuclear reactor, and eight tons of uranium oxide. Scientists captured at Göttingen and Katlenburg-Lindau included Werner Osenberg, the chief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> board of the Reichsforschungsrat, and Fritz Houtermans, who provided information about the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Celle, the Alsos Mission uncovered an experimental centrifuge for separating uranium isotopes, the result of work undertaken at the University of Hamburg by a team under Paul Harteck.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning,</b> things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division {{had not been}} used yet at Gettysburg, A.P.

Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, troops that had done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.|$|E
5|$|Planning {{permission}} {{was granted}} by Camden council in July 2006 after {{changes were made}} to the planning application following a public consultation.

5|$|Rivington {{village is}} a {{conservation}} area, designated under section 69 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990; {{almost half the}} houses in the village centre have listed status.

Locally sourced stone for walls and slate for roofs are the predominant building materials, used for places of worship, the school, houses (including many not listed), and boundary dry stone walls. An exception is Fisher House, a three-storey Georgian rendered building.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{a victory for the}} Japanese and it proved {{instrumental}} in helping them to regain the initiative in the northern sector of Bougainville. As a result, shortly afterwards the Australian forces on Bougainville changed the focus of their operations to the southern sector of the island where they were able to advance along the coastal plain towards the main Japanese position at Buin. Since the end of the war, there has been considerable criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> undertaken by the Australians prior to the operation, and {{it has been argued that}} the operation failed due to poor intelligence and lack of resources and was ultimately unnecessary.|$|E

5|$|The main {{problems}} were {{the pressure of}} time and the desire of the U.S. president for secrecy. The Cambodian monsoon, whose heavy rains would hamper operations, was only two months away. By the order of the president, the State Department did not notify the Cambodian desk at the US Embassy, Saigon, the Phnom Penh embassy, or Lon Nol <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning.</b> Operational security was as tight as General Abrams could make it. There was to be no prior U.S. logistical build-up in the border regions which might serve as a signal to the communists. U.S. brigade commanders were informed only a week in advance of the offensive, while battalion commanders got only two or three days' notice.|$|E
5|$|Commercial diving {{operations}} may {{expose the}} diver to more and sometimes greater hazards than recreational diving, but the associated occupational {{health and safety}} legislation is less tolerant of risk than recreational, particularly technical divers, may be prepared to accept. Commercial diving operations are also constrained by the physical realities of the operating environment, and expensive engineering solutions are often necessary to control risk. A formal hazard identification and risk assessment is a standard and required part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> for a commercial diving operation, and this is also the case for offshore diving operations. The occupation is inherently hazardous, and great effort and expense are routinely incurred to keep the risk within an acceptable range. The standard methods of reducing risk are followed where possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, McNicoll was {{appointed}} chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> {{committee for the}} British nuclear tests on the Montebello Islands, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. Later that year, he was made commanding officer of the heavy cruiser , a post he held for the next two years. As commander of Australia, McNicoll also served as Chief Staff Officer to the Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. HMAS Australia was near the end of its naval service and had been relegated to training duties from 1950. As such, the cruiser was primarily consigned to Australian waters, though a brief trip to New Zealand did occur in October 1953. McNicoll {{was appointed}} a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year Honours List for his involvement in the British atomic program; he was presented with the decoration three months later by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at Government House, Melbourne.|$|E

5|$|In the 1990s, Shamrock Rovers {{were granted}} {{land in the}} Dublin suburb of Tallaght {{to build a new}} stadium. On 30 March 2000, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern turned the sod at the site. However, work on the stadium ceased in 2001 and in March 2005, South Dublin County Council {{announced}} that they were taking back the land that they had granted to the club, as the conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> permission had not been met. A public consultation process was initiated in July 2005 and a resolution was passed in December 2005 to alter the stadium to accommodate senior GAA games while still having Shamrock Rovers as the preferred tenants. This decision was subject to additional government funding. This funding was not made available and on 13 January 2006 the council voted to proceed with the original plan.|$|E
5|$|Michael and Lori Fortier were {{considered}} accomplices for their foreknowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> of the bombing.

Fortier agreed {{to testify against}} McVeigh and Nichols {{in exchange for a}} reduced sentence and immunity for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998 to twelveyears in prison and fined $75,000 for failing to warn authorities about the attack.

5|$|Modi led the BJP in the 2014 general election, {{which gave}} the party a {{majority}} in the Lok Sabha, the first time a single party had achieved this since 1984. Modi himself was elected to parliament from Varanasi. Since taking office, Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, increased spending on infrastructure, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy, and centralised power through the abolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> commission. He has begun a high-profile sanitation campaign, and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. Credited with engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.|$|E
