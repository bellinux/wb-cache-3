5|$|The 16th-century {{gatehouse}} is on {{the inland}} side of the Nether Bailey, and comprises twin D-plan towers flanking an arched entrance passage. Formerly the passage was defended by a portcullis and a double set <b>of</b> <b>doors,</b> with guard rooms either side. Over the entrance {{are a series of}} rooms which may have served as accommodation for the castle's keeper. Collapsed masonry surrounds the gatehouse, dating from its destruction after 1690.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must explore a galaxy that is {{composed}} of 15 nonlinear worlds. Each world {{is composed of}} a series of stages with areas interconnected by different types <b>of</b> <b>doors.</b> Most doors open automatically, but some require a special action to be unlocked. For example, some doors require the player to defeat all the enemies in the area, while others may require a specific key. Although the player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies, health-recovery gems and ammunition crates can be collected throughout the world to increase the player's resources. Power-ups can also be found to expand the player's health and ammunition capacity.|$|E

5|$|The Edwardian castles {{also made}} strong {{symbolic}} {{statements about the}} nature of the new occupation. For example, Caernarvon was decorated with carved eagles, equipped with polygonal towers and expensive banded masonry, all designed to imitate the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power. The actual site of the castle may also have been important as it was positioned close to the former Roman fort of Segontium. The elaborate gatehouse, with an excessive five sets <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> and six portcullises, also appears to have been designed to impress visitors and to invoke an image of an Arthurian castle, then believed to have been Byzantine in character.|$|E
5|$|When the Students' Building opened, {{it stood}} two stories tall with a basement, {{as well as}} wooden pillars on its facade {{supporting}} a pediment. A cupola topped the structure and stairs beneath the pediment led to a three sets of double doors—one large, the others smaller but otherwise identical. Above each set <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> was a single large window. In the 1973 renovation, two red brick wings {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the building to accommodate numerous dining rooms. Featuring large windows, the new wings were more modern in their style than the old central portion of the building.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images <b>of</b> <b>doors,</b> drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E
5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty into every motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E

5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. Wise and Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them {{that it was a good}} idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that Wise and Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which Wise and Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player must build rooms and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. Rooms include GP's Offices, Psychiatric rooms, Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location <b>of</b> <b>doors</b> and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few rooms are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some rooms, such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain rooms, such as the Research room (used to research new rooms and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are rooms that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Research room, while patients also require certain rooms such as toilet facilities.|$|E

5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they have the best wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets <b>of</b> <b>doors,</b> which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
