40|$|When {{firms can}} {{identify}} their past customers, they may use information about purchase histories {{in order to}} price discriminate. We present a model with a monopolist and a continuum of heterogeneous consumers, where consumers can <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> from being identified, possibly at a cost. We find that when consumers can costlessly <b>opt</b> <b>out,</b> they all individually choose privacy, which results in the highest profit for the monopolist. In fact, all consumers are better off when <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> is costly. When valuations are uniformly distributed, social surplus is non-monotonic {{in the cost of}} <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> and is highest when <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> is prohibitively costly. We introduce the notion of a privacy gatekeeper - a third party that is able to act as a privacy conduit and set the cost of <b>opting</b> <b>out.</b> We prove that the privacy gatekeeper only charges the firm in equilibrium, making privacy costless to consumers...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares {{two general}} methods of {{privatization}} social security: forced {{participation in the}} new privatized system vs. letting people choose between the new system or staying in social security (i. e., <b>opting</b> <b>out).</b> Simulations are performed using a large scale perfect-foresight OLG simulation model that incorporates both intra-generational and inter-generational heterogeneity. The decision of any agent to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> is endogenous and depends on the <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> decisions of all other agents vis-…-vis factor prices. Various tax bases are considered in financing the transition path, {{as well as the}} perceived tax-benefit linkage due to the informational problems inherent in many social security systems. We consider two cases: full and no perception Both methods of privatizing social security lead to large long- run gains for all lifetime income classes despite the intra-generational progressivity of social security, but differ in their short run effects due to adverse selection associated with <b>opting</b> <b>out.</b> Adverse selection is a key reason why many economists oppose <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> and why many plans to privatize social security systems mandate participation. This paper, however, shows this wisdom to be wide of the mark. <b>Opting</b> <b>out</b> is better at protecting the welfare of the initial elderly, even though forced participation protects their real value of social security benefits because <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> continues to collect payroll tax revenue from those who stay with social security. <b>Opting</b> <b>out</b> can mean quicker transition paths by reducing social security wealth faster than forced participation, because many will forfeit their accrued claims as the price of <b>opting</b> <b>out.</b> Yet <b>opting</b> <b>out,</b> along with a decrease in the payroll tax rate is better at shifting the burden to future workers who benefit from privatization. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cross-listing on a U. S. {{exchange}} {{does not}} bond foreign firms {{to follow the}} corporate governance rules of that exchange. Hand-collected data show that 80 % of cross-listed firms <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> {{of at least one}} exchange governance rule. Relative to firms that comply, firms that <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> have a smaller share of independent directors. Cross-listed firms <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> more when coming from countries with weak corporate governance rules, but if firms based in such countries are growing and have a need for external finance, {{they are more likely to}} comply. <b>Opting</b> <b>out</b> also substantially affects the value of cash holdings. ...|$|R

If evolution is taught properly, it should not be possible to <b>opt</b> <b>out</b> of it without <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of biology. Moreover, if Intelligent Design creationist criticisms of evolution and scientific naturalism were taken as the basis for <b>opting</b> <b>out,</b> then the effect would be even more radical and would require <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of science entirely...|$|R
5|$|After {{a disappointing}} season, the Rockets {{had to make}} some {{significant}} changes to their roster. Howard wasn't happy with his role and the team overall still lacked an identity. On June 1, 2016, the Rockets named Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. Howard <b>opted</b> <b>out</b> of {{the final year of}} his contract later in June, and signed with the Atlanta Hawks in July. With Howard gone, Harden was now the undisputed franchise player. Harden reaffirmed his commitment to the franchise when he signed a four-year, $118.1 million contract extension in July. The Rockets also signed Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon, two perimeter players who complemented Harden and fit D'Antoni's style of play.|$|E

Our results suggest evidence for a simultaneous and endogenous influence of national identity on political preferences for the <b>opting</b> <b>out</b> of the Basque Country from Spain.
