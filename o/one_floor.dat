Twelve thousand volumes were moved by hand in one weekend. In 1965, the library expanded into its own building in what is now the Harvey Academic Center. Lyndon Professor Emeritus and Vermont state senator Graham S. Newell selected Samuel Read Hall as the library’s namesake. In 1972, the current library building was opened, and in 1980, the building won a design award from the American Institute of Architects for being a “bridge” from one side of campus to the other. By 1994, however, the library and the college had both outgrown their space, and so {{the decision was made to}} expand the library building into what would become known as the Library Academic Center, or LAC. The renovated building, which opened in 1995, added <b>one</b> <b>floor</b> of library space and <b>one</b> <b>floor</b> of classrooms.|$|E
