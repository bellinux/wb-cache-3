However, during the production, Connery {{announced that it would}} be his last film as Bond, leaving Broccoli to tell Alan Whicker, [...] "it won't be the last Bond under any circumstances—with all due respect to Sean, who I think has been certainly the best man to play this part. We will, in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> try to continue the Bond series for the audience because it's too important".|$|E
500|$|In September 2017, Matt Cameron told Billboard {{that he and}} {{the other}} {{surviving}} members of Soundgarden had yet {{to make a decision about}} the future of the band following Cornell's death. He was quoted as saying, [...] "I don't think we're ready to say anything other than ... Kim and Ben and I are certainly aware of how much our fans are hurting, and we're certainly hurting right there along with them. But we're extremely private people, and we're all still processing our grief in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>way</b> and on our own time.

500|$|Despite Morello, Wilk and Commerford's {{involvement}} in Prophets of Rage, Commerford confirmed {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone that Rage Against the Machine has not split up, explaining, [...] "We just do things <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b> Throughout our career, we never did what anyone wanted us to do. We never made the records people wanted us to make. We never played by the rules people wanted us to play by. And here we are, 25 years later, still a band. Clearly that means something. And if we did ever play or make new music or anything, {{it would be a very}} big deal. And there's a lot of bands that I've seen come along during that 25-year period that did everything the record companies and the powers-that-be wanted them to do, and they sold millions of records. But where are they now? They're gone." [...] Morello added, [...] "Right now...the cold embers of Rage Against the Machine are now the burning fire of Prophets of Rage. Where Rage Against the Machine lives, is this summer in these songs that we are playing. And we have nothing but the greatest love and honor and respect for Zack de la Rocha, the brilliant lyricist of Rage Against the Machine, who is working on his own music, which I'm sure will be fantastic—he's a great artist in his own right. But where you're going to hear Rage Against the Machine is in Prophets of Rage." ...|$|E

We would have gone <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>ways</b> and done <b>our</b> <b>own</b> things: the only reference point for any of this bunch of people who liked each other's works, and each other, more or less, was Maciunas. So fluxus, as far as I'm concerned, is Maciunas." [...] George Brecht ...|$|R

2500|$|Two months later, Thursday {{announced}} they would reunite for Atlanta, Georgia's Wrecking Ball music festival in August 2016. In {{a statement about}} the reunion show, Rickly said: [...] "Five years ago, we {{found it necessary to}} end Thursday for reasons beyond our control. Earlier this year, we were able to reconcile all of our differences and spend time together. This is a vital component to what we loved about being in Thursday and we're happy to say that we'll be playing this show as the same line-up that began touring together on Full Collapse and jointly worked on every record since." [...] Thursday agreed to perform at Wrecking Ball only two days before publicly announcing their participation, and the decision was made after its organizers allowed the band to perform [...] "in <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> including involving a charity" [...] and after hearing about the strong lineup of bands on the festival. The band had no intention to reunite before this decision. Two months later, it was announced that the band would be playing both Denver and Chicago dates of Riot Fest in September, causing speculation that the band may play more shows later on in the year.|$|E
