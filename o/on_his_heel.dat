2500|$|I {{appeal to}} any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's cabin hungry, {{and he gave}} him not meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. During {{the course of the}} last long and bloody war, Logan {{remained}} idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my countrymen pointed as they passed, and said, Logan is the friend of the white men. I have even thought to live with you but for the injuries of one man. Col. Cresap, the last spring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women and children. [...] There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This has called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed many: I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace. [...] But do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>heel</b> to save his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.|$|E
