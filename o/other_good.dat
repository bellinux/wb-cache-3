5|$|A production–possibility {{frontier}} (PPF) or {{production possibility}} curve (PPC) is a graphical representation of possible combinations of two goods (such as butter and guns) {{that can be}} produced with constant technology and resources per unit of time, such that more of one good could be produced only by diverting resources from the <b>other</b> <b>good,</b> resulting in less production of it; i. e. production tradeoffs, usually for an economy, but which can also be interpreted as applying for an individual, household, etc.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of these problems, in 1954 serious {{consideration}} was given to scrapping the class and replacing them with Britannia class locomotives. However, the locomotives had excellent boilers and several <b>other</b> <b>good</b> features and so the decision was taken to rebuild them, removing several of Bulleid's less successful ideas.|$|E
5|$|This {{measure of}} {{elasticity}} is {{sometimes referred to}} as the own-price elasticity of demand for a good, i.e., the elasticity of demand with respect to the good's own price, in order to distinguish it from the elasticity of demand for that good with respect to the change in the price of some <b>other</b> <b>good,</b> i.e., a complementary or substitute good. The latter type of elasticity measure is called a cross-price elasticity of demand.|$|E
50|$|It is {{possible}} that both {{the account of the}} Periplus and at least part of Miller's theory are correct, for the Periplus focuses on the availability of tortoise shell, and its silence about <b>other</b> <b>goods</b> should not be taken as evidence that <b>other</b> <b>goods</b> were not traded.|$|R

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the <b>other</b> <b>good.</b> In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|Any {{point that}} lies {{either on the}} {{production}} possibilities curve or {{to the left of}} it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources. Points that lie {{to the right of the}} production possibilities curve are said to be unattainable because they cannot be produced using currently available resources. Points that lie strictly to the left of the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any <b>other</b> <b>good.</b> An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing his head against the wall of his stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. <b>Other</b> <b>good</b> winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E

5|$|The {{story for}} The Battle for Middle-earth II {{is divided into}} Good and Evil Campaigns. The Good Campaign focuses on Glorfindel, an Elf who is alerted to a planned attack on the Elven {{sanctuary}} of Rivendell. With help from the Dwarves and <b>other</b> <b>Good</b> forces, the Elves attempt to eliminate Sauron and his army to restore peace in Middle-earth. In the Evil Campaign, Sauron sends the Mouth of Sauron and the Nazgûl to muster wild Goblins. With his army, Sauron moves forward with his plan to destroy the remaining Good forces in the North.|$|E
5|$|The MCC were {{reluctant}} to tour so soon after the war, but the Australian authorities were insistent. The tourists, led once more by Wally Hammond, were beaten 3–0 in the Test series, finding their opponents much stronger than expected. Hutton began the tour well, scoring two early centuries, the latter of which was described by Wisden as the best English innings of the tour. A string of <b>other</b> <b>good</b> performances drew praise from press and former players; one such report named him the best batsman in the world. However, Hutton failed to reach a score of 50 runs {{in the first three}} Tests; in the first, he was out for a first ball duck, and in the second, a short ball from Keith Miller struck him on his injured arm. In the second innings of the latter game, he quickly scored 37, frequently driving the bowling of Miller and Fred Freer before the bat slipped from his hand and hit the wicket, ending the innings. Even so, the display was praised by critics.|$|E

25|$|Scarcity is {{represented}} in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume beyond the PPF (such as at X) and by the negative slope of the curve. If production of one good increases along the curve, production of the <b>other</b> <b>good</b> decreases, an inverse relationship. This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the <b>other</b> <b>good,</b> decreasing the latter.|$|E
25|$|Any <b>other</b> <b>good</b> {{that you}} can think of would be better if {{pleasure}} were added to it, and it is only by good that good can be increased.|$|E
25|$|The {{slope of}} the curve at a point on it gives the {{trade-off}} between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the <b>other</b> <b>good,</b> {{an example of a}} real opportunity cost. Thus, if one more Gun costs 100 units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is 100 Butter. Along the PPF, scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the <b>other</b> <b>good.</b> Still, in a market economy, movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents.|$|E

Adams is informal and accessible for the most part to high schoolers. Lickorish is a rigorous introduction for graduate students, covering a nice mix of classical and modern topics.|$|E

25|$|One {{can also}} use {{consumer}} theory to analyze a consumer's choice between leisure and labor.
