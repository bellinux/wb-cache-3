2500|$|Presently {{the moon}} rose, dead ahead of me; and painted boldly across its face was {{the figure of}} an Indian.

2500|$|According to {{an article}} from The New York Times, [...] "over the years, Frazier has lost a fortune through a {{combination}} of his own generosity and naïveté, his carousing, and failed business opportunities.
