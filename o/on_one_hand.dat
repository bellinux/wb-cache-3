5|$|Although a Junimist for a {{large part}} of his life, Ion Luca Caragiale himself saw a {{precursor}} in Heliade, and even expressed some sympathy for his political ideals. During the 1890s, he republished a piece by Heliade in the Conservative Party's main journal, Epoca. One of Caragiale's most significant characters, the Transylvanian schoolteacher Marius Chicoş Rostogan, shares many traits with his counterparts in Heliade's stories. Developing his own theory, he claimed that there was a clear difference between, <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> the generation of Heliade Rădulescu, Ion Câmpineanu, and Nicolae Bălcescu, and, on the other, the National Liberal establishment formed around Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu—he identified the latter grouping with hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption, while arguing that the former could have found itself best represented by the Conservatives.|$|E
5|$|By {{that year}} the bikini made up nearly 20% of {{swimsuit}} sales, {{more than any}} other model in the US. As skin cancer awareness grew and a simpler aesthetic defined fashion in the 1990s, sales of the skimpy bikini decreased dramatically. The new swimwear code was epitomized by surf star Malia Jones, who appeared on the June 1997 cover of Shape Magazine wearing a halter top two-piece for rough water. After the 90s, however, the bikini came back again. US market research company NPD Group reported that sales of two-piece swimsuits nationwide jumped 80% in two years. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> the one-piece made a big comeback in the 1980s and early 1990s, on the other bikinis became briefer with the string bikini in the 1970s and 80s.|$|E

This is because, <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below.

5|$|In practice, the {{flexibility}} which the OBO design allows has gone largely unused, as these ships tend {{to specialize in}} either the liquid or dry bulk trade.

5|$|Techniques such as {{artificial}} insemination and embryo transfer are frequently used today, {{not only as}} methods to guarantee that females breed regularly but also to help improve herd genetics. This may be done by transplanting embryos from high-quality females into lower-quality surrogate mothers – freeing up the higher-quality mother to be reimpregnated. This practice vastly increases the number of offspring which may be produced by a small selection of the best quality parent animals. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> this improves {{the ability of the}} animals to convert feed to meat, milk, or fiber more efficiently, and improve the quality of the final product.

5|$|The {{argument}} concerned {{who should}} invest a new bishop {{with his staff}} and ring: traditionally, this had been {{carried out by the}} king in a symbolic demonstration of royal power, but Pope Urban II had condemned this practice in 1099, arguing that only the papacy could carry out this task, and declaring that the clergy should not give homage to their local temporal rulers. Anselm returned to England from exile in 1100 having heard Urban's pronouncement, and informed Henry that he would be complying with the Pope's wishes. Henry was in a difficult position. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> the symbolism and homage was important to him; on the other hand, he needed Anselm's support in his struggle with his brother Duke Robert.|$|E

5|$|The {{extent of}} Guðrøðr's {{authority}} in the Hebrides is unknown due to his apparent coexistence with Gilli, and to the uncertainty of Orcadian encroachment.

Although it is conceivable that either Gilli or Sigurðr capitalised on Guðrøðr's death, and extended their overlordship as far south as Mann, possible after-effects such as these are uncorroborated. Although it is possible that Gilli controlled the Hebrides whilst Guðrøðr ruled Mann, the title accorded to the latter on his death could indicate otherwise. If so, the chronology of Gilli's subordination to Sigurðr may actually date to the period after Rǫgnvaldr's death in 1004/1005.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> the agencies {{have been accused of}} giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies have a tendency to act conservatively, and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E

At the dance studio where she claimed to have trained, he finds a man with prosthetic feet. The bar where she claimed to work has been abandoned for a year following the murder and dismemberment of the owner. A passerby tells Aoyama that the police found three extra fingers, an extra ear, and an extra tongue when they recovered the body; Aoyama has hallucinations of the body pieces. Meanwhile, Asami goes to Aoyama's house and finds a photo of his late wife. Enraged, she drugs his liquor. Aoyama comes home, pours a drink, and begins feeling {{the effects of the}} drug. A flashback shows that the sack in Asami's apartment contains a man missing both feet, his tongue, one ear and three fingers <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand.</b> He crawls out and begs for food. Asami vomits into a dog dish and places it on the floor for the man. The man sticks his face into the vomit and hungrily consumes it.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary, so the experiment should have given a positive result. However, the result of this experiment was negative. Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time, the experimental situation was contradictory: <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> the aberration of light, the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether-dragging. On the other hand, the Michelson–Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth, apparently supporting the idea of complete aether-dragging (see aether drag hypothesis). So the very success of Fresnel's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis, which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand</b> he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an advanced guard of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E

5|$|Gamma delta T cells (γδ T cells) {{possess an}} {{alternative}} T-cell receptor (TCR) {{as opposed to}} CD4+ and CD8+ (αβ) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood. Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, the various subsets {{are also part of}} the innate immune system, as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors. For example, large numbers of human Vγ9/Vδ2 T cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes, and highly restricted Vδ1+ T cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Martin {{was still}} {{optimistic that the}} fourth {{installment}} might be released {{in the last quarter}} of 2002. However, the five-year gap did not work for all characters during writing. <b>On</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> Martin was unsatisfied with covering the events during the gap solely through flashbacks and internal retrospection. On the other hand, it was implausible to have nothing happen for five years. After working on the book for about a year, Martin realized he needed an additional interim book, which he called A Feast for Crows. The book would pick up the story immediately after the third book, and Martin scrapped the idea of a five-year gap. The material of the written 250-page prologue was mixed in as new viewpoint characters from Dorne and the Iron Islands. These expanded storylines and the resulting story interactions complicated the plot for Martin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, I. C.

Filitti subsequently {{turned his attention to}} some of the earliest sources on Wallachian history, adding his opinion to the debate surrounding the historicity of Negru Vodă (described by some early modern sources as Wallachia's state-builder). His topical study, published by in the 1924 Romanian Academy annals, concluded that Negru Vodă was in fact the stuff of legend, concocted by the 17th-century Wallachian Lord Matei Basarab. The next year, he returned to social history, with the book Clasele sociale în trecutul românesc ("Social Classes in the Romanian Past"). It mainly explained the difference between the concepts of nobility in Western Europe, <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>hand,</b> and the Danubian Principalities, on the other: Moldo-Wallachian nobility had no concept of knighthood, as all boyars were defined by their demesnes.|$|E
