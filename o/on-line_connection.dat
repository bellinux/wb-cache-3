50|$|Ellen {{returns home}} after a long day's work. At the front door she is {{recognized}} by an intelligent surveillance camera, the door alarm is switched off, and the door unlocks and opens. When she enters the hall the house map indicates that her husband Peter is at an art fair in Paris, and that her daughter Charlotte is in the children's playroom, where she is playing with an interactive screen. The remote children surveillance service is notified that she is at home, and subsequently the <b>on-line</b> <b>connection</b> is switched off. When she enters the kitchen the family memo frame lights up to indicate that there are new messages. The shopping list that has been composed needs confirmation before it {{is sent to the}} supermarket for delivery. There is also a message notifying that the home information system has found new information on the semantic Web about economic holiday cottages with sea sight in Spain. She briefly connects to the playroom to say hello to Charlotte, and her video picture automatically appears on the flat screen that is currently used by Charlotte. Next, she connects to Peter at the art fair in Paris. He shows her through his contact lens camera some of the sculptures he intends to buy, and she confirms his choice. In the mean time she selects one of the displayed menus that indicate what can be prepared with the food that is currently available from the pantry and the refrigerator. Next, she switches to the video on demand channel to watch the latest news program. Through the 'follow me' she switches over to the flat screen in the bedroom where she is going to have her personalized workout session. Later that evening, after Peter has returned home, they are chatting with a friend in the living room with their personalized ambient lighting switched on. They watch the virtual presenter that informs them about the programs and the information that have been recorded by the home storage server earlier that day.|$|E

40|$|This article aims at describing, {{according}} to the recent advances in social psychology and Computer Mediated Communication, how identities are perceived and constructed in the cyberspace. All interactions analysed {{in this study were}} performed within “Euroland”, a collaborative virtual environment. The interacting community was composed by students, teachers and researchers working at a trans-national educational project. Practices and dialogues within Euroland are analyzed using an ethnographic and conversational method. A sample of discourses and actions occurred during 8 months of time, selected {{according to}} the research aims, was analyzed. During <b>on-line</b> <b>connections,</b> users were personified by an “Avatar. ” Avatars are able to walk, fly, and look around the virtual world. They are also able to build and manipulate three-dimensional objects, perform virtual actions, and chat with other connected users. Results showed that “Eurolanders” showed and constructed their identities using strategic “positioning” depending on the interactive situation. Identities are thus dynamic and strongly related to the context, created and constantly re-created by the users. It is concluded that specific features offered by the Euroland environment are exploited by the users as resources to play with, while moving from a strategic positioning to another. Cyber identities involve resources given by specific technological tools and by community. The cyber-identity construction process seems to be then highly congruent to the advances in the dialogical perspective in psychology where identities are considered in their conceptualizations as multiple, “multi-voiced”, “positioned”, and context-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Bioanalytical {{chemistry}} is a challenging field, often involving complex samples, such as blood, plasma, serum or urine. In many applications, sample cleanup {{is the most}} demanding and time-consuming step. In the work underlying this thesis a novel dynamic miniature extractor, known as a hollow-fibre liquid-phase microextractor (HF-LPME), was designed, evaluated and studied closely when used to clean plasma samples. Aqueous-organic-aqueous liquid extraction, in which the organic liquid is immobilised in a porous polypropylene membrane, was the principle upon which the extractor was based, and this is discussed in all the papers associated with this thesis. This type of extraction is known as supported-liquid membrane extraction (SLM). The aim of this work was {{the development of a}} dynamic system for SLM. It was essential that the system could handle small sample volumes and had the potential for hyphenations and <b>on-line</b> <b>connections</b> to, for instance, LC/electrospray-MS. The design of a miniaturised HF-LPME device is presented in Paper I. The extraction method was developed for some weakly acidic pesticides and these were also used for evaluation. In the work described in Paper II, the method was optimised on the basis of an experimental design using spiked human plasma samples. Paper III presents a detailed study of the mass-transfer over the liquid membrane. The diffusion through the membrane pores was illustrated by a computer-simulation. Not surprisingly, the more lipophilic, the greater the retention of the compounds, as a result of dispersive forces. The main focus of the work described in Paper IV was to make the HF/LPME system more versatile and user-friendly; therefore, the extractor was automated by hyphenation to a SIA system. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 4 : Manuscript...|$|R

40|$|The {{current cost}} of calls and {{interconnection}} rates in South Africa {{are perceived to be}} high and unnecessary unaffordable {{for the majority of the}} users. An assertion fully supported by ICASA – the communication regulatory body had since mandated all the telephone network operators to review and revised their call and inter-connection rates. To this end, Telecommunication industry in South Africa recently introduced a new functionality Mobile Number Portability (MNP) which presents the subscribers with freedom of changing a network provider without them having to change their mobile number. MNP is seen as a great opportunity which can increase acquisition and to a greater extent encourage healthy competition among telephone operators but the process, functionality, subsequent administration and maintenance is a complex one, involving the careful planning and balancing of factors such as cost, convenience, simplicity, speed, reliability, heterogeneous integration and robustness. The reduced tariff transparency, increased competitiveness and lower cost of call and inter-connection rate that would normally result from the introduction of MNP is a problem that could seriously affect the usability, affordability, <b>on-line</b> <b>connection</b> of mobile services for users and have great impact on the profit margin.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA), is the largest cash assistance program in the United States. For fiscal year 2002, SSA expects to pay SSI benefits totaling $ 31. 5 billion to more than six million financially needy individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled. Since becoming operational in August 1996, the fugitive felon program has provided a valuable service by helping SSA to identify and prevent payments to ineligible SSI benefits recipients and helping law enforcement agencies to locate and and apprehend fugitive felons. Nevertheless, several technological and other barriers are contributing to inefficiencies in the program's operations. Certain information systems that SSA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) use in processing matched data are not interoperable or compatible, thus also hindering the efficient exchange of warrant information. Contributing to these inefficiencies {{is that no one}} office within SSA has been designated to oversee and manage the overall performance of the fugitive felon program. Consequently, no program officials could explain the overall data sharing and matching process. Largely because of the SSA's and states' limited uses of information technology to support the fugitive felon program, many state law enforcement agencies have been reluctant to enter into data-matching agreements with SSA. According to SSA and law enforcement officials, among the factors that made some states reluctant to enter into the agreements were that some states did not maintain central repositories of warrant information and SSA's guidance for formatting, downloading, and manually transmitting the information created additional resource requirements that some states were unable to meet. The enactment of legislation prohibiting OASI and DI payments to fugitive felons could increase SSA's recovery of improperly paid benefits and prevent more potentially dangerous fugitives from fleeing justice. However, the additional matches of warrant records against OASI and DI recipient files could substantially increase the data processing workloads of both SSA and the FBI's Information Technology Center. SSA may be able to improve the fugitive felon program's operational efficiency and outcomes by exploring its existing telecommunications connectivity supporting other federal, state, and local programs. SSA currently has direct, <b>on-line</b> <b>connections</b> with every state that transmits and receives data supporting various other programs, including its program to suspend SSI, OASI, and DI benefits to prisoners. ...|$|R

Karrikoiden voidaan sanoa, että perinteisiä kirjanpitäjiä luonnehditaan turhaa rutiinityötä tekeviksi ja sähköisen taloushallinnon taidot omaksuvia kirjanpitäjiä konsulteiksi. Tilintarkastajatkin jaetaan kahteen ryhmään: tavallisiin, joiden atk-taidot ovat riittämättömiä, ja atk-taitoisiin, jotka ovat parempaa väkeä. KTL Pirkko Jaatinen on tutkinut sähköistyvää taloushallintoa käsitteleviä artikkeleita kahdesta ammattilehdestä yli 35 vuoden ajalta. Tutkimusaineistona on Tilisanomista (116 kpl) ja Tilintarkastus-lehdistä (81 kpl) poimitut artikkelit aikaväliltä 1971 2008. Tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, miten sähköisen taloushallinnon uudet keksinnöt ovat vaikuttaneet kirjanpitäjien ja tilintarkastajien työhön, millä ilmaisuilla näiden ammattilaisten työstä puhutaan ja mitä merkityksiä käytettyihin ilmaisuihin sisältyy. Jaatinen jakaa tarkasteluajanjakson kahteen päävaiheeseen: tietokoneistumisen aikaan (1971 1988) ja sähköistymisen aikaan (1989 2008). Tietokoneistumisen ajalle oli tunnusomaista tietokoneiden tulo yritysten taloushallintoon, sähköistymisen aikaa kuvaavat linjayhteydet ja tiedonsiirron leviäminen eri toimijoiden välillä. Suomessa sähköisen taloushallinnon leviämiseen ovat vahvasti vaikuttaneet pankit ja julkinen valta. Kirjanpitolain muutoksen jälkeen 1997 kirjanpitovelvolliset ovat voineet valita kirjanpitoaineiston säilytysmuodon. Paperittomana voidaan säilyttää muu aineisto paitsi tilinpäätösasiakirjoihin kuuluva tasekirja. Samassa tahdissa ei taloushallinnon sähköisiä uudistuksia ole otettu käyttöön eri kokoluokan yrityksissä. Suuryrityksiin ja palvelukeskuksiin tietokoneet yleistyivät jo 1970 -luvulla. Suuryritykset ovat lähettäneet sähköisiä laskuja 1970 -luvun alusta lähtien. Pienyritykset alkoivat hankkia tietokoneita vasta 1980 -luvulla. Internet on mahdollistanut kaikille osapuolille tietoliikenneyhteydet. Ennen kuin uudet keksinnöt voivat levitä, mahdollisten omaksujien täytyy esimerkiksi lehtien välityksellä saada tietoa niistä ja niiden hyödyntämisestä. Lukijat voivat sitten omalla työpaikallaan toimia tiedon välittäjinä ja uusien keksintöjen puolestapuhujina. Tilisanomissa ja Tilintarkastus-lehdissä haettiin oikeutusta sähköistyvälle taloushallinnolle. Lehdissä perusteltiin tietokoneen hankintaa ja sähköisen taloushallinnon ratkaisuja kustannussäästöillä. Laskelmia ei kuitenkaan esitetty uuden ratkaisun aiheuttamista kustannuksista eikä ylipäänsä laskentainnovaatioiden kannattavuudesta. Artikkeleissa sähköistä taloushallintoa kuvattiin ongelmien ratkaisuautomaattina yritysten kannattavuus- ja kilpailukykyongelmiin sekä työvoimapulaan. Innovation Development in Electronic Accounting: Attributed Meanings and Discourses in Professional Journals Finland {{has been}} one of the {{pioneering}} countries in adopting different electronic ac-counting (eAccounting) innovations. Traditionally, financial accounting systems have operated in the closed environment of the firm. Developments in communica-tions technology have changed this situation. Finnish bookkeeping law was changed in 1997 to take account of these technological developments and every organisation which is obliged to keep accounts can now opt to keep their records entirely in elec-tronic form, except for the balance sheet book. The aim of this study was to form an overall picture of the process of electronifi-cation of accounting, and the changes which electronification have brought about in the work of accounting professionals. Using articles in Finnish journals for account-ing professionals from 1971 to 2008 as the data, meanings and discourses attributed to electronification of accounting have been analysed. The theoretical framework of the study is based on research into the diffusion of innovation and text analysis. Before any innovation can take place, potential adopt-ers must be aware that the innovation exists, and that there is an opportunity to util-ise it. The reader of a journal can play the role of a change agent in his or her own environment. The main communication channels are said to be the mass media. The methodological approaches are based on text analysis: historical analysis, content analysis and discourse analysis. The historical analysis covers over 35 years, and examines the phases and concepts of electronic accounting. The content and discourse analysis cover the same period, and examine what was written about the electronification of accounting. The empirical data consist of all the eAccounting articles in two Finnish professional accounting journals: Tilisanomat and Tilintar-kastus from 1971 up to 2008. The study reveals that the years studied can be divided into two main periods: 1971 - 1988 : computerizing, and 1989 - 2008 : eAccounting. The earlier stage was characterised by the advent of computers and therefore computerizing of accounting describes that period. The later stage saw the spread of <b>on-line</b> <b>connections</b> and data transmissions with business partners, banks and tax authorities; it can thus be briefly referred to as the eAccounting stage. There have been two major factors influencing the diffusion of eAccounting in Finland: banks and government. While developments leading to eAccounting happened in two stages in both big companies and small ones, these stages were passed through later in small compa-nies. In Finland the big companies and accounting centres already had computers in the 1970 s, and they have been sending electronic invoices since the beginning of the 1970 s. Small firms started to acquire computers in the 1980 s. In Finnish professional journals the main approach has been to legitimise elec-tronic innovations. The main assertion identified in the discourse analysis was: Ac-cept electronic accounting. Numerous articles have used economic arguments to promote electronic accounting as the solution to many of a firm´s problems. The argumentation in favour of eAccounting has relied heavily on cost savings. However, the figures quoted to prove the cost saving benefits are mostly very rough estimates. There has been no attempt to calculate the costs caused by the innovative solutions themselves, or the overall profitability of accounting innovations. Rhetorical means are based on persuasion. Discourse analysis shows that writers have constructed a two-tiered, black-and-white vision of accounting. On the lower tier is the traditional, pre-electronic kind, which the writers depict as old-fashioned and undeveloped. On the upper-tier is the new, improved, developed electronic kind of accounting of which the writers speak with approval. A similar contrast is drawn between traditional accountants, who, it is implied, do tedious, routine work, and modern, accounting consultants. The latter perform the same functions more effectively i. e. electronically, and have time to spare to act as management advisors. Auditors, too, come in two varieties: the ordinary kind, and those with ADP skills...|$|R
40|$|As the new {{millennium}} dawns, a battle is shaping up in cyber- space that may redefine {{the manner in which}} many people obtain copies of their favorite music. In one corner stands the record and music industry, seeking to protect their current distribution channels and to control the dissemination of their intellectual property over the Internet. In the other corner, a group consisting of Inter- net mavens, some musical artists, including acts ranging from in- dependent bands to well-established headliners, and the ever present cyberpirates, stand ready to exploit the Internet as a means to quickly and cheaply distribute and download songs. The development of compressed music files is the catalyst for this struggle over the use of the Internet to distribute songs. Our society increasingly accepts and values the Internet {{as an integral part of}} everyday life. For example, the nation’s use of the Internet has grown significantly in the past year alone. Forty-six percent of the estimated 74 million American Internet users began their use within the past twelve months. As a consequence, more people than ever are turning to the Internet to shop, gather news, socialize, and play. Currently, the two most popular uses for the Internet are email and <b>on-line</b> shopping. In <b>connection</b> with the increased general use of the Internet, musical artists and consumers have turned to the Net as a means to distribute songs. The Internet provides artists with another avenue to disseminate their works while also enabling consumers to sample various recordings with ease. The availability of data compression formats such as MP 3 enable web surfers to both upload and download music files with an efficiency that was previously un- heard of. The ability of consumers to gain ready access to music files via the Internet may ultimately transform the manner in which the entire music industry operates. Unfortunately, although many of the files available on-line are copies authorized by the artists, there are also a large number of pirated files that users post without the artists’ permission. This article addresses the current controversy over the distribution of unauthorized digital music files over the Internet. The recent introduction of the Rio, essentially a Walkman for MP 3 digital music files, and the record industry’s efforts to prevent the sale of the Rio raise the issue of whether today’s federal copyright framework is sufficient to protect copyright owners, in this case the music industry, from piracy on the Net. Part I of this article provides background information on the current use of the Internet to distribute music files and a brief analysis of how the distribution of unauthorized music files violates a copyright owner’s fundamental rights under the Copyright Act of 1976. Part II provides the technical background necessary to understand the technology at issue, namely the MP 3 format and the Rio MP 3 player, and introduces the litigation between a record industry group and Diamond Multimedia, the manufacturer of the Rio, over Diamond’s right to market and distribute the Rio. Part III presents an analysis of the current copyright law as it pertains to the distribution of digital music over the Net. This section of the article includes an analysis of the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992 which formed the basis for the record industry’s recent action against Diamond Multi- media, and a critique of the decision in that case. Part III additionally examines the recently enacted Digital Millennium Copyright Act to determine whether the Act contains adequate protections for copyright owners’ rights in cyberspace. Part IV contains proposals for measures that Congress, the record industry, and musical artists might consider in order to further the protection of musical copyrights on the information superhighway. This article concludes that while technological innovations such as the Rio and MP 3 technology may have rendered the amendments to the copy- right statute contained in the Audio Home Recording Act obsolete, the new Digital Millennium Copyright Act represents significant progress in furthering the protection of copyrights on the Internet and provides a framework of information regulation...|$|R

40|$|Today, the {{information}} about total mercury content in a sample {{is not enough to}} know because of different toxicity of various species like inorganic forms such as Hg+, Hg+II and organic bonded mercury in Methyl-mercury, Ethyl-mercury or Phenyl-mercury. Therefore a speciation analysis is needed to do. The aim of this diploma thesis was to develop and validate a new method for speciation determination of selected mercury compounds. This method comprises a connection of high performance liquid chromatography, electrochemical mercury cold vapor generation as a postcolumn derivatization technique and atomic absorption spectrometer. Using this <b>on-line</b> <b>connection</b> of mentioned techniques, an efficient separation of Hg+II and methylmercury was achieved. Reached limits of detection were 0. 3 µgml- 1 and 0. 5 µgml- 1 for Hg+II and methylmercury, respectively. At the end of experimental work, proposed hyphenated technique HPLC- EcMCVG-QFAAS was used for determination of these two mercury compounds in six real tap water samples (Bílý potok, Bílina, Labe, Vltava, Botič, pond Kovošrot). In Bílý potok, inorganic mercury (Hg+II) was identified on the base of identical of retention time compared to standard. Standard addition method was used in both FIA and HPLC arrangements and determined content of Hg+II was (0. 4 [...] ...|$|E

40|$|A flow trough type {{catalytic}} reactor system was adequately modified for NO related catalytic and adsorption measurements, including the <b>on-line</b> <b>connection</b> of a digital chemiluminescent NO-NO{sub x} analyzer to the reactor outlet system. Moreover, we have largely completed {{the installation of}} an FTIR coupled catalytic system containing a HTEC cell for high temperature DRIFT studies. Three different barium cuprate samples, Ba{sub 2 }CuO{sub 3 }, BaCuO{sub 2 }, and Ba{sub 2 }Cu{sub 3 }O{sub 5 } were synthesized and characterized by powder XRD for catalytic tests. Prior to catalytic studies over these cuprates, a new, liquid indium based supported molten metal catalyst (In-SMMC) was tested in the reduction of NO by various reductants. In the presence of excess O{sub 2 } and H{sub 2 }O, the In-SMMC {{proved to be more}} active for the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO to N{sub 2 } by ethanol than most other catalysts. Using C{sub 1 }-C{sub 3 } alcohols as reductants, self sustained periodic oscillations observed in the NO{sub x} concentrations of reactor effluents indicated the first time that radical intermediates can be involved in the SCR of NO by alcohols. Further, In-SMMC is the only effective and water tolerant SCR catalyst reported thus far which contains SiO{sub 2 } support. Thus, this novel catalyst opens up a promising new alternative for developing an effective and durable catalyst for NO{sub x} abatement in stack emission...|$|E
40|$|VMSbase is an R package {{devised to}} manage, process and {{visualize}} information about fishing vessels activity (provided by the vessel monitoring system - VMS) and catches/landings (as {{reported in the}} logbooks). VMSbase is primarily conceived to be user-friendly; to this end, a suite of state-of-the-art analyses is accessible via a graphical interface. In addition, the package uses a database platform allowing large datasets to be stored, managed and processed vey efficiently. Methodologies include data cleaning, that is removal of redundant or evidently erroneous records, and data enhancing, that is interpolation and merging with external data sources. In particular, VMSbase is able to estimate sea bottom depth for single VMS pings using an <b>on-line</b> <b>connection</b> to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) database. It also allows VMS pings to be assigned to whatever geographic partitioning has been selected by users. Standard analyses comprise: 1) me ́tier identification (using a modified CLARA clustering approach on Logbook data or Artificial Neural Networks on VMS data); 2) linkage between VMS and Logbook records, with the former organized into fishing trips; 3) discrimination between steaming and fishing points; 4) computation of spatial effort with respect to user-selected grids; 5) calculation of standard fishing effort indicators within Data Collection Framework; 6) a variety of mapping tools, including an interface for Google viewer; 7) estimation of trawled area. Here we report a sample workflow for the accessory sample datasets (available with the package) in order to explore the potentialities of VMSbase. In addition, the results of some performance tests on two large datasets (16105 and 16106 VMS signals, respectively) are reported to inform about the time required for the analyses. The results, although merely illustrative, indicate that VMSbase can represent a step forward in extracting and enhancing information from VMS/logbook data for fisheries studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{the winter}} of 1994 I moved to Yokohama, Japan, to direct a semester-long U. C. Education Abroad Program (EAP) {{curriculum}} on Peace and Development Studies at Meiji Gakuin University. Because all electronic communications in Japan were controlled by the government’s telecomm monopoly, NHK, Internet access was extremely expensive, and my Compuserve subscription was costing me a small fortune —over US$ 250 each month — in connection charges. Since I was in more-or-less regular e-mail contact {{with a number of}} other China scholars in various countries, I decided to economize on my <b>on-line</b> <b>connection</b> charges by periodically sending group e-mailings to several recipients at a time, on subjects relating to Chinese politics. My monthly telecomm bills quickly dropped by 70 percent. By the time I returned to Los Angeles in the late summer of 1994 there were twenty-one China watchers on my group recipient list; by March of 1995 the list had grown to thirty-one, including a handful of international journalists residing in China. At that point I decided to set up a dedicated on-line SIG (special interest group) exclusively for specialists working on contemporary Chinese politics. The idea was to create an interactive electronic forum where scholars, journalists, diplomats, and other China experts could exchange information, ideas and insights about current events and developments. I sent out a request to each of the thirty-one people on my group e-mail list, inviting them {{to take part in the}} new forum and asking them to provide the names and addresses of other China watchers who might be interested in participating. Needing an eight-letter alias for the group in order to conform to the standard DOS file-naming protocol, I called the group “Chinapol. ” Here is the letter I sent out: Date: Wed, 15 Mar 95 08 : 45 : 00 PST Subject: creating a Chinese politics forum Dear friends and colleagues: I would like to establish an on-line e-mail forum to facilitate rapid, informal communication among Internet-linked specialists in contemporary Chinese politics, economics, and related fields. Insofar as my personal list of e-mail addresses is rather limited, I would like to invite you to help me expand my mailing list. For the moment, I would like to limit the group (which I have called “Chinapol”) to academics, Government analysts, and journalists who specialize in contemporary Chinese affairs. It may also be possible later to add a few advanced graduate students, people in the private sector, and others on an individual basis... ...|$|E
40|$|Providing {{quality of}} service (QoS) {{guarantees}} over wireless packet networks poses a host of technical challenges that are not present in wireline networks. One of the key issues is how {{to account for the}} characteristics of the time-varying wireless channel and for the impact of link-layer error control in the provisioning of packet-level QoS. In this dissertation, we accommodate both aspects in analyzing the packet loss and delay performance over a wireless link. We also propose novel techniques for quantifying the wireless effective bandwidth, defined as the minimum amount of bandwidth that needs to be allocated to ensure a given level of QoS. These techniques are essential to <b>on-line</b> <b>connection</b> admission control (CAC) and capacity dimensioning in multiservice wireless networks with QoS support. To analyze the loss and delay performance, we consider a wireless link whose capacity fluctuates according to a fluid version of Gilbert-Elliot channel model. Incoming traffic sources are modeled with on-off fluid processes, which capture the bursty nature of network traffic. The packet loss performance is analyzed for the cases of a single and multiplexed traffic streams. For the single-stream case, we derive the packet loss rate (PLR) due to buffer overflow at the sender side of the wireless link. We also obtain a closed-form approximation for the corresponding wireless effective bandwidth. In the case of multiplexed streams, we obtain a good approximation for the PLR using the Chernoff-Dominant Eigenvalue (CDE) approach. The delay performance is analyzed via two distinct yet complementary approaches: fluid queueing analysis and discrete-time analysis, each being advantageous in analytic tractability and accuracy, respectively. The fluid approach is used to derive the packet delay distribution via two different approaches: uniformization and Laplace transform. Using the analytic results, we investigate the packet discard rate at the receiver, which is particularly important for delay-sensitive traffic. The delay distribution is further used to quantify the wireless effective bandwidth under a given delay guarantee. Numerical results and simulations are used to verify the adequacy of our analysis and to study the impact of error control on the allocation of bandwidth for guaranteed packet loss and delay performance. Finally, we use discrete-time analysis to quantify the mean delay experienced by a Markovian source over a wireless channel. In this case, the wireless link implements the selective-repeat automatic-repeat-request (SR ARQ) scheme for retransmission of erroneous packets. We obtain good approximations of the total mean delay, which consists of transport and resequencing delays. The transport delay, in turn, consists of queueing and transmission delays. The exact probability generating function (PGF) of the queue length under "ideal" SR ARQ is obtained and combined with the retransmission delay to obtain the mean transport delay. For the resequencing delay, the analysis is performed under the assumptions of heavy traffic and small window sizes (relative to the channel sojourn times). We show that ignoring the autocorrelations between packet interarrival times or the time-varying nature of the channel state can lead to significant underestimation of the delay performance, particularly at high channel error rates...|$|E
