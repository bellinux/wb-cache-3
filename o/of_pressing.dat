5|$|The {{aristocracy}} {{shared their}} power {{only with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops {{were members of the}} aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This {{is one of the reasons}} that so many of the Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.|$|E
5|$|The incessant warfare of the 1290s put a great {{financial}} {{demand on}} Edward's subjects. Whereas the King had only levied three lay subsidies until 1294, four such taxes were granted {{in the years}} 1294–97, raising over £200,000. Along with this came the burden of prises (appropriation of food), seizure of wool and hides, and the unpopular additional duty on wool, dubbed the maltolt. The fiscal demands on the King's subjects caused resentment, and this resentment eventually led to serious political opposition. The initial resistance was not caused by the lay taxes, however, but by clerical subsidies. In 1294, Edward made a demand of a grant of one half of all clerical revenues. There was some resistance, but the King responded by threatening with outlawry, and the grant was eventually made. At the time, the archbishopric of Canterbury was vacant, since Robert Winchelsey was in Italy to receive consecration. Winchelsey returned in January 1295 and had to consent to another grant in November of that year. In 1296, however, his position changed when he received the papal bull Clericis laicos. This bull prohibited the clergy from paying taxes to lay authorities without explicit consent from the Pope. When the clergy, {{with reference to the}} bull, refused to pay, Edward responded with outlawry. Winchelsey was presented with a dilemma between loyalty to the King and upholding the papal bull, and he responded by leaving it to every individual clergyman to pay as he saw fit. By the end of the year, a solution was offered by the new papal bull Etsi de statu, which allowed clerical taxation in cases <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> urgency.|$|E
25|$|In {{large-scale}} {{industrial oil}} extraction you will often see some combination <b>of</b> <b>pressing,</b> chemical extraction and/or centrifuging {{in order to}} extract {{the maximum amount of}} oil possible.|$|E
5|$|The second release <b>of</b> <b>pressings</b> <b>of</b> {{the album}} were {{released}} in late November 1998 {{which included a}} bonus disc featuring a live recording of Powderfinger's performance at the Sydney Opera House 25th birthday celebration in October 1998.|$|R

25|$|James was meticulous {{about the}} process of recording, {{mastering}} and pressing. He tried a number <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> plants until he was satisfied with the quality of each EP. James prefers vinyl or tape to digital. However, label co-owner Wilson-Claridge convinced him to release a CD compilation (Chosen Lords) with 10 tracks from the Analord series.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} these problems, as of 2010, non-contact or touchless 3D fingerprint scanners have been developed. Acquiring detailed 3D information, 3D fingerprint scanners take a digital approach to the analog process <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> or rolling the finger. By modelling the distance between neighboring points, the fingerprint can be imaged at a resolution high enough to record all the necessary detail.|$|E
25|$|Winemakers often {{keep their}} {{free-run}} juice and pressed wine separate (and perhaps even further isolate the wine produced by different pressure levels/stages <b>of</b> <b>pressing)</b> {{during much of}} the winemaking process to either bottle separately or later blend portions of each to make a more complete, balanced wine. In practice the volume of many wines are made from 85-90% of free-run juice and 10-15% pressed juice.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second and}} fourth singles from the album, [...] "La Luna" [...] (2000) and [...] "Here with Me" [...] (2001) were {{released}} in Brazil and Europe respectively in a limited number <b>of</b> <b>pressings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tim Biskup {{presented}} {{two different}} <b>pressings</b> <b>of</b> Rejection on Duck Butter Records, one <b>of</b> the <b>pressings</b> having hand screened art and clear red vinyl.|$|R
50|$|Copies of this album, due to {{the scant}} number <b>of</b> <b>pressings,</b> are {{virtually}} impossible to find. Digital copies of the recordings did not even surface in fan trading circles until the spring of 2007, when the songs were made available in mp3 format on an internet blog.|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} the wine press and <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> is nearly {{as old as the}} history of wine itself with the remains of wine presses {{providing}} some of the longest-serving evidence of organised viticulture and winemaking in the ancient world. The earliest wine press was probably the human foot or hand, crushing and squeezing grapes into a bag or container where the contents would ferment.|$|E
25|$|The {{advancement}} of steam power machinery in the 19th century {{brought about a}} revolution in wine press technology as manual basket press gave way to steam-powered presses that greatly increased the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> and reduced the amount labor needed to operate a press. Even the {{advancement of}} rail transport had a positive influence {{as the cost of}} transporting large wine presses from manufacturers to wine regions throughout the globe decreased and more wineries began being able to afford purchasing a wine press.|$|E
25|$|A comptometer is a {{mechanical}} or electro-mechanical adding machine. The comptometer {{was the first}} adding device to be driven solely by the action <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> keys, which are arranged {{in an array of}} vertical and horizontal columns. Although the comptometer was designed primarily for adding, it could also do division, multiplication, and subtraction. Special comptometers with varying key arrays were produced for a variety of purposes, including calculating currencies, time and Imperial measures of weight. The original design was invented and patented in 1887 by Dorr Felt.|$|E
5000|$|A seven-song 12" [...] {{record of}} demos and outtakes from the {{recording}} of the East Grand Blues EP was released {{as a part of}} the vault package no. 6 from Third Man Records. This album is not available for purchase in stores, and only a limited number <b>of</b> <b>pressings</b> were made.|$|R
5000|$|The entire Faction discography is {{extremely}} rare and {{very hard to}} find. Their albums do turn up in the [...] "usual" [...] places for sale. However, due to the very limited number <b>of</b> <b>pressings</b> the band were able to make, finding these albums is a lesson in patience and luck.|$|R
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to change the}} album's name {{at the last minute}} resulted in a few different versions of the album. There are also different versions of the album that are unrelated to the title. Regarding the different versions of the album, some <b>of</b> the first <b>pressings</b> <b>of</b> the cassette still contained Five Against One printed on the cassette itself, the first couple <b>of</b> <b>pressings</b> <b>of</b> the cassette do not contain the title printed on the artwork at all, and the lyrics to [...] "Indifference" [...] are included in the cassette version. The first couple <b>of</b> <b>pressings</b> <b>of</b> the CD do not contain the title printed on the artwork at all, and the initial versions of the CD came in an Ecopak, which was a variation on the traditional CD-sized Digipak. While not rare, they went out of print quickly and are now hard to find. The song titles are not printed on the back cover of this version, but the artwork remains the same. The vinyl version has never had the title printed on it, and the cover art on the vinyl copies is different from the CD and cassette. For all versions, the picture of the [...] "elderly woman" [...] changed at some point after the first pressings. Allegedly, the original woman never gave permission for her picture to be used, so Pearl Jam changed the picture to another woman. The difference is easy to spot, as [...] "the new and improved woman behind the counter" [...] is printed below the picture.|$|R
25|$|On January 27, 2012, a {{group of}} Russian Orthodox Christian activists entered the {{premises}} of the Moscow Krishna temple and tried to hand the temple authorities a box of canned beef. The group claimed that their action was {{in retaliation for the}} burning of the Russian flag in India by Hindu fundamentalists protesting the proposed ban of the Bhagavad Gita As It Is, which they called an “anti-Russian … disgraceful act” and “one of the steps in the unprecedented campaign <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> on Russian court".|$|E
25|$|The bulk of a galley's {{crew was}} formed by the rowers, the remiges (sing. remex) or eretai (sing. eretēs) in Greek. Despite popular perceptions, the Roman fleet, and ancient fleets in general, relied {{throughout}} their existence on rowers of free status, and not on galley slaves. Slaves were employed only in times <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> manpower demands or extreme emergency, and even then, they were freed first. In Imperial times, non-citizen freeborn provincials (peregrini), chiefly from nations with a maritime background such as Greeks, Phoenicians, Syrians and Egyptians, formed {{the bulk of the}} fleets' crews.|$|E
25|$|The die is a {{negative}} image of the glass master: typically, several are made, depending on the number <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> mills that are to make the CD. The die then goes into a press, and the physical image is transferred to the blank CD, leaving a final positive image on the disc. A small amount of lacquer is applied as a ring around {{the center of the}} disc, and rapid spinning spreads it evenly over the surface. Edge protection lacquer is applied before the disc is finished. The disc can then be printed and packed.|$|E

50|$|The {{album cover}} was {{originally}} covered in gold-colored foil on the outside, {{and the initial}} run <b>of</b> <b>pressings</b> were pressed in clear, dark yellow vinyl. The album has been reissued many times and is currently available in the Compact Disc format. A Quadraphonic mix of the album was available in the Quadraphonic 8-Track cartridge format.|$|R
25|$|With the IV Corps out of position, revolts {{breaking}} out, and the Army of the Center threatening Madrid, Joseph and his adviser Marshal Jean-Baptiste Jourdan {{were in a}} panic. Only Villatte and Latour-Maubourg with 9,000 soldiers {{stood between}} Infantado and the capital. But, instead <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> his advantage, the Spanish commander became inert between 26 December and 11 January. Infantado seems to have spent his time concocting fantastic strategical schemes while leaving his lieutenant Venegas without instructions. To support the Army of the Center, a 6,000-man Spanish division under General Marquis del Palacio moved north from the Sierra Morena to Villaharta.|$|E
25|$|While {{the exact}} origins of {{winemaking}} (and, thus, <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> grapes) are not known, most archaeologists {{believe that it}} originated somewhere in the Transcaucasia between the Black and Caspian Seas in the land that now includes the modern countries of Russia, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey and Iran. There are stories in the Imeretin Valley (in what is now Krasnodar Krai, Russia) dating to between 7000-5000 BC of early winemaking using hollowed out logs that they would fill with grapes, tread with their feet and then scoop the juice and crushed grape remains into jars to ferment. In the 17th century, French traveller Sir Jean Chardin would describe a similar practice still in use thousands of years later in Georgia.|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} {{and loss of}} a U.S. fighter to a MiG-19 (J-6) was in 1965 when a USAF Lockheed F-104 Starfighter piloted by Captain Philip E. Smith was {{attacked}} by a People's Liberation Army Air Force aircraft over Hainan Island. His Starfighter took cannon fire which damaged {{a portion of his}} wing and missile mount. Smith gave chase and did receive missile tone on the MiG but, within a millisecond <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> his missile firing button, his Starfighter lost all power. He ejected and was captured. Smith was held prisoner until released on 15 March 1973, due to improving US-China relations following U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972.|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} and variability of conditioned suppression <b>of</b> bar <b>pressing</b> and dipper licking were compared. In two steady-state experiments, suppression <b>of</b> bar <b>pressing</b> was more profound and more stable {{from day to}} day. The two measures of suppression were uncorrelated as indexed by Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients computed for adjacent trials. Correlations within measures (internal consistency) were somewhat higher for the bar-press system except when {{a high proportion of}} rats completely suppressed on one of the correlated trials. In a transient state experiment in which possible adventitious punishment of both response systems was eliminated, suppression <b>of</b> bar <b>pressing</b> was again more profound and considerably slower to extinguish...|$|R
50|$|The most {{successful}} release by Spartan Records has been their <b>pressing</b> <b>of</b> Mae's Destination: Beautiful. Their first pressing in 2012 involved {{a mix of}} 500 vinyl LPs including 200 white, 200 navy blue/white swirl, and 100 180 gsm black discs. After completely selling out the first pressing in 2012 they announced another <b>pressing</b> <b>of</b> 500 in 2013 on teal (100), white teal splatter (200) and Teal/white Swirl (200) these also sold out. Due to the popularity <b>of</b> this <b>pressing</b> they released another <b>pressing</b> <b>of</b> 500 copies on glow in the dark vinyl through Hot Topic and that pressing sold out quickly as well. In 2014 a fourth <b>pressing</b> <b>of</b> Destination: Beautiful was released {{as a part of}} Record Sale Day 2014 on Transparent Blue and gold vinyl. It was limited to 500 copies and has sold out as well.|$|R

25|$|Cato {{described}} the process <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> as {{taking place in}} a special room that included an elevated concrete platform containing a shallow basin with raised curbs. The basin was shaped with gentle slopes {{that led to a}} runoff point. Horizontally across the basin were long, wooden beams whose front parts were attached by rope to a windlass. The crushed grapes were placed between the beams, with pressure applied by winding down the windlass. The pressed juice ran down between the beams and collected in the basin. As the construction and use of a wine press was labor-intensive and expensive, its use was generally restricted to large estates, with smaller wineries relying on treading alone to obtain grape juice.|$|E
25|$|In {{red wine}} {{production}} {{the timing of}} when to press {{is one of the}} most important decisions in the wine making process since that will be the moment that maceration and phenolic extraction ceases. Some winemakers use the decreasing sugar level (such as brix measurement) scale and press once the wine has reached complete dryness. Often winemakers will use taste to determine if the wine has extracted enough tannins to produce a balanced wine and may press before complete dryness (such as at 3-8 brix). Though removing the skins by pressing often removes some solids that the wine yeast need to complete fermentation and the benefits <b>of</b> <b>pressing</b> early is often balanced by the risk of potential stuck fermentation.|$|E
25|$|Although {{saved from}} fire, the Declaration of Independence did suffer {{in years to}} come from the unanticipated ill effects of {{exposure}} and handling. Perhaps the most destructive action occurred in 1823 when the document was used to make a press copy as a master for making facsimile copies to distribute to members of Congress, governors, the Supreme Court and others including the three surviving signers—John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and John Carroll. As a result <b>of</b> <b>pressing,</b> {{a large portion of the}} ink was lifted from the document. Over the years, rolling and folding of the document creased and broke the parchment, and constant exposure to strong sunlight led to fading of the signatures to the extent that some could not be read.|$|E
50|$|Around 600 copies <b>of</b> {{the first}} <b>pressing</b> were sent out for promotional uses, but these omitted the Hib-Tone contact address. It was included, however, on the 6,000 copies <b>of</b> the second <b>pressing.</b>|$|R
