5|$|Any {{point that}} lies either <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> {{possibilities}} curve {{or to the}} left of it is said to be an attainable point: it can be produced with currently available resources.

Points that lie strictly {{to the left of}} the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>production</b> possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E
