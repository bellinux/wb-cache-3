5|$|Although England trailed behind other European {{powers in}} {{establishing}} overseas colonies, {{it had been}} engaged during the 16th century in the settlement <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> with Protestants from England and Scotland, drawing on precedents {{dating back to the}} Norman invasion <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> in 1169. Several people who helped establish the Plantations <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> also played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men.|$|E
5|$|By 1541, King Henry VIII of England {{had broken}} with the Church of Rome and {{declared}} himself Supreme Head of the Church of England. The pope's grant <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> to the English monarch became invalid, so Henry summoned {{a meeting of}} the Irish Parliament to change his title from Lord <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> to King <b>of</b> <b>Ireland.</b> However much of the island was beyond English control, resulting in the extended Tudor conquest <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> that only made the Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> a reality in 1603, {{at the conclusion of the}} Nine Years' War (Ireland). Nevertheless, Ireland retained its own parliament, becoming an independent state in 1642-1649 (Confederate Ireland), and again in 1688-91. Only warfare such as the Williamite War in Ireland and subsequent occupation enabled the English crown from 1692, and successive British states from 1707, to retain the country.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the century}} that followed, Norman feudal law {{gradually}} replaced the Gaelic Brehon Law {{so that by}} the late 13th century the Norman-Irish had established a feudal system throughout much <b>of</b> <b>Ireland.</b> Norman settlements were characterised by the establishment of baronies, manors, towns and the seeds of the modern county system. A version of the Magna Carta (the Great Charter <b>of</b> <b>Ireland),</b> substituting Dublin for London and Irish Church for Church of England, was published in 1216 and the Parliament <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> was founded in 1297.|$|E

5|$|Politically, Ireland {{is divided}} between the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Ireland</b> (officially named Ireland), which covers five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, {{which is part of}} the United Kingdom, in the {{northeast}} of the island.

Throughout the letter, the Drapier pretends that Carteret's transfer to Ireland to enforce Wood's patent was a rumour produced by Wood's allies, although Swift had knowledge to the contrary.|$|E
