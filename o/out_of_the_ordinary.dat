5|$|Although Casablanca was an A-list {{film with}} {{established}} stars and first-rate writers, no one involved with its production {{expected it to}} be anything <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> It was just one of hundreds of pictures produced by Hollywood every year. Casablanca was rushed into release {{to take advantage of the}} publicity from the Allied invasion of North Africa a few weeks earlier. It had its world premiere on November 26, 1942, in New York City and was released nationally in the United States on January 23, 1943. The film was a solid if unspectacular success in its initial run.|$|E
5|$|An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump is a 1768 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Joseph Wright of Derby, {{one of a}} number of candlelit scenes that Wright painted during the 1760s. The painting departed from convention of the time by depicting a scientific subject in the reverential manner formerly reserved for scenes of historical or religious significance. Wright was intimately involved in depicting the Industrial Revolution and the scientific advances of the Enlightenment, but while his paintings were recognised as something <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> by his contemporaries, his provincial status and choice of subjects meant the style was never widely imitated. The picture has been owned by the National Gallery, London, since 1863 and is still regarded as a masterpiece of British art. In June 2015 it was on loan to Tate Britain.|$|E
5|$|Although Hermes o Logios was {{the most}} {{important}} publication for the transmission of progressive ideas to the Greek people, which should ultimately lead to the emancipation and independence, there was hardly any information of signs of an ongoing revolution, at least on the surface. There was the Austrian censure to be reckoned with, as the reactionary minister Klemens von Metternich and his secret police kept a very close eye on the activities of the local Greek community. The lack of items on politics, polity, law and social structures does not indicate an immanent revolution. Several editors were also members of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia and staunch supporters of the struggle for independence, but one can hardly maintain that this fervent patriotism is reflected in the subjects treated inside the periodical. Even in the last years, {{on the eve of the}} Greek War of Independence, in the fields of philology, sciences, philanthropy, etc., nothing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> was published. On the other hand, there is no doubt that the contributors of Hermes o Logios dreamed of the liberation of the Greek nation and of an independent state.|$|E

5|$|Peter Emmerson, a {{historian}} and {{supporter of the}} desertion theory, asks why Wilson would have sent three of his men away at such a precarious moment. JP Lott, another historian, comments that Wilson had sent runners to Forbes twice the previous night, when he was already at very close quarters with the Matabele and with far fewer men; he surmises {{that it would not}} be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> for the major to do so again. In his evaluation John O'Reilly asks why Wilson sent Gooding back with the two Americans; surely Burnham and Ingram, both seasoned scouts, were enough? Gooding writes in his account that Wilson originally only asked Burnham to ride to Forbes, and that Captain Judd suggested to Wilson that Burnham should take two men with him. The Chief of Scouts requested Ingram, and Borrow asked Gooding to go too. Burnham also says that Borrow sent Gooding.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> Four Horsemen, {{the black}} horse and its rider {{are the only}} ones whose {{appearance}} is accompanied by a vocal pronunciation. John hears a voice, unidentified but coming from among the four living creatures, that speaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prices <b>of</b> wheat and barley, also saying [...] "and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine". This suggests that the black horse's famine is to drive up <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> grain but leave oil and wine supplies unaffected (though <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary</b> worker). One explanation for this is that grain crops would have been more naturally susceptible to famine years or locust plagues than olive trees and grapevines, which root more deeply. The statement might also suggest a continuing abundance <b>of</b> luxuries for <b>the</b> wealthy while staples, such as bread, are scarce, though not totally depleted; such selective scarcity may result from injustice and <b>the</b> deliberate production <b>of</b> luxury crops for the wealthy over grain, as would have happened during the time Revelation was written. Alternatively, <b>the</b> preservation <b>of</b> oil and wine could symbolize <b>the</b> preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Christian faithful, who used oil and wine in their sacraments.|$|R

25|$|The dynasty is {{regarded}} as the greatest native Yemeni state since the fall of pre-Islamic Himyarite Kingdom. They were of Turkic descent.

25|$|Hip-hop being tolerated by the {{government}} of Cuba is something <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary,</b> because performers are provided with venues and equipment by {{the government}}. The Cuban rap and hip-hop scene sought out the involvement of the Ministry of Culture in the production and promotion of their music, which would otherwise have been impossible to accomplish.

25|$|Some synesthetes often {{report that}} they were unaware their {{experiences}} were unusual until they realized other people did not have them, while others report feeling {{as if they had}} been keeping a secret their entire lives. The automatic and ineffable nature of a synesthetic experience means that the pairing may not seem <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> This involuntary and consistent nature helps define synesthesia as a real experience. Most synesthetes report that their experiences are pleasant or neutral, although, in rare cases, synesthetes report that their experiences can lead to a degree of sensory overload.|$|E

40|$|Review <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Common Place <b>of</b> Law: Stories From Everyday Life by Patricia Ewick 2 ̆ 6 Susan S. Silbey (1998). Sometimes a work 2 ̆ 7 s {{intellectual}} influences reveal {{both its}} strengths and its shortcomings. This {{is certainly the}} case with Patricia Ewick and Susan Silbey 2 ̆ 7 s <b>The</b> Common Place <b>of</b> Law: Stories From Everyday Life, and its indebtedness to <b>the</b> thinking <b>of</b> Michel Foucault and Michel de Certeau. Taken together, Foucault and de Certeau 2 ̆ 7 s work suggests that investigations of law 2 ̆ 7 s power are most fruitful not at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> legal institutions and the state but at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> lived experience, where we can see how power is exercised, understood, and sometimes, resisted. This is, in essence, the narrative at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Common Place <b>of</b> Law, where two sociologists of law examine how law or legality (power {{that is at once}} institutional and embedded in day-to-day social practices) is recognized, resisted, and reconstituted by a wide variety of ordinary people going about their lives. It is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most <b>ordinary</b> acts that law is constituted as law...|$|R

This delayed {{the opening of}} the line from the anticipated start date of April 3, although there was some indication that the opening would have been delayed anyway.

Certain aspects of the design had been tried before, but the cars were the first to combine the factors of conforming to American standards (as opposed to European), having low floors and being built at the company's Mexico plant. Some problems also cropped up during testing of the vehicles, but Bombardier said that the issues were not <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b>|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, Sutherland had already established a reputation as a diva with a voice <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ordinary.</b> She sang Lucia to great acclaim in Paris in 1960 and, in 1961, at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera. In 1960, she sang a superb Alcina at La Fenice, Venice, where she was nicknamed La Stupenda ("The Stunning One"). Lucia di Lammermoor generated so much excitement that standees began lining up at 7:30 that morning. Her singing of the Mad Scene drew a thunderous 12-minute ovation. Sutherland would soon be praised as La Stupenda in newspapers around the world. Later that year (1960), Sutherland sang Alcina at the Dallas Opera, with which she made her US debut.|$|E
