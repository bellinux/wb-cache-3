25|$|The initial {{deployment}} to Vietnam got <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> foot. The {{first two}} B-57Bs to land collided {{with each other}} on the ground and blocked the runway at Bien Hoa, forcing the rest of the flight to divert to Tan Son Nhut Airport {{on the other side of}} Saigon. One of the B-57Bs was hit by ground fire and dived into the ground during approach at Tan Son Nhut and was destroyed, killing both crew members. Ground rescue parties were unable to reach the planes due to strong Viet Cong fire.|$|E
25|$|Arkansas got <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> foot as punter Richie Butler's punt was blocked, {{setting up}} a one-yard {{touchdown}} run for Georgia running back Musa Smith. Another run by Smith pushed the Bulldog advantage to 14–0. Three Georgia field goals added to the score to make it 23–0. Arkansas had only one scoring drive, but even that was on life support, kept alive by two personal fouls, one after an incompletion on 3rd and 23. Georgia added a touchdown, won the game 30–3, and with the victory won the Southeastern Conference.|$|E
25|$|By 24 May {{the town}} was {{completely}} cut off, and 2nd Lieutenant William Dothie, commanding a Troop of six S/L detachments east of the town, found himself out of communication with his Battery HQ. His THQ, including a number of stragglers from other units, came under attack by German tanks and aircraft {{in the evening and}} he fell back to a small farm in a nearby wood. The following morning, Dothie led an attack on the tanks in their camp, engaging them with Boys and Bren fire. Although the tanks withdrew, Dothie guessed that they would bring up reinforcements and he ordered his men to withdraw, covering their crossing of some open ground with a Bren gun. However, he and the QVR Bren gunner found themselves cut <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> side of the open ground and could not get back to the rendezvous until after dark, by which time the rest of the party had made their way to Calais.|$|E

6000|$|From Prag onwards, {{here has}} been a {{delicate}} set of operations; perfectly executed,--thanks to Friedrich's rapidity of shift, and also to the cautious slowly puzzling mind of Daun. Had Daun used any diligence, had Daun and Prince Karl been broad awake, together or even singly! But Friedrich guessed they seldom or never were; that they would spend some days in puzzling; and that, with despatch, he would have time for everything. Daun, we could observe, stood singing TE-DEUM, greatly at leisure, in his old Camp, 20th June, while Friedrich, from the first gray of morning, and diligently all day long, was withdrawing from the trenches of Prag,--Friedrich's people, self and goods getting folded out in the finest gradation, and with perfect success; no Daun to hinder him,--Daun leisurely doing TE-DEUM, forty miles <b>off,</b> helping <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>WRONG</b> side by that exertion! [Cogniazzo, ii. 367.]--"Poor Browne, he is dead of his wounds, in Prag yonder," [...] writes Westphalen, in his Leitmeritz Journal, [...] "news came to us July 1st: men said, 'Ah, that was why they lay asleep.'" ...|$|R

When Morgan's brother Michael (Chad Duell) forces Morgan {{to go back home}} to Port Charles, Kiki follows and moves in with Morgan and Michael. While they initially get <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> foot, Kiki softens toward Michael when she learns why he is so protective of Morgan. Kiki is shocked when her mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) confesses that her father, Franco (Roger Howarth) is very much alive. In addition, Kiki is also shocked to learn that Ava is a member of powerful Jerome crime family that is challenging Michael and Morgan's father Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for his territory. After they kiss, Michael and Kiki are led to believe they are cousins. Noticing the attraction, Morgan convinces Kiki to marry him in the summer of 2013 only for it to be revealed that Kiki is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). To divert his new bride's attention, Morgan resorts to buying Kiki expensive gifts. The marriage quickly implodes when Kiki learns that Morgan knew about her paternity before they married and she files for an annulment. Despite {{the fact that she is}} now dating Michael, Kiki is furious to discover Morgan and Ava are having an affair.|$|E
500|$|Having {{arrived at}} Holby as an F1, Oliver quickly progressed onto his F2 training. This {{resulted}} in [...] "professional jealousy" [...] forming with Penny, and in retaliation to their disagreements, he put {{her career in}} jeopardy by revealing her affair. Registrar Greg Douglas was appointed as Oliver's mentor. The fast-paced storyline saw Greg initially [...] "kick against his newfound responsibility", before realising that Oliver could be beneficial to his own career, which resulted in an [...] "unlikely friendship" [...] forming between them. Though a [...] "fairly light, buddy-buddy" [...] storyline to begin with, Anderson felt that filming their scenes was [...] "intensive". Speaking of their friendship, Anderson explained: [...] "We start <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> foot {{with each other and}} we're competitive, which is unhelpful to the patients and (initially) we're not out to help one another at all. But they have similarities... in terms of dropping people in it." [...] The pace of the storyline had to be changed when Anderson injured his knee upon falling down a ten foot cellar. The pair clashed over conflicting medical opinions on patient care, and their friendship soon created a negative effect over Oliver's work ethic. Greg's jokes at his expense left Oliver unable to carry out simple procedures correctly.|$|E
500|$|Swan's {{time on the}} South Coast was miserable: {{family dog}} Zee died; wife Bex had a {{difficult}} birth with baby George; and Swan became a hate figure with his teammates and the local population at large after the club suffered a poor start to the season. Swan's problems then took a supernatural bent as the young couple became convinced that their Plymouth home was haunted – the family moved 260 miles back to the more friendly surroundings of Stoke. He got <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> foot with the Argyle fans after the local media pointed out that his goal saving tackle at Vale Park on 19 February 1994 had cost Plymouth promotion (Vale had finished three points ahead of Plymouth, who lost out to Burnley in the playoffs); Shilton also did little to help Swan's cause by appointing him as captain {{at the expense of}} fan's favourite Steve Castle. His new teammates also resented the record-signing Northerner for intruding on their clique. Rudge offered Shilton £150,000 to bring Swan back to Vale Park, but was refused; the local press asked Swan [...] "If you're so desperate to leave, why did you come to Plymouth in the first place?"; his answer of [...] "For the money" [...] only served to further incense supporters. Meanwhile, he had off-the-field scuffles with teammates Alan Nicholls and Kevin Nugent. Despite this, Swan's form on the pitch did improve {{towards the end of the}} season. Shilton was replaced by Steve McCall, who was in turn replaced by caretaker-manager Russell Osman, though neither men were able to steer the club away from relegation at the end of 1994–95 – to Swan's delight.|$|E
50|$|Emil Guillermo's cousin, 26-year-old Stephen Guillermo, was {{fatally shot}} in the Mission District in San Francisco on May 3, 2014. Stephen, who was drunk and unarmed, got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{elevator}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> floor of his apartment building and entered an apartment identical to his own but two floors below. He {{walked to the door}} that had the same number of his apartment, struggled with the doorknob, but managed to get inside. The 68-year-old male occupant of that apartment fired one shot that killed Stephen. The shooter claimed that he feared for his life from an intruder. He was initially booked for murder but was released two days later and prosecutors declined to file charges against him. Emil has expressed disapproval over the prosecutors' decision to not file charges.|$|R

From here she {{proceeded}} north to Shetland travelling continuously on a standard zigzag course as a precaution against being targeted by U-boats. This difficult manoeuvring required extremely accurate navigation, especially with such a large vessel. In the event it appears to have been poor navigation, rather than enemy action that was to doom Oceanic. An inaccurate fix of their position was made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night of 7 September by navigator Lieutenant David Blair RNR (previously assigned to, then reassigned from, the [...] ).

All of this came out years down the line, in my multitude of creative interests that are the tools I now bring to the Party. Writing, acting, music, comedy. A deep love of literature and books. Thank God for all the artists who've helped me. I'd read these words and off I went - dreaming my own imaginative dreams. Exercising them at will, eventually to form bands, comedy, more bands, movies, anything creative. This is the coin of the realm I use in my words - Vision. On June 16, 1993 I was diagnosed with having [...] "liver cancer that had spread from the pancreas." [...] One of life's weirdest and worst jokes imaginable. I'd been making such progress recently in my attitude, my career and realizing my dreams that it just stood me on my head for a while. [...] "Why me!?" [...] I would cry out, and [...] "Why now!?" [...] Well, I know now there may never be any answers to those particular questions, but maybe in telling a little about myself, we can find some other answers to other questions. That might help our way down our own particular paths, towards realizing my dream of New Hope and New Happiness. Amen. I left in love, in laughter, and in truth and wherever truth, love and laughter abide, I am there in spirit.|$|R

Rowling confirmed this view when asked how Lily and James {{had fallen in love}} if Lily hated him. Lupin tells Harry that after James matured, Lily started seeing him in their seventh year.
