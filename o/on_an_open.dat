Alprazolam is no longer recommended in Australia for the treatment of panic disorder due to concerns regarding tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Most evidence shows that the benefits of alprazolam in treating panic disorder last only 4 to 10 weeks. However, people with panic disorder have been treated <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> basis for up to 8 months without apparent loss of benefit.|$|E

The first official match took place in 1879. In 1882, a Mr J. Cruit donated land at Priory Road with the necessary facilities required for professional clubs. Cruit asked the club to leave his land after two years because the crowds became far too large and noisy.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} {{greatest}} operational efficiency, ML constructed two dedicated container terminals {{with their own}} gantry cranes, spreaders etc. The Manchester terminal was built <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> site next to {{the western end of}} No. 9 Dock. A second container berth was added in 1972. The other terminal was created at Montreal, with similar equipment, where the containers were trans-shipped to a dedicated liner train operated by Canadian National Railways, which carried them onwards to Toronto and further destinations.|$|E
5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas.

It is often burned inefficiently <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} stone circles {{were built in}} the area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being constructed from sarsen stone and being smaller than those found elsewhere. The Hampton Down ring was erected <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> downland ridge overlooking the coast. It originally contained either eight or nine sarsen stones and had a diameter of 20 feet (6.5 metres) across with a track leading to it from the north. By 1908 the circle had been shifted east of its original position, with a hedge built across the site, and the number of stones increased to sixteen. By 1964 the number of stones had further increased to twenty-eight. In 1965, Geoffrey J. Wainwright oversaw an archaeological excavation which revealed the circle's original location and dimensions, after which it was reconstructed in its original location with the extraneous stones removed.|$|E
5|$|Chinautla Viejo was {{attacked}} by the invading Spanish in 1525; the first two attacks against the heavily fortified city were unsuccessful. The besieged city received Poqomam reinforcements that were comprehensively defeated <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> field of battle, with the Spanish cavalry being decisive. The capture of Poqomam prisoners allowed the Spanish to discover {{the location of a}} cave providing a secret entrance to the city. A third assault broke the month-long siege, allowing the Spanish to take the city. The surviving inhabitants were moved to another settlement and Pedro de Alvarado ordered the city to be burned.|$|E

Unhappy with the Manor Ground's poor facilities, the club moved to the nearby Invicta Ground in 1890, before returning to the Manor Ground three years later as the Invicta Ground's rent proved too expensive.|$|E

5|$|In the Adler {{variation}} 3...Ng4 4.Nf3, after White {{has moved}} f2–f4, the e3-pawn becomes a backward pawn <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> file. Black can then apply {{pressure on the}} e-file in general, against the e3-pawn and the e4-square in particular. Typical moves in this plan would include the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f6, followed by putting the heavy pieces on the e-file with Rf8–e8 and Qd8–e7 (see diagram at right). The Bc5 is already well placed to pressure the e3-pawn. Depending on circumstances, the Bc8 may be involved either on b7 or on f5, in both cases to assert control over the central e4-square.|$|E

5|$|The English {{economy was}} {{fundamentally}} agricultural, depending on growing {{crops such as}} wheat, barley and oats <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> field system, and husbanding sheep, cattle and pigs. In the late Anglo-Saxon period many peasants moved away from living in isolated hamlets and instead came together to form larger villages engaged in arable cultivation. Agricultural land became typically organised around manors, and was divided between some fields that the landowner would manage directly, called demesne land, {{and the majority of}} the fields that would be cultivated by local peasants. These peasants would pay rent to the landowner either through agricultural labour on the lord's demesne fields or through rent in the form of cash and produce. By the 11th century, a market economy was flourishing across much of England, while the eastern and southern towns were heavily involved in international trade. Around 6,000 watermills were built to grind flour, freeing up labour for other more productive agricultural tasks.|$|E

5|$|The series {{consists}} of four role-playing games and one social card game. Each game typically features a third-person camera. The player controls the player character in a combination of combat and puzzle game elements to achieve goals and complete the story. Hotroit Stories is the only installment to feature an overhead perspective, while Daibouken Monsters is played as a card game, with no character movement. All games in the series feature a battle mode. During battles, player command a single human ally. To fight enemies in the main game, players use magical abilities or familiars; in Hotroit Stories, players attack using items such as dry ice for similar effects, while Daibouken Monsters limits players to using familiars only. The battle mode in Wrath of the White Witch and Revenant Kingdom is <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> battlefield, allowing players to freely roam around the area, while Dominion of the Dark Djinn employs a grid layout, whereby players can create formations to avoid attacks.|$|E

5|$|Each of the game's worlds feature eight main levels, with a boss {{appearing}} {{at the end}} of every fourth and eighth level. Hidden throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins, the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level. Collecting Flowers adds flowers to the gate {{at the end of}} each level (not including boss levels). If the player manages to land <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> flower after jumping through the end gate, they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu, such as additional stars or maginifying glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins. At the end of each level, players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found, as well as how many stars they have remaining, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars. Completing all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world.|$|E

5|$|Instead of an orchestral tutti, the concerto {{opens with}} the almost {{immediate}} entry of the solo violin, playing the very tune in E minor that gave Mendelssohn no peace. Following a bravura of rapidly ascending notes, the opening theme is then restated by the orchestra. There is then a frenetic chromatic transition passage {{as the music}} subsides and modulates into a tranquil second subject theme in G major. The melody is initially played by the woodwinds with the soloist providing a pedal note <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> G string. The tune is played by the solo violin itself before a short codetta ends the exposition section of the opening movement. The opening two themes are then combined in the development section, where the music builds up to the innovative cadenza, which Mendelssohn wrote out in full rather than allowing the soloist to improvise. The cadenza builds up speed through rhythmic shifts from quavers to quaver-triplets and finally to semiquavers, which require ricochet bowing from the soloist. This serves as {{a link to the}} recapitulation, where the opening melody is played by the orchestra, accompanied by the continuing ricochet arpeggios by the soloist. During the recapitulation, the opening themes are repeated with the second theme being played in the E major before returning to E minor for the closing of the movement. The music gathers speed into the coda, which is marked 'Presto', before a variant of the original chromatic transition passage ends the first movement.|$|E
5|$|Kayb'il B'alam had {{received}} {{news of the}} Spanish advance and had withdrawn to his fortress at Zaculeu, with some 6,000 warriors gathered from the surrounding area. The fortress possessed formidable defences, and Gonzalo de Alvarado launched {{an assault on the}} weaker northern entrance. Mam warriors initially held firm against the Spanish infantry but fell back before repeated cavalry charges. Kayb'il B'alam, seeing that outright victory <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> battlefield was impossible, withdrew his army back within the safety of the walls. As Alvarado dug in and laid siege to the fortress, an army of approximately 8,000 Mam warriors descended on Zaculeu from the Cuchumatanes mountains to the north, drawn from towns allied with the city; the relief army was annihilated by the Spanish cavalry. After several months the Mam were reduced to starvation. Kayb'il B'alam finally surrendered the city to the Spanish in the middle of October 1525. When the Spanish entered the city they found 1,800 dead Indians, and the survivors eating the corpses. After the fall of Zaculeu, a Spanish garrison was established at Huehuetenango, and Gonzalo de Alvarado returned to Tecpán Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The {{black-necked grebe}} uses {{multiple}} foraging techniques. Insects, {{which make up}} the majority of this bird's diet, are caught either {{on the surface of the}} water or when they are in flight. It occasionally practices foliage gleaning. This grebe dives to catch crustaceans, molluscs, tadpoles, and small frogs and fish. When moulting at saline lakes, this bird feeds mostly on brine shrimp. The black-necked grebe makes a floating cup nest <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>open</b> lake. The nest cup is covered with a disc. This nest is located both in colonies and by itself. During the breeding season, which varies depending on location, this species will lay one (sometimes two) clutch of three to four eggs. The number of eggs is sometimes larger due to conspecific brood parasitism. After a 21-day incubation period, the eggs hatch, and then the nest is deserted. After about 10 days, the parents split up the chicks between themselves. After this, the chicks become independent in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E
