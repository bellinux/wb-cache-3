Fifty-one percent of women reporting homosexual experience had only <b>one</b> <b>partner.</b> Women with post-graduate education had a higher prevalence of homosexual experience, followed by women with a college education; the smallest occurrence was among women with education no higher than eighth grade. However, Kinsey's methodology was criticized.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 4,500 {{same-sex}} couples married in Spain {{during the first}} year of the law. Shortly after the law was passed, questions arose about the legal status of marriage to non-Spaniards whose country did not permit same-sex marriage. A ruling from the Justice Ministry stated that the country's same-sex marriage law allows a Spanish citizen to marry a non-Spaniard regardless of whether that person's homeland recognizes the partnership. At least <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> must be a Spanish citizen in order to marry, although two non-Spaniards may marry if they both have legal residence in Spain.|$|E

5|$|Contrary {{to initial}} reports of monogamy, ruffed lemurs {{in the wild}} exhibit {{seasonal}} polygamous breeding behavior, with {{both males and females}} mating with more than <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> within a single season. Mating is not restricted to just community members, but also involves members of neighboring communities. Females mate primarily with males with whom they had affiliative relations prior to mating season, although some matings occurred with roaming males from other communities.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and {{the timing of the}} births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E
5|$|Paper Mario {{combines}} traditional role-playing game (RPG) elements with {{concepts and}} features from the Mario series. For {{the majority of}} the game, the player controls Mario, who can jump and use his hammer to overcome physical obstacles placed in the game's overworld. Many of the game's puzzles and boundaries are based upon the abilities of Mario's partners, who each have a specialised skill required for progression in the game. The player accumulates partners as they advance into different locations; only <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> can accompany Mario in the overworld, although the player can interchange them at any time.|$|E

5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> is under attack, the other partner {{should be aware of}} which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender an opportunity to take initiative.|$|E
5|$|The {{repertoire}} of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as preening, pointing, calling, bill clacking, staring, and combinations of such behaviours (like the sky-call). When a bird first {{returns to the}} colony it will dance with many partners, but {{after a number of}} years the number of birds an individual will interact with drops, until <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> is chosen and a pair is formed. They then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair. Having established a pair bond that will last for life, however, most of that dance will never be used again.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers of {{the time}} {{reported}} that the society promoted free love, but the society promoted free love only {{in the sense that}} consenting adults had a right to change partners and even to have more than <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> at a time. Rather than promiscuousness, though, the society promoted tolerance, including tolerance of homosexuality. The Spirit Fruit Society, unlike most other communitarian groups of that time, did not seek to convert or recruit others to the group. Members were permitted to come and go as they pleased. The goal of the commune was not to convert or to expand membership in the society—it was simply to live as the adherents wished to live.|$|E

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine the interrelationship between engagement in sexual fantasy, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. The research on this topic has been sparse to date; however, the examination of such interrelationships may be helpful when conducting therapy with couples who suffer from sexual difficulties. A survey questionnaire was administered, which included items intended to measure relationship satisfaction, sexual satisfaction, as well as engagement in sexual fantasy. Pilot questions were also added to include other forms of fantasy and erotica use, the expression of fantasy, and the frequency of engagement in fantasy. Significant effects were seen between sharing fantasies with <b>one's</b> <b>partner</b> and sexual satisfaction, and the interaction between sharing fantasies about someone else with <b>one's</b> <b>partner</b> and sharing fantasies about someone else with <b>one's</b> <b>partner</b> while lovemaking and relationship status. Positive correlations were found between sharing one's fantasies with <b>one's</b> <b>partner</b> and relationship satisfaction as well as sexual satisfaction. Negative correlations were found between fantasizing about someone other than <b>one's</b> <b>partner</b> and relationship satisfaction as well as sexual satisfaction. These results have the potential to serve providers who wish to enhance their understanding of sexual relationships and to aid those who are seeking services...|$|R
5|$|Females {{are ready}} to breed at ten to eleven months of age {{although}} males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually monogamous, sticking to <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may {{be taken over by}} some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.|$|E
5|$|These {{characters}} also assist Mario in the game's turn-based battles, where damage inflicted {{against them}} results in temporary paralysis as the characters {{do not have}} individual HP statistics. Attacks in the game {{are similar to those}} in traditional RPGs, although the player can influence the power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario and his partners have a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points (FP) when performed. Such statistics can be increased by earning Star Points (experience points) in combat to level up. There is also an on-screen gauge to display Star Energy, which is required to perform another type of move that accumulate in number as the player advances through the game. The player can locate hidden battle upgrades in the game's overworld, which promotes <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> character to a new rank at a time.|$|E
25|$|One common {{solution}} is to form the enolate of <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> first, and then add the other partner under kinetic control. Kinetic control means that the forward aldol addition reaction must be significantly faster than the reverse retro-aldol reaction. For this approach to succeed, two other conditions must also be satisfied; it must be possible to quantitatively form the enolate of <b>one</b> <b>partner,</b> and the forward aldol reaction must be significantly faster than {{the transfer of the}} enolate from <b>one</b> <b>partner</b> to another. Common kinetic control conditions involve the formation of the enolate of a ketone with LDA at −78°C, followed by the slow addition of an aldehyde.|$|E
