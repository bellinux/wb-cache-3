25|$|The <b>opposition</b> <b>{{procedure}}</b> {{before the}} European Patent Office (EPO) is a post-grant, contentious, procedure intended to allow any European patent to be centrally opposed. European patents {{granted by the}} EPO under the European Patent Convention (EPC) may be opposed by any person from the public (no commercial or other interest whatsoever need be shown). This happens often when some prior art was not found during the grant procedure, but was only known by third parties.|$|E
25|$|An {{opposition}} {{can only}} {{be based on a}} limited number of grounds, i.e. {{on the grounds that the}} subject-matter of the patent is not patentable, that the invention is insufficiently disclosed, or that the content of the patent extends beyond the content of the application as filed. The notice of opposition to a European patent must be filed in writing at the EPO (either at Munich, The Hague or Berlin), along with the payment of an opposition fee, within nine months from the publication of the mention of the grant of the patent in the European Patent Bulletin. Opposition Divisions of the EPO are responsible for the examination of oppositions. The <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> may involve multiple opponents. According to the EPO, a European patent was once opposed by a record number of 27 opponents.|$|E

These boards act as the final instances in the granting and <b>opposition</b> <b>procedures</b> before the EPO. The Boards of Appeal have been recognised as courts, or tribunals, of an international organisation, the EPO.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the unified, regional character of a European patent application, the granted European patent does not comprise, in effect, any such unitary character, except for the <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure.</b> In other words, one European patent in one Contracting State is effectively independent of the same European patent in each other Contracting State, except for the <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure.</b>|$|E

A central time-limited <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> and central {{limitation}} and revocation procedures before the EPO are available however. The <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> allows a third party, i.e. any person except the patent proprietor, to oppose a granted European patent {{in an attempt to}} have the EPO reconsider the grant of the patent and possibly revoke or amend the patent. The <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> may only be initiated within nine months of the grant of the European patent. The limitation and revocation procedures allow the patent proprietor to centrally request the limitation or revocation of his own European patent.|$|E

50|$|Patent {{examiners}} at the European Patent Office (EPO) {{carry out}} examination and <b>opposition</b> <b>procedures</b> for patent applications originating {{anywhere in the}} world and seeking protection in any of the member states of the European Patent Organisation. The process involves a search for existing documentation in the technical area of the application (prior art) and communication with the applicant in order to bring the application in line with the legal requirements of the European Patent Convention. For every patent application, a division formed by three examiners must decide whether the application is granted or not, and in which scope.|$|R
40|$|In the {{presence}} of asymmetric information, economic agents need to communicate their quality to investors and other parties. This paper investigates how information generated during the patenting process affects the ability of new ventures to attract VC financing. While {{much of the literature}} on information asymmetries focuses on patent applications, we argue that the entire examination process should be considered, including information that emerges in the course of patent examination and review. We test several hypotheses using a sample of British and German companies that seek venture capital. We find that the filing of patent applications is positively related to VC financing. Moreover, the examination process at the patent office generates valuable technological and commercial information via search reports, citations and <b>opposition</b> <b>procedures</b> which affect the likelihood of VC financing. Our results suggest that the patenting process supports investors in updating their expectations regarding the quality of new ventures...|$|R

The European Patent Office needs to instill more self-reflection into the patent system and foster interaction between the Office and patent stakeholders. In this respect, we propose that the EPO should establish an ex-ante, patent-granting advisory body that would consist of multidisciplinary staff drawn from various technical fields, and collaborate closely with the scientific community and other national bodies. It is expected that such an advisory body would provide an input to the existing patent system, since it would anticipate, control and reduce the possibility that patent examiners would issue low-quality patents with huge socio-economic consequences...|$|R
40|$|The {{speakers}} {{will introduce}} {{the activities of}} the European Patent Office, followed by a discussion on the patentability of CIIs. About the speakers Georg Weber is the Director at the EPO in Munich and Head of Directorate 1870. He is responsible for search, examination and <b>opposition</b> <b>procedures</b> in the technical areas of computer and network security, cryptography, computer arithmetic and mobile applications. His team comprises 70 patent examiners who are technical experts in these fields. Georg Weber joined the EPO in 1988 and is director since more than 10 years. He started his career in the office initially as a patent examiner and worked in different technical areas of chemistry and mechanics. Birger Koblitz is patent examiner at the EPO in Munich in the technical field of computer security. Before joining the office in 2009, he earned a PhD in Experimental Particle Physics from the University of Hamburg, and worked at CERN in the IT department supporting the experiments in their Grid Computing activities. </p...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the European Patent Organisation (EPO) granted 3 patents on the BRCA 1 gene (EP-B- 699754, EP-B- 705903, EP-B- 705902) to Myriad Genetics. The patents, and {{the option}} of the patent holder to {{strictly}} exert its monopoly right by requesting that all diagnostic testing be done at its laboratory in the United States, has evoked strong reactions in Europe. Several <b>opposition</b> <b>procedures</b> have been started against these patents. After oral hearings at the EPO in Munich in May 2004, the first patent was revoked due to errors contained in the initially filed sequence. At oral proceedings in January 2005, the other two patents were severely limited in scope. The discussion on inventive step on the cloning of the BRCA 1 gene - {{other than the one}} that relates to the priority date - has not taken place. In other words, the EPO has not questioned the patentability of this gene per se. The author participated in the hearings in Munich and would like to give the genetic community a firsthand account of the case. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Any {{person can}} contest a patent's validity. There is a post-grant <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> {{available}} through SIPO, or otherwise actions can be initiated at the Patent Review Board (PRB). Appeal lies to the Beijing IP Court now. Before 2014, it was Beijing Intermediate People's Court.|$|E
50|$|There {{are only}} two types of {{centrally}} executed procedures after grant, the <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> and the limitation and revocation procedures. The <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure,</b> governed by the EPC, allows third parties to file an opposition against a European patent within 9 months of the date of grant of that patent. It is a quasi-judicial process, subject to appeal, {{which can lead to}} maintenance, maintenance in amended form or revocation of a European patent. Simultaneously to the opposition, a European patent may be the subject of litigation at a national level (for example an infringement dispute). National courts may suspend such infringement proceedings pending outcome of the opposition proceedings to avoid proceedings running in parallel and the uncertainties that may arise from that.|$|E
50|$|During the <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{when the}} European patent is {{maintained}} in an amended form, {{the publication of}} the mention of maintenance of the European patent in the European Patent Bulletin marks the start of the three-month period (or more in some countries, such as Ireland) for supplying the translation of the text in which the European patent has been maintained to each national patent office, in order to have an effective protection in each country.|$|E

50|$|Although menstrual {{regulation}} centers are centralized {{and free of}} charge, many women still lack access due to socioeconomic barriers and social stigma.

50|$|The <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> {{before the}} European Patent Office (EPO) is a post-grant, contentious, inter partes, {{administrative}} procedure intended to allow any European patent to be centrally opposed. European patents {{granted by the}} EPO under the European Patent Convention (EPC) may be opposed by any person from the public (no commercial or other interest whatsoever need be shown). This happens often when some prior art was not found during the grant procedure, but was only known by third parties.|$|E
50|$|The {{case law}} of the EPO Boards of Appeal is not binding on the first {{instance}} departments of the EPO (i.e. the Examining Divisions), and different Examining Divisions of the EPO may assess patentability differently. Likewise, during an <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> before the EPO, where the grant of a recently granted European patent may be opposed by a third party (opponent), the patent may be revoked if the Opposition Division form a different view {{on whether or not}} the invention in question was patentable.|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{attributes}} of a European patent in a Contracting State, i.e. ownership, validity, and infringement, are determined independently under respective national law, {{except for the}} <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure,</b> limitation procedure, and revocation procedure as discussed above. Though the EPC imposes some common limits, the EPC expressly adopts national law for interpretation of all substantive {{attributes of}} a European patent in a Contracting State, with a few exceptions. Thus, almost all post-grant proceedings - including renewal, revocation proceedings (when initiated by somebody else than the proprietor), and infringement enforcement are determined under national law.|$|E
5000|$|Since June 2012, the Guidelines include eight parts, {{relating}} respectively to the {{formalities examination}} (Part A), the search (Part B), the procedural aspects of substantive examination (Part C), the <b>opposition</b> and limitation/revocation <b>procedures</b> (Part D), general procedural matters (Part E), the European patent application (Part F), patentability (Part G), and the amendments and corrections (Part H). The Guidelines are revised annually.|$|R
50|$|The {{search and}} {{examination}} process is principally conducted between {{the patent office}} and the applicant. However, in some jurisdictions, {{it is possible for}} interested third parties to file opinions on the patentability of an application. Such opinions may {{take the form of a}} formal pre-grant <b>opposition</b> inter partes <b>procedure</b> or it may simply be an opportunity of filing observations as a third party. Reform legislation is set to create an opposition system in the United States.|$|R

There are many different haka; though, one, [...] "Ka mate" [...] by Te Rauparaha, is much more widely known than any other.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} competences of the European Patent Office remain unchanged: A so-called <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure</b> {{dealing with}} {{the validity of the}} patent (but not with infringement) may also be brought before the European Patent Office during a 9-month period after the grant of the patent. Decisions by the European Patent Office are valid throughout the territory where the European patent is valid and may thus encompass 38 countries. Furthermore, countries may still grant their own national patents independently of the European Patent Office. Such patents are not litigated in the Unified Patent Court.|$|E
50|$|Patents granted {{under the}} European Patent Convention (EPC) are called European patents. Those are granted {{following}} a unified grant procedure {{based on a}} single patent application, in one language. After grant however, a European patent is not a unitary right, but becomes a bundle of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents -subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure,</b> which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and revocation procedures, which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.|$|E
50|$|The European Patent Convention (EPC), {{also known}} as the Convention on the Grant of European Patents of 5 October 1973, is a {{multilateral}} treaty instituting the European Patent Organisation and providing an autonomous legal system according to which European patents are granted. The term European patent is used to refer to patents granted under the European Patent Convention. However, a European patent is not a unitary right, but a group of essentially independent nationally-enforceable, nationally-revocable patents, subject to central revocation or narrowing as a group pursuant to two types of unified, post-grant procedures: a time-limited <b>opposition</b> <b>procedure,</b> which can be initiated by any person except the patent proprietor, and limitation and revocation procedures, which can be initiated by the patent proprietor only.|$|E
