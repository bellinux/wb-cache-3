5|$|Immediately after Perón's death, the {{government}} suspended all official activities {{for two days}} and <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> flags flown at half-staff for ten days. It soon became apparent, however, that these measures fell short of reflecting popular grief. The crowd outside of the presidential residence, where Evita died, grew dense, congesting the streets for ten blocks in each direction.|$|E

5|$|The {{service was}} {{attended}} by many dignitaries from across the United States, and President Hayes <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> flags to half-staff.

5|$|After chasing {{away the}} Japanese forces at Koli Point, the U.S. renewed the western {{offensive}} towards Kokumbona on 10 November with three battalions under the overall command of U.S. Marine Colonel John Arthur. In the meantime, fresh Japanese {{troops from the}} 228th Infantry Regiment of the 38th Infantry Division landed by Tokyo Express over several nights beginning on 5 November and effectively resisted the American attack. After making small advances, at 13:45 on 11 November Vandegrift suddenly <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> the American forces {{to return to the}} east bank of the Matanikau.|$|E
5|$|As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> the Muslim armies in Syria to {{evacuate}} the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya.

5|$|By {{the middle}} of 1943, Lockwood had {{received}} enough reports from submarine officers to convince him the Mark 6 was significantly flawed. On 24 June 1943, he formally <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> submarines operating out of Pearl Harbor to deactivate the magnetic influence feature. However, Christie was still committed to the exploder, and ordered Fremantle boats to continue using the influence feature. Submarines operating between the two commands were required to either enable or disable it, depending on which command area they were in. This difference of opinion strained {{relations between the two}} admirals.|$|E
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> {{life rafts}} and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5|$|Dolly {{weakened}} as it accelerated northeastward, {{although it}} still threatened to strike Bermuda with strong winds. As a result, the United States Air Force <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> {{of the planes}} on the island to fly to the mainland. After continued weakening, Dolly passed over the island on September11, producing only gale-force winds, rains, and little to no damage. It deteriorated into a tropical storm on September12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The remnants of Dolly later turned eastward, dissipating just west of Portugal on September17.|$|E

5|$|During {{the filming}} of Victory of Faith, Hitler had stood {{side by side with}} the leader of the Sturmabteilung (SA) Ernst Röhm, a man with whom he clearly had a close working relationship. Rohm was ruthlessly murdered on Hitler's orders a short time later during the purge of the SA {{referred}} to as the Night of the Long Knives. It has gone on record that, immediately following the killings, Hitler subsequently <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> copies of the film to be destroyed, although Riefenstahl disputes that this ever happened.|$|E
5|$|During {{the meeting}} in Kolwezi, Tshombe had <b>ordered</b> <b>all</b> {{remaining}} Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Jean Schramme was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate {{what remained of the}} Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|From 1810 to 1820, {{the number}} of free blacks in Indiana {{increased}} from 400 to 1200. In 1820 the State Supreme Court case of Polly v.

In 1820 the census recorded 190 slaves; by the 1830 census there were only three.|$|E
