40|$|The mantle {{lithosphere}} {{beneath the}} cratonic part of continents is the deepest (> 200 km) and oldest (> 2 - 3 Ga) on Earth, remaining a conundrum {{as to how}} these cratonic roots could have resisted delamination by asthenospheric convection over time. Water, or trace H incorporated in mineral defects, could be {{a key player in}} the evolution of continental lithosphere because it influences melting and rheology of the mantle. Mantle xenoliths from the Lac de Gras kimberlite in the Slave craton were analyzed by FTIR. The cratonic mantle beneath Lac de Gras is stratified with shallow (< 145 km) oxidized ultradepleted peridotites and pyroxenites with evidence for carbonatitic metasomatism, underlain by reduced and less depleted peridotites metasomatized by kimberlite melts. Peridotites analyzed so far have H O contents in ppm weight of 7 - 100 in their olivines, 58 to 255 in their orthopyroxenes (opx), 11 to 84 in their garnet, and 139 in one clinopyroxene. A pyroxenite contains 58 ppm H 2 O in opx and 5 ppm H 2 O in its <b>olivine</b> and <b>garnet.</b> <b>Olivine</b> and <b>garnet</b> from the deep peridotites have a range of water contents extending to higher values than those from the shallow ones. The FTIR spectra of olivines from the shallow samples have more prominent Group II OH bands compared to the olivines from the deep samples, consistent with a more oxidized mantle environment. The range of olivine water content is similar to that observed in Kaapvaal craton peridotites at the same depths (129 - 184 km) but does not extend to as high values as those from Udachnaya (Siberian craton).

40|$|Earth's deep convecting upper mantle is {{believed}} to represent a rather homogenous geochemical reservoir of spinel or garnet lherzolite with primitive major element and moderately depleted trace element composition. Only where subduction occurs is this homogeneity disrupted by a suite of rocks ranging from eclogites/garnet pyroxenites (former oceanic crust) to residual harzburgites. In addition to these well documented peridotitic and metabasaltic rocks we have now discovered {{the presence of a}} chemically distinct reservoir in the deep convecting upper mantle. In situ structural analyses (micro X-ray diffraction and micro Raman spectroscopy) and three-dimensional trace element mapping (confocal micro X-ray fluorescence imaging) of polyphase inclusions in a diamond from Guinea that formed at about 300 – 360 km depth reveal the existence of a deep Ca-rich source, in the absence of several common mantle minerals, like <b>olivine,</b> <b>garnet</b> and low-Ca pyroxene.

Additional well calibrated single-clinopyroxene thermobarometric calculations were also applied. Results indicate the underlying mantle experienced different equilibration conditions.

40|$|Water is {{believed}} to be a key factor controlling the long-term stability of cratonic lithosphere, but mechanisms responsible for the water content distribution in the mantle remain poorly constrained. Water contents were obtained by FTIR in <b>olivine,</b> pyroxene and <b>garnet</b> for 20 well-characterized peridotite xenoliths from the Udachnaya kimberlite (central Siberian craton) and equilibrated at 2 - 7 GPa. Water contents in minerals {{do not appear to be}} related to interaction with the host kimberlite. Diffusion modeling indicates that the core of olivines preserved their original water contents. The Udachnaya peridotites show a broad range of water contents in olivine (6. 5 +/- 1. 1 to 323 +- 65 ppm H 2 O (2 sigma)), and garnet (0 - 23 +/- 6 ppm H 2 O). The water contents of <b>olivine</b> and <b>garnet</b> are positively correlated with modal clinopyroxene, garnet and FeO in <b>olivine.</b> Water-rich <b>garnets</b> are also rich in middle rare earth elements. This is interpreted as the result of interaction between residual peridotites and water rich-melts, consistent with modal and cryptic metasomatism evidenced in the Siberian cratonic mantle. The most water-rich Udachnaya minerals contain 2 to 3 times more water than those from the Kaapvaal craton, the only craton with an intact mantle root for which water data is available. The highest water contents in olivine and orthopyroxene in this study (>= 300 ppm) are found at the bottom of the lithosphere (> 6. 5 GPa). This is in contrast with the Kaapvaal craton where the olivines of peridotites equilibrated at > 6. 4 GPa have 6 GPa is lower or similar (8. 4 10 (exp 16) to 8. 0 10 (exp 18) Pa. /s) to that of the asthenosphere (<= 3. 7 x 10 (exp 18) Pa. /s). Such lithologies would not be able to resist delamination by the convecting asthenosphere. However, seismology studies as well as the high equilibration pressures of our samples indicate that the Udachnaya cratonic lithosphere is 220 - 250 km thick. Consequently, the water-rich peridotites are likely not representative of the overall Siberian cratonic lithosphere. Their composition is linked to spatially limited melt metasomatism in mantle regions above asthenospheric upwellings responsible for the kimberlite magmatism prior to their ascent and eruption...|$|R

40|$|Most {{applications}} of high-resolution NMR {{to questions of}} short-range order/disorder in inorganic materials {{have been made in}} systems where ions with unpaired electron spins are of negligible concentration, with structural information extracted primarily from chemical shifts, quadrupolar coupling parameters, and nuclear dipolar couplings. In some cases, however, the often-large additional resonance shifts caused by interactions between unpaired electron and nuclear spins can provide unique new structural information in materials with contents of paramagnetic cations ranging from hundreds of ppm to several per cent and even higher. In this brief review we focus on recent work on silicate, phosphate, and oxide materials with relatively low concentrations of paramagnetic ions, where spectral resolution can remain high enough to distinguish interactions between NMR-observed nuclides and one or more magnetic neighbors in different bonding configurations in the first, second, and even farther cation shells. We illustrate the types of information available, some of the limitations of this approach, and the great prospects for future experimental and theoretical work in this field. We give examples for the effects of paramagnetic transition metal, lanthanide, and actinide cation substitutions in simple oxides, pyrochlore, zircon, monazite, <b>olivine,</b> <b>garnet,</b> pyrochlores, and olivine structures.

40|$|In the Shackleton Range of East Antarctica, garnet-bearing ultramafic rocks {{occur as}} lenses in supracrustal {{high-grade}} gneisses. In {{the presence of}} <b>olivine,</b> <b>garnet</b> is an unmistakable indicator of eclogite facies metamorphic conditions. The eclogite facies assemblages are only present in ultramafic rocks, particularly in pyroxenites, whereas other lithologies - including metabasites - lack such assemblages. We conclude that under high-temperature conditions, pyroxenites preserve high-pressure assemblages better than isofacial metabasites, provided the pressure is high enough to stabilize garnet-olivine assemblages (i. e. >= 18 - 20 kbar). The Shackleton Range ultramafic rocks experienced a clockwise P-T path and peak conditions of 800 - 850 °C and 23 - 25 kbar. These conditions correspond to ~ 70 km depth of burial and a metamorphic gradient of 11 - 12 °C/km that is typical of a convergent plate-margin setting. The age of metamorphism is defined by two garnet-whole-rock Sm-Nd isochrons that give ages of 525 ± 5 and 520 ± 14 Ma corresponding {{to the time of}} the Pan-African orogeny. These results are evidence of a Pan-African suture zone within the northern Shackleton Range. This suture marks the site of a palaeo-subduction zone that likely continues to the Herbert Mountains, where ophiolitic rocks of Neoproterozoic age testify to an ocean basin that was closed during Pan-African collision.

Diffusion couples were prepared by ablating an olivine (XFo = 0. 3) target to deposit {{a thin film}} (20 - 100 nm) onto a polished surface of a natural, oriented diopside crystal using the pulsed laser deposition technique. After diffusion anneals, compositional depth profiles at the near surface region (~ 400 nm) were measured using Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy.

Diffusion coefficients, DFe-Mg, can be described by a single Arrhenius relation with (Formula presented).

As a consequence, diffusion in clinopyroxene may be the rate-limiting process for the freezing of many geothermometers, and compositional zoning in clinopyroxene may preserve records of a higher (compared to that preserved in other coexisting mafic minerals) temperature segment of the thermal history of a rock. In the absence of pervasive recrystallization, clinopyroxene grains will retain compositions from peak temperatures at their cores in most geological and planetary settings where peak temperatures did not exceed ~ 1, 100 °C (e. g., resetting may be expected in slowly cooled mantle rocks, many plutonic mafic rocks, or ultra-high temperature metamorphic rocks) ...|$|E

Acceptable ICP-MS data were obtained for the following suite of elements: Mg, P, Ca, Mn, Co, Zn, Sr, Ba, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Rb, Cd, Sb, Cs, and Ce. The application of the procedure to lichens from different sites indicated that sites could be distinguished by their trace element concentrations; the elements with differences included elements of environmental interest such as V, Zn, and Cu.

The chondrite normalized REE patterns of garnets from deformed lherzolites are mostly characterized by smooth increasing of LREE values with gradation in the field of HREE. The distribution curves of REE in garnets of megacrystalline dunites have highly sinusoidal character. The very big difference in REE values is seen in the width of dunite field.

The sharp sinusoidality of REE distribution curves, early enrichment with the LREE prove that some garnets of studied dunites were not in the equilibrium with the melt.

The results show that 75  % of the pre-monsoon samples and 62.5  % of the post-monsoon samples were exceeded the permissible limit 50  mg/l. This variation in concentration of Ca and Mg is due to the seasonal changes in the rock–water interactions during pre- and post-monsoon periods. An increase in the concentration was observed for Ca and Mg during the pre-monsoon period. The possible explanation for the elevated concentration of Ca and Mg in the groundwater during the pre-monsoon season {{may be due to the}} increased residence time of the groundwater due to sluggish flow (Han et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 199 {{diamonds}} from the Venetia kimberlite, South Africa, whose mineral inclusion chemistry {{had already been}} measured, were analyzed for their carbon isotopic composition. Silicate inclusions in these diamonds either belong to a peridotitic (P-Type), an eclogitic (E-Type) or transitional, websteritic (W-Type), paragenesis. The carbon isotopic composition of 161 P-Type diamonds ranges from δ 13 C = − 2. 23 to − 18 ‰ vs. PDB. The large number of samples available and the wide range in δ 13 C permitted, for the first time, {{a detailed analysis of}} the relationships between P-Type inclusion chemistry and the carbon isotopic composition of the diamond host. The δ 13 C sampling frequency distribution is multi-modal. Examination of the inclusion chemistry (chromite, <b>olivine,</b> <b>garnet)</b> {{as a function of the}} carbon isotope composition mode to which the host belongs, as well as multivariate regression analyses, revealed no correlation between inclusion chemistry and 13 C content. The inclusion compositions in diamonds of low 13 C content are not distinctive. For a given carbon isotopic composition the combination of Ni/Fe and Mg/(Mg + Fe) of olivine inclusions varies systematically along fractionation trends. The composition of the olivine inclusions and the 13 C content of their hosts can be interpreted as reflecting similar petrogenetic processes occurring in several mantle environments into which carbon of variable isotopic composition was introduced. The iron/magnesium distribution between coexisting garnets and olivines permits an estimate of their pressure/temperature equilibration conditions. Diamonds whose inclusions were equilibrated at lower temperatures and pressures tend to have, on average, lower 13 C contents. The compositions of coexisting olivines and chromites suggest oxygen fugacities between 2. 9 and 5. 8 log units below the quartz-fayalite-magnetite buffer at 50 kbar, and temperatures between 1280 and 1490 °C prevailed during diamond formation. Inclusions from diamonds of lower 13 C content do not indicate systematically lower fO 2 values during their formation. The fO 2 /T conditions determined suggest minimal (0. 0 to − 0. 5 ‰) isotope fractionation between a C-H-O vapor phase (carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, water, hydrogen) and diamond. The large 13 C depletion of some Venetia P-Type diamonds appears to be unrelated to the composition of their inclusions, igneous fractionation trends, oxygen fugacity, and vapor isotope fractionation processes. This conclusion is consistent with evidence deduced from more limited data sets from other kimberlites. Eclogitic diamonds constitute less than 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{speciation}} {{and amount}} of water dissolved in nominally anhydrous silicates comprising eight different mantle xenoliths has been quantified using synchrotron micro-FTIR spectroscopy. Samples studied are from six geographic localities and represent a cross-section of the major upper mantle lithologies {{from a variety of}} tectonic settings. Clinopyroxene contains between 342 and 413 ppm H₂O. Orthopyroxene, <b>olivine</b> and <b>garnet</b> contain 169 – 201, 3 – 54 and 0 to < 3 ppm H₂O, respectively. Pyroxenes water contents and the distribution of water between ortho- and clinopyroxene is identical regardless of sample mineralogy (D water cpx/opx = 2. 1 ± 0. 1). The total water contents of each xenolith are remarkably similar (113 ± 14 ppm H₂O). High-resolution spectroscopic traverses show that the concentration and speciation of hydrous defects dissolved in each phase are spatially homogeneous within individual crystals and identical in different crystals interspersed throughout the xenolith. These results suggest that the amount of water dissolved in the silicate phases is in partial equilibrium with the transporting melt. Other features indicate that xenoliths have also preserved OH signatures of equilibrium with the mantle source region: Hydroxyl stretching modes in clinopyroxene show that garnet lherzolites re-equilibrated under more reducing conditions than spinel lherzolites. The distribution of water between pyroxenes and olivine differs according to xenolith mineralogy. The distribution of water between clinopyroxene and <b>olivine</b> from <b>garnet</b> peridotites (D water cpx/oliv(gnt) = 22. 2 ± 24. 1) is a factor of four greater than mineral pairs from spinel-bearing xenoliths (D water cpx/oliv(sp) = 88. 1 ± 47. 8). Such an increase in olivine water contents at the spinel to garnet transition is likely a global phenomenon and this discontinuity could lead to a reduction of the upper mantle viscosity by 0. 2 – 0. 7 log units and a reduction of its electrical resistivity by a factor of 0. 5 – 0. 8 log units. 20 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2003. Environmental ScienceIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 111 - 120) Lichens {{are excellent}} biomonitors. This study was undertaken {{to develop and}} refine a partial digestion procedure for lichen, suitable for ICP-MS analysis of trace elements, {{for the purpose of}} environmental monitoring. The developed digestion method consisted of a series of alternating dry and wet ashings utilizing nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Acceptable ICP-MS data were obtained for the following suite of elements: Mg, P, Ca, Mn, Co, Zn, Sr, Ba, V, Cr, Fe, Cu, Rb, Cd, Sb, Cs, and Ce. The application of the procedure to lichens from different sites indicated that sites could be distinguished by their trace element concentrations; the elements with differences included elements of environmental interest such as V, Zn, and Cu. The concentrations determined by this research for Newfoundland lichens were generally much lower than those reported by other researchers. The digestion procedure was also applied to different lichen species (Alectoria sarmentosa, Bryoria sp., and Cladonia alpestris) collected at the same site. It was found that different species yielded different trace element information, thus direct comparisons cannot necessarily be made. Digestion residues were examined by SEM-EDX to determine general compositions. The majority of these residual particles had a high silicon content, with varying amounts of other elements, particularly aluminum and potassium; these minerals were silicates, likely to be quartz, feldspars, <b>olivines,</b> <b>garnets,</b> micas, and/or clay minerals. Differences in concentration (as determined by ICP-MS) were observed in lichen samples collected from the same site in consecutive years. Some elements displayed differences between ICP-MS Runs, likely due to sample inhomogeneity. Other researchers have found that elemental concentrations can differ between species, that some elements (e. g. Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn) have higher concentrations in more polluted areas, and that the levels of some anthropogenic pollutants decrease with distance from the source; each of these points support the findings of this study...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of mineral}} {{inclusions}} in natural diamonds and rare diamondiferous xenoliths from kimberlites {{show that most}} diamonds {{are associated with a}} dunite or harzburgite paragenesis. The diamondiferous periodites and dunites have predominantly coarse or tabular textures that suggest low-temperature (less than 1100 C) equilibration. Application of the K(D) Fe/Mg(Ga/Ol) geothermometer of O'Neill and Wood to analytical data for the minerals in these rocks shows that most have equilibrated below 1100 C. Application of this thermometer to pairs of <b>olivine</b> and <b>garnet</b> crystals included in individual diamonds indicates that the diamonds have crystallized in the range 900 - 1300 C, with a majority of estimated equilibration temperatures falling in the range below 1150 C. Comparison of these estimates of equilibration temperature with the zone of invariant vapor composition solidus for kimberlite and garnet lherzolite determined by Eggler and Wendlandt (1979) suggests that many diamonds may have formed in subsolidus events...|$|R
40|$|The {{partitioning}} of Fe and Mg between coexisting garnet and olivine {{has been}} studied at 30 kb pressure and temperatures of 900 ° to 1, 400 °C. The results of both synthesis and reversal experiments demonstrate that KD (= (Fe/Mg) gt/(Fe/Mg) OI) {{is strongly dependent on}} Fe/Mg ratio and on the calcium content of the garnet. For example, at 1, 000 °C/ 30 kb, KD varies from about 1. 2 in very iron-rich compositions to 1. 9 at the magnesium end of the series. Increasing the mole fraction of calcium in the garnet from 0 to 0. 3 at 1, 000 ° C increases KD in magnesian compositions from 1. 9 to about 2. 5. The observed temperature and composition dependence of KD has been formulated into an equation suitable for geothermometry by considering the solid solution properties of the olivine and garnet phases. It was found that, within experimental error, the simplest kind of nonideal solution model (Regular Solution) fits the experimental data adequately. The use of more complex models did not markedly improve the fit to the data, so the model with the least number of variables was adopted. Multiple linear regression of the experimental data (72 points) yielded, for the exchange reaction: 3 Fe 2 SiO 4 + 2 Mg 3 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 <b>olivine</b> <b>garnet</b> ⇌ 2 Fe 2 Al 2 Si 3 O 12 + 3 Mg 2 SiO 4 garnet olivine ΔH ° (30 kb) of - 10, 750 cal and ΔS ° of - 4. 26 cal deg- 1 mol- 1. Absolute magnitudes of interaction parameters (Wij) derived from the regression are subject to considerable uncertainty. The partition coefficient is, however, strongly dependent on the following differences between solution parameters and these differences are fairly well constrained: WFeMgol-WFeMggt≃ 800 cal WCaMggt-WCaFegt≃ 2, 670 cal. The geothermometer is most sensitive in the temperature and composition regions where KDis substantially greater than 1. Thus, for example, peridotitic compositions at temperatures less than about 1, 300 ° C should yield calculated temperatures within 60 °C of the true value. Iron rich compositions (at any temperature) and magnesian compositions at temperatures well above 1, 300 °C could not be expected to yield accurate calculated temperatures. For a fixed KDthe influence of pressure is to raise the calculated temperature by between 3 and 6 °C per kbar. © 1979 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Diamonds {{are formed}} at high pressure, {{temperature}} and low oxygen fugacity {{conditions in the}} Earth's deep mantle. However, during their residence in the mantle and transport to the surface by kimberlite magma, they may be exposed to deformation or oxidising conditions outside of their stability field, causing diamond corrosion and resorption processes. The infiltration of silicate-rich melts and hydrothermal fluids are key processes that cause this corrosion (oxidation). Understanding the processes involved in diamond transport and preservation is important for diamond exploration and to assess the potential diamond grade for economic geology of kimberlite deposits. However, {{a thorough understanding of}} variations in diamond grade and survival or preservation conditions in the Lunda province (LP) has not yet been developed. Here a diamond preservation index model has been developed. Chemical analyses and petrography both support the view that the observed variations in diamond grade or abundance within Lunda Province (NE Angola) are associated with oxygen fugacity (fO 2), oxidation state, viscosity of kimberlite magma, speed of kimberlite emplacement. Variations in temperature and pressure can impose conditions that are sufficiently oxidising for diamond resorption or to form CO 2. Several kimberlite pipes were sampled and it is known that they transported different amounts of diamond to the Earth's surface. In this study, both mantle xenoliths and kimberlite rocks from five kimberlite pipes (Catoca, Camatxia, Camagico, Caixepa and Camutue) from the Lucapa graben (NE Angola) were investigated, with the highest diamond concentrations occurring in LP. Alteration characteristics of kimberlite indicator minerals (KIMs) from the sampled deposits were investigated by optical microscopy, SEM, electron probe microanalysis (EMPA), XRF, XRD and 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy. The results of petrography and geochemical studies of peridotite, eclogite and kimberlite rocks during this project have revealed that the sampled kimberlite diamond deposits have experienced several alteration processes and the analysed diamond indicator minerals (<b>olivine,</b> <b>garnet,</b> spinel, ilmenite and pyroxene) reflect these alteration / redox reactions. The hydrothermal-metasomatic processes are associated with factors that controlled kimberlite emplacement. Mössbauer spectroscopy and EMPA results reveal that in the diamondiferous pipes of Camatxia, Caixepa and Camutue, iron redox ratios in ilmenites are considerably lower, indicating lower ƒO 2 and consequently better diamond preservation conditions than for Catoca diamonds. The observed low diamond quality from Catoca pipe and the higher measured Fe 3 +/ΣFe ratio of Catoca indicator minerals agrees with a model which supports the use of ilmenite redox ratios to measure diamond and estimate the resorption on diamond. Results from Mössbauer and EMPA suggest that even with higher Fe 3 +/ΣFe Fe 3 +, and a lack of the original Mg-rich ilmenite and complex ilmenite formation, the presence or mineralization of diamond within Lucapa graben kimberlites cannot be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of H₂O, F, Cl, C, P, and S {{have been}} {{measured}} by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) in experimentally produced peridotite phases (including clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, <b>olivine,</b> <b>garnet,</b> amphibole, and mica) and coexisting basanitic glasses. Because only two experiments produced glasses on quenching (with the melt phase in others reverting to felt-like crystallite masses) H₂O concentrations in melts were also separately determined from mass-balance relationships and by assuming constant H₂O/La in melts and starting materials. The resulting values {{were used to}} calculate mineral/melt partition coefficients (D values) for H₂O [where DH₂O crystal/melt = (mass fraction of H₂O in crystal) /(mass fraction of H₂O in melt) ] for conditions of 1025 - 1190 ℃ and 1. 0 - 3. 5 GPa. These gave 0. 0064 - 0. 0164 for clinopyroxene, 0. 0046 - 0. 0142 for orthopyroxene, 0. 0015 - 0. 0016 for olivine, and 0. 0016 - 0. 0022 for garnet. Although less information was obtained for the other volatiles, F {{was found to be}} significantly more compatible than H₂O during peridotite melting, whereas Cl is significantly less compatible. S also has small but appreciable solubilities in amphiboles and micas, but not in pyroxenes or olivine. The solubility of C in silicate minerals appears to be negligible, although C was present in coexisting melts (~ 0. 5 wt% as CO₂) and as residual graphite during experiments. The D values for H₂O in clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene are positively correlated with ivAl but negatively correlated with the H₂O concentrations of melts (when considered as wt%). These relationships are consistent with the broad trends of previously published partitioning data. Although some of the concentration dependence can be related to cross-correlation between ivAl in pyroxenes and H₂O concentrations in melts (via the latter's control of liquidus temperatures) this relationship is too inconsistent to be a complete explanation. A concentration dependence for DH₂Omineral/melt can also be independently predicted from speciation models for H₂O in silicate melts. Thus it is likely that DH₂Opyx/melt is influenced by both ivAl and the absolute concentration of H₂O in melts. DH₂O/DCe for clinopyroxene is inversely correlated with M 2 site radii. Because the latter decrease with increasing pressure and temperature, relatively hot and/or deeply derived melts should be enriched in Ce relative to H₂O when compared to melts from cooler and shallower mantle sources. Conversely, melts from H₂O-rich settings (e. g., subduction zones) should have higher H₂O/Ce than their source rocks. When combined with previously obtained partitioning data for non-volatile elements (from the same experiments), our data are consistent with the enrichment of intraplate basalt sources in both volatile and non-volatile incompatible elements by small-degree melts derived from local mid-ocean ridge basalt sources. In this way, volatiles can be seen to play an active role (via their promotion of partial-melting and metasomatic processes) in the auto-regulation of incompatible element concentrations in the depleted upper mantle. 13 page(s...|$|E
