5|$|The main predators of {{the house}} martins are those birds of prey which are capable of {{catching}} these agile fliers, such as the hobby (Falco subbuteo). Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground. This has therefore become a communal activity, {{with a group of}} these birds descending suddenly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> mud. The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, The Greencards {{relocated}} from Austin to Nashville, to {{be closer}} to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas {{on the way back to}} Austin, but with no serious injuries.|$|E
5|$|Before 1902, Manchester United {{were known}} as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their {{football}} matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman John Henry Davies decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit {{for a team that}} had recently won the First Division and FA Cup, so he donated funds {{for the construction of a}} new stadium. Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> land adjacent to the Bridgewater Canal, just off the north end of the Warwick Road in Old Trafford.|$|E

5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, {{he and his team}} faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E

However, Dome built {{a much larger}} facility there. The facility was constructed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> bald prairie in the early 1970s.

25|$|An open (non-locking or {{otherwise}} traction-aided) differential always supplies close to equal torque to each side. To illustrate how this can limit torque {{applied to the}} driving wheels, imagine a simple rear-wheel drive vehicle, with one rear roadwheel on asphalt with good grip, and the other <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> slippery ice. It takes very little torque to spin the side on slippery ice, and because a differential splits torque equally to each side, the torque that {{is applied to the}} side that is on asphalt is limited to this amount.|$|E
25|$|A mass fall {{occurred}} as the climbers began the traverse. George Bell slipped and fell <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> hard ice, pulling off his rope-mate Tony Streather. As they fell their rope became tangled with those connecting Houston, Bates, Gilkey and Molenaar, pulling all these climbers off as well. Finally the strain came onto Pete Schoening, {{who had been}} belaying Gilkey and Molenaar. Quickly wrapping the rope around his shoulders and ice axe, Schoening held all six climbers, {{some of whom had}} by that point fallen over 100m. Had he not done so, the entire team, apart from Craig who was unroped, would have fallen around 2000m to the Godwin-Austen Glacier.|$|E

25|$|Shortly before Lugosi's {{death in}} August 1956, {{he had been}} working with Wood on {{numerous}} half-realized projects, variously titled Tomb of the Vampire or The Ghoul Goes West. Scenes unconnected to Plan 9, featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking {{in and out of the}} side door of the Johnson home at nighttime, and a daylight scene <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> scrub land near a highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself and walking back the way he came, had been shot. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects. It is not certain for which projects the Lugosi footage was intended, and Wood's own account of the affair in his written memoirs seems to suggest that the director had something like Plan 9 in mind when the material was filmed. This claim stands in apparent contradiction to the Vampires' Tomb/Ghoul Goes West theory, backed up by a comment Lugosi made about Ghoul being his next project in a filmed interview upon his release from drug rehabilitation.|$|E

He missed three weeks of spring training, and began the season on the disabled list. Washington said: [...] "We miss his presence. We miss his threat. We miss what he brings on the defensive end. We miss his leadership." [...] He made his initial 2010 appearance on April 30, after having missed the first 20 games of the season.|$|E
500|$|In October 2005 a {{group of}} {{students}} from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a [...] wooden ship at a range of around 100feet (30m). Flames broke out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show MythBusters, using a wooden fishing boat in San Francisco as the target. Again some charring occurred, along {{with a small amount of}} flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its autoignition temperature, which is around 300°C (570°F).|$|E
