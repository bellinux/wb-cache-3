5|$|Cagney made a rare TV {{appearance}} in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem into the story. They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use <b>of</b> <b>fight</b> clips from Cagney's boxing movie Winner Take All (1932), {{despite the fact that}} the TV movie is about an entirely different character.|$|E
5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type <b>of</b> <b>fight</b> raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, {{it can also be}} a gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E
5|$|Ziskin {{initially}} considered hiring Buck Henry {{to write}} the adaptation, finding Fight Club similar to the 1967 film The Graduate, which Henry had adapted. When a new screenwriter, Jim Uhls, lobbied Donen and Bell for the job, the producers chose him over Henry. Bell contacted four directors to direct the film. He considered Peter Jackson the best choice, but Jackson was too busy filming the 1996 film The Frighteners in New Zealand. Bryan Singer received the book but did not read it. Danny Boyle met with Bell and read the book, but he pursued another film. David Fincher, who had read Fight Club and had tried to buy the rights himself, talked with Ziskin about directing the film. He hesitated to accept the assignment with 20th Century Fox at first because he had an unpleasant experience directing the 1992 film Alien 3 for the studio. To repair {{his relationship with the}} studio, he met with Ziskin and studio head Bill Mechanic. In August 1997, 20th Century Fox announced that Fincher would direct the film adaptation <b>of</b> <b>Fight</b> Club.|$|E

25|$|The Matrix had {{a strong}} effect on action film-making in Hollywood. The film's {{incorporation}} of wire fu techniques, including the involvement <b>of</b> <b>fight</b> choreographer Yuen Woo-ping and other personnel with a background in Hong Kong action cinema, affected the approaches to fight scenes taken by subsequent Hollywood action films, moving them towards more Eastern approaches. The success of The Matrix created high demand for those choreographers and their techniques from other filmmakers, who wanted fights of similar sophistication: for example, wire work was employed in X-Men (2000) and Charlie's Angels (2000), and Yuen Woo-ping's brother Yuen Cheung-Yan was choreographer on Daredevil (2003). The Matrixs Asian approach to action scenes also created an audience for Asian action films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) {{that they might not}} otherwise have had.|$|E

50|$|The Art <b>of</b> <b>Fighting</b> series {{originally}} {{served as}} a prequel to the Fatal Fury series, taking place during the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The Hyper Neo-Geo 64 game Buriki One and the PlayStation port of Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition features an older modern-day Ryo adopting his father's former identity of Mr. Karate.

25|$|The Castilian fleet {{divided and}} part of the ships headed to the Llobregat river to get water. There they were confronted by many peasants of Barcelona and Sant Boi, and Peter I reorganized his forces and sailed to Ibiza, where he placed its castle under siege.

Relieving the island, the Castilian army left the siege and reembarked. Though he had numerical advantage, Peter I chose not to join the battle and withdrew. He was pursued by 15 or 20 galleys under Bernat de Cabrera. This force then anchored at the Denia estuary.
