5|$|Hypertrophic scars are uncommon, and are {{characterized}} by increased collagen content after the abnormal healing response. They are described as firm and raised from the skin. Hypertrophic scars remain within the original margins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound,</b> whereas keloid scars can form scar tissue outside of these borders. Keloid scars from acne occur more often in men and people with darker skin, and usually occur on {{the trunk of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|PVSJ 407, a Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, had a pit in a skull bone {{attributed}} by Paul Sereno and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits {{occurred on}} the splenial. The areas around these pits are swollen and porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound,</b> {{it is likely that}} they were obtained in a fight with another Herrerasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E

50|$|The American {{casualty}} report stated 25 killed and 50 wounded; all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wounded</b> being among <b>the</b> prisoners, who numbered 23 officers and 489 enlisted men.

50|$|During the Korean War, Army nurses would {{once again}} treat <b>the</b> <b>wounded.</b> Nurses would staff MASH units and {{standard}} emplaced hospitals in Japan and Korea. Nurses were on <b>the</b> forefront <b>of</b> battlefield medicine during the conflict, playing {{a major role}} in <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wounded</b> U.N. forces within mere minutes or hours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wounds</b> being inflicted.|$|R
5|$|In {{some parts}} of the world (mainly Africa and South America), large ants, {{especially}} army ants, are used as surgical sutures. The wound is pressed together and ants are applied along it. The ant seizes the edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> in its mandibles and locks in place. The body is then cut off and the head and mandibles remain in place to close the wound. The large heads of the dinergates (soldiers) of the leafcutting ant Atta cephalotes are also used by native surgeons in closing wounds.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 1943, the 32nd Infantry Regiment {{was pinned}} down by enemy {{fire in the}} {{vicinity}} of Fish Hook Ridge, in the Aleutian Islands. On his own account, Martinez led two assaults, firing into the Japanese foxholes and occasionally stopping to urge on his comrades. His example inspired the men of his unit to follow. Martinez {{was shot in the head}} as he approached one final foxhole after the second assault, dying <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> the following day. Because of his actions the pass was taken, and its capture was an important preliminary to the end of organized hostile resistance. Martinez was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|Strachwitz was {{promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) of the Reserves on 1 January 1942. He had left the Eastern Front {{at the end of}} November 1941, returning home to receive treatment for the numerous injuries he had sustained over the year. From 1 December 1941 – 9 January 1942 he stayed at hospitals in Opplen and Breslau. He then went on an extended leave, staying in Groß Stein and Alt Siedel, before returning to the Eastern Front in mid-March 1942. He received the 1939 version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wound</b> Badge in Silver on 17 March 1942.|$|E

5|$|When he {{examined}} Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds {{from a single}} shotgun blast {{on the right side}} under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about four inches across. The nature and location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported.|$|E
5|$|Though usually {{opposing}} {{each other}} in their reporting of events, reporting by both the Epitaph and the Nugget initially supported the lawmen's version of events. Woods, the publisher of the pro-Cowboy Nugget, was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The Nugget staff had a close relationship with Sheriff Behan, but Rule's story, as printed in the Nugget the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps' version of events. This varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony. Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the Nugget after that day supported Behan's and the Cowboys' view of events. Other stories in the Epitaph countered the Nuggets later view entirely and supported the lawmen. In addition, Dr. George Goodfellow, who examined the Cowboys after their death, told the court that the angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> in Billy Clanton's wrist indicated that his hands could not have been in the air, or holding his coats open by the lapels, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified.|$|E

25|$|Wound dehiscence, the {{bursting}} of {{a surgical}} wound {{at the line}} of closure sutures, is a medical complication resulting from the poor healing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b> Unless wound dehiscence aesthetically compromises the breast-lift outcome, it is managed conservatively.|$|E
25|$|Using a 20mm {{calliper}} as a protractor—one tip at {{the apex}} of the wound—the surgeon delineates two semi-circles, an inner semi-circle, and an outer semi-circle. The outer semi-circle defines the necessary length of the two lobes of the skin flap. The inner semi-circle bisects the center of the original wound, and continues across the donor skin, establishing limit measure of the pedicle common to the two lobes of the flap. The surgeon then draws two lines from the apex of the wound; the first line drawn is at an angle of 45 degrees from the long axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound,</b> and the second line drawn is at a 90-degree angle from the axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b> The two (2) lines delineate the central axes of the two lobes of the bilobed flap.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the flap is {{determined}} by placing an un-folded, un-stretched 4 × 4-inch gauze upon the wound, and with it measuring from the pedicle base to the distal (farthest) point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound.</b> This measure is the {{length of the}} central axis of the skin flap.|$|E

25|$|As with C. hominivorax, {{the first}} sign of an {{infestation}} is often the irritated surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound,</b> producing many of the same symptoms.

25|$|A nasal skin defect of {{less than}} 15nbsp&mm in {{diameter}} can be managed with a bilobed flap; the surgeon trims the edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wound</b> (defect) to match its dimensions (length, width, depth) to the natural curve at {{the border of the}} nasal tip.
