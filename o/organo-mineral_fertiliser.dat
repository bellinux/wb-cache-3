30|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of urea blended with brown coal as a fertiliser. We first sought to optimise the granulation and superheated steam drying of the urea-brown coal blend, before undertaking a series of soil-based experiments to compare the leaching, nitrous oxide emissions and plant uptake of N from urea-brown coal granules versus conventional urea fertiliser. This research provides proof of concept for further optimisation of <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> manufacture using readily available lignite resources.|$|E
30|$|Urea and BC was {{successfully}} blended, granulated and dried on a pilot scale. The granules formed were of an appropriate size for agricultural use, although the current formulation produces granules {{that are not}} strong enough for the handling requirements of a fertiliser. The N retention in the granules is close to that calculated theoretically for the formulation and is consistent for all the air drying and steam drying methods tested. The urea-BC granules significantly reduced the amount of nitrate and ammonium lost though leaching and also reduced the emission of nitrous oxides from the soil, whilst not reducing the plant available N. N losses were lower for the low N urea-BC formulation than for the high N formulation, emphasising the significant role of the brown coal in the N retention. This work provides a proof of concept for the pilot-scale production and use of BC blended <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> granules. Additional work is now necessary to characterise urea-BC granule behaviour in various soil types and under field conditions.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: <b>Organo-mineral</b> biochar <b>fertiliser</b> has the {{potential}} to replace conventional biochar and organic fertiliser to improve soil quality and increase plant photosynthesis. This study explored mechanisms involved in nitrogen (N) cycling in both soil and ginger plants (Zingiber officinale: Zingiberaceae) following different treatments including organic fertiliser, commercial bamboo biochar <b>fertiliser,</b> and <b>organo-mineral</b> biochar <b>fertiliser.</b> Materials and methods: Soil received four treatments including (1) commercial organic fertiliser (5 t ha− 1) as the control, (2) commercial bamboo biochar fertiliser (5 t ha− 1), (3) <b>organo-mineral</b> biochar <b>fertiliser</b> at a low rate (3 t ha− 1), and (4) <b>organo-mineral</b> biochar <b>fertiliser</b> at a high rate (7. 5 t ha− 1). C and N fractions of soil and plant, and gas exchange measurements were analysed. Results and discussion: Initially, <b>organo-mineral</b> biochar <b>fertiliser</b> applied at the low rate increased leaf N. <b>Organo-mineral</b> biochar <b>fertiliser</b> applied at the high rate significantly increased N use efficiency (NUE) of the aboveground biomass compared with other treatments and improved photosynthesis compared with the control. There was N fractionation during plant N uptake and assimilation since the 15 N enrichment between the root, leaf, and stem were significantly different from zero; however, treatments did not affect this N fractionation. Conclusions: <b>Organo-mineral</b> biochar <b>fertiliser</b> has agronomic advantages over inorganic and raw organic (manure-based) N fertiliser because it allows farmer to put high concentrations of nutrients into soil without restricting N availability, N uptake, and plant photosynthesis. We recommend applying the low rate of <b>organo-mineral</b> biochar <b>fertiliser</b> as a substitute for commercial organic fertiliser. © 2017 Springer-Verlag GmbH German...|$|R
30|$|There is {{therefore}} a strong reason to hypothesise that blending common mineral N fertilisers with organic materials as <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>fertilisers</b> could reduce off-site fertiliser N loss. To date, most controlled-release N fertilisers (CRFs) rely on polymer coatings that delay fertiliser release; higher-stability chemical fertilisers that take more time to solubilise; or granules coated or mixed with specific compounds that inhibit N transformation pathways, such as urease or nitrification inhibitors [9, 10]. Of the few studies investigating controlled-release <b>organo-mineral</b> N <b>fertilisers,</b> Richards et al. [11] showed that blending of commercial ammonium nitrate fertiliser with sphagnum peat reduced fertiliser nitrate leaching whilst still providing sufficient N {{for the growth of}} maize. More recently, Gonzalez et al. [12] found that urea formulated together with biochar slowed down the release of urea, but none of the biochar CRFs performed as well as a commercial CRF that did not contain biochar.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{fertilisers}} {{are generally}} applied {{by means of}} centrifugal disk spreaders. The machinery, the working conditions and the physical characteristics of fertilizers (including the aerodynamic characteristics of particles) may affect the behaviour of particles after the discarding from the spreader. We investigated the aerodynamic properties of <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>fertilisers</b> (a class of slow release fertilisers that are less investigated since they are relatively new in the market) using a vertical wind tunnel similar to an elutriator. In the same time, the morphological characteristics of individual fertilizer particles were measured {{by means of an}} image analysis procedure. In the study we compare six different fertilisers and we discuss the suitability of the employed methods. The results provide the terminal velocity – Vt – (the velocity value that overcome the gravity force of the particles) of the particles, ranging from 8. 60 to 9. 55 m s- 1, and the relationships between Vt and some physical properties (mass, shape, dimensions) of the fertilizers. Moreover, the results of field distribution trials show the behaviour of the tested fertilizers during practical use. Such data can contribute to enhance the quality of application of these products in field...|$|R
40|$|Biosolids {{were applied}} with urea {{to produce a}} {{granulated}} <b>organo-mineral</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (OMF) for ap-plication by farm fertiliser equipment {{to a range of}} agricultural crops. The recommended rates of nitrogen, phosphate and potash were calculated for the test crops using “The Fertiliser Manual”, which assesses the nutrient requirement based on previous cropping, rainfall and soil index. The OMF produced similar crop yields compared to ammonium nitrate fertiliser when applied as a top-dressing to winter wheat, forage maize and grass cut for silage in the cropping years 2010 to 2014. In 2012 the grain yield of spring barley top-dressed with OMF was significantly lower than the conventional fertiliser treatment, due to dry conditions following application. For this reason it is recommended that OMF is incorporated into the seedbed for spring sown crops and The Safe Sludge Matrix guidelines followed. The experimental work presented shows that OMF can be used in sustainable crop production systems as a source of nitrogen and phosphorus for a range of ag-ricultural crops...|$|E
40|$|Viabilidad técnica para la producción {{industrial}} de abonos y enmiendas orgánicas mediante compostaje de orujo de oliva de dos fases o "alperujo"Nowadays, {{the main}} concern for the Spanish olive oil industry is the disposal of the huge amounts (about 5 Mt in the last olive oil campaign, 2010 - 2011) of the two-phase olive-mill waste or “alperujo” (AL) that it produces. Here, we have studied the technical feasibility of using composting to transform AL into commercial organic amendments and fertilisers. For this, six piles of 20 t each, prepared by mixing AL and either poultry (PM) or sheep manure (SM), were composted. In addition, Fe and P-enriched acidic mineral amendments were added {{at the beginning of}} the process in order to reduce alkalinisation and nitrogen losses. As composting proceeded, substantial organic matter degradation, progressive humification, increases of pH and germination indices and decreases in fats and water-soluble organic fractions were detected. Also, the addition of the mineral amendments was effective with regard to reducing the pH, water-soluble organic carbon and polyphenols, hemicellulose fraction and nitrogen losses. According to the Spanish legislation for fertiliser production (PRE/ 630 / 2011), the composts obtained were suitable for preparing commercial organic amendments and fertilisers within categories such as AL Compost, Humic Organic Amendment, Compost Organic Amendment and NPK Organic Fertiliser. Also, by mixing with organic and/or mineral fertilisers, the composts were optimal substrates for the production of 19 types of <b>Organo-mineral</b> <b>Fertilisers,</b> either as solid or liquid formulations.

30|$|Importantly, the {{granulation}} of urea {{with brown}} coal did not reduce plant growth or {{the acquisition of}} N by plants in this limited six-week growth study (Fig.  7). In a similar study evaluating <b>organo-mineral</b> N <b>fertilisers,</b> Richards et al. [11] found that blending urea or ammonium nitrate fertiliser with peat reduced total N uptake by 9.1  % in three successive, 6 -week corn crops grown under glasshouse conditions. However, under field conditions they found {{no significant differences in}} yield or N uptake by corn grown with conventional ammonium nitrate fertiliser or peat-blended ammonium nitrate. In our study, the short-time frame of the trial probably masked any potential effects, as evidenced by the minor differences between N-fertilised treatments and controls not receiving N fertiliser. In addition, we did not measure ammonia volatilisation during these experiments. Ammonia volatilisation can represent a significant N loss pathway from the plant/soil system, particularly in alkaline soils [1]. More work is therefore needed to extend the duration and scale of the plant growth experiments, together with additional measurements of potential N loss through ammonia volatilisation.|$|R
40|$|The age-old {{need to make}} soils more {{productive}} and yet, at the same time, more sustainable was the core of debate at an expert group meeting held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, from 26 to 30 July 1999. The problems and prospects of using fertilisers, and of the chemical degradation of soil caused by traditional cultivation, were {{at the heart of}} the discussions. Moving beyond the obvious effects of injudicious fertiliser use on the environment, the group examined how to make progress in the search for organic nitrogenous fertilisers, such as waste products, and how to study the efficacy of some <b>organo-minerals</b> as <b>fertilisers,</b> taking into account the environmental effects of the heavy metals in them. Among the recommendations were the need for more training and incentives in fertiliser management, applications of local resources as fertilisers, and studies on new bio-fertiliser materials such as Azolla and water hyacinth. Almost thirty scientists from South Africa, Mauritius, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Nigeria and international institutions attended the meeting, which was funded by the Organisation of African Unity and FAO, and organised in collaboration with the African Soil Science Society.
