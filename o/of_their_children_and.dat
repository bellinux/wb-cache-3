We examined fMRI brain activation patterns as mothers viewed images <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own <b>child</b> <b>and</b> dog <b>and</b> an unfamiliar <b>child</b> <b>and</b> dog. There {{was a common}} network of brain regions involved in emotion, reward, affiliation, visual processing and social cognition when mothers viewed images <b>of</b> both <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> dog. Viewing images <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> resulted in brain activity in the midbrain (ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra involved in reward/affiliation), while a more posterior cortical brain activation pattern involving fusiform gyrus (visual processing of faces and social cognition) characterized a mother's response to her dog. Mothers also rated images <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> dog as eliciting similar levels of excitement (arousal) and pleasantness (valence), although {{the difference in the}} own vs. unfamiliar child comparison was larger than the own vs. unfamiliar dog comparison for arousal. Valence ratings <b>of</b> <b>their</b> dog were also positively correlated with ratings of the attachment to their dog. Although there are similarities in the perceived emotional experience and brain function associated with the mother-child and mother-dog bond, there are also key differences that may reflect variance in the evolutionary course and function of these relationships...|$|R

Aquinas asserted that the children of a slave mother were rightly enslaved even though they themselves had not committed personal sin.

25|$|The {{higher rates}} of {{autoimmune}} diseases due {{to the presence of}} maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and whether or not microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well is unknown. Women often also have a few cells genetically identical to that <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> some people also have some cells genetically identical to that of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).|$|E

25|$|Non-fraternal {{polyandry}} {{occurs when}} the wives' husbands are unrelated, as among the Nayar tribe of India. It happens sparsely among tribes in separate worldwide locations. In this case, a woman undergoes a ritual marriage before puberty, and he is acknowledged {{as the father of}} all her children. She, however, may never cohabit with him, taking multiple lovers instead; these men must acknowledge the paternity <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> (<b>and</b> hence demonstrate that no caste prohibitions have been breached) by paying the midwife. The women remain in their maternal home, living with their brothers, and property is passed matrilineally.

25|$|Horizontal {{segregation}} {{refers to}} differences {{in the number of}} people of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to be men are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.|$|E

Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> in 1985 they became responsible for each other’s debts.|$|E

40|$|Children {{who have}} parents {{with a drug}} {{addiction}} is the main issue in this paper. The importance of early intervention and further research into the topic of childhood-at-risk due to parental and family problems are also relevant. In this study the population is related with numerous high-risk factors and a vulnerability to disorganized attachment. The {{purpose of this study}} is to look into the parents’ representations <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> the parentchild relationship. A qualitative research interwiew is used. Parents are interviewed about their inner working model of the child after minimum six months in parent-infant treatment. One must take into consideration that the population consist of only four informants. This makes it difficult to generalize. There is a reason to believe that the representations of the <b>child</b> <b>and</b> the parent-child relationship can have a tendency to variations. The mentalizing perspective is an important part of the theoretical framework in the context where the parents <b>and</b> <b>children</b> live for a period <b>of</b> <b>their</b> life. This perspective has relevance for the caregiver to establish a secure attachment with the child. The study shows treatment in institution can give the parents a language and understanding related to <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> that doesn´t need to be internalised. On the other hand, the same language and understanding can provide the parents an opportunity to expand the representations <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> the parent-child relationship. </p...|$|R
