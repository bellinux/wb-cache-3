This is an epoxide-containing commercial polymethacrylic carrier with suitable characteristics for enzyme immobilization. The immobilized lipase suitable for pentyl octanoate synthesis has been prepared by a direct lipase binding to polymers via their epoxide groups.

The performance and smoke results obtained from an electricity generator engine operating on WCOME showed that the smoke reduction, compared to that of conventional diesel fuel, was around 60 % for B 100 (100 % biodiesel) and around 25 % for B 20 (20 % biodiesel) (Cetinkaya and Karaosmanoglu 2005). Dorado et al. (2003) conducted an 8 -mode test using waste <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-stroke, three-cylinder, direct injection, 34  kW engine and results showed that 8.6 % reduction <b>in</b> CO 2, <b>a</b> 58.9 % reduction <b>in</b> CO and <b>a</b> 57.7 % reduction in SO 2 emissions. However, increases of 8.5 % and 32 % were observed in specific fuel consumption and NOx emissions, respectively. Murillo et al. (2007) tested a four-stroke diesel outboard engine running on conventional diesel, conventional diesel blended with 10 %, 30 % and 50 % biodiesel derived from WCOME and pure biodiesel. The biodiesel blends proved to be environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional diesel fuel. They noticed reductions in power of approximately 5 % with B 10 and B 30, and 8 % with B 50 and B 100. Despite the positive performance tendencies of WCOME mentioned above, contradictory results have also been reported. Lin et al. (2007) found sharp increases in both NOx and particulate emissions when WCOME was used.|$|R
50|$|Agliata is {{prepared}} with crushed garlic, <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> bread crumbs, vinegar, salt and pepper. The bread crumbs are soaked in vinegar, {{which is then}} squeezed out, after which the garlic is whisked or beaten into the mixture. Its preparation includes the emulsion of the ingredients to prevent separation, which is performed by the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> being added <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slow drizzle while the mixture is constantly whisked. It generally accompanies broiled or boiled meat, fish and vegetables.|$|R
