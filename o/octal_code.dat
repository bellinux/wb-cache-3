40|$|This study {{constitutes}} a {{first attempt to}} describe the genetic population structure and drug resistance of the tubercle bacilli circulating in Saudi Arabia. A total of 1, 505 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, isolated between 2002 and 2005 from seven regions of Saudi Arabia, were studied. The sample studied showed a male-to-female sex ratio of 1. 27, {{with half of the}} cases among foreign-born individuals and 47 % within the 21 - to 40 -year-old age group; a total resistance rate of 19. 7 %; and multiple drug resistance of 4. 5 %. Upon spoligotyping, a total of 387 individual patterns were obtained (clustering rate, 86. 4 %; 182 clusters containing between 2 and 130 isolates per cluster). A total of 94 % of the strains matched the spoligotype patterns in an international database. Nearly 81 % of the isolates in this study belonged to established phylogeographic clades: Central Asian (CAS), 22. 5 %; ill-defined T clade, 19. 5 %; East African-Indian (EAI), 13. 5 %; Haarlem, 7. 5 %; Latin American-Mediterranean, 7. 2 %; Beijing, 4. 4 %; Manu, 2. 7 %; X, 0. 9 %; and Bovis, 0. 9 %. Two clonal complexes with unique spoligotyping signatures (<b>octal</b> <b>codes</b> 703777707770371 and 467777377413771) specific to Saudi Arabia were identified. These belonged to the CAS and EAI clades, respectively, as confirmed upon secondary typing using mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRUs). The results obtained underline the predominance of historic clones of principal genetic group 1, which are responsible for roughly 45 % of all tuberculosis cases in Saudi Arabia. The high rate of clustering observed might be an indication of rapid ongoing transmission within certain communities and/or subpopulations in Saudi Arabia; nonetheless, spoligotyping is known to overestimate clustering, and only a systematic second-line typing, such as MIRUs, coupled with a better tuberculosis registry and epidemiological investigations would allow us to know the exact rate of ongoing transmission and associated risk factors in Saudi Arabia...|$|R

40|$|Universal metric {{properties}} of the genetic code (i. e. RNA, DNA and protein coding) are defined {{by means of the}} nucleotide base representation on the square with vertices U or T = 00, C = 01, G = 10 and A = 11. It is shown that this notation defines the Canter set and Smale horseshoe map representation of the genetic code, the classic table arrangement and Siemion one-step mutation ring of the code. Gray code solutions to the problem of defining codon positions on the [0, 1] interval, and an extension to the <b>octal</b> <b>coding</b> system, based on the linear block triple check code, are given. This result enables short block (word) decoding of the genetic code patterns. The block code is related to the minimization of errors during transcription and translation processes, which implies that the genetic code is error-correcting and not degenerate. Two algorithms for the representation of codons on the [0, 1] interval and the related binary trees are discussed. It is concluded that the ternary Canter set algorithm is the method of choice for this type of analysis and coding. This procedure enables the analysis of the six dimensional hypercube codon positions by means of a simple time series and/or 'logistic' difference equation. Finally, a unified concept of the genetic code linked to the Canter set and horseshoe map is introduced {{in the form of a}} classic combinatorial 4 colour necklace model with three horizontal frames consisting of 64 coloured pearls (bases) and vertically hanging decorations of triplets (codons). Three horizontal necklace frames define Crick's code without comma, and vertical necklace decorations define the evolutional code. Thus, the type of the code depends on the level or direction of observation. The exact location of the mRNA and complementary DNA coding groups of triplets within a frame is determined. The latter enables decoding of long code block (language) patterns within the genetic code. This method of genetic code analysis is named Symbolic Canter Algorithm (SCA). The validity of the method was confirmed by 94 % accurate classification of 50 proteins of known secondary structure (25 alpha -helices and 25 beta -sheets) with the C 5. 0 machine learning system. Nucleotide strings of proteins transcribed by SCA were used for the analysis.

40|$|Micro-ID is {{a system}} {{designed}} to identify the Enterobacteriaceae by utilizing reagent-impregnated disks for 15 biochemical tests. Since its initial evaluations, the system has undergone modification in formulation and in its computer data base.

Each laboratory also exchanged 50 cultures to test the system's reproducibility. Micro-ID correctly identified 142 (98 %) of the common clinical isolates and 123 (76 %) of the unusual or atypical organisms.

When the common tests of Micro-ID and API 20 E were compared with conventional tube media, we found that the tests in the Micro-ID performed as well as or better than those of the API 20 E. Certain groups of organisms, i. e., Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Proteus, Salmonella, and Serratia genera, were found to give low correlation on certain common tests.

Actually, in Section ‘Performance of APSK in multipath scenarios’, simulations considering the use of turbo channel codes[28] will be presented. In such case, the encoder of a binary turbo code is added at the TX, before the bit to symbol mapping (i.e., according to a “pragmatic” approach), while, at the RX, a decoder based on the BCJR algorithm is inserted after the decision device. The turbo code we consider is that included in the UMTS standard[29]. It is composed of two recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) encoders with constraint length 4, concatenated in parallel. The feedforward generator is 15 and the feedback generator is 13 (in <b>octal</b> notation). The <b>code</b> bits for the two encoders are alternatively punctured to achieve the desired code rate R = 1 / 2. Decoding has been implemented in MatlabⒸ, by using the algorithm presented in[30].

30|$|The {{simulations}} {{are performed}} for coded MIMO-CDMA systems that employ parity bit selected and permutation spreading. In the transmitter, at first, the data bits are encoded by a 1 / 2 rate convolutional encoder with the constraint length of 5 and the generators of 23 and 35 in <b>octal</b> notation. The <b>coded</b> bits are randomly interleaved and serial-to-parallel converted such that 4 parallel coded bits are transmitted simultaneously on 4 transmit antennas. Depending on the spreading code selection technique, a message vector of length 4 {{is used to}} choose spreading waveforms for transmit antennas. If parity bit selected technique is used, using (2), depending on the coset the message vector comes from, a spreading waveform is selected {{to be used by}} all transmit antennas. In the case of MIMO-CDMA system with permutation spreading, the message vector follows Table 1 to select permutation of spreading waveforms for each transmit antenna. The channel is modeled as a slowly-varying, frequency-nonselective, Rayleigh fading channel, where the channel gains of different transmit-receive links are uncorrelated. We assume that perfect channel estimation is available at the receiver without a power penalty. We consider MIMO-CDMA systems with four transmit antennas and four or one receive antennas.|$|R

Comparison tables, rather than simple percentage agreement tables, were generated to define the particular strengths and weaknesses of each system and allow the laboratory to best use the data. The MICRO-ID compared quite favorably with conventional media. MICRO-ID yielded incorrect identifications with 1. 5 % of the isolates tested (API 20 E, 4. 7 % misidentification rate). Half the MICRO-ID misidentifications occurred when the system identified a Citrobacter diversus as a lysine-negative Escherichia coli; all gave one octal number. A direct comparison of the MICRO-ID and API 20 E was of limited value because percentage agreements were merely the sums of the errors of each.
