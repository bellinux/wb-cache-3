5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic thinking. The Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|In May 1582, {{letters from}} the Spanish {{ambassador}} in England, Bernardino de Mendoza, to contacts in Scotland were found on a messenger by Sir John Forster, who forwarded them to Walsingham. The letters indicated a conspiracy among the Catholic powers to invade England and displace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots. By April 1583, Walsingham had a spy, identified as Giordano Bruno by author John Bossy, deployed in the French embassy in London. Walsingham's contact reported that Francis Throckmorton, a nephew of Walsingham's old friend Nicholas Throckmorton, had visited the ambassador, Michel de Castelnau. In November 1583, after six months <b>of</b> <b>surveillance,</b> Walsingham had Throckmorton arrested and then tortured to secure a confession—an admission of guilt that clearly implicated Mendoza. The Throckmorton plot called for an invasion of England along with a domestic uprising to liberate Mary, Queen of Scots, and depose Elizabeth. Throckmorton was executed in 1584 and Mendoza was expelled from England.|$|E

5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon that the idea of a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E

5|$|According to the indictment, {{the crime}} {{organization}} headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money-laundering {{business in the}} US from 2002 to 2006, processing {{tens of millions of}} dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel Trade Bank, through the “Jerusalem Gang′s” extortion of Ofer Maximov, that led to his sister Etti Alon′s embezzling 250 million shekel. The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States, who were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money. Yoram Elal, who has fled to Brazil, was responsible for special-operations. The activities have been documented in hundreds <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{compared}} the cost-effectiveness of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) programme <b>of</b> active <b>surveillance</b> plus decolonization {{with the current}} Veterans Health Administration (VHA) strategy <b>of</b> active <b>surveillance</b> alone, {{as well as a}} common strategy <b>of</b> no <b>surveillance.</b> A decision-analytical model was developed for an inpatient stay time horizon, using the VHA's perspective. Model inputs were taken from published literature where available, and supplemented with expert opinion when necessary. Effectiveness outcomes were hospital-acquired MRSA infections and deaths avoided. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed. In the base-case analysis, the strategy <b>of</b> active <b>surveillance</b> plus decolonization dominated (i. e. lower cost and greater effectiveness) both the comparison strategies <b>of</b> active <b>surveillance</b> and no surveillance. In addition, the active surveillance strategy dominated the strategy <b>of</b> no <b>surveillance.</b> One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that at low levels of direct benefit of decolonization (1 – 4 %), the strategy <b>of</b> active <b>surveillance</b> plus decolonization would no longer be dominant. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, active surveillance plus decolonization dominated both the other two strategies, and the active surveillance strategy dominated no <b>surveillance</b> in all <b>of</b> 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. These results provide a strong economic argument for adding an MRSA decolonization protocol to the current VHA active surveillance strategy...|$|R

5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea <b>of</b> <b>surveillance</b> cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} market surveillance from exchanges and securities commissions from twenty-five jurisdictions in North, Central and South America, Western and Eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia. Exchanges as SROs {{engage in a}} greater range <b>of</b> single-market <b>surveillance</b> <b>of</b> market manipulative practices than securities commissions, but the scope <b>of</b> cross-market <b>surveillance</b> activity is very similar among exchanges and securities commissions. Cross-market surveillance is more effective with information-sharing arrangements, and securities commissions {{are more likely to}} engage in information sharing than exchanges are. Relative to the scope <b>of</b> single-market <b>surveillance,</b> the scope <b>of</b> cross-market <b>surveillance</b> shows a stronger positive association with trading velocity, the number of listed companies, and market capitalization. The data also indicate that as at 2005, there is ample scope for jurisdictions to expand their cross-market surveillance and thereby stimulate investor confidence and trading activity.
