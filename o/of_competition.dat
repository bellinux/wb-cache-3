40|$|Today {{development}} of national tax systems takes {{place under the}} decisive influence <b>of</b> tax <b>competition.</b> That is why there is no necessity in developing of theoretical and methodical vehicle for studying this phenomenon. Topicality of this subject is conditioned {{by the fact that}} understanding of character and features <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> are impossible without determination of its types. The {{purpose of this article is}} to define types <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> under conditions <b>of</b> globalization of world economy. Definition of forms and types <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> is debatable in economics literature; therefore today general approach is absent. Besides in most cases scientists lack unified approach when selecting and examining descriptions <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> classifications. Often researchers make no difference between such concepts as "type" and "form" <b>of</b> tax <b>competition.</b> Authors offer logical communication chart for such categories as "maintenance", "form", "type", and on this basis necessity to examine tax <b>competition</b> as form <b>of</b> economic <b>competition</b> is grounded and it is proposed to identify certain displays <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> that have general signs as well as its types but not as forms. On the basis of analogies method in relation to the signs of classifications <b>of</b> economic <b>competition</b> and taking into account works of economists in the field <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> authors suggest classification of types <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> based on the list of entries in accordance with their functions and status; territory of action; particular branch sign; instruments; methods of competitive activities; on the objects of tax competition; actions of participants in accordance with which fourteen types <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> are selected. Practical application of this classification will be necessary for deep understanding of the phenomenon <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> in all its variety. The prospect of subsequent scientific researches in this direction is the detailed analysis of certain displays of types <b>of</b> tax <b>competition</b> in Ukraine...|$|R
