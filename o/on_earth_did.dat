25|$|The {{series was}} a major {{international}} success: it was sold to 100 territories and watched by an estimated audience of 500 million people worldwide. However, Life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>did</b> not generate the same revenue for the BBC as later Attenborough series because the Corporation signed away the American and European rights to their co-production partners, Warner Bros. and Reiner Moritz.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the first}} series was simply known as Journey Into Space, with the {{subtitle}} A Tale of the Future added by the Radio Times, {{but within the}} BBC it became known as Journey to the Moon. The series was set in 1965 (the year in which Chilton believed humans would first walk on the Moon), and was first broadcast in 1953–1954 on the BBC Light Programme, which later became BBC Radio 2. The series was originally intended to have 12 episodes (one source claims 8 episodes), and 5.1 million people tuned into the first episode, but the first four episodes (which took place <b>on</b> <b>Earth)</b> <b>did</b> not prove very popular, and the audience soon shrank to fewer than 4 million. But once the rocket set off for the Moon in episode 5, the audience reaction was much more favourable. The series was extended to 18 episodes, {{and by the time}} the final episode was broadcast, 8 million people were tuning in.|$|E

500|$|For the game's cover, Acclaim hired Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni to pose as Kuros; Fabio was {{presented}} {{on the cover}} bare-chested and without armor. When Zippo Games saw {{the image of the}} cover a week prior to its release, they were perplexed. According to Ste Pickford, [...] "Our jaws hit the floor when we first saw this image (which was, being merely the developers, probably about a week before the game's release). Why <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>did</b> they choose a photograph of a bare-chested barbarian to promote a game starring a knight in shining armour?". Pickford added that [...] "We used it {{as an example of the}} lack of imagination of Americans", while suggesting that having an actual suit or armor would be too costly to use for a photo shoot. Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was released by Acclaim for the NES in North America in December1989 and in Europe and Australia in 1991. It managed to sell about 500,000 copies in North America and about 50,000 copies in Europe. Following the game's release, Zippo Games would proceed to develop its next game for Rare, they would eventually also release the third installment in the Wizards & Warriors series, [...]|$|E

2500|$|His work Cosmic Teachings of a Lama {{states that}} life <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>did</b> not occur through abiogenesis, but instead through pansperma. To Samael Aun Weor, the {{theories}} of abiogenesis {{are similar to those}} of spontaneous generation, and that Pasteur had already implicitly refuted the former when the latter was empirically disproved. Furthermore, while evolution is a verified fact of nature, speciation through Darwinian evolution has never been witnessed and is [...] "an absurd theory without basis or foundation." [...] Instead, the sum of zoological variation is determined by the seeds of life traveling throughout space (protected by electromagnetic [...] "whirlwinds") which determine the evolution and devolution of life on any planet. Life, according to Samael Aun Weor, is eternal, however its expression is divided into evolutive and devolutive modes: species evolve, reach a pinnacle, and necessarily devolve and return to a germinal state.|$|E
2500|$|Since its completion, the {{building}} has won a number of awards for architecture. In October 2004, the architect was awarded the 2004 RIBA Stirling Prize. For {{the first time in}} the prize's history, the judges were unanimous. In December 2005, a survey of the world's largest firms of architects published in 2006 BD World Architecture 200 voted the tower as the most admired new building in the world. However, Ken Shuttleworth, who worked for Foster and Partners on the design of {{the building}}, said in 2011 that he believed the style was now out-moded: [...] "I was looking at the glass all around and , 'Why <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> <b>did</b> we do that?' Now we would do things differently". The building featured in recent films such as Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Russell Crowe's A Good Year, Sharon Stone's Basic Instinct 2, and Woody Allen's Match Point and, rechristened the Spirit of London, became the spaceship centrepiece of Keith Mansfield's 2008 novel Johnny Mackintosh and the Spirit of London.|$|E
2500|$|Brooks – and the Sporting Times {{as a whole}} – had in {{any case}} a {{reputation}} {{as something of a}} joker. A story retold in a book of 1898 by one of the other journalists of Brooks' time recounts an incident when the newspaper was three columns short at the time of going to press [...] "and nobody was sober enough to attempt the task of writing them"; Brooks solved the problem by reprinting an entire article from the magazine Truth, merely adding the headline: [...] "How <b>on</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>Did</b> this Story get into the Columns of Truth?" [...] Following the publication of the memoirs of the theatrical impresario John Hollingshead in 1895, another journalist recounted an incident in which he and Brooks had successfully conned theatre tickets from Hollingshead. Some of Brooks' witticisms misfired. In 1886, the French actor/manager Marius {{was in charge of the}} Empire Theatre, which was owned by the Café Royal, and reacted badly when Brooks, in a review of a play at the Empire for a magazine called The Bat, suggested the Café Royal might have done better to employ Marius in his former profession of a waiter, rather than as a theatre manager. Marius claimed never to have been a waiter and sued for libel; Brooks took to the witness stand but the case was lost and Marius received £100 damages.|$|E
