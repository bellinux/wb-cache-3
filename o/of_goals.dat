In three studies, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that university freshmen’s ambivalence toward the <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> completing their degree mediates the effect <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> self-concordance on subjective well-being. In Studies 1 and 2, differences in goal ambivalence accounted for effects <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> self-concordance on concurrent life satisfaction and affect {{at the end of}} the freshman year. Study 3 evidenced a longitudinal mediation effect <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> ambivalence on 1 -year post-entry increases in life and study satisfaction, which were explained through perceptions <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> progress {{at the end of the}} freshman year. Decomposing self-concordance into autonomous and controlled motivation revealed non-redundant parallel effects for both subcomponents. These results point to ambivalence as a significant experience in goal pursuit and suggest that it represents an additional explanatory variable in the self-concordance model <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> striving and longitudinal well-being...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Medical and {{business}} {{are one of}} the most popular majors among students, and both fields require intensive training to reach certain level of expertise. During the development <b>of</b> professionalism, <b>goal</b> can become a crucial role in psychological impetus. The purpose of this study is to compare goal contents, goal characteristics, and effect <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> characteristics on student’s major satisfaction between medical {{and business}}. Methods: A total of 193 undergraduate students (97 medical students, 96 business students) answered survey questions including goal contents, goal characteristics (goal autonomy, goal attainability, social value <b>of</b> <b>goal)</b> and satisfaction on their majors. Qualitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> contents and quantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> characteristics, and their effects on student major satisfaction were performed. Results: Goal content analysis showed percentage <b>of</b> social concern <b>goal</b> was higher in medical students (25. 8 %) than business students (6. 3 %), whereas percentage <b>of</b> wealth <b>goal</b> was higher business students (24. 0 %) than medical students (3. 1 %). Among goal characteristics, goal attainability and social value <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> were higher in medical students than business students.

Conclusion: Goal contents and goal characteristics are different between medical and business students.

40|$|Procrastination, {{defined as}} the subjectively {{aversive}} inability to initiate or complete the pursuit <b>of</b> a given <b>goal,</b> is a common phenomenon in academic contexts. This theoretical paper presents a dynamic model that centers on the role <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> focus in influencing procrastination during goal pursuit. Our central hypothesis is that focusing on the means <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> pursuit (i. e., adopting a process focus) reduces procrastination, particularly when fear of failure is high. Focusing on the means should decrease the salience of performance outcomes and thereby reduce fear of failure. This, in turn, should facilitate the initiation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> pursuit. In contrast, when means are perceived as unpleasant (high task aversiveness), focusing more on the outcome <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> pursuit (i. e., adopting an outcome focus) should reduce procrastination by directing {{attention away from the}} means while highlighting the importance <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> achievement. Furthermore, the model takes account of dynamic contextual factors, particularly the distance to a given deadline...|$|R

40|$|Goal incongruence, {{both within}} organisations and between organisations {{operating}} in a network context, has long been acknowledged as an important influence on organisational behaviour. This work presents the findings from an ethnographic study <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> incongruence in a public service network located in the UK. The study develops a conceptual framework for defining and researching the extent and sources <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> incongruence within public service networks. The author defines incongruence as contradiction between goals, draws evidence from organizationally enacted behaviours and recognises distinctions between formal goals and the operative <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> network groups. Empirical evidence is used to evaluate two explanations <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> incongruence: that goal incongruence is produced {{by the nature of}} bureaucratic delegation (the hierarchical model) and that it is produced by professional difference (the horizontal model). The findings of the study indicate that bureaucratic delegation is the source <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> incongruence. However, several elements of the hierarchical model are questioned. The evidence does not support the orthodox view that incongruence between formal and operative goals increases as conceptions of desired ends are transmitted downward within hierarchies. The study finds that the operative <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> actors at the apex of the network were most highly incongruent with the formal <b>goals</b> <b>of</b> the network. Professional difference was not a source <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> incongruence. Indeed the study provided evidence that operational staff who exhibited different professional identities co-operated to integrate practice and reduce goal-incongruence. The study concludes that the application of the novel conceptual framework provides a more selective, detailed and convincing account <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> incongruence than those found in the recent literature. The sources <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> incongruence were hierarchical elites putting the resources of the network to their own purposes as social agents and hierarchically imposed systems of organisational obligation and performance control. Finally, the study suggests that evidence for interprofessional integration indicates that the role of peer groups in moderating goal incongruence is under-represented in theoretical and empirical accounts <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> incongruence...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to examine the role <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> {{commitment}} in goal-setting research. Despite Locke's (1968) specification that commitment to goals is a necessary condition for the effec-tiveness <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> setting, a majority of studies in this area have ignored goal commitment. In addition, results of studies that have examined the effects <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> commitment were typically inconsistent with conceptualization of commitment as a moderator. Building on past research, we have developed a model <b>of</b> the <b>goal</b> commitment process and then used it to reinterpret past goal-setting research. We show that the widely varying sizes of the effect <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> difficulty, conditional effects <b>of</b> <b>goal</b> difficulty, and inconsistent results with variables such as participation can largely be traced to main and inter-active effects of the variables specified by the model. The major finding emanating from the widespread research on goal setting is that difficult and specific goals lead to higher levels of performance than do easy or vague goals (Locke, Shaw, Saari, & Latham, 1981). There is some evidence to suggest, however, that one or more variables may act to moderate the relation between goal difficulty and task performance. First, the goal difficulty effect does not always result (e. g., Motowidto...|$|R
