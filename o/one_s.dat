5|$|On June 13, 2016, {{during its}} E3 2016 press conference, Microsoft {{unveiled}} Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S,</b> {{a revision of}} the original Xbox One hardware with a streamlined form factor. Its new casing is 40% smaller than the original design, and supports vertical orientation with a stand. The capacitive power and eject keys were replaced by physical buttons, the side USB port and controller sync button were moved {{to the front of}} the console, and its power supply is integrated into the console's casing rather than sitting externally. Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> requires a USB adapter to attach a Kinect sensor, as it no longer includes the proprietary port used on the original model. A free USB adapter was provided by Microsoft to Kinect owners who registered their ownership of Kinect and Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> online, but this promotion ended in March 2017. Although Microsoft stated that it would eventually bundle the adapter with standalone Kinect units, it is instead sold separately.|$|E
5|$|Since June 2017, games may be {{promoted}} with additional icons that denote compatibility with hardware enhancements found in newer Xbox One models, including support for high-dynamic-range (HDR) colors (on Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> and Xbox One X), native rendering at 4K resolution (Xbox One X), and specific optimizations for Xbox One X.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, Microsoft {{released}} a refreshed Xbox One model, Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S,</b> {{which has a}} streamlined design, native support for 4K video playback and upscaling, and HDR10 high-dynamic-range color. It was praised for its smaller size, its on-screen visual improvements, and its lack of an external power supply, but its regressions such as {{the lack of a}} native Kinect port were noted. A high-end model, Xbox One X, was unveiled in June 2017 for release in November, which features major hardware upgrades focused on enabling games to be rendered at 4K resolution.|$|E

5|$|Xbox One X's {{design is}} a {{revision}} of the Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> hardware, but further streamlined. It uses a system-on-chip (SoC) known as Scorpio Engine, which incorporates a 2.3GHz octa-core CPU, and a Radeon GPU with 40 Compute Units clocked at 1172MHz, generating 6 teraflops of graphical computing performance. It also includes 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, 9 GB of which is allocated to games. To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution, Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect GPU traces from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One. Scorpio Engine's CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One, but with a 31% increase in performance; the custom platform is unrelated to AMD's current Ryzen architecture. The console will feature a vapor chamber method of cooling for the SoC, and motherboards will be tailored to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage. The console will also support AMD's FreeSync technology on compatible displays.|$|E
25|$|St James' Park is spelt with James {{featuring}} <b>one</b> <b>s</b> and an apostrophe mark, as {{seen on the}} signage of the St James' Park steps {{outside the}} entrance to the stadium, and signage inside the adjacent Metro station. The use of an apostrophe is in contrast with the name of the Metro station itself, which is signed as St James Metro station, and with the street signs of the nearby St James Street and St James Terrace. Further, the use of <b>one</b> <b>s</b> and an apostrophe mark differs from the common convention of adding a second s to monosyllabic possessives ending in s, {{as is the case with}} the well-known public space in London: St. James's Park.|$|E
25|$|Jaguar is a {{microarchitecture}} codename for Bobcat's successor, {{released in}} 2013, {{that is used}} in various APUs from AMD aimed at the low-power/low-cost market. Jaguar and its derivates {{would go on to}} be used in the custom APUs of the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S,</b> and Xbox One X. Jaguar would be later followed by the Puma microarchitecture in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Microsoft ceased {{production}} of Xbox 360 HD DVD players while considering how its HDi and VC-1 technologies {{could be applied}} to other platforms. Microsoft's VC-1 codec is already in use in Blu-ray titles; Warner Bros. encodes the main features of all titles in the format but encodes supplements and bonus content in MPEG-2. Microsoft has since entered into talks with Sony regarding Blu-ray; although, Windows Vista has supported basic filesystem and shell functionality for both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD since launch, relying on third parties to implement movie playback. A Blu-ray drive was not released for the Xbox 360 but its successor, the Xbox One, features a built-in Blu-ray drive for movies and gaming, and the Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> supports Ultra HD Blu-ray for 4K playback.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, AMD's then CEO Rory Read began {{a program}} to offer semi-custom designs. Rather than AMD simply {{designing}} and offering a single product, potential customers could work with AMD to design a custom chip based on AMD's intellectual property. Customers pay a non-recurring engineering fee for design and development, and a purchase price for the resulting semi-custom products. In particular, AMD noted their unique position of offering both x86 and graphics intellectual property. These semi-custom designs would have design wins as the APUs in the Playstation 4 and Xbox One and the subsequent PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S,</b> and Xbox One X. Financially, these semi-custom products would represent {{a majority of the}} company's revenue in 2016. In November 2017, AMD and Intel announced that Intel would market a product, combining in a single package an Intel Core CPU, a semi-custom AMD Radeon GPU, and HBM2 memory.|$|E
500|$|Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> {{natively}} supports {{video output}} at 4K resolution, and {{high dynamic range}} (HDR) color using HDR10. 4K video can be played from supported streaming services and Ultra HD Blu-ray Disc, Games are upscaled from 1080p to 4K. Rod Fergusson, head of Microsoft's Gears of War studio The Coalition, stated that Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> also had upgraded CPU and GPU components, which were capable of providing more consistent performance in Gears of War 4 during graphics-intensive sequences than the previous hardware. While Xbox planning lead Albert Penello initially stated that the additional CPU and GPU access granted to developers for Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> is to enable HDR and would have [...] "literally no impact" [...] {{on the performance of}} games, games with dynamic resolution or uncapped frame rates can see increased performance due to higher GPU clock speed and ESRAM bandwidth. Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> also ships with a revision of the Xbox One controller, with textured grips and Bluetooth support.|$|E

500|$|Xbox One X will be {{released}} on November 7, 2017, with a 1TB model that will be priced at US$499. The Xbox One X has been {{said to be a}} competitor to the PlayStation 4 Pro, a hardware update of the PlayStation 4 released in late-2016 that similarly focuses on 4K gaming and improved virtual reality performance, although Phil Spencer stated that the PlayStation 4 Pro's competition is instead the Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S.</b> In October 2016, Penello stated that the performance advantage of the Xbox One X over the PS4 Pro would be [...] "obvious", noting that the PS4 Pro's GPU only had 4.2 teraflops of graphical computing performance in comparison to Microsoft's stated 6 teraflops. Some journalists thought that Microsoft's messaging and positioning of Scorpio alongside the release of the Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> were at odds with themselves and was [...] "confusing".|$|E
500|$|Dieter Bohn of The Verge {{praised the}} Xbox One S's revised design as being [...] "svelte and good-looking", noting its smaller form factor {{and the lack}} of power brick. The Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> was also praised for being the {{cheapest}} 4K-compatible Blu-ray Disc player on the market, but it was argued that consumers were [...] " [...] as eager to upgrade to 4K Blu-rays as they were to DVDs back in the day. Especially when 4K streaming boxes can be purchased for much less." [...] The lack of HDR-compatible games available on-launch was panned, as well as Microsoft's choice of the standard over Dolby Vision (which was the only HDR standard supported by the reviewer's 4K television). Bohn concluded that the Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its HDR and 4K support, but recommended that existing owners hold off until the release of Xbox One X in 2017.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{insights}} from narrative gerontology, narrative psychology, and narrative therapy to discuss spirituality {{in relation to}} aging.

It argues that coping with the changes and challenges of later life requires countering such foreclosure by developing “a good, strong story”. A process of “story-work ” is then elaborated whereby older adults can be assisted in expanding, examining, transforming, and eventually transcending the stories by which they live...|$|R

500|$|Nick Pino of TechRadar {{was mostly}} positive, {{considering}} the Xbox <b>One</b> <b>S</b> to be [...] "the pinnacle of what Microsoft {{set out to}} create three years ago", but noting regressions such as the lack of Kinect port (which was interpreted as being [...] "one last kick in the pants for all the gamers forced into buying the more expensive console bundle two short years ago"), {{and the lack of}} 4K content sources beyond Blu-ray, Netflix, and YouTube. Visual improvements were noted on games such as Fallout 4 and Rise of the Tomb Raider when upscaled to 4K. Concerns were shown that the revised hardware and HDR support would lead to fragmentation of Xbox One's ecosystem, as not all users will necessarily experience a game the same way.|$|E
500|$|On launch, Xbox One was {{available}} in a single retail configuration, which included the console with 500GB hard drive, one controller, and Kinect sensor.
