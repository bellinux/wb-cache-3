40|$|This paper {{refers to}} {{nitrogen}} removal optimization of an alternating oxidation ditch system {{through the use}} of a mathematical model and pilot testing. The pilot system where measurements have been made has a total volume of 120 m 3 and consists of two ditches operating in four phases during one cycle and performs carbon oxidation, nitrification, denitrification and settling. The mathematical model consists of one-dimensional mass balance (convection-dispersion) equations based on the IAWPRC ASM 1 model. After the calibration and verification of the model, simulation system performance was made. Optimization is achieved by testing <b>operational</b> <b>cycles</b> and phases with different time lengths. The limits of EU directive 91 / 271 for nitrogen removal have been used for comparison. The findings show that <b>operational</b> <b>cycles</b> with smaller time lengths can achieve higher nitrogen removals and that an ""equilibrium"" between phase time percentages in the whole cycle, for a given inflow, must be achieved. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

50|$|This <b>operational</b> <b>cycle</b> is a {{modification}} of the traditional expander cycle. In the bleed (or open) cycle, instead of routing heated propellant through the turbine and sending it back to be combusted, {{only a small portion}} of the propellant is heated and used to drive the turbine and is then bled off, being vented overboard without going through the combustion chamber. Bleeding off the turbine exhaust allows for a higher turbopump output by decreasing backpressure and maximizing the pressure drop through the turbine. Compared with a standard expander cycle, this leads to higher engine thrust at the cost of sacrificing some efficiency due to essentially wasting the bled propellant by not combusting it.|$|E
50|$|The <b>operational</b> <b>cycle</b> of {{the engine}} is {{somewhat}} similar to a conventional six-cylinder engine.

By the time the combustion was complete the pressure in the flame cans would be much higher, although the actual compression ratio is not specified. The hot gas then blew through a turbine to extract power, instead of forcing a piston to move. Although {{there would be some}} loss of charge during the burning period, and thus the design would be less efficient than the true Otto cycle, it would nevertheless be somewhat more efficient than a traditional jet engine, at the cost of some complexity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Production of {{heterologous}} {{proteins in}} the E. coli periplasm, {{or into the}} extracellular fluid has many advantages; therefore naturally occurring signal peptides are selected for proteins translocation. The {{aim of this study}} was the production in high yields of a recombinant pectin lyase that is efficiently secreted and the encapsulation of transformed E. coli cells for pectin degradation in a biotechnological process. Results The nucleotide sequence of Bacillus subtilis α-amylase's signal peptide was fused to the N-terminal of an heterologously expressed pectin lyase in E. coli BL 21 [DE 3]. Thus pectin lyase secretion was achieved into the extracellular growth medium. E. coli cells harboring the recombinant plasmid heterologously express pectin lyase to around 22 % of the total cellular proteins, as it was estimated by SDS-PAGE and image analysis. IPTG induces the heterologously expressed enzyme, which is initially distributed extracellularly (7 hour) and later on at the periplasmic (9 hours) or cytosolic fraction (20 hours). No pectin lyase activity was found in the membranes fraction and in the inclusion bodies. Encapsulation of the recombinant strains of E. coli in alginate or alginate/silica beads 1 : 5 showed that pectin lyase could degrade effectively its substrate, for at least ten <b>operational</b> <b>cycles.</b> Conclusion Secretion of an heterologously overexpressed pectin lyase in E. coli BL 21 [DE 3] was achieved in this study. For this purpose the signal peptide of α-amylase from B. subtilis was fused to the N-terminal domain of pectin lyase. Encapsulated E. coli BL 21 [DE 3] cells harboring pET 29 c/exPNL were used successfully for pectin degradation up to ten <b>operational</b> <b>cycles</b> indicating that under special conditions this might have biotechnological implementations. </p...|$|R

50|$|Because {{data can}} be {{measured}} under varying conditions, the ability to normalize the data becomes {{very important to the}} damage identification process. As it applies to SHM, data normalization is the process of separating changes in sensor reading caused by damage from those caused by varying operational and environmental conditions. One of the most common procedures is to normalize the measured responses by the measured inputs. When environmental or operational variability is an issue, the need can arise to normalize the data in some temporal fashion to facilitate the comparison of data measured at similar times of an environmental or <b>operational</b> <b>cycle.</b> Sources of variability in the data acquisition process and with the system being monitored need to be identified and minimized to the extent possible. In general, not all sources of variability can be eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary to make the appropriate measurements such that these sources can be statistically quantified. Variability can arise from changing environmental and test conditions, changes in the data reduction process, and unit-to-unit inconsistencies.|$|E

Each unit started with unknown degrees of initial degradation and manufacturing variation. The units were operating normally {{at the start of}} each time series, and developed a fault {{at some point during the}} series. The data set was further divided into training and testing subsets.
