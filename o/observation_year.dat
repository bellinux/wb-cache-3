In common {{with the rest of}} the organism, the brain reaches its finished structure only at maturity; and in proportion as its structure is unfinished, its actions are wanting in precision. Hence like the first movements and the first attempts at speech, the first perceptions and thoughts are extremely vague. As from a rudimentary eye, discerning only the difference between light and darkness, the progress is to an eye that distinguishes kinds and gradations of colour, and details of form, with the greatest exactness; so, the intellect as a whole and in each faculty, beginning with the rudest discriminations among objects and actions, advances towards discriminations of increasing nicety and distinctness. To this general law our educational course and methods must conform. It is not practicable, nor would it be desirable if practicable, to put precise ideas into the undeveloped mind. We may indeed at an early age communicate the verbal forms in which such ideas are wrapped up; and teachers, who habitually do this, suppose that when the verbal forms have been correctly learnt, the ideas which should fill them have been acquired. But a brief cross-examination of the pupil proves the contrary. It turns out either that the words have been committed to memory with little or no thought about their meaning, or else that the perception of their meaning which has been gained is a very cloudy one. Only as the multiplication of experiences gives materials for definite conceptions--only as <b>observation</b> <b>year</b> by year discloses the less conspicuous attributes which distinguish things and processes previously confounded together--only as each class of co-existences and sequences becomes familiar through the recurrence of cases coming under it--only as the various classes of relations get accurately marked off from each other by mutual limitation, can the exact definitions of advanced knowledge become truly comprehensible. Thus in education we must be content to set out with crude notions. These we must aim to make gradually clearer by facilitating the acquisition of experiences such as will correct, first their greatest errors, and afterwards their successively less marked errors. And the scientific formulæ must be given only as fast as the conceptions are perfected.|$|E

The aims of this study are to examine the effect of receiving going-concern audit opinion, the profitability of investment and financial risk on stock return in the Stock Exchange manufacturing company in the period of 2009. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling with the criteria (1) the companies are included in the group of manufacturing companies that issue financial statements every year and are listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) during the <b>observation</b> <b>year,</b> 2009, (2) The listed company has a stock price data in the IDX during the <b>observation</b> <b>year</b> 2009, (3) the financial statements have data associated with the study variables during the <b>observation</b> <b>year</b> 2009, and (4) the listed company does not have negative equity value during the <b>observation</b> <b>year</b> 2009.

Based on partial results only variable price earnings ratio (PER) and earnings per share (EPS), which has positive and significant impact on stock returns of manufacturing industries in BEI in 2009, because the significance is less than 0. 05. While receiving going concern audit opinion (GCO), return on investment (ROI), quick ratio (QR), and debt to total equity ratio (DER) had no significant effect on stock return. Simultaneously, the independent variable has effect on stock return.

To understand how increased CO 2 affects below-ground part of trees under varied soil condition, we investigated {{the responses of the}} fine root (diameter < 2 mm) dynamics of Japanese white birch (Betula platyphylla var. japonica) which was planted in 2010. The three-year-old birch seedlings were grown in four experimental treatments comprising two levels of CO 2, i. e., ambient: 380 - 390 and elevated: 500 mu mol mol(- 1), in combination with two kinds of soil: brown forest (BF) soil and volcanic ash (VA) soil which has few nutrients. The growth and turnover of fine roots were measured for 3 years (2011 - 2013) using the Mini-rhizotron. In the first <b>observation</b> <b>year,</b> live fine root length (standing crop) in BF soil was not affected by CO 2 treatment, but it was reduced by the elevated CO 2 from the second <b>observation</b> <b>year.</b> In VA soil, live fine root length was reduced by elevated CO 2 for all 3 years. Fine root turnover tended to decrease under elevated CO 2 compared with ambient in both soil types during the first and second observation years. Turnover of fine root production and mortality was also affected by the two factors, elevated CO 2 and different soil types. Median longevity of fine root increased under elevated CO 2, especially in VA soil at the beginning, and a shorter fine root lifespan appeared after 2 years of observation (2011 - 2012). These results suggest that elevated CO 2 does not consistently stimulate fine root turnover, particularly during the plant seedlings stage, as it may depend on {{the costs and benefits of}} constructing and retaining roots. Therefore, despite the other uncontrollable environment factors, carbon sequestration to the root system may be varied by CO 2 treatment period, soil type and plant age...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of symptomatic intracranial aneurysms (IAs) and ischaemic stroke (IS) in PXE. METHODS: The records of 100 patients with PXE were retrieved. All patients were contacted and data on complications were collected. The literature was reviewed regarding PXE, ISs, and IAs. RESULTS: No patient with PXE had a symptomatic IA as presenting symptom. One patient presented with an IS. During follow-up of 94 of the 100 patients (mean follow-up 17. 1 years, range 1 - 49 years), none presented a symptomatic IA (3, 168 retrospective patient <b>observation</b> <b>years</b> and 1, 602 prospective patient <b>observation</b> <b>years).</b> Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage during follow-up occurred in 17 patients, in 1 patient during aspirin use. One patient has IS as presenting symptom and a recurrence during follow-up, and 7 patients had IS during follow-up. All were caused by small-vessel disease. The relative risk of IS in PXE under 65 years compared with the general population was 3. 6 (95 % confidence interval 3. 3 - 4. 0). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the currently available data, an association between symptomatic IAs and PXE is unlikely. However, the incidence of IS, due to small-vessel disease, was increased. Antiplatelet therapy in patients with PXE may lead to a high incidence of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In many {{petroleum}} basins, {{and especially}} in more mature areas, most reserve additions consist of the growth over time of prior discoveries, a phenomenon termed reserve appreciation. This paper concerns crude oil reserve appreciation in both the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. It examines the change in reserves attributed to North Sea fields over time, seeking to reveal patterns of reserve appreciation both for individual fields and for groups of fields classified by potentially relevant common elements. These include field size, year of production start-up, geological age, gravity, depth and depletion rate. The paper emphasises the statistical analysis of reserve appreciation. It contrasts the Norwegian and UK experience. An important distinction is drawn between appreciation of oil-in-place and changes in recovery factors. North Sea oil reserve appreciation between production start-up and the last <b>observation</b> <b>year</b> (usually 1996) {{is found to be}} substantial, but it generally lacks a consistent profile.
