5000|$|The Trangia stove is {{a popular}} {{commercial}} alcohol stove, which is available in many different models, from a single bare burner to an integrated expedition cooking system. Some of these come with a sealing cover, allowing the burner to be packed while still containing fuel, although putting the lid on while the stove is hot can damage the <b>O</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> (hence it may leak in transit). An even simpler system is the Sterno heater, in which the can that contains a jellied fuel also serves as the burner. Homemade beverage can stoves (or [...] "Pepsi can stoves") are similar. These are made from discarded aluminium beverage cans, and come {{in a wide variety}} of different designs.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{its release}} {{the engine was}} noted {{as one of the}} best diesel engines (for cars and light vans) in the world with its high power output and {{refinement}} it made all other diesel engines seem agricultural. [...] It was also particularly light, with a ready-to-run XUD9 weighing 157 kg, 15% less than a comparable diesel of the previous generation. However, if the cooling system is neglected or improperly bled after filling - needing a raised filling level because the expansion tank is not the highest point in the system - the engine has a tendency to blow its head gasket. A simple solution is to use a plastic soft drink bottle with the bottom removed, fitted with a rubber <b>O</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> on the flange at the cap end for filling. Because radiators (typical life 100,000 miles), generally have only just sufficient cooling capacity when new, in order to help get the engine to operating temperature quickly, silting causes significant problems. Coolant changes to maintain corrosion inhibitors (and stop silting) are critical on this engine. Nonetheless due to the high volume of cars manufactured with this engine spare parts are plentiful and well priced.|$|E

50|$|As {{well as a}} lubricant, {{vacuum grease}} is also used as a sealant for joints in vacuum systems. This is usually limited to soft vacuums, as ultra high vacuum or high {{temperatures}} may give problems with the grease outgassing. Grease is most commonly used with glass vacuum systems. All metal systems usually use knife-edge seals in soft metals instead. Where <b>O</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seals</b> are used, these should not be greased (in static seals at least) as it can cause the <b>O</b> <b>rings</b> to become permanently distorted when compressed.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the many}} design {{challenges}} of this project is predicting the thermal effects due to the environment inside the vacuum chamber on the turntable and spin motor spindle assembly. The objective {{of the study is}} to model the spin motor using the computer program System Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer (SINDA). By formulating the appropriate input information concerning the motor's geometry, coolant flow path, material composition, and bearing and motor winding characteristics, SINDA should predict temperatures at various predefined nodes. From these temperatures, hopefully, one can predict if the coolant flow rate is sufficient or if certain mechanical elements such as bearings, <b>O</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seals,</b> or motor windings will exceed maximum design temperatures...|$|R
50|$|Screw jacks {{have now}} largely been {{replaced}} by hydraulic jacks. This was encouraged in 1858 when jacks by the Tangye company to Bramah's hydraulic press concept were applied to the successful launching of Brunel's , after two failed attempts by other means. The maximum mechanical advantage possible for a hydraulic jack is not limited by the limitations on screw jacks and can be far greater. After World War II, improvements to the grinding of hydraulic rams {{and the use of}} <b>O</b> <b>ring</b> <b>seals</b> reduced the price of low-cost hydraulic jacks and they became widespread for use with domestic cars. Screw jacks still remain for minimal cost applications, such as the little-used tyre-changing jacks supplied with cars.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{continuing}} effort to develop improved <b>O</b> <b>rings</b> for <b>sealing</b> joints in solid-fuel rocket motors. Following an approach based on the lessons learned in {{the explosion of the}} space shuttle Challenger, investigators have been seeking O-ring materials that exhibit adequate resilience for effective sealing over a broad temperature range: What are desired are <b>O</b> <b>rings</b> that expand far and fast enough to maintain seals, even when metal sealing surfaces at a joint move slightly away from each other shortly after ignition and the motor was exposed to cold weather before ignition. Other qualities desired of the improved <b>O</b> <b>rings</b> include adequate resistance to ablation by hot rocket gases and resistance to swelling when exposed to hydrocarbon-based greases used to protect some motor components against corrosion. Five rubber formulations two based on a fluorosilicone polymer and three based on copolymers of epichlorohydrin with ethylene oxide were tested as candidate O-ring materials. Of these, one of the epichlorohydrin/ethylene oxide formulations was found to offer the closest to the desired combination of properties and was selected for further evaluation...|$|R

The measured data includes leakage, attitude angle, eccentricity ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping, and inertia. When the floating <b>ring</b> <b>seals</b> are locked up, the eccentricity ratio of the smooth surface floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> is {{lower than that of}} the damper floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal.</b> The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds. The damping coefficients of the damper floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> are higher than those of the floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal.</b> Whirl frequency ratios of the floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> are lower than the damper floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> with high eccentricity ratio at low operating speed range.

40|$|Floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> with bump foil(BFRS) was newly {{proposed}} and tested. BFRS {{which has a}} thickness of bump (0. 076, 0. 1 and 0. 12 mm) are separately tested for pressure-drops of 3. 0, 5. 0 and 7. 0 MPa and rotor-speed up to 24, 800 rpm. The measured data included leakage performance, attitude angle, lock-up eccentric ratio, and rotordynamic coefficients such as stiffness, damping and equivalent whirl frequency ratio to decide the whirling stability of seal were compared with floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal.</b> When the thickness of bump floating <b>ring</b> <b>seals</b> is increasing, leakage flow rate somewhat increases. Also, the lock-up eccentric ratio of the bump floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> with large thickness is {{lower than that of}} the floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> or small thickness of bump foil. The attitude angle increases linearly with the operating speeds in both cases. The direct damping coefficients increase significantly with the increments in bump-foil thickness and hydrostatic pressure-drop, but diminish with the rising rotor-speed. Especially, Coulomb friction damping force between the bump foil and housing surface contributes to the enhancement of direct damping coefficient value. Whirl frequency ratio of the floating <b>ring</b> <b>seal</b> without bump shows somewhat small in low speed ranges. When bump foil thickness is 0. 074 mm or 0. 1 mm, WFR is insensitive in rotating speed and pressure. But BFRS(0. 12 mm) shows up more stable tendency according to decreasing whirl frequency ratio in high speed ranges. The design parameters determined from these test results will be used to enhance the stability in high pressure and high speed turbomachinery seals...|$|R

50|$|Factors {{including}} late {{intake valve}} closure (relatively speaking for camshaft profiles outside of typical production-car range, {{but not necessarily}} {{into the realm of}} competition engines) can produce a misleadingly low figure from this test. Excessive connecting rod clearance, combined with extremely high oil pump output (rare but not impossible) can sling enough oil to coat the cylinder walls with sufficient oil to facilitate reasonable piston <b>ring</b> <b>sealing.</b> In engines with compromised <b>ring</b> <b>seals,</b> this can artificially give a misleadingly high compression figure.|$|R

In the project, the failure steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> is considered. This situation had threatened {{the safety of the}} whole steam turbine system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the failure cause of the steel <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> used in nuclear steam turbines. New high nickel steel alloy <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> was compared with the failed <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The dimensions of macroscopic ring with clearly plastic deformation were measured using calipers. Surface morphology of ring was observed by optical microscopy through metallographic analysis. There is a lot of precipitation in the grain boundaries of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> along with smaller grain size than the new <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> To explore the composition of precipitation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS) were used. The results indicated that the concentration of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) was higher in the precipitation of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> At the same time, the hardness and elastic modulus of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> were reduced, measured by nanoindentation test. In-situ SEM tensile testing were used to record and analyze the generation of crack source and crack development under applied load. The reasons of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure can be answered because of these experimental results at both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The main reason of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure is a combination of long-term stress and elevated temperature during turbine operation. Complex work environment caused recrystallization and recovery, resulting in grain refinement and secondary phase precipitation. Further embodiment, recrystallization and recovery caused the elastic modulus and hardness of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> decrease. Moreover, a lot of secondary phase precipitates appeared at grain boundaries during use. The appearance of secondary phase precipitates become the weakest part of used <b>seal</b> <b>ring.</b> The applied load lead to <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> failure from the formation of microvoids to microvoids aggregated becoming microcracks until to the appearance of cracks at macroscopic scale.

50|$|This {{phenomenon}} {{can actually}} be used to some slight advantage.

40|$|Pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> generally has a U-shaped cross section {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the high-pressure side that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> tighter against the gland and body sealing surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the U-shaped cross section and ejects or deforms the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the U-shaped cross section from that of the corresponding conventional <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> directly against the both gland and body sealing surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> against a gland sealing surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> into a smaller volume bounded by the gland and body sealing surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> more tightly against the body sealing surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring,</b> the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the body sealing surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the seal gland. These extensions would help to restrain the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the <b>sealing</b> <b>ring</b> in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the <b>seal</b> <b>ring</b> when the pressure on the high-pressure side was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal <b>seal</b> <b>rings</b> may be preferred.
