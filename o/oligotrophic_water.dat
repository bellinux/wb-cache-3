40|$|Free living viruses are {{ubiquitous}} {{in marine waters}} and concentrations are usually several {{times higher than the}} bacterial abundance. These viruses are capable of lysing host bacteria and therefore, {{play an important role in}} the microbial loop in <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters.</b> However, few studies have been conducted to compare the role of viruses in regulating bacterial abundance and heterotrophic activities between natural <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters</b> and anthropogenic influenced eutrophic waters. In this study, we examined viral effects on bacterial functions of four single bacterial species incubated with natural viral assemblages in seawater samples from eutrophic and <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters.</b> The viral-lysis of bacteria was significantly higher in eutrophic than <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters.</b> This suggests that viruses were capable of controlling bacterial abundance, respiration and production in the eutrophic waters. Cellular bacterial respiration and production was higher with viruses than without viruses, which was more evident in the <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters.</b> These results indicate that viruses can slow down bacterial consumption of oxygen and reduce bacteria-induced eutrophication effects in anthropogenic eutrophic waters, but switch to the role of sustaining the bacterial population when nutrients are limiting. There were bacterial species differences in resisting viral attack, which can influence the dominance and biodiversity of bacterial species in coastal waters...|$|R

50|$|Algal cell {{chemical}} composition is 106 carbon: 16 nitrogen: 1 phosphorus: 0.0001 iron atoms. In other words, each atom of iron captures 1,060,000 atoms of carbon, while one nitrogen atom captures only 6. Experimental iron fertilisation in HNLC regions has been supplied with excess iron which cannot be utilized {{before it is}} scavenged. Thus the organic material produced was much less than if the ratio of nutrients above were achieved. Only {{a fraction of the}} available nitrogen (because of iron scavenging) is drawn down. In culture bottle studies of <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>water,</b> adding nitrogen and phosphorus can draw down considerably more nitrogen per dosing. The export production is {{only a small percentage of}} the new primary production and in the case of iron fertilization, iron scavenging means that regenerative production is small. With macronutrient fertilisation, regenerative production is expected to be large and supportive of larger total export. Other losses can also reduce efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Heterotrophic {{bacteria}} {{are a key}} component driving biogeochemical processes in aquatic ecosystems. In 1998, we examined the role of heterotrophic bacteria by quantifying plankton biomass and bacterial and planktonic respiration across a trophic gradient in several small Minnesota lakes as well as Lake Superior. The contribution of bacteria (m fraction) to total planktonic respiration ranged from similar to 10 to 90 %, with the highest contribution occurring in the most <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters.</b> The bacterial size fraction constituted a substantial reservoir of planktonic carbon. nitrogen, and phosphorus (14 - 58 %, 10 - 49 %, and 14 - 48 %, respectively), being higher in oligotrophic than in eutrophic waters. However, we saw no clear evidence for the selective enrichment of either nitrogen or phosphorus in the bacteria size fraction relative to total plankton. Carbon:nitrogen and carbon:phosphorus ratios in both the total particulate matter and m fractions were similar and above Redfield values in <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters,</b> but approached them in eutropbic waters. Carbon-based bacterial growth efficiencies (BGE) were variable (4 - 40 %) but were lowest in oligotrophic systems and increased in eutrophic systems.

40|$|Isoetid {{species are}} small, slow-growing, {{evergreen}} water plants with thick, stiff leaves or stems that form basal rosettes {{and have a}} proportionally large below ground biomass. Isoetids often dominate carbonate poor (weakly buffered) and nutrient poor (<b>oligotrophic)</b> <b>water</b> and are characterized by a (very) slow growth rate. The special adaptations to oligotrophic conditions enable them to grow where other plants are unable to thrive. The high porosity of the plants {{as a whole and}} the permeability of the roots in combination with the very low permeability of the leaves enable the efficient use of carbon dioxide from the sediment and also the oxidation of the sediment. The oxidation of the sediments helps them to create and maintain oligotrophic conditions. The processes involved are discussed in this review.

40|$|Abstract: Concentrations of {{inorganic}} {{and organic}} carbon and organic nitrogen, {{as well as}} other hydrographic and biogeochemical variables, were measured in the <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters</b> of the western South Pacific Ocean (5 - 35 ”s; 17 O”W). With those data, we assess the impact of the intertropical convergences of the western tropical Pacific Ocean on surface ocean biogeochemistry. Low salinity, <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>waters</b> of the western tropical Pacific underlying regions of high net precipitation are characterized by concentrations of organic carbon and nitrogen that are elevated relative to higher salinity (lower net precipitation) zones. We hypothesize that water column stratification, forced by high net precipitation, favors enhanced rates of Nz fixation, with resultant elevation of organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the region. An effect of anthropogenic ocean warming and the associated increased hydrologic cycle in the tropical Pacific may be to alter the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen through enhancement of N 2 fixation. 1...|$|R

40|$|A 1 Syear {{series of}} daily {{measurements}} of pH and total alkalinity recorded {{at the water}} intake of a municipal water-treatment plant on Clear Lake, Iowa, demonstrated that rapid chemical changes occur annually as the ice cover melts. Additional measurements of total and calcium hardness on this and three other eutrophic, hard-water lakes showed that total and calcium hardness concentrations declined rapidly as the main ice tiass was destroyed. This decline was not caused by chemical or biological precipitation of carbonates, but by a dilution effect of melting ice. The magnitude of the declines could be predicted from mea-surements of hardness under the ice, lake volume, and volume of ice. Studies of natural lakes and farm ponds have shown that water hardness and al-kalinity levels are generally higher in winter under an ice cover than in spring or summer and that {{the magnitude of the}} winter to spring-summer decline is great-er in eutrophic than in <b>oligotrophic</b> <b>water...</b>|$|E
