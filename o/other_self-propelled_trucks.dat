The nozzle had been part of a pump engine originally used by the Sacramento Fire Department and later used by the Portland Fire Bureau and the City of Albany. One of the early fires was in January 1912 when the Commercial Hotel at Second and Washington burned, with two fatalities. The city built a new city hall in 1914 on Second Avenue, and the department moved into the building.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} the concentration of microtubules and depletion force in the emergence of collective motion of microtubules driven by kinesins. Critical concentrations were found for both microtubules and the depletant to demonstrate the collective motion of microtubules. More importantly, the kinetics of the collective motion were found to be significantly dependent on the concentration of microtubules and the depletant. Substantial variations in the time course of emergence of the collective motion of microtubules were observed in response to the changes in concentration of the microtubules and the depletant. This study provides new insights into the kinetics of the collective motion of microtubules driven by kinesins, which might also be useful in understanding the coordinated behavior of <b>other</b> <b>self-propelled</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|We study {{a system}} of {{self-propelled}} particles which interact with their neighbors via alignment and repulsion.

50|$|The Sholef's 155mm/52 gun is an {{original}} design created by Soltam, though it bears a resemblance to South Africa's G5 Howitzer.

This gun has a maximum rate of fire of 9 rounds/min, and a range in excess of 40,000 m when firing an ERFB-BB round. Though loaded automatically, the gun may be cycled and fire manually if the need arises. While the gun is normally carried by a travel lock as with most <b>other</b> <b>self-propelled</b> howitzers while the Sholef is on the move, the weapon is stabilized and can actually be used for direct-fire while the vehicle is moving, giving it much greater self-defense capability than most other vehicles of its type.|$|R

50|$|The Canadian Ukrainian dialect {{is based}} on the Ukrainian spoken by the first wave of {{immigrants}} from the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1891 to 1914. Because the Ukrainian language of this era had no words for such things as agricultural machinery other than a plow, words for wildlife or vegetation common to North America and uncommon in Ukraine, words related to the automobile or <b>other</b> <b>self-propelled</b> vehicles on roads, or words for internal combustion engine-powered or electrically-powered tools or home appliances of any kind, extensive borrowings and adaptations from Canadian English were independently made by Ukrainian settlers in the block settlements of the Prairies during their first decades in Canada. The decline of regular communication with relatives in Ukraine, especially the severe restrictions between 1939 and 1989, further isolated the Western Canadian Ukrainian dialect from an evolving Ukrainian language in Soviet Ukraine. Now, immigrants from Ukraine to Western Canada since 1991 speaking Ukrainian find the Canadian Ukrainian dialect old-fashioned and sometimes strange, for modern Ukrainian no longer uses some of the expressions and vocabulary common to the Canadian dialect - or, {{in the case of the}} Canadian loan words and adaptations, never did use, because Standard Ukrainian either invented other terms or borrowed and adapted from other languages, such as French, German or Russian.|$|R
40|$|Sperm {{motility}} is {{an important}} concept in fertility research. To this end, single spot laser tweezers {{have been used to}} quantitatively analyze the motility of individual sperm. However, this method is limited with throughput (single sperm per spot), lacks the ability of in-situ sorting based on motility and chemotaxis, requires high laser power (hundreds of milliWatts) and {{can not be used to}} dynamically monitor changes in sperm swimming behavior under the influence of a laser beam. Here, we report a continuous 3 -D ring-shaped laser trap which could be used for multi-level and high-throughput (tens to hundred sperm per ring) sperm sorting based on their motility and chemotaxis. Under a laser power of only tens of milliWatts, human sperm with low to medium velocity are slowed down, stopped, or forced to change their trajectories to swim along the ring due to the optical gradient force in the radial direction. This is the first demonstration of parallel sperm sorting based on motility with optical trapping technology. In addition, by making the sperm swimming along the circumference of the ring, the effect of laser radiation, optical force and external obstacles on sperm energetics are investigated in a more gentle and quantitative way. The application of this method could be extended to motility and bio-tropism studies of <b>other</b> <b>self-propelled</b> cells, such as algae and bacteria. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} depths of coal mines and the low permeability of some coal seams, conventional methods of gas drainage in underground mines are facing many problems. To improve gas extraction, a new technique using water jets to drill tree-type boreholes in coal seams is proposed. A self-propelled water-jet drilling nozzle was designed to drill these boreholes. The configuration of the self-propelled nozzle was optimized by conducting drilling experiments and self-propelling force measurements. Experimental {{results show that the}} optimal self-propelled nozzle has a forward orifice axial angle at 25 °, a radial angle at 90 °, a center distance of 1. 5 mm, and backward pointing orifices with an axial angle of 25 °. The self-propelling force generated by the jets of the nozzle with 30 MPa pump pressure can reach 29. 8 N, enough to pull the hose and the nozzle forward without any external forces. The nozzle can drill at speeds up to 41. 5 m/h with pump pressures at 30 MPa. The radial angles of the forward orifices improve the rock breaking performance of the nozzle and, with the correct angle, the rock breaking area of the orifices overlap to produce a connecting hole. The diameter of boreholes drilled by this nozzle can reach 35. 2 mm. The nozzle design can be used as the basis for designing <b>other</b> <b>self-propelled</b> nozzles. The drilling experiments demonstrate the feasibility of using the tree-type drilling technique in underground mines...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} sought to more {{fully understand the}} types and causative factors of injury/fatality incidents resulting from the rearward-movement of tractors and <b>other</b> <b>self-propelled</b> agricultural machinery, with the view that such findings might lead to the development, improvement, and/or better utilization of safety procedures, design principles, and technologies that would prevent—or at least markedly reduce—their occurrence. Thus, {{the scope of this}} study focused only on rearward-travel (not mechanical malfunction) incidents, and principally on agricultural equipment (although cases involving similar equipment in industrial or construction settings were also drawn upon). Applying these two criteria, a search of published and online sources uncovered more than 100 documented cases, 35 of which could clearly be identified as rearward-movement incidents, of which 28 (80 %) were fatal. Each of these 35 cases were then assessed, based on the type of machine, type of worksite, and type/description of incident (i. e., ‘scenario’), which fell into one of three distinct categories or classifications—(1) co-worker run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator loses visual contact with co-worker; (2) bystander run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator is unaware of bystander’s presence; and (3) operator run over/crushed/otherwise injured because operator loses visual contact with, or is unaware of, a stationary object or a hazard. Then, from each scenario, a representative incident (i. e., case study) was selected for a more in-depth analysis. The collective findings, from these three case studies and all 35 machinery rearward-movement incidents, were as follows: (1) The ‘victim’ could be the machine operator as well as a co-worker or a bystander; (2) The specific site of the co-worker or bystander injury/fatality was {{at the base of the}} machine’s rear tires or tracks, at the hitching point, or behind a towed implement; (3) The specific cause was loss of visual contact between the operator and co-worker/bystander due to visual obstruction, the operator’s physical limitations, or the operator’s and/or bystander’s lack of alertness. To reduce the likelihood of future occurrences of agricultural machinery rearward travel-related incidents, preventive measures aimed at addressing the key causative factors for each scenario are offered...|$|R
