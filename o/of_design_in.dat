Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the author}} seeks to {{investigate}} the interplay between space, interaction and learning sequences in higher education. She argues that space {{is an important part}} <b>of</b> <b>designs</b> for learning, where the building and the rooms are parts of the framing and the conditions for learning; furthermore, she discusses space as a resource in the meaning-making process, considering space as a significant part <b>of</b> <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> learning. The analysis builds on the concept that we can read space as three-dimensional text, using Halliday’s metafunctional theory to understand meaning potential in a space. The article also draws on a design-oriented perspective called ’Designs for Learning’ and demonstrates how we can understand space as being a part both <b>of</b> <b>designs</b> for learning and <b>of</b> <b>designs</b> <b>in</b> learning...|$|R
