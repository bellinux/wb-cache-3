50|$|The weapon {{consists}} of a rocket within a launcher consisting of two tubes, one inside the other. While closed, the <b>outer</b> <b>assembly</b> serves as a watertight container for the rocket and the percussion-cap firing mechanism that activates the rocket. The outer tube contains the trigger, the arming handle, front and rear sights, and the rear cover. The inner tube contains the channel assembly, which houses the firing pin assembly, including the detent lever. When extended, the inner tube telescopes outward toward the rear, guided by the channel assembly, which rides in an alignment slot in the outer tube's trigger housing assembly. This causes the detent lever to move under the trigger assembly in the outer tube, both locking the inner tube in the extended position and cocking the weapon. Once armed, the weapon is no longer watertight, even if the launcher is collapsed into its original configuration.|$|E

In X. leavis M phase extracts, preassembled kinetochores disassemble after inhibiting Aurora B activity with either drugs or antibodies.

PP 1 is necessary for kinetochores to disassemble {{at the exit from}} M phase, and purified enzyme is sufficient to cause disassembly on isolated mitotic nuclei.

Previous work has shown that the flagellar beat frequency is reduced in sup-pf- 2, but little else was known about the sup-pf- 2 phenotype (Huang, B., Z. Ramanis, and D. J. L. Luck. 1982. Cell. 28 : 115 - 125; Brokaw, C. J., and D. J. L. Luck. 1985. Cell Motil. 5 : 195 - 208). We have reexamined sup-pf- 2 using improved biochemical and structural techniques and by the analysis of additional sup-pf- 2 alleles. We have found that the sup-pf- 2 mutations are associated with defects in the outer dynein arms. Biochemical analysis of sup-pf- 2 - 1 axonemes indicates that both axonemal ATPase activity and outer arm polypeptides are reduced by 40 - 50 % when compared with wild type. By thin-section EM, these defects correlate with an approximately 45 % loss of outer dynein arm structures. Interestingly, this loss is biased toward a subset of outer doublets, resulting in a radial asymmetry that may reflect some aspect of <b>outer</b> arm <b>assembly.</b> The defects in <b>outer</b> arm <b>assembly</b> do not appear to result from defects in either the outer doublet microtubules or the outer arm docking structures, but rather appear to result from defects in outer dynein arm components. Analysis of new sup-pf- 2 mutations indicates that the severity of the <b>outer</b> arm <b>assembly</b> defects varies with different alleles. Complementation tests and linkage analysis reveal that the sup- pf- 2 mutations are alleles of the PF 28 /ODA 2 locus, which is thought to encode the gamma-dynein heavy chain subunit of the outer arm.

The outer T= 13 shell protein P 8 consists of two alpha-helical domains joined by a linker, which allows the trimer to adopt either a closed or an open conformation. The trimers in an open conformation swap domains with each other. Our observations allow us to propose a mechanistic model for calcium concentration regulated <b>outer</b> shell <b>assembly.</b> Furthermore, the structure provides a prime exemplar of bona fide domain-swapping.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of structural components and morphogenetic factors {{required for the}} assembly of the Bacillus subtilis spore coat is governed by a mother cell-specific transcriptional cascade. The first two temporal classes of gene expression, which involve RNA polymerase sigma σE factor and the ancillary regulators GerR and SpoIIID, are deployed prior to engulfment of the prespore by the mother cell. The two last classes rely on σK, whose activation follows engulfment completion, and GerE. The cotE gene codes for a morphogenetic protein essential for the <b>assembly</b> of the <b>outer</b> coat layer and spore resistance to lysozyme. cotE is expressed first from a σE-dependent promoter and, in a second stage, from a promoter that additionally requires SpoIIID and that remains active under σK control. CotE localizes prior to engulfment completion {{close to the surface}} of the developing spore, but formation of the outer coat is a late, σK-controlled event. We have transplanted cotE to progressively later classes of mother cell gene expression. This created an early class of mutants in which cotE is expressed prior to engulfment completion and a late class in which expression of cotE follows the complete engulfment of the prespore. Mutants of the early class assemble a nearly normal outer coat structure, whereas mutants of the late class do not. Hence, the early expression of CotE is essential for <b>outer</b> coat <b>assembly.</b> Surprisingly, however, all mutants were fully resistant to lysozyme.

Beginning with a tagged oda 5 allele, we isolated genomic and cDNA clones of the wild-type gene. ODA 5 predicts a novel, 66 -kDa coiled-coil protein. Immunoblotting indicates Oda 5 p is an axonemal component that assembles onto the axoneme independently of the outer arm and ODA-DC and is uniquely missing in oda 5 and oda 10 axonemes. Oda 5 p is released from the axoneme by extraction with 0. 6 M KCl, but the soluble Oda 5 p does not cosediment with the outer dynein arm/ODA-DC in sucrose gradients. Quantitative mass spectrometry by using isotope coded affinity tagging revealed that a previously unidentified adenylate kinase is reduced 35 - 50 % in oda 5 flagella. Direct enzymatic assays demonstrated a comparable reduction in adenylate kinase activity in oda 5 flagella, and also in oda 10 flagella, but not in flagella of other oda mutants.

A 181 -amino-acid coat protein called CotE assembles into the coat early in spore formation and plays a morphogenetic role in the assembly of the coat’s outer layer. We have used a series of mutant alleles of cotE to identify regions involved in <b>outer</b> coat protein <b>assembly.</b> We found that the insertion of a 10 -amino-acid epitope, between amino acids 178 and 179 of CotE, reduced or prevented the assembly of several spore coat proteins, including, most likely, CotG and CotB.

In contrast, the removal of 37 amino acids from the C terminus, {{as well as other}} alterations between amino acids 4 and 160, resulted {{in the absence of a}} detectable outer coat but did not prevent localization of CotE to the forespore.

Unexpectedly, only one pore is used for secretion, while both usher protomers are used for chaperone-subunit complex recruitment.

However, CENP-A {{is not sufficient}} to drive full-kinetochore assembly, and {{it is not clear how}} centromeric chromatin is established. Here, we identify CENP-W as a component of the DNA-proximal constitutive centromere-associated network (CCAN) of proteins. We demonstrate that CENP-W forms a DNA-binding complex together with the CCAN component CENP-T. This complex directly associates with nucleosomal DNA and with canonical histone H 3, but not with CENP-A, in centromeric regions. CENP-T/CENP-W functions upstream of other CCAN components with the exception of CENP-C, an additional putative DNA-binding protein. Our analysis indicates that CENP-T/CENP-W and CENP-C provide distinct pathways to connect the centromere with <b>outer</b> kinetochore <b>assembly.</b> In total, our results suggest that the CENP-T/CENP-W complex is directly involved in establishment of centromere chromatin structure coordinately with CENP-A...|$|R

New crystallographic data of PapD with the C-terminal fragment of a subunit suggest a mechanism for how periplasmic chaperones mediate the extraction of pilus subunits from the inner membrane, a prerequisite step for subunit folding. In addition, the conserved N- and C-terminal regions of pilus subunits are shown to participate in the quaternary interactions of the mature pilus following their uncapping by the chaperone.

To determine whether the predicted EF-hands are functional, we purified bacterially expressed wild-type DC 3 and analyzed its calcium-binding potential in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol and Mg 2 +. The protein bound one calcium ion with an affinity (Kd) of approximately 1 x 10 - 5 m. Calcium binding was observed only {{in the presence of}} dithiothreitol and thus is redox-sensitive. DC 3 also bound Mg 2 + at physiological concentrations but with a much lower affinity. Changing the essential glutamate to glutamine in both EF-hands eliminated the calcium binding activity of the bacterially expressed protein. To investigate the role of the EF-hands in vivo, we transformed the modified DC 3 gene into a Chlamydomonas insertional mutant lacking DC 3.
