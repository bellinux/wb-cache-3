50|$|The term {{rillette}} perhaps {{refers to}} the final product and its appearance when spread on sliced bread. Rillettes were traditionally made with fatty pork belly or pork shoulder. The meat was cubed, salted and cured, cooked slowly <b>over</b> <b>low</b> <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> very tender, then raked into small shreds and blended with the warm cooking fat to form a rustic paste. Rillettes could be stored in crocks for several months. In Anjou, rillaud was a speciality, plated {{in the shape of}} a pyramid and topped with the pig's tail; the rillettes were proudly displayed to the guest of honor. In time the rillette cooking style was applied to game birds, wild rabbit, and fish. Eventually several preparations for seafood rillettes were developed including an anchovy, tuna, and salmon version. Though the fish is not actually cooked in the fat, it is blended with fat to form the characteristic paste-spread. The soft, smooth texture is a deciding factor in determining a good rillette dish.|$|E

5000|$|Pé de moleque (...) (literally [...] "boy's foot" [...] in Portuguese) is a {{traditional}} candy from the Brazilian cuisine made of peanuts and jaggery or molasses.
