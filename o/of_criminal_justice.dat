5|$|During {{his service}} as {{lieutenant}} governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately financed group assembled {{to make recommendations}} for the state's future growth and development. The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report – containing more than 100 recommendations – in September 1986. Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891. The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, {{secretary of state and}} superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms. The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not immediately adopted, though several have since been implemented. Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of lifelong learning programs, implementation <b>of</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> reforms, and improvements in worker training. The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.|$|E

40|$|The era of romanticization <b>of</b> {{international}} <b>criminal</b> <b>justice,</b> {{ushered in}} during the 1990 s is over. As romance fades, we are confronted with grim reality: the constraints and complexities <b>of</b> international <b>criminal</b> <b>justice,</b> the selectivity, the price tag, the inordinate length of international trials. Yet, the goals and objectives <b>of</b> international <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> must be (re) defined {{in order to assess}} success or failure. Success is when the International Criminal Court (ICC) remains idle: by preventing the commission of mass atrocities in the first place, and by empowering national jurisdictions. Reconciliation, on the other hand, can be no more than an incidental outcome <b>of</b> international <b>criminal</b> <b>justice,</b> not its purpose. All in all, {{there is a need to}} creatively confront the challenges the ICC's normative empire faces today, for international <b>criminal</b> <b>justice</b> to rise again with adjusted expectations...|$|R
