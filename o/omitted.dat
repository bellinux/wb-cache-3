5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} <b>omitted</b> decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the <b>omitted</b> decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the <b>omitted</b> decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E

40|$|On Maltsev Conditions {{associated}} with <b>omitting</b> {{certain types of}} local structures Tame congruence theory identifies six Maltsev conditions {{associated with}} locally finite varieties <b>omitting</b> certain subsets of types of local behaviour. Extending a result of Siggers, we show that of these six Maltsev conditions only {{two of them are}} equivalent to strong Maltsev conditions for locally finite varieties. Besides <b>omitting</b> the unary type [18], the only other of these conditions that is strong is that of <b>omitting</b> the unary and affine types. We also present a Maltsev condition that is similar in form to having a Taylor term but that is associated with <b>omitting</b> the unary, affine, and semilattice local types. 1...|$|R

5|$|D'Oliveira was <b>omitted</b> {{from the}} England team {{for part of}} 1968 amid a slump in his batting form, but he marked his return in late August with a score of 158 runs in England's final Test match of the year, against Australia at The Oval. Days later, the MCC {{selectors}} <b>omitted</b> D'Oliveira from the team to tour South Africa; they insisted that this was based entirely on cricketing merit, but many in Britain voiced apprehension {{and there was a}} public outcry. After Tom Cartwright's withdrawal because of injury on 16 September, the MCC chose D'Oliveira as a replacement, prompting accusations from Vorster and other South African politicians that the selection was politically motivated. Attempts to find a compromise followed, but these led nowhere. The MCC announced the tour's cancellation on 24 September.|$|E

Conservative Judaism retains the traditional number and time periods during which the Amidah must be said, while <b>omitting</b> explicit supplications for restoration of the sacrifices. Reconstructionist and Reform Judaism, consistent with their views that {{the rhythm of the}} ancient sacrifices should no longer drive modern Jewish prayer, often <b>omit</b> some of the Amidah prayers, such as the Mussaf, <b>omit</b> temporal requirements, and <b>omit</b> references to the Temple and its sacrifices.|$|R
40|$|The <b>OMIT</b> electron-density-map {{calculation}} is {{very effective}} in discovering errors in a macromolecular structure determination. A Fortran program called <b>OMIT</b> has been written to calculate such maps and an investigation {{has been carried out}} into which coefficients for the map calculation produce the best <b>OMIT</b> maps. Testing of the program on Savinase showed that the best overall results were obtained when |Fo| without figure of merit was used. In regions where the map is incorrect, the most interesting <b>OMIT</b> maps are produced when only the figure of merit, or modified SIGMAA coefficients, are used as the initial map amplitude coefficients. Thus, these tests suggest that such <b>OMIT</b> maps are particularly useful to reconstruct the macromolecular model in the grossly incorrect regions of the model. ...|$|R

5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by setting in train {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and {{medicine}} were {{one and the same}} but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually <b>omitted</b> the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that <b>omitted</b> the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E

40|$|We {{analytically}} {{study the}} optomechanically induced transparency (<b>OMIT)</b> in the N-cavity {{system with the}} Nth cavity driven by pump, probing laser fields and the 1 st cavity coupled to mechanical oscillator. We also consider that one atom could be trapped in the ith cavity. Instead of only illustrating the <b>OMIT</b> in such a system, {{we are interested in}} how the number of <b>OMIT</b> windows is influenced by the cavities and the atom and what roles the atom could play in different cavities. In the resolved sideband regime, we find that, the number of cavities precisely determines the maximal number of <b>OMIT</b> windows. It is interesting that, when the two-level atom is trapped in the even-labeled cavity, the central absorptive peak (odd N) or dip (even N) is split and forms an extra <b>OMIT</b> window, but if the atom is trapped in the odd-labeled cavity, the central absorptive peak (odd N) or dip (even N) is only broadened and thus changes the width of the <b>OMIT</b> windows rather than induces an extra window.
