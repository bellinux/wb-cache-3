5|$|Chapter Four {{lists the}} powers and {{duties of the}} Parliament of Belarus, which is called the National Assembly. The National Assembly itself {{is divided into two}} houses: the lower House of Representatives and the upper Council of the Republic. While each house has its <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> {{governing}} how members are elected, members decide on the various bills that could become Belarusian law and approve the nominations of cabinet heads that the president chooses.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the loss}} of their <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> Sheffield {{remained}} the centre of the footballing world until the onset of professionalism. The association matches versus London were considered only equalled in importance to the England v Scotland international and FA Cup Final. Sheffield born Charles Clegg became chairman of the Football Association in 1890 leading it until his death in 1937. In the process he became the longest serving FA chairman and earned the nickname The Napoleon of Football.|$|E

Players can also play a card game called Caravan, which was specifically designed for the game and has its <b>own</b> <b>rules,</b> and can be played with certain people outside of the casinos.|$|E
5|$|The {{innovative}} streak within Sheffield remained {{after the}} demise of their <b>own</b> <b>rules.</b> On 15 October 1878 a crowd of 20,000 watched the first floodlit match at Bramall Lane. The exhibition match {{was set up to}} test the use of the lights and was played between specially selected teams captained by the brothers William and Charles Clegg. William Clegg's team won 2–0. The experiment was repeated a month later at the Oval.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the Dade County vote, Fort Lauderdale, Gainesville, and Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas, all {{rejected}} ordinances to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development overturned its <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> they had set {{earlier in the year}} to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing. Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15years had been fired. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the very liberal Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights ordinances.|$|E

5|$|The Lottery {{also offers}} Print 'n Play games. As with {{traditional}} Lottery games, tickets are printed by the terminal; however as in scratchers, winning status are determined when the ticket is printed (there is no drawing). There is a continually-changing lineup of games at $2, $3, and $5 prices: {{each with its}} <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> and prizes. The basic rules are the same, but the lineup is now simplified to the three most popular Fast Play games—Bingo, Blackjack, and Crossword—each of which is now available in up to four different price tiers including a new $10 tier.|$|E
5|$|Roughly spherical eggs of {{different}} animals {{give rise to}} extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for bodybuilding proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its <b>own</b> <b>rules</b> of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The giraffe {{does not have a}} gene for a long neck, any more than the elephant has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development {{of different}} features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{from its}} outset, the Yalta {{decision}} favored the communists, who enjoyed {{the advantages of}} Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe securely {{under the influence of}} the Soviet Union, as well as control over crucial government departments such as the security services (this activity was initially dominated by Lavrentiy Beria's Soviet NKVD). Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the populist program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's delegation was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its political-military organizations became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the PKWN Manifesto and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support. From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established workers' councils, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its <b>own</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although {{universities}} and student unions each had their <b>own</b> <b>rules,</b> students generally {{were required to}} become a member of their campus student organisation automatically upon enrolment. A fee for student services or amenities was charged to students, typically once a semester, once a year, or in a lump sum upon enrolment. This fee was typically collected by the university, which usually took a portion in collection fees and passed the rest to campus student organisation(s). These organisations then distributed the money according to their <b>own</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The term autonomia/Autonome {{was first}} used in 1620, having been {{composed}} out of two Greek words, [...] "auto - nomos", referring to someone or something which lives by his/her <b>own</b> <b>rule.</b> Autonomy, in this sense, is not independence. While independence refers to an autarchic kind of life, separated from the community, autonomy refers to life in society but by one's <b>own</b> <b>rule.</b> Though the notion of autonomism was alien to the ancient Greeks, the concept is indirectly endorsed by Aristotle, who stated that only beasts or gods could be independent and live apart from the polis ("community"), while Kant defined the Enlightenment by autonomy of thought and the famous [...] "Sapere aude" [...] ("dare to know").|$|R
