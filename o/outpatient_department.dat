It was a wooden single-storey building measuring 50 to 60 feet long, with an <b>outpatient</b> <b>department,</b> male and female wards. On 8 March 1928, Sibu was again consumed by a great fire. However, the Tua Pek Kong Temple remained intact. The locals considered this a miracle.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its <b>outpatient</b> <b>department,</b> and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for free in the Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E
25|$|During {{his time}} in India, Rambo gained many supporters, and the hospital's {{facilities}} and delivery of medical services expanded substantially, as the building grew from a four-room hospital into a 120-bed surgical unit known for treating eye disease. The hospital was remodeled to include an <b>outpatient</b> <b>department,</b> lab, and records room and several new wards after it accepted a substantial donation from a supporter back in the United States. Rambo received new operating, delivery, and examining rooms for eye patients. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi provided Rambo with equipment and instruments worth over 10,000 dollars, and Oxfam donated additional supplies.|$|E

40|$|Coordinated {{health service}} {{utilisation}} in the ambulatory care sector is of major interest from a health policy perspective. This ecological study investigates {{the interplay between}} medical care utilisation in hospital <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments</b> and in freestanding physician practices by drawing on {{the example of the}} Austrian healthcare system, which is standing out due to three features: ambulatory care is provided by both free-standing public (contract) and private (non-contract) practitioners; medical specialists operate in free-standing physician practices and in hospital outpatient departments; essentially, no gatekeeping is in place. As the ongoing health care reform aims to strengthen the primary care sector, we investigate whether in the current system care in general practitioner and specialist physician practices is in a substitutive, complementary or independent relation with medical care in <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments.</b> Methods: Hypotheses were tested using ordinary least square regression analysis based on administrative data of all Austrian districts with a hospital department in 2010, including a proxy for actual utilisation rather than physician headcount. Results: Controlling for socio-demographic and geographic characteristics and inpatient activity, we find that a higher level of care provision by contract GPs is associated with lower use of hospital <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments</b> on the district level. In contrast, a higher level of care by non-contract specialists is related to a higher utilization in <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments.</b> Conclusion: While care by non-contract specialists seems to be in a complementary and potentially demand-inducing relation with <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments,</b> primary care by contract GPs appears to be capable of replacing care in <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the position of nurses in internal expert <b>outpatients</b> <b>departments.</b> The current position of nurses in the internal <b>outpatients</b> <b>departments</b> is special and demanding. We cannot imagine how the health care service would work without them. An outpatients nurse has several tasks that she should master and carry out smoothly [...] it {{is the role of}} an educator, an attorney, a manager, a provider of health care, a mentor, a researcher and a carrier of all changes. The relation between the doctor and the nurse is also highly important; it should be friendly, considerate and mutually respectful, and their cooperation should be based on equal rights. Internal <b>outpatients</b> <b>department</b> provide health care to patients with various diseases of internal organs. Nurses are {{a significant part of the}} medical team. The departments serve as places of the first contact of the client with the medical staff. Professional approach and communication with the patient are expected. A quality medical and nursing care is unthinkable without communication between the client and the nurse. Patients vary in their behaviour and reactions but certain manifestations of behaviour are common to certain groups of people. The objective of my work is to find out the position of nurses in selected internal expert <b>outpatients</b> <b>departments.</b> In order to fulfil this objective I applied the qualitative research. The method of collection of data consisted in half-structured interviews with 35 standardized questions carried out with nurses in selected internal <b>outpatients</b> <b>departments.</b> The interviews were completely anonymous. Three nurses were interviewed in every selected internal <b>outpatients</b> <b>department.</b> The whole research was carried out in the Motol University Hospital in Prague. 9 nurses took part in the research (3 nurses from the department of diabetology, 3 nurses from the department of endocrinology and 3 nurses from the rheumatologic department). The interviews with nurses from individual <b>outpatients</b> <b>departments</b> were the basis of case histories. Those served as the research groundwork for elaboration of 11 categorizing charts that summarize the most important results of the research. Thanks to our research findings and meeting the objective of our research we found out that the position of nurses in selected expert internal <b>outpatients</b> <b>departments</b> is good though financially undervalued. High demands, mainly in the sphere of communication with patients and other medical staff, are placed on them. The research further showed that the nurses mainly work as educators and their job description mostly consists in administrative and nursing work. They have adequate working conditions. They also provide information to patients orally as well as by means of practical demonstrations. On the other hand, nurses in <b>outpatients</b> <b>departments</b> suffer from more displays of stress...|$|R
2500|$|In February 1923, Freud {{detected}} a leukoplakia, a benign growth associated with heavy smoking, on his mouth. Freud initially kept this secret, but in April 1923 he informed Ernest Jones, {{telling him that}} the growth had been removed. Freud consulted the dermatologist Maximilian Steiner, who advised him to quit smoking but lied about the growth's seriousness, minimizing its importance. Freud later saw Felix Deutsch, who saw that the growth was cancerous; he identified it to Freud using the euphemism [...] "a bad leukoplakia" [...] instead of the technical diagnosis epithelioma. Deutsch advised Freud to stop smoking and have the growth excised. Freud was treated by Marcus Hajek, a rhinologist whose competence he had previously questioned. Hajek performed an unnecessary cosmetic surgery in his clinic's <b>outpatient</b> <b>department.</b> Freud bled {{during and after the}} operation, and may narrowly have escaped death. Freud subsequently saw Deutsch again. Deutsch saw that further surgery would be required, but did not tell Freud that he had cancer because he was worried that Freud might wish to commit suicide.|$|E
2500|$|So {{that the}} distractions {{of a busy}} life should not {{interfere}} with Head's introspective analysis, {{it was decided that}} the experimentation should take place in Rivers's rooms. Here, as Head states, [...] "for five happy years we worked together on week-ends and holidays in the quiet atmosphere of his rooms at St. John's College." [...] In the normal course of events, Head would travel to Cambridge on Saturday, after spending several hours on the <b>outpatient</b> <b>department</b> of the London Hospital. On these occasions, however, he would find that he was simply too exhausted to work on the Saturday evening so experimentation would have to be withheld until the Sunday. If, therefore, a long series of tests were to be carried out, Head would come to Cambridge on the Friday, returning to London on Monday morning. At some points, usually during Rivers's vacation period, longer periods could be devoted to the observations. Between the date of the operation and their last sitting on 13 December 1907, 167days were devoted to the investigation.|$|E

In order to stimulate direct referral from primary care it is important that a financial system is in place that does not penalise the primary care physician and which recognises that primary care radiology is both cost effective and efficient for the patient: it reduces unnecessary referral to expensive hospital <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments</b> and will result in a more efficient service as the patient will arrive at the <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments</b> more effectively evaluated.|$|R

40|$|The {{prescribing}} {{pattern of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in prescriptions prescribed by the qualified medical {{personnel in the}} <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments</b> of three selected teaching hospitals in Dhaka city were studied. A total of 600 prescriptions containing NSAIDs were collected. The clinical conditions for which NSAIDs prescribed were identical in all the three hospitals, although there were wide variations in the prescribing pattern with respect to pharmacological sub-classes of NSAIDs. Analgesics with no or minimal anti-inflammatory effects were the most commonly prescribed NSAIDs in the medical <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments</b> of Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital (BSMMUH) whereas analgesics with potent anti-inflammatory effects were the most commonly prescribed NSAIDs in a private teaching hospital (PH). Moreover, the prescribers in PH had to prescribe additional drugs {{than those of the}} prescribers of DMCH and BSMMUH to counter the adverse effects of NSAIDs. Proton pump inhibitors were mainly used in medical <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments</b> whereas H 2 blockers were in surgical <b>outpatient</b> <b>departments.</b> Consequently, the cost of prescribed NSAIDs per prescription and ultimately the cost of total drugs per prescription became more expensive in PH compared to DMCH and BSMMUH. In conclusion, it may be said that the overall prescribing pattern of NSAIDs among three hospitals is rational...|$|R
