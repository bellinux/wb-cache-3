5|$|After {{four weeks}} of filming in Philadelphia, {{the cast and crew}} moved to Wildwood, New Jersey, which doubled for scenes set at the Atlantic City boardwalk. Filming then moved to San Francisco, California. The scene where Birdy and Al climb atop a {{refinery}} building was filmed on the rooftop <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> gasworks in Hercules, California. The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, French {{officials}} {{decided to}} build a satellite museum on the site <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> coal pit in the former mining town of Lens to relieve the crowded Paris Louvre, increase total museum visits, and improve the industrial north's economy. Six cities were considered for the project: Amiens, Arras, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais, Lens, and Valenciennes. In 2004, French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin chose Lens to {{be the site of}} the new building, the Louvre-Lens. Japanese architects SANAA were selected to design the Lens project in 2005. Museum officials predicted that the new building, capable of receiving about 600works of art, would attract up to 500,000visitors a year when it opened in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In Alameda County, {{the freeway}} {{begins in the}} city of Fremont, where it intersects SR 262, which was {{unsigned}} until 2000. Continuing through the city, it meets Mission Boulevard at SR 238 before exiting the city. Prior to 2002, two ghost ramps existed here, remains <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> freeway project replacing Mission Blvd. Amid Alameda County, it abruptly turns northeastward and enters a hilly area, where it crosses over Mission Pass, and descends into the Sunol Valley, where it runs concurrently with SR 84 for a short while. Afterwards, it enters Pleasanton and intersects with I-580, currently California's longest auxiliary interstate providing access to Oakland and the Central Valley. It enters Dublin for a short segment before exiting the county and entering Contra Costa County.|$|E
5|$|One of the city's {{most recent}} sports-related attractions is the Covelli Centre, which was funded {{primarily}} through a $26 million federal grant. Located {{on the site}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> steel mill, the large, high-tech facility opened in October 2005. It was formerly called the Chevrolet Center, and during planning it {{was known as the}} Youngstown Convocation Center. The Centre's main tenants are the Youngstown Phantoms, who play in the United States Hockey League. Previously, it was home to the Youngstown Steelhounds hockey team, who played in the CHL. The city plans to develop vacant land adjacent to the Centre for a park, a riverwalk (the Mahoning River flows through the site), an amphitheater, or an athletic stadium for the city's public and private high schools.|$|E

5|$|STRIKE's {{victory in}} the Black Sea leads them to the Caucasus, where Sadissa Savak, leader of the fictional state of Irek, begins {{aggressive}} overtures against local fighters. In the mission (which is supposedly north of the main battle area where Desert Strike took place), the player and Amad join forces with a militia run by Amad's relatives in stopping Ireki troops from capturing an ex-Soviet chemical weapons plant. With STRIKE killing Savak (and passed off as {{the victim of a}} car crash), the group goes to a heavily irradiated Transylvania to rescue Nick once more, this time from Dr Grymyenko Ukrainian, who wields an arsenal of ballistic missiles. The player is also tasked to kill the Shadowman's lead armor commander, Vila, who operates a special red-turreted T-80, and aid in the destruction <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> nuclear reactor the Shadowman is planning to use.|$|E
5|$|After the executions, Hancock was {{assigned}} {{command of the}} newly organized Middle Military Department, headquartered in Baltimore. In 1866, on Grant's recommendation, Hancock was promoted to major general and was transferred, later that year, to command of the military Department of the Missouri, which included the states of Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, and New Mexico. Hancock reported to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and took up his new posting. Soon after arriving, he {{was assigned}} by General Sherman to lead an expedition {{to negotiate with the}} Cheyenne and Sioux, with whom relations had worsened since the Sand Creek massacre. The negotiations got off to a bad start, and after Hancock ordered the burning <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> Cheyenne village in central Kansas, relations became worse than when the expedition had started. There was little loss of life on either side, but the mission could not be called a success.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan was shelved, {{the need for a}} highway in western Nassau County still existed. In 1963, the Department of Public Works revived the project; however, the routing was altered to extend from the Sunrise Highway (NY27) north to an intersection with CR101 (Middle Neck Road) in Sands Point. Part of the route would use modern NY101 and the right-of-way <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> Long Island Rail Road line. In 1971, several proposed crossings of the Long Island Sound were studied. One crossing, a bridge connecting Sands Point to New Rochelle to Westchester County, may have become a northward extension of the highway if it was constructed. By 1971, though, hopes had begun to fade on the highway's prospects of becoming reality. Even if construction had begun in that year, the highway would not be open to traffic until 1975. The project was eventually shelved.|$|E

5|$|Indiana militia leaders {{learned of}} Morgan's capture of Brandenburg, ten {{miles south of}} Corydon, and his intent to cross into Indiana in a {{dispatch}} from Regular Army commanders in Louisville. All the roads Morgan would likely take northward intersected at Corydon. Emergency requests for reinforcements were sent out from the town in all directions. New Albany leaders sent word promising to send a thousand men. Other companies around Harrison County immediately began to gather and advance to Corydon. Three companies of the 6th Regiment Indiana Legion based in Mauckport and totaling about one hundred men moved to Morvin's Landing, the north {{bank of the river}} opposite Brandenburg, to contest the crossing. A thirty-man company of the 8th Regiment of the Indiana Legion based in Leavenworth and under the command of Capt. G.W. Lyon, was transported to Morvin's landing by the Lady Pike during the night. They brought with them their town's ceremonial 8-pound cannon which they deployed and camouflaged on a small bluff in front <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> log cabin.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opens to}} a shot <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> office, where the main {{character}} (Pierre Jolivet), who is only identified as 'The Man' in the end credits, is having intercourse with a sex doll. The Man is then seen attempting to salvage parts from abandoned vehicles, but returns to his dwelling empty handed, where he works on building a makeshift aircraft. The Man ventures outside the office building he lives in, which {{is surrounded by a}} desert wasteland. A group of men are shown surviving in the wasteland. They hold a man, 'The Dwarf' (Maurice Lamy), captive, and force him to retrieve water for them. The Man, who has been observing the survivors, makes his way to their camp, stabs their leader, 'The Captain' (Fritz Wepper) and retrieves a car battery. Survivors pursue The Man, though he is able to escape in his now completed aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The film used Technicolor's Oz process during post-production. This is {{a partial}} silver {{retention}} on the interpositive, similar to bleach bypass, {{which will be}} used to lend to the sense of detachment from the modern world McG was looking for. Industrial Light & Magic developed shader programs to make the desaturated lighting of the CGI realistic and well-integrated to the on-set footage. The filmmakers consulted with many scientists about the effects <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>abandoned</b> world and nuclear winter. McG cited , the original Star Wars trilogy and Children of Men, as well as the novel The Road, as his visual influences. He instructed his cast to read the latter as well as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Like Children of Men, McG would storyboard scenes so that it would be edited together to resemble a seamless, continuous shot. It took two weeks to film a two-minute shot of Connor getting caught up in a bombing on the Skynet base where he discovers plans for the T-800.|$|E
