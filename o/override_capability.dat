40|$|Hydraulic pump/motor {{units have}} {{a wide range of}} commer-cial applications, each {{requiring}} a separate bolt-on hydraulic controller. This paper outlines the results of laboratory feasibility tests, aimed at replacing these hydraulic con-trollers with an electromechanical valve actuated by a universal microprocessor based controller. Since the majority of controller functions include a pressure <b>override</b> <b>capability,</b> the constant pressure override control (CPOC) function has been investigated in detail. The CPOC controller varies the pump flow rate to ensure that the hydraulic pipeline pres-sure remains constant despite variations in load. The micro-processor required an accurate measure of average line pressure. Preliminary tests showed that the axial pump superimposed large synchronous pressure ripples onto this average level. The results show that if careful signal con-ditioning is used to remove this ripple, a microprocessor based control unit can mimic the main control function of existing hydraulic controllers successfully. Design features required for a suitable prototype controller necessary for field trials are discussed. ...|$|E

This paper explores the use of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Surrogate research aircraft to serve as platforms for UAS systems research, development, and flight testing. These aircraft would be manned with safety pilots and researchers that would allow for flight operations almost anywhere in the NAS without the need for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Certificate of Authorization (COA). With pilot <b>override</b> <b>capability,</b> these UAS Surrogate aircraft would be controlled from ground stations like true UAS s. It would be possible to file and fly these UAS Surrogate aircraft in the NAS with normal traffic and they would be better platforms for real world UAS research and development over existing vehicles flying in restricted ranges or other sterilized airspace. These UAS surrogate aircraft could be outfitted with research systems as required such as computers, state sensors, video recording, data acquisition, data link, telemetry, instrumentation, and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). These surrogate aircraft could also be linked to onboard or ground based simulation facilities to further extend UAS research capabilities. Potential areas for UAS Surrogate research include the development, flight test and evaluation of sensors to aide in the process of air traffic "see-and-avoid".

40|$|A {{generally}} observable {{trend of}} the past 10 years is {{that the amount of}} sensors embedded in mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets is rising steadily. Arguably, the available sensors are mostly underutilized by existing mobile user interfaces. In this dissertation, we explore sensor-based user interface concepts for mobile devices with the goal of making better use of the available sensing capabilities on mobile devices as well as gaining insights on the types of sensor technologies that could be added to future mobile devices. We are particularly interested how novel sensor technologies could be used to implement novel and engaging mobile user interface concepts. We explore three particular areas of interest for research into sensor-based user interface concepts for mobile devices: continuous interaction, around-device interaction and motion gestures. For continuous interaction, we explore the use of dynamic state-space systems to implement user interfaces based on a constant sensor data stream. In particular, we examine zoom automation in tilt-based map scrolling interfaces. We show that although fully automatic zooming is desirable in certain situations, adding a manual <b>override</b> <b>capability</b> of the zoom level (Semi-Automatic Zooming) will increase the usability of such a system, as shown through a decrease in task completion times and improved user ratings of user study. The presented work on continuous interaction also highlights how the sensors embedded in current mobile devices can be used to support complex interaction tasks. We go on to introduce the concept of Around-Device Interaction (ADI). By extending the interactive area of the mobile device to its entire surface and the physical volume surrounding it we aim to show how the expressivity and possibilities of mobile input can be improved this way. We derive a design space for ADI and evaluate three prototypes in this context. HoverFlow is a prototype allowing coarse hand gesture recognition around a mobile device using only a simple set of sensors. PalmSpace a prototype exploring the use of depth cameras on mobile devices to track the user's hands in direct manipulation interfaces through spatial gestures. Lastly, the iPhone Sandwich is a prototype supporting dual-sided pressure-sensitive multi-touch interaction. Through the results of user studies, we show that ADI can lead to improved usability for mobile user interfaces. Furthermore, the work on ADI contributes suggestions for the types of sensors could be incorporated in future mobile devices to expand the input capabilities of those devices. In order to broaden the scope of uses for mobile accelerometer and gyroscope data, we conducted research on motion gesture recognition. With the aim of supporting practitioners and researchers in integrating motion gestures into their user interfaces at early development stages, we developed two motion gesture recognition algorithms, the 3 Gesture Recognizer and Protractor 3 D that are easy to incorporate into existing projects, have good recognition rates and require a low amount of training data. To exemplify an application area for motion gestures, we present the results of a study on the feasibility and usability of gesture-based authentication. With the goal of making it easier to connect meaningful functionality with gesture-based input, we developed Mayhem, a graphical end-user programming tool for users without prior programming skills. Mayhem can be used to for rapid prototyping of mobile gestural user interfaces. The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of a number of novel user interface concepts for sensor-based interaction. They will help developers of mobile user interfaces make better use of the existing sensory capabilities of mobile devices. Furthermore, manufacturers of mobile device hardware obtain suggestions for the types of novel sensor technologies that are needed in order to expand the input capabilities of mobile devices. This allows the implementation of future mobile user interfaces with increased input capabilities, more expressiveness and improved usability...|$|E
40|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory was tasked by the U. S. Army Engineering and Support Center (Huntsville, AL) to {{evaluate}} the mathematical basis of existing software tools used to assist the Army with the characterization of sites potentially contaminated with unexploded ordnance (UXO). These software tools are collectively known as SiteStats/GridStats. The first purpose of the software is to guide sampling of underground anomalies to estimate a site's UXO density. The second purpose is to delineate areas of homogeneous UXO density {{that can be used}} in the formulation of response actions. It was found that SiteStats/GridStats does adequately guide the sampling so that the UXO density estimator for a sector is unbiased. However, the software's techniques for delineation of homogeneous areas perform less well than visual inspection, which is frequently used to override the software in the overall sectorization methodology. The main problems with the software lie in the criteria used to detect nonhomogeneity and those used to recommend the number of homogeneous subareas. SiteStats/GridStats is not a decision-making tool in the classical sense. Although it does provide information to decision makers, it does not require a decision based on that information. SiteStats/GridStats provides information that is supplemented by visual inspections, land-use plans, and risk estimates prior to making any decisions. Although the sector UXO density estimator is unbiased regardless of UXO density variation within a sector, its variability increases with increased sector density variation. For this reason, the current practice of visual inspection of individual sampled grid densities (as provided by Site-Stats/GridStats) is necessary to ensure approximate homogeneity, particularly at sites with medium to high UXO density. Together with Site-Stats/GridStats <b>override</b> <b>capabilities,</b> this provides a sufficient mechanism for homogeneous sectorization and thus yields representative UXO density estimates. Objections raised by various parties to the use of a numerical ''discriminator'' in SiteStats/GridStats were likely because of the fact that the concerned statistical technique is customarily applied for a different purpose and because of poor documentation. The ''discriminator'', in Site-Stats/GridStats is a ''tuning parameter'' for the sampling process, and it affects the precision of the grid density estimates through changes in required sample size. It is recommended that sector characterization in terms of a map showing contour lines of constant UXO density with an expressed uncertainty or confidence level is a better basis for remediation decisions than a sector UXO density point estimate. A number of spatial density estimation techniques could be adapted to the UXO density estimation problem...|$|R

Often, the incremental complexity of the pursued systems <b>overrides</b> experimental <b>capabilities,</b> or increasingly sophisticated protocols are underutilized to merely refine confidence levels of already established interactions. For metabolic networks, the currently employed confidence scoring system rates reactions discretely according to nested categories of experimental evidence or model-based likelihood. Results Here, we propose a complementary network-based scoring system that exploits the statistical regularities of a metabolic network as a bipartite graph. As an illustration, we apply it to the metabolism of Escherichia coli. The model is adjusted to the observations to derive connection probabilities between individual metabolite-reaction pairs and, after validation, to assess the reliability of each reaction in probabilistic terms. This network-based scoring system uncovers very specific reactions that could be functionally or evolutionary important, identifies prominent experimental targets, and enables further confirmation of modeling results. Conclusions We foresee {{a wide range of}} potential applications at different sub-cellular or supra-cellular levels of biological interactions given the natural bipartivity of many biological networks. </p...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative stress {{results when}} {{the balance between}} the {{production}} of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <b>overrides</b> the antioxidant <b>capability</b> of the target cell; oxidative damage from the interaction of reactive oxygen with critical cellular macromolecules may occur. ROS may interact with and modify cellular protein, lipid, and DNA, which results in altered target cell function. The accumulation of oxidative damage has been implicated in both acute and chronic cell injury including possible participation {{in the formation of}} cancer. Acute oxidative injury may produce selective cell death and a compensatory increase in cell proliferation. This stimulus may result in the formation of newly initiated preneoplastic cells and/or enhance the selective clonal expansion of latent initiated preneoplastic cells. Similarly, sublethal acute oxidative injury may produce unrepaired DNA damage and result in the formation of new mutations and, potentially, new initiated cells. In contrast, sustained chronic oxidative injury may lead to a nonlethal modification of normal cellular growth control mechanisms. Cellular oxidative stress can modify intercellular communication, protein kinase activity, membrane structure and function, and gene expression, and result in modulation of cell growth. We examined the role of oxidative stress as a possible mechanism by which nongenotoxic carcinogens may function. In studies with the selectiv...|$|R

Some mechanisms are needed to protect sensitive information stored in XML documents, and access control {{is one of the}} mechanisms. Supported by a National 863 project, implementing flexible, security and effective model as objective, research on access control for XML documents is conducted in this paper. Some results obtained in this paper are as follows. XML document model is described by formal method. Some rules are provided to guarantee that the described documents are well-formed. The model is also applicable for XML schema documents. A flexible and practical method to enforce Discretionary Access Control (DAC) policy on XML documents is presented in this paper. The method is based on XML schema technology that is more powerful than DTD. The authorization is extended to include three fields for <b>overriding</b> option, administrative <b>capability</b> and grantor. Administrative capability in authorization on XML documents is described. Privileges on objects are controllable to some extent. The determinability of users' requests is proved, and algorithm for judging users' requests is given. How to enforce Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy on XML documents is first proposed. The XML document model is extended to include security label, and some rules which security labels in XML documents should obey are given. The validation of XML documents under MAC policy is defined to improve the usability of systems processing valid documents. Operations on XML documents under MAC policy are described in details. The polyinstantiation caused by these operations is also discussed. Some implementing mechanisms for key models are given. Based on methods discussed before, how to enforce an integrated policy with DAC and MAC on XML system is discussed, an access control based on RBAC is presented to implement the integrated policy. After introduce the concepts of multilevel role and internal role, administrators and users don't have to consider the constraints among the labels of users, roles and objects when assigning privileges. Administrative operations in the model are described in details. This model is flexible and able to be configured to meet different security requirements. The model is applicable in many systems with different scales. The complexity of privilege administration will not added heavily when the numbers of objects or security labels increase...|$|R
