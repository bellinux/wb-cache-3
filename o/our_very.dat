25|$|Granger's {{next two}} films for Goldwyn, Edge of Doom and <b>Our</b> <b>Very</b> Own, were {{unpleasant}} working experiences, and the actor {{refused to allow}} the producer to loan him to Universal Pictures for an inferior magic carpet saga. When he was placed on suspension, he decided to accompany Ethel Chaplin, who had separated from her husband, and her daughter {{on a trip to}} Paris. At the last moment they were joined by Arthur Laurents, who remained behind when the group departed for London to see the opening of the New York City Ballet, which had been choreographed by Jerome Robbins. He and Granger engaged in a casual affair until the actor was summoned to return to New York to help publicize <b>Our</b> <b>Very</b> Own and Edge of Doom, both of which received dreadful reviews. Goldwyn cancelled the nationwide openings of the latter, hoping to salvage it by adding wraparound scenes that would change the focus of the film, and Granger refused to promote it any further. Once again placed on suspension, he departed for Europe, where he spent time in Italy, Austria and Germany with Laurents before being contacted about an upcoming film by Alfred Hitchcock.|$|E

25|$|Read on its own, the First Meditation {{can be seen}} as {{presenting}} skeptical doubts as {{a subject}} of study in their own right. Certainly, skepticism is a much discussed and hotly debated topic in philosophy, even today. Descartes raised the mystifying question of how we can claim to know with certainty anything about the world around us. The idea is not that these doubts are probable, but that their possibility can never be entirely ruled out. And if we can never be certain, how can we claim to know anything? Skepticism cuts straight {{to the heart of the}} Western philosophical enterprise and its attempt to provide a certain foundation for our knowledge and understanding of the world. It can even be pushed so far as to be read as a challenge to <b>our</b> <b>very</b> notion of rationality.|$|E

[...] It is in the figure of the vampire that Kostova reveals this, since [...] "our fear of Dracula lies in the fear of losing ourselves, of relinquishing <b>our</b> <b>very</b> identities as human beings".

500|$|On July 22, 2005, in {{response}} to bombings in London, the New York City Transit Police introduced a new policy of randomly searching passengers' bags as they approached turnstiles. The NYPD claimed that no form of racial profiling would be conducted when these searches actually took place. The NYPD {{has come under fire}} from some groups that claim purely random searches without any form of threat assessment would be ineffectual. Donna Lieberman, Executive Director of the NYCLU, stated, [...] "This NYPD bag search policy is unprecedented, unlawful and ineffective. It is essential that police be aggressive in maintaining security in public transportation.

[...] Similarly, according to DJBooth, while Graduation is far from being West's best studio album, it nevertheless is a pretty good piece of work while the outcome of its competition with 50 Cent stands as a historical moment in hip-hop culture: [...] "Graduation isn’t Kanye's best, it's very few people's favorite, but it’s still an okay body of work.

Dennis Haysbert's [...] "commanding" [...] performance as David Palmer was hailed by critics, with some believing the character helped the campaign of Barack Obama. David Leonhart of The New York Times praised Gregory Itzin's portrayal of President Charles Logan, comparing his character to former U.S. President Richard Nixon. The New York Times characterized Logan's administration as [...] "a projection of <b>our</b> <b>very</b> worst fears" [...] of the government. Jean Smart's portrayal of Martha Logan in the fifth season was equally acclaimed. The character's opening scene (in which she, unsatisfied with her hairdo, dunks her head into a sink) was called [...] "the most memorable character debut in 24 history". The finale of season one is seen by many critics {{as one of the best}} episodes of the series and is frequently cited as one of the best television season finales of all-time. Teri Bauer's death at the end of the finale was voted by TV Guide as the second most shocking death in television history.|$|E
