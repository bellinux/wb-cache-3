40|$|As an {{essential}} component for a flexible adaption and capability of being extended in this work the architecture characteristics of suited operating systems have been discussed. On doing that the properties, in particular for the process automation in ring rolling technique have been worked out clearly. The notion 'operating system' has been defined more comprehensively from a control technical point of view. It has been shown, that the coordination and control of all <b>operating</b> <b>means</b> of a machine can be solved only by a hiercharchical operating system with defined tasks. As {{a result of this}} study a software structure and elementary important function modules have been elaborated.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{provided}} for forming an autologous graft by distending a donor blood vessel and harvesting the distended {{portion of the}} vessel. Also provided is a device for in vivo or in vitro vessel distension. Typically the device is implanted, for example using endoscopic techniques, in a patient sometime prior to another surgery on that patient which includes implanting a vascular graft. The device includes a stretching mechanism which {{is attached to a}} donor blood vessel, means for operating the stretching mechanism to cause the vessel to distend, and a controller, preferably externally located, for controlling the <b>operating</b> <b>means.</b> In a preferred embodiment, the device includes a pair of opposed straps, attached to a healthy, small-diameter donor blood vessel such as a femoral artery in the leg. The straps are displaced from each other {{over a period of time}} to continuously distend or elongate the donor vessel. The distended portion of the donor vessel is excised at the time of the bypass surgery. The ends of the donor vessel are then sutured end to end to repair the donor vessel, a procedure common in vascular repair and generally accomplished without complication. The result is a totally autologous, living vascular graft. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) attract {{extensive}} attentions {{for detecting}} optical photons in high energy physics and medical imaging {{due to its}} high gain, high photon detection efciency (PDE), low operation voltage and fast timing response. We use a binary optical element (BOE) made of the silicon exible optical material to transform the incident light intensity expressed as Gaussian distribution into uniform in space, making the incident photons be detected by the SiPM evenly. In this way, we can make full use of all cells of the SiPM, and more cells <b>operating</b> <b>means</b> more photons being detected for a certain pulse, which can increase the count rate of the incident photons and therefore improve the detection efciency of the SiPM. Also, by comparing the outputs of the SiPM in different light intensity inputs, we can obtain the best light intensity t for the SiPM along with the suitable scintillator and surface treatment for the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging based on the SiPM. In our experiments, we use the laser pulse as the SiPM input, whose light intensity can be expressed as Gaussian distribution in space, and then compare the readouts of the SiPM with and without the BOE. As expected, by using the BOE, the timing resolution and energy resolution of the SiPM are better than those without using it for some certain light intensity...|$|E

Operating times were collected and related to the number of procedures done by residents performing closed reduction and internal fixation using cannulated screws for intracapsular fractures of the hip and cephalomedullary nailing for trochanteric fractures, as well as hemiarthroplasty for displaced intracapsular fractures. The <b>mean</b> <b>operating</b> times decreased significantly for all four procedures studied, though at different rates.
