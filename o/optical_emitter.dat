40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the use of deep sub-wavelength(sub-&# 61548;) nano-photonic structures to enhance radiation of <b>optical</b> <b>emitters.</b> The deep sub-wavelength designs are based on high permittivity contrast of materials involving either purely dielectric interfaces or metal. The optical properties of metal at infrared and optical frequencies enable optical structures that can confine light to dimension smaller than the wavelength. The building blocks of these nano-photonic system are non-resonant, broadband waveguides with dramatic field confinement in the nano-scale low permittivity region. Strong interaction and enhanced radiation leads to efficient coupling into the primary optical mode of the structures which improves fluorescence brightness, saturation, speed, emission efficiency, single photon fidelity at a single emitter-single photon level and holds promise for solid-state lighting, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing application. The first part of the dissertation explores deep sub-wavelength waveguiding structures as non-resonant optical component that enhances radiation and collects emitted photon with high fidelity.

40|$|We {{model the}} intermediate-mass black hole HLX- 1, using the Hubble Space Telescope, XMM-Newton and Swift. We {{quantify}} the relative contributions of a bluer component, function of X-ray irradiation, and a redder component, constant and likely coming {{from an old}} stellar population. We estimate a black hole mass of about (2 ^{+ 2 }_{- 1 }) x 10 ^ 4 M_{sun}, a spin parameter a/M ~ 0. 9 for moderately face-on view, and a peak outburst luminosity of about 0. 3 times the Eddington luminosity. We discuss {{the discrepancy between the}} characteristic sizes inferred from the short X-ray timescale (R ~ a few 10 ^{ 11 } cm) and from the <b>optical</b> <b>emitter</b> (R sqrt[cos theta] ~ 2. 2 x 10 ^{ 13 } cm). One possibility is that the <b>optical</b> <b>emitter</b> is a circumbinary disk; however, we disfavour this scenario because it would require a very small donor star. A more plausible scenario is that the disk is large but only the inner annuli are involved in the X-ray outburst. We propose that the recurrent outbursts are caused by an accretion-rate oscillation driven by wind instability in the inner disk. We argue that the system has a long-term-average accretion rate of a few percent Eddington, just below the upper limit of the low/hard state; a wind-driven oscillation can trigger transitions to the high/soft state, with a recurrence period of ~ 1 year (much longer than the binary period, which we estimate as ~ 10 days). The oscillation that dominated the system in the last decade is now damped such that the accretion rate no longer reaches the level required to trigger a transition. Finally, we highlight similarities between disk winds in HLX- 1 and in the Galactic black hole V 404 Cyg. Comment: 22 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|E

Resonant enhancement of the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of a fluorescent molecule is observed when coupled to an optical dimer nanoantenna. Upon varying the dipole position, it is possible to obtain a predominant enhancement of radiative decay rates over the nonradiative counterpart, resulting in an increase of the internal quantum efficiency.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} radiative and nonradiative decay rates of an <b>optical</b> <b>emitter</b> {{in close proximity to}} a prolate-shaped metal nanoparticle. We use the model developed by Gersten and Nitzan, that we correct for radiative reaction and dynamic depolarization and extend for prolate particle shapes. We show that prolate-shaped metal nanoparticles can lead to much higher quantum efficiency enhancements than corresponding spherical nanoparticles. For properly engineered emitter-nanoparticle geometries, quantum efficiency enhancements from an initial value of 1 % (in absence of the nanoparticle) to 70 % are feasible. We describe the anisotropy-induced enhancement effects in terms of large field enhancements near the metal tips that cause strong coupling to the (radiative) dipolar modes. For increasing particle anisotropy, a strong spectral separation between radiative dipolar and dark higher-order modes occurs, which leads to higher radiative efficiencies for anisotropic particles. In addition, we demonstrate that for large (> 100 nm) nanoparticles, the influence of Ohmic losses on plasmon-enhanced luminescence is substantially reduced, which implies that, if prolate shaped, even lossy metals such as Al and Cu are suitable materials for optical nano-antennas...|$|E

The nano-scale quantum system is a quantum dot; the mechanical resonator {{a microscopic}} trumpet which simultaneously optimizes the mechanical and photonic properties. The quantum dot transition is driven resonantly. Via the resonance fluorescence, we observe mechanical Brownian motion even at 4 K, and demonstrate a coupling to mechanical modes of different types.

40|$|We {{analytically}} {{study the}} spontaneous emission {{of a single}} optical dipole emitter {{in the vicinity of}} a plasmonic nanoshell, based on the Lorenz-Mie theory. We show that the fluorescence enhancement due to the coupling between <b>optical</b> <b>emitter</b> and sphere can be tuned by the aspect ratio of the core-shell nanosphere and by the distance between the quantum emitter and its surface. In particular, we demonstrate that both the enhancement and quenching of the fluorescence intensity are associated with plasmonic Fano resonances induced by near- and far-field interactions. These Fano resonances have asymmetry parameters whose signs depend on the orientation of the dipole with respect to the spherical nanoshell. We also show that if the atomic dipole is oriented tangentially to the nanoshell, the interaction exhibits saddle points in the near-field energy flow. This results in a Lorentzian fluorescence enhancement response in the near field and a Fano line-shape in the far field. The signatures of this interaction may have interesting applications for sensing the presence and the orientation of optical emitters in close proximity to plasmonic nanoshells...|$|E

One of the great challenges is to modify the silicon lattice so as to enhance the light emission properties. Moreover, by referring to Moore’s Law, there are concerns of the increase in interconnect time delay which can surpass the switching time if the gate length in transistors are continued to scale down. By implementing the silicon <b>optical</b> <b>emitter</b> on the integrated circuit, it will eliminate this major problem thus enhancing the performance and speed of the computer. This work will focus on researching the point defect especially the G-centre in silicon as a potential technique to emit coherent light from silicon. We have investigated and presented a new approach to incorporate high levels of the emissive G-centre peaking sharply at 1280 nm by implanting carbon and protons into the silicon lattice. Significantly this technique utilizes fully ULSI technology compatible processes such as ion implantation and high temperature annealing. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were used along with the photoluminescence measurement to correlate the optical and structural properties of the G-centre formed by the carbon implantation and high energy ion irradiation. The analysis reveals that the silicon interstitials generated after proton irradiation are an essential factor in forming the G-centre complex. We have also introduced the dislocation engineering technique into the silicon lattice with the G-centre complexes. The results are promising and with optimization of the technique to introduce the dislocation loops into the G-centre technique, the temperature quenching problem often related to the optically active point-defect centre, may be solved. Electroluminescence (EL) measurements were carried out after the fabrication of the LED devices. Results from the sample with the G-centre luminescence is the most crucial as it shows that by using the proposed technique in this research, luminescence from silicon is indeed possible when electrically pumped.
