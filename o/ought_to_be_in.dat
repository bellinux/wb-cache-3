The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough that they <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E

2500|$|According to Archbishop John Habgood, both {{science and}} {{religion}} represent distinct ways of approaching experience and these differences are sources of debate. He views science as descriptive and religion as prescriptive. He stated that if science and mathematics concentrate on what the world <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>in</b> the way that religion does, it may lead to improperly ascribing properties to the natural world as happened among the followers of Pythagoras in the sixth century B.C. In contrast, proponents of a normative moral science take issue {{with the idea that}} science has no way of guiding [...] "oughts". Habgood also stated that he believed that the reverse situation, where religion attempts to be descriptive, can also lead to inappropriately assigning properties to the natural world. A notable example is the now defunct belief in the Ptolemaic (geocentric) planetary model that held sway until changes in scientific and religious thinking were brought about by Galileo and proponents of his views.|$|E

2500|$|Further developed, {{and fully}} {{translated}} into English, this Communion service 'commonly called the Mass' was included, one year later, in 1549, {{in a full}} prayer book, set out with daily offices, readings for Sundays and Holy Days, the Communion Service, Public Baptism, of Confirmation, of Matrimony, The Visitation of the Sick, At a Burial and the Ordinal (added in 1550) [...] The Preface to this edition, which contained Cranmer's explanation as to why a new prayer book was necessary, began: [...] "There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised, or so sure established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted." [...] Although the work is commonly attributed to Cranmer, its detailed origins are obscure [...] A group of bishops and divines met first at Chertsey and then at Windsor in 1548, drawn from both conservatives and reformers, agreed only [...] "the service of the church <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> the mother tongue" [...] Cranmer collected the material from many sources; even the opening of Preface (above) was borrowed [...] He borrowed much from German sources, particularly from work commissioned by Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of Cologne; and also from Osiander (to whom he was related by marriage) [...] The Church Order of Brandenberg and Nuremberg was partly {{the work of the}} latter.

2500|$|Positive {{analysis}} of the poem came from Leigh Hunt, in the 21 October 1821 Examiner when Hunt wrote a piece on Coleridge {{as part of his}} [...] "Sketches of the Living Poets" [...] series. When coming to [...] "Kubla Khan", he pointed out: [...] "instead of being content to have written finely under the influence of laudanum, recommends 'Kubla-Khan' to his readers, not as a poem, but as 'a psychological curiosity' ... Every lover of books, scholar or not, who knows what it is to have his quarto open against a loaf at his tea ... <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> possession of Mr. Coleridge's poems, if it is only for 'Christabel', 'Kubla Khan', and the 'Ancient Mariner'." [...] When talking about the poem on its own, Hunt claimed it [...] "is a voice and a vision, an everlasting tune in our mouths, a dream fit for Cambuscan and all his poets, a dance of pictures such as Giotto or Cimabue, revived and re-inspired, would have made for a Storie of Old Tartarie, a piece of the invisible world made visible by a sun at midnight and sliding before our eyes ... Justly is it thought that to be able to present such images as these to the mind, is to realise the world they speak of. We could repeat such verses as the following down a green glade, a whole summer's morning". The work went without major notice until John Bowring reviewed Coleridge's Poetical Works for the January 1830 Westminster Review. When discussing the work along with the origins of the poem, Bowring stated, [...] "The tale is extraordinary, but 'Kubla Khan' is much more valuable on another account, which is, that of its melodious versification. It is perfect music. The effect could scarcely have been more satisfactory to the ear had every syllable been selected merely for the sake of its sound. And yet there is throughout a close correspondence between the metre, the march of the verse, and the imagery which the words describe." [...] When concluding about the work, he declared, [...] "The elements of this melody are only the common and well-known ones of English versification; our author is always felicitous in their management, but no where has he blended them in so perfect a combination as in this instance." [...] Another emphasis on the musicality of the poem came in August 1834, with Henry Nelson Coleridge's analysis in the Quarterly Review: [...] "In some of the smaller pieces, as the conclusion of the 'Kubla Khan', for example, not only the lines by themselves are musical, but the whole passage sounds all at once as an outburst or crash of harps in the still air of autumn. The verses seem as if played to the ear upon some unseen instrument. And the poet's manner of reciting verse is similar." ...|$|E
