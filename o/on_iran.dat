5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. While {{the rest of the world}} wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In the first week of the massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks <b>on</b> <b>Iran.</b> Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} came at {{a delicate}} time for relations between Iran and Western nations, which were removing sanctions <b>on</b> <b>Iran</b> after its compliance with an agreement for curtailing development of its nuclear enrichment program. The agreement stipulated that once Iranian compliance with {{the terms of the}} agreement was verified, most sanctions against Iran would be lifted, including all sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council as well as nuclear-related European Union and U.S. sanctions; U.S. sanctions against Iran for terrorism, human rights abuses, and ballistic missiles would not be affected. In mid-January 2016, most sanctions were lifted. In March, the District Court for the Southern District of New York found, by default, that Iran had provided support to certain terrorist groups and individuals responsible for the September 11 attacks and awarded $10.5billion in damages to the plaintiffs, which consisted of $3billion to reimburse insurance companies for paid claims and $7.5billion for victims and their families ($2million for pain and suffering and $6.88million in punitive damages per victim). The same judge ruled just six months earlier that there was insufficient evidence linking Saudi Arabia—which has sour relations with Iran—to the 9/11 attacks to overcome, under the terrorism exemption, Saudi Arabia's immunity under the FSIA.|$|E
