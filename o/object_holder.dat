It has a large field of view (FOV), which can acquire the whole body imaging of a normal-size mouse in a single scan which usually takes about several minutes or tens of minutes. FDK method is adopted for 3 D reconstruction with Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration. In order to reconstruct images with high spatial resolution and low artifacts, raw data preprocessing and geometry calibration are implemented before reconstruction. A method which utilizes a wire phantom to estimate the residual horizontal offset of the detector is proposed, and 1 D point spread function is {{used to assess the}} performance of geometric calibration quantitatively.

40|$|In my dissertation, I {{present a}} suite of {{protocols}} that assist in efficient content location and distribution in unstructured Peer-to-Peer overlays. The basis of these schemes is their ability to learn from past interactions, increasing their performance with time. Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) networks are gaining increasing attention from both the scientific and the large Internet user community. Popular applications utilizing this new technology offer many attractive features to {{a growing number of}} users. P 2 P systems have two basic functions: Content search and dissemination. Search (or lookup) protocols define how participants locate remotely maintained resources. In data dissemination, users transmit or receive content from single or multiple sites in the network. P 2 P applications traditionally operate under purely decentralized and highly dynamic environments. Unstructured systems represent a particularly interesting class of P 2 P networks. Peers form an overlay in an ad-hoc manner, without any guarantees relative to lookup performance or content availability. Resources are locally maintained, while participants have limited knowledge, usually confined to their immediate neighborhood in the overlay. My work aims at providing effective and bandwidth-efficient searching and data sharing. A suite of algorithms which provide peers in unstructured P 2 P overlays with the state necessary in order to efficiently locate, disseminate and replicate objects is presented. The Adaptive Probabilistic Search (APS) scheme utilizes directed walkers to forward queries on a hop-by-hop basis. Peers store success probabilities for each of their neighbors in order to efficiently route towards <b>object</b> <b>holders.</b> AGNO performs implicit grouping of peers according to the demand incentive and utilizes state maintained by APS in order to route messages from content holders towards interested peers, without requiring any subscription process.

40|$|Modern cryobanking for {{long-term}} storage {{of large numbers}} of objects in or over liquid nitrogen needs regular and exact quality control without thawing the materials. Cryo Focus Ion Beam combined with Cryo Scanning Electron Microscopy (Cryo-FIB-SEM) is useful. This method allows examination of cell surface and, with FIB-preparation, three-dimensional analysis of the intracellular ultra-structure. Further, it permits estimation of adhesion contacts of the cells with frozen cryosubstrates. Cryo-FIB-SEM investigation can be performed in a closed cryotechnological chain during: (a) controlled freezing of materials; (b) storage at low temperatures; (c) sample transfer to Cryo-FIB-SEM; and (d) return of objects to the cryobank. Some difficulties have to be overcome. Firstly, additional ice formation during sample transfer to the Cryo-FIB-SEM examination has to be prevented. Secondly, the temperature of the sample holder must be constant during examination. Thirdly, the biological objects have to be contrasted to distinguish them from ice. RIN-m multi-cellular spheroids producing insulin or RIN-m cell monolayers grown on plastic substrates were treated with electron contrast agents without any loss of vitality. Afterwards the samples were mounted on specially constructed <b>object</b> <b>holders</b> and frozen with cryoprotectants in a computer-controlled freezer at 1 °C/min from 4 °C to ? 80 °C. The sample transfer to Cryo-FIB-SEM was carried out in a conventional cryo-dry-shipper (? 160 °C) with a static holding time of 12 days. From the dry-shipper to the SEM cryo-chamber the samples were transported in newly developed Teflon wrapping. We have demonstrated differences between various cryopreservation methods. Numerous extracellular ice crystals could be observed in samples preserved by slow freezing procedures while Cryo-FIB-SEM of vitrified biomaterials confirms absence of ice. Usage of contrast agents has improved cryopreservation of spheroids most likely due to plasma membrane enhancement but no differences could be recognized between control and cryopreserved samples. By studying contrasted and frozen RIN-m monolayer fine chromatin structures of mitotic cells could be seen through the ice. The results can be considered as a first step {{in the development of a}} new class of cryo-imaging techniques...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThe mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is {{emerging}} as a new paradigm of wireless communication in both civilian and military applications. Recently, efforts {{have been made to}} migrate peer-to-peer (P 2 P) applications from the wired Internet to the MANET system, which are expected to be the major impetus to MANET commercialization. Several fundamental technologies that facilitate the deployment of P 2 P content distribution systems over MANET are investigated. In particular, we have focused on efficient P 2 P content discovery and privacy protection in P 2 P file sharing.; First, a Bloom filter (BF) -based probabilistic routing (VABF) is proposed to improve query efficiency. The VABF protocol constructs its routing tables using Bloom filters in a distributed manner without the knowledge of the global network. Each node forwards P 2 P queries to its closest <b>object</b> <b>holders</b> by the shortest path. Simulation results show that VABF outperforms several popular unstructured P 2 P search algorithms in terms of the query success rate and the route strength.; Second, the performance of several unstructured P 2 P content discovery techniques over MANETs is analyzed. They include: query flooding, expanding ring search, random walk and BF-based probabilistic routing. The chosen performance metrics are the query success rate, the route stretch and the search cost. Mathematic analysis is conducted to predict their behavior in static networks. Besides, the overhead introduced by the BF-based probabilistic routing is modeled using a M/G/infinity queue. Finally, extensive computer simulation is performed to validate our analytical results in a static environment and shed light on the behavior of these schemes in a mobile environment.; Third, the MANET Anonymous Peer-to-peer Communication Protocol (MAPCP) is proposed for privacy protection. MAPCP uses broadcasts with probabilistic flooding control to establish multiple anonymous paths between communication peers. It requires no hop-by-hop encryption/decryption along anonymous paths and builds multiple paths to multiple peers within a single query phase without using an extra route discovery process. The analysis and simulations show that MAPCP always maintains a higher degree of anonymity than a MANET anonymous single-path routing protocol in a hostile environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{synchrotron}} X-ray microscope is {{a powerful}} imaging apparatus for taking high-resolution and high-contrast X-ray images of nanoscale objects. A sufficient number of X-ray projection images from different angles is required for constructing 3 D volume images of an object. Because a synchrotron light source is immobile, a rotational <b>object</b> <b>holder</b> is required for tomography. At a resolution of 10 nm per pixel, the vibration of the holder caused by rotating the object cannot be disregarded if tomographic images are to be reconstructed accurately. This paper presents a computer method {{to compensate for the}} vibration of the rotational holder by aligning neighboring X-ray images. This alignment process involves two steps. The first step is to match the "projected feature points" in the sequence of images. The matched projected feature points in the x-θ plane should form a set of sine-shaped loci. The second step is to fit the loci to a set of sine waves to compute the parameters required for alignment.

30|$|The test {{images were}} {{acquired}} {{with a home}} made micro-CT which consists of a CMOS FPD and a micro focus X-ray tube (L 8121 - 01, Hamamatsu, Japan). The micro-focus X-ray source is a sealed tube with a fixed tungsten anode having an angle of 25 ° against the electron beam and with a 200 μ m-thick beryllium exit window. The emitted X-ray beam span angle is about 43 °. The source has a variable focal spot size from 5 μ m to 50 μ m depending on the applied tube power (Watt or kVp mA). The maximum tube voltage and tube current are 150 kVp and 0.5 mA, respectively. The micro-focus X-ray source has been operated in a continuous mode with an Al filter with a thickness of 1 mm. The FPD (C 7943 CA- 02, Hamamatsu, Japan) used in this experiment consists of 1216 × 1220 effective matrix of transistors, photodiodes with a pixel pitch of 100 μ m and a CsI:Tl scintillator. The CsI:Tl has a columnar structure with a typical diameter of about 10 μ m and a thickness of 200 μ m. A computer-controlled rotating system was adopted in the <b>object</b> <b>holder</b> to achieve a cone-beam mode scan in the micro-CT. The precision of the rotational motion is 0.083 ° which allows the number of views larger than 4, 000. The system has the built-in white and dark image correction schemes. Since our micro-CT system does not provide the CT images in Hounsfield unit (HU), we have normalized all the original (uncorrected) reconstructed images so that the maximum pixel intensity is 1.0 with arbitrary unit. The corrected images are scaled using the corresponding normalization factor of the uncorrected images.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Tomographic {{image quality}} crucially {{depends on a}} precise {{knowledge}} of the scan geometry of the acquisition system, especially in micro-CT (μCT). But also C-arm systems require monitoring the focus-detector alignment in order to compensate for imperfections (misalignment) prior to image reconstruction. We developed a method to calibrate rotational cone-beam systems simultaneously with each individual scan without sophisticated calibration phantoms. Methods and Materials: Tracing the projection orbits of point objects, we determine 5 of the 6 parameters describing orientation and placement of the detector relative to the focus plus the point coordinates inside the probe. Our algorithm iterates explicit analytic expressions for the parameters and the coordinates to solve the underlying non-linear optimization problem. It assumes that the angle (tilt) between detector and rotation axis is known (e. g., zero). We simulated rotational (2 π) scans of point objects (with noise) on misaligned detectors to compare the reconstructed parameters/coordinates to the known true ones. We measured on the μCT scanners at our institute, and on a commercial μCT system (VAMP, Moehrendorf/Germany), to assess the reduction of image artifacts after misalignment corrections. Vertical arrays of small bearing balls were scanned with spatial resolution ranging from 10 - 100 μm. After segmentation and absorption-weighted center determination we obtained up to 20 complete point orbits on the detector area which were then used in our misalignment analysis. Results: The simulations yielded that we recovered the true skew and slant of the detector, its horizontal and vertical displacements, and the focus-detector distance with errors below 1 %, 2 %, 1 %, 3 %, and 1 %, respectively. Up to several degrees of detector tilt {{did not lead to}} noticeable artifacts and were neglected. Increasing the number of points increased the accuracy and provided a good estimate of residual errors. Since their locations were also reconstructed, the method proved insensitive to phantom specifications and placement uncertainties. In the measured μCT scans image artifacts were greatly reduced. Moreover, the accuracy of the method allowed to assess other corrections, e. g., for detector distortion. Conclusion: Misaligned mechanically stable scanning devices can be calibrated with simple point objects. For systems with unstable geometry, e. g., due to focal-spot motion, markers can be added to the actual probe, or the <b>object</b> <b>holder,</b> such that no extra calibration scan is necessary.

40|$|Metal objects have {{traditionally}} not been repaired or constructed by adhesives, but primarily by soldering, welding, and mechanical assemblies. Soldering has many disadvantages for the conservator such {{as lack of}} reversibility, problems to solder a corroded surface, corrosive flux, heating causing damage to the patina, crystal structure and more. Bonding of historical metal objects with adhesives is here examined. A literature survey is done. Another goal with the work is to get {{an indication of the}} suitability of various adhesives by means of simple test methods. Two test <b>objects</b> (candle <b>holders)</b> of tin, were chosen as basis for the investigation. Six adhesives were selected for testing: Paraloid B- 72, (a thermoplastic acrylic copolymer), two different epoxies, (Araldite 2011 A + B and Bostik Epoxy Rapid) an ethyl cyanoacrylate product, (Loctite Super Glue Precision), Bostik contact, a contact adhesive based on polychloroprene rubber, Dana limstänger, (a hot melt adhesive consisting of an EVA copolymer). These adhesives were subjected to simple tests, a pH test, a so-called Oddy test and a simple tensile test with specimens of tin to investigate strength. In addition, a test for removability of the adhesive and a very simple contact test were carried out. pH tests showed that many of the adhesives are quite acidic when wet. After curing the pH of the epoxies are about pH 9 - 10. The others were more neutral after curing. Oddy test showed that all but Paraloid B- 72 affected lead slightly. ”Epoxy Rapid” affected silver and copper with a dark colour. The results of strength tests were somewhat difficult to interpret. The strength differed greatly between the adhesives. For example the specimens bonded by the hot-melt adhesive fell apart by themselves. The cyanoacrylate was so strong that in one sample the joint was not broken at all, instead the tin specimen broke. When the tests were done the two candlesticks were treated. Only some indicating conjectures can be made by these results.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} is a development that taken the issue of environment as a priority besides on making whatever planning into reality. One of the key themes of 'sustainable development' is managing a waste (Williams, 1998). Sustainable waste management encourages the generation of less waste, the re-use, recycling and recovery of waste that is produced. Farmoso et al. (1999) defines waste as any losses produced by activities that generate direct or indirect costs but do not add any value to the product {{from the point of}} view of the client. While Symond (1999) define wastes as any substance or <b>object,</b> which the <b>holder</b> discards or intends, or is required, to discard.

Beside of negative impact to the environment due to depletion of natural resources, it may increases the amount of waste and pollution if no measurement to tackle the problem is taken. In Malaysia, the construction waste has cause a significant impact on the environmental and also increasing the concern of the society (Beguma, Siwar et al. 2006). Hence, this paper, review construction waste minimisation strategies, addresses the issues that are attributed to construction waste management and presents an integrated approach to whole life cycle management of construction waste.

40|$|The {{physical}} manipulation of biological cells is very attractive now in biotechnology (Butler, 1991)) because it opens {{the possibility of}} examining and manipulating single molecules. Other methods are based on chemical effects, electrical effects, etc., and they generally do not allow researchers to examine single molecules cell and, thus, to understand their interaction which may encode many useful pieces of information. Such {{physical manipulation}} is fully performed by robotic devices. In order to automate the process of physical manipulation, micro machine vision for the fast identification of the objects involved is required. Typical objects that are involved are cells, cell elements, holders and injectors. In the research described in this thesis, which {{was carried out in}} the Advanced Engineering Design Laboratory of the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Saskatchewan, algorithms for the three <b>objects</b> (the cell, <b>holder</b> and injector) were developed, implemented and tested.

This means that it must have specific strengths in one or more value creation functions. The aim of the firm is to make such products that meet the needs of customers at the highest possible level and thereby maximize their profits. This entails the need of firm to cooperate with its customers in each process of manufacturing the final product and thus positively influencing (maximizing) the final effect in meeting customers' needs. In connection with the EFQM excellence model and its possibilities for experience rate measurement in the value co-creation, we have to stress the Results, approach, deployment, assessment and review methodology (RADAR). The paper focuses on the ability to apply the main ideas of the customer value concept for measurement and value chain management. Detail focus is addressed to the issue of identification, definition, evaluation and management of unique value co-creation with customers throughout the all value chain processes. The goal of this paper is to propose a specific application of the customer value concept for measurement and value chain management...|$|R

A {{memory for}} storing data for access by an {{application}} program being executed on a data processing system, comprising:a data structure stored in said memory, said data structure including information resident in a database used by said application program and including:a plurality of attribute data objects stored in said memory, each of said attribute data objects containing different information from said database;a single <b>holder</b> attribute data <b>object</b> for each of said attribute data objects, each of said <b>holder</b> attribute data <b>objects</b> being one of said plurality of attribute data objects, a being-held relationship existing between each attribute data <b>object</b> and its <b>holder</b> attribute data <b>object,</b> and each of said attribute data objects having a being-held relationship with only a single other attribute data object, thereby establishing a hierarchy of said plurality of attribute data objects;a referent attribute data object {{for at least one}} of said attribute data objects, said referent attribute data object being nonhierarchically related to a <b>holder</b> attribute data <b>object</b> for the same at least one of said attribute data objects and also being one of said plurality of attribute data objects, attribute data objects for which there exist only <b>holder</b> attribute data <b>objects</b> being called element data objects, and attribute data objects for which there also exist referent attribute data objects being called relation data objects; andan apex data object stored in said memory and having no being-held relationship with any of said attribute data objects, however, at least one of said attribute data objects having a being-held relationship with said apex data object.The examiner rejected all of Lowry’s claims as so-called printed matter. That is, they were directed to information stored on a medium ("substrate") without any unobvious cooperation between the medium and the information to provide a useful function. The PTO Board of Appeals sustained the examiner’s rejection of all claims. The claimed data structures were stored into a computer memory, but they did not sufficiently interact with the memory to provide a functional relationship with it. Accordingly, the ADOs were not [...] "patentably distinguished" [...] from the prior art, [...] making them obvious or anticipated, and thus unpatentable.|$|R
