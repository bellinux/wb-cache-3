He was joined on the grid's front row by Riggs and had the pole position until Gordon's lap.

Edwards, Reed Sorenson, Biffle, Martin and Kurt Busch rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Earnhardt, a Chase for the Nextel Cup driver, qualified thirteenth, and Johnson, another driver in the Chase, started eighteenth. Yeley crashed on his first lap after leaving turn one, and his rear-end contacted the wall; he was checked at the infield care center, and later released to continue racing.

Due to it's diverse nature, many problems have arisen inherent to the way the system works. For instance, the use of different tools and platforms to accomplish various tasks is required. Getting these tools to work well together in disparate situations is a key issue. How can a company determine which tools, platforms, and systems changes are desired? One {{way to do this is}} to communicate; share the information concerning the problems one encounters with others who find themselves in the same boat. Therefore, a survey was distributed focusing within six facets of client/server application development: performance, capacity, scalability, portability, connectivity, and functionality. The objective: to discover various common links and/or connections that contribute to successful client/server application development The result: information was gathered from the people who are <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> producing it. The four page survey was disseminated to over 500 information systems professionals throughout the domestic United States. Participants were selected by the respondent's title(manager or director of MIS or Systems & Programming), the corporation's listed systems, and were obtained from the Spring 1995 Computing IS Managers Guide. The design of the survey was critical in obtaining specific, relevant information. Utilizing the inverted funnel sequencing style, the task of getting a given respondent to open up was accomplished. The respondent contributed the answers as opposed to the survey suggesting them. 15 % of the surveys (74 of 500) were returned; 40 of which the respondent indicated no background in client/server and 34 of which were completed in full. Through analysis of these surveys, I have gained a greater appreciation for exactly how diverse client/server really is. I was able to discover some common threads in each area.
