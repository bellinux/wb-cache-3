Access and Paradox significantly differed {{in the way they}} presented results from queries. Access showed records before a query was completed and without the overhead of creating an <b>output</b> <b>table.</b> Paradox showed the results only after all the records were retrieved and an ANSWER table created. This performance difference was significant for large datasets and negatively impacted Paradox/W.|$|E

Therefore, input - <b>output</b> <b>tables</b> often have to be deflated by the practitioners themselves. The method of double deflation is used predominantly for this purpose. The present paper shows that the double-deflation method is subject to aggregation problems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the double-deflation method to provide the correct answers are derived. The conditions {{are found to be}} stringent and unlikely to be met in empirical cases. The results for aggregation in the case of double deflation are shown to be dual to the traditional results for aggregation {{in the case of a}} quantity model, which have been extensively discussed in the literature. ...|$|R

A similar argument holds when this kind of test is applied in a forecasting context where the projected values of sectoral gross outputs of region A are assumed to yield the true estimates.

40|$|For {{some years}} (since 1976) a {{research}} {{team at the}} University of Queensland have progressively developed and applied a technique termed the Generation of Regional Input - <b>Output</b> <b>Tables</b> (GRIT), in the compilation of regional input - <b>output</b> <b>tables.</b> GRIT {{was designed as a}} hybrid technique, that is, one containing elements of nonsurvey or mechanical methods, but also requiring the insertion into the regional table of sufficient 'superior' or 'survey' data to ensure an acceptable level of accuracy. Willis has recently published a paper purporting to test the accuracy of the GRIT technique. This paper is a response to Willis's claims, and it is asserted that Willis did not observe the normally accepted guidelines for critical evaluation, by 'testing' GRIT purely as a nonsurvey technique, rather than as a hybrid model requiring substantial amounts of region-specific data. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} convention for compressing FITS binary tables that is {{modeled after the}} FITS tiled-image compression method (White et al. 2009) {{that has been in}} use for about a decade. The input table is first optionally subdivided into tiles, each containing an equal number of rows, then every column of data within each tile is compressed and stored as a variable-length array of bytes in the output FITS binary table. All the header keywords from the input table are copied to the header of the <b>output</b> <b>table</b> and remain uncompressed for efficient access. The output compressed table contains the same number and order of columns as in the input uncompressed binary table. There is one row in the <b>output</b> <b>table</b> corresponding to each tile of rows in the input table. In principle, each column of data can be compressed using a different algorithm that is optimized for the type of data within that column, however in the prototype implementation described here, the gzip algorithm is used to compress every column.

40|$|Statistical {{agencies}} are making {{increased use of}} the internet to disseminate census tabular outputs through web-based flexible table-generating servers that allow users to define and generate their own tables. The key questions in the development of these servers are: (1) what data should be used to generate the tables, and (2) what statistical disclosure control (SDC) method should be applied. To generate flexible tables, the server {{has to be able to}} measure the disclosure risk in the final <b>output</b> <b>table,</b> apply the SDC method and then iteratively reassess the disclosure risk. SDC methods may be applied either to the underlying data used to generate the tables and/or to the final <b>output</b> <b>table</b> that is generated from original data. Besides assessing disclosure risk, the server should provide a measure of data utility by comparing the perturbed table to the original table. In this article, we examine aspects of the design and development of a flexible table-generating server for census tables and demonstrate a disclosure risk-data utility analysis for comparing SDC methods. We propose measures for disclosure risk and data utility that are based on information theory...|$|E
