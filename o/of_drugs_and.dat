5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based healthcare reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E

5|$|In {{the great}} {{majority}} of cells, smooth ER regions are scarce and are often partly smooth and partly rough.

The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> poisons.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> {{alcohol use}} in pilots {{can have a}} {{detrimental}} impact on aviation safety. Important cognitive and psychomotor functions necessary for safe operation of an aircraft can be significantly impaired by <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> alcohol. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence <b>and</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-related accidents and incidents in Australian civil aviation. A search of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's accident and incident database was conducted for all occurrences in which drugs or alcohol were recorded between 1 January 1975 and 31 March 2006. There were 36 <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-related events (31 accidents and five incidents). The majority of these occurrences were related to alcohol (22 occurrences). The drugs identified included prescription <b>drugs,</b> over-the-counter medications <b>and</b> illegal <b>drugs</b> (including heroin <b>and</b> cannabis). <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol events accounted for only 0. 02 per cent of all the occurrences listed on the Australian Transport Safety Bureau's database. <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-related accidents accounted for 0. 4 per cent of all accidents. Furthermore, 89 per cent <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol occurrences resulted in an accident, with the proportion of these 32 occurrences that resulted in an accident quite high, at 86. 5 per cent. Fatal accidents accounted for 67 per cent <b>of</b> all <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol occurrences. The results of this study show that the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol-related accidents and incidents in Australian civil aviation is very low, but that the related accident and fatality rates are high. The planned introduction <b>of</b> a mandatory <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol testing program into the Australian civil aviation industry will provide a more prescriptive approach to the issue <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use in pilots. Education and training remain important elements of an overall approach to reducing the significant impact <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use on flight safety...|$|R
5|$|On 10 August 1917, Downes became Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS) of the Desert Mounted Corps, {{while still}} {{retaining}} {{the post of}} ADMS AIF Egypt. He was therefore answerable to three superiors—to Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, {{the commander of the}} Desert Mounted Corps and AIF Egypt; to Major General Neville Howse, the DMS AIF in London; and to the new British DMS EEF, Major General William Travers Swan. As the EEF advanced into Palestine, the major medical problem remained transportation. During the operations in the Es Salt area, Downes experimented with the delivery <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> medical supplies by air. In the Jordan valley in 1918, however, Downes was confronted with an epidemic of malaria and vigorous preventative and prophylactic efforts were required in order to bring it under control.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
