As a result, paint masked some of Crisp's inscriptions inside the house, but <b>outside,</b> <b>signs</b> reading [...] "Don't keep off the grass", [...] "Herons will be prosecuted" [...] and [...] "Eton boys are a Harrowing sight" [...] remained intact. Harrison also discovered inscriptions with a more profound meaning, which he described to his Hare Krishna friend Shyamasundar Das as [...] "like songs really, about the devil, about friendship, life". One example was [...] "Shadows we are and shadows we depart", written on a stone sundial; another began: [...] "Scan not a friend with a microscopic glass / You know his faults, now let his foibles pass..." [...] This four-line verse was written above an entrance-way in a garden wall, {{and it was an}} aphorism that Harrison soon took to quoting in interviews. On 28 April 1970, just over two weeks after the Beatles' break-up, he used the words during an interview for New York's WPLQ Radio, as Village Voice reporter Howard Smith repeatedly pushed for details on the animosity between Paul McCartney and the other three Beatles. In October 1974 – towards the end of what Harrison termed a [...] "bad domestic year", following his split with Boyd – he used the same quote in an interview with BBC Radio's Alan Freeman, when again discussing the current relationship among the four ex-Beatles.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} and the men lighted their pipes; and Hester studied the {{newcomer}} as she removed the plates. He was smartly dressed and had an alert look, but while there was nothing particular in his appearance that she could object to, she was not prepossessed in his favor. Davies had already noticed that the room was of a type common to the prairie homesteads. Its uncovered floor was, perhaps, cleaner than usual when plowing was going on, and the square stove was brightly polished, but the room contained no furniture that was not strictly needed. There was nothing that suggested luxury; and comfort {{did not seem to}} be much studied. On the other hand, he had noticed <b>outside</b> <b>signs</b> of bold enterprise and a prosperity he had not expected to find. Davies was a judge of such matters, and he saw that his host was a man of practical ability.|$|E

The renovated Bloemendaal House {{was attached to}} a small adjacent cottage with an addition designed by Marcellus Wright, Cox and Smith, and the building was opened as a Visitors Center in September 1988. The new building provided space for a horticulture library, a historic interpretation room, and a herbarium and laboratory.|$|E
50|$|On {{the latest}} {{building}} at the Promenade, the name 'Schunck' (which is still quite renowned in Heerlen) remained featured in large lettering {{on the front and}} back (see photo above) and even on pillars inside. But the <b>outside</b> <b>signs</b> were also removed in 2006. By this time, the Schunck-signs on the Glaspaleis had already been removed. In 2009, however, they were put back for the occasion of the family reunion that year and an official renaming of the building from 'Glaspaleis' to 'Schunck'.|$|E
