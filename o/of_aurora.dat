5|$|Ahead of the storm, over 24,000people {{evacuated}} Philippines's northeastern province <b>of</b> <b>Aurora.</b> Many radio stations, typically which close during Easter, remained operational {{to broadcast}} the storm. Officials issued storm warnings, {{and the military}} was on alert. Beaches were closed, boats were ordered to remain at port, and 10flights were canceled. The Department of Social Welfare and Development reported that ₱300.9million (US$6.8million) worth of funds and supplies were available for possible relief efforts. Approximately 28,000family food packs were prepositioned in warehouses across Luzon.|$|E

The Spanish Red Cross were forced to maintain relief supplies in the provinces <b>of</b> <b>Aurora</b> and Quezon in addition to managing ongoing relief efforts for regions impacted by Tropical Depression Winnie. Individual Red Cross chapters were tasked with closely monitoring the movement of relief stockpiles during these preparatory measures.|$|E

The routes remain a two-lane residential street for a distance, intersecting with CR383 (Reiter Road) as it winds west. Now in the town <b>of</b> <b>Aurora,</b> US 20A and NY 78 enter a large interchange with NY400 (the Aurora Expressway). A short distance later, the routes enter the village of East Aurora. Now known as Main Street, US 20A and NY 78 proceed west as a two-lane village street, intersecting with NY16 (Olean Road) and the southern continuation of CR6 (Pine Street).|$|E
5|$|In December 1816 Jonathan Jennings, Indiana's first governor, {{nominated}} John Johnson of Vincennes Knox County; James Scott of Charlestown Clark County; and Jesse Holman <b>of</b> <b>Aurora</b> Dearborn County, {{to serve}} as the first panel of judges on the Indiana Supreme Court. Johnson became the Court's first chief justice. When Johnson died in 1817, Jennings named Isaac Blackford to replace him. Blackford became the second chief justice of the Court and was the longest serving justice in the Court's history, serving 36 years, 3 months, and 24 days. Blackford recorded all of the Court's early decisions in a multivolume work titled Blackford's Reports that served for many years as a foundational text on the interpretation of state laws.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from £2,000 to £1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and to mortgage the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase <b>of</b> <b>Aurora</b> had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to mortgage it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a negative image of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a full complement of crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new {{catalogue}} of observations <b>of</b> the <b>aurora</b> borealis at Lisbon, i. e., at low-latitudes, {{in the late}} 18 th century by Jacob Prætorius and Henrique Schulze, two German artillery officers. Dates <b>of</b> 18 <b>auroras</b> compiled by Prætorius and Schulze are compared with those published in other catalogues for that period. The number <b>of</b> annual <b>auroras</b> observed by the two Germans is then compared with two indices of solar activity showing a very good level of consistency between all time series. Finally, we have assessed the number <b>of</b> <b>auroras</b> observed taking into consideration the phase of the lunar cycle and the geomagnetic latitude of Lisbon. 1...|$|R
5|$|The Blues Brothers {{opened on}} June 20, 1980, with a release in 594 theaters. It took in $4,858,152, ranking second for that week (after The Empire Strikes Back) and 10th {{for the entire}} year. Over the years, it has {{retained}} a following through television and home video. The film in total grossed $57,229,890 domestically and $58,000,000 in foreign box offices {{for a total of}} $115,229,890. By genre, it is the ninth-highest grossing musical and the tenth-highest earner among comedy road movies. It ranks second, between Wayne's World and Wayne's World 2 (which, coincidentally, also take place in the greater Chicago metropolitan area, in the outlying suburb <b>of</b> <b>Aurora,</b> Illinois), among films adapted from Saturday Night Live sketches. Director John Landis claimed The Blues Brothers was also the first American film to gross more money overseas than it did in the United States.|$|E
5|$|When Sleeping Beauty was {{released}} in 1959, the film was both a critical and commercial failure, discouraging the studio from adapting fairy tales into animated films for decades. Aurora herself received negative reviews for her passivity and overall similarity to Snow White. Aurora would remain Disney's last princess until The Little Mermaids Ariel debuted 30 years later in 1989. However, Costa's vocal performance was praised, which inspired her to pursue a full-time career as an opera singer to great success. Chronologically, Aurora is the third Disney Princess. Despite having since established herself as a popular character for her beauty and fashion, Aurora's personality continues to receive negative press, particularly from feminist critics, thus earning her {{a reputation as one}} of Disney's most passive princess characters. Actress Elle Fanning portrays a live-action version <b>of</b> <b>Aurora</b> in the film Maleficent (2014), a retelling of Sleeping Beauty from the perspective of its villain.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Cimaron {{struck the}} Philippines with winds {{estimated}} at 195km/h (120mph) and gusts {{in excess of}} 230km/h (145mph). Along coastal Aurora Province, a mother and daughter were killed when strong winds destroyed their home. Numerous trees and power lines were felled by the winds as well, causing widespread blackouts in Luzon. The majority <b>of</b> <b>Aurora</b> and Isabela provinces were left without power and telecommunications {{for more than two}} weeks. Approximately 90percent of the homes in Dinapigue were damaged. Heavy rains across the region swelled many rivers, flooding low-lying areas along their banks. Several bridges became impassable and officials had to release water from two major dams to prevent them from overflowing. The most significant flooding occurred along the Allied-Sinocalan and Tagamusing rivers in Pangasinan. Low-lying areas along the Cagayan, Chico, Magat, Pinacanauan, Tuguegarao Pared rivers throughout Cagayan province were also affected by flooding. Numerous roads were blocked off by landslides or washed away by flooding, severely limiting travel. A landslide temporarily isolated four barangays in Nueva Vizcaya. A Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council search and rescue team was later deployed to Kasibu where at least four people were killed by flooding. Fatal landslides took place in Benguet and Kalinga provinces. A traffic accident blamed on the storm in La Union resulted in one death and seven injuries.|$|E

Four typical kinds <b>of</b> <b>auroras</b> are seen in this region during this period. They are (a) bright poleward expansion auroras, (b) transpolar auroras, (c) sun-aligned arcs, and (d) morning side bright <b>auroras.</b> The intensity <b>of</b> (a), (b) and (d) auroras are very strong and these auroras are similar to those observed along the auroral oval. The sun-aligned arcs (c) are the typical aurora seen only on the high latitude side of the auroral oval.
