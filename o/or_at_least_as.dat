25|$|If {{religious}} {{exercises are}} held to be an impermissible activity in schools, religion is placed in an artificial and state-created disadvantage.... And a refusal to permit religious exercises thus is seen, not as the realization of state neutrality, but rather as {{the establishment of a}} religion of secularism, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>as</b> governmental support of the beliefs of those who think that religious exercises should be conducted only in private.|$|E
25|$|Another consequentialist {{version is}} motive consequentialism which looks at {{whether the state}} of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> good as each of the {{alternative}} state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act {{was based on a}} right motive. A possible inference is, that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgements if the motivation was to do good.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Klien was {{unsuccessful}} {{in comparison to}} his more experienced teammate David Coulthard, as the Brit scored the team's first podium and was more consistent than Klien throughout the season. In August 2006, {{it was confirmed that}} Klien would not stay with the Red Bull team for the upcoming 2007 season, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> a race driver, due to Red Bull's signing of Mark Webber. After the 2 points finishes in Bahrain and Germany, there was some uncertainty as to where Klien would go next in his racing career, speculation suggested America as a logical choice for the Austrian, but he refused a ChampCar seat in a Red Bull-backed team for 2007, preferring to chase a Formula One drive with another team. As a result, the team announced that Klien had been dropped for the last three races of the season in favour of test driver Robert Doornbos.|$|E

500|$|Heraclius now halved {{the pay of}} officials, {{enforced}} increased taxation, forced loans, and levied extreme fines on corrupt {{officials in}} order to finance his counter-offensive. Despite disagreements over the incestuous marriage of Heraclius to his niece Martina, the clergy of the Byzantine Empire strongly backed his efforts against the Persians by proclaiming the duty of all Christian men to fight and by offering {{to give him a}} war loan consisting of all the gold and silver-plated objects in Constantinople. Precious metals and bronze were stripped from monuments and even the Hagia Sophia. This military campaign has been seen as the first [...] "crusade", <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> an antecedent to the Crusades, by many historians, beginning with William of Tyre, but some, like Kaegi, disagree with this moniker because religion was just one component in the war. Thousands of volunteers were gathered and equipped with money from the church. Heraclius himself decided to command the army from the front lines. Thus, the Byzantine troops had been replenished, re-equipped, and were now led by a competent general while maintaining a full treasury.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} fallen angels is first found in Judaism among {{texts of the}} Second Temple era, being applied in {{particular}} to Azazel. However, from the Middle Ages certain Jewish scholars, both rationalist and traditionalist, rejected belief in rebel or fallen angels, since they considered evil as simply the absence of good <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> not absolute. However, modern Orthodox Rabbeim believe that angels don't have free will, and are [...] "pre-programmed" [...] to perform certain duties.

2500|$|Reaction to the {{exhibition}} came from two distinct camps of critics, with few having views from both. [...] One camp rejected {{the very idea of}} The Art of the Motorcycle, having {{nothing to do with the}} machines on display in the Guggenheim or Thomas Krens' way of displaying them, nor his way of financing such a show. The other camp accepted in principle that such a show was acceptable, as art, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> subject for a museum like the Guggenheim, and from that basis formed a range of opinions about the quality of the show itself.|$|E
2500|$|In Greek {{religious}} practice, Pluto {{is sometimes}} {{seen as the}} [...] "chthonic Zeus" [...] (Zeus Chthonios or Zeus Catachthonios), <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> having functions or significance equivalent to those of Zeus but pertaining to the earth or underworld. In ancient Roman and Hellenistic religion, Pluto was identified {{with a number of}} other deities, including Summanus, the Roman god of nocturnal thunder; Februus, the Roman god from whose purification rites the month of February takes its name; the syncretic god Serapis, regarded as Pluto's Egyptian equivalent; and the Semitic god Muth (Μούθ).

2500|$|Another {{object of}} {{controversy}} is the Academy's [...] "one-country-one-film" [...] rule, {{which has been}} criticized by filmmakers. The Guardian said {{that the idea of}} a Best Foreign Language Film category itself is a [...] "fundamentally flawed premise" [...] and this is the [...] "most critically sneered-at of all Oscar categories". It also stated [...] "In a perfect world — <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>as</b> perfect a world as would still allow for gaudy film-award pageantry — there’d be no need for a separate best foreign language film Oscar. The fact that, after 87 years, the Academy has yet to honour a film not predominantly in English as the year’s best Best Picture says everything about their own limitations, and nothing about those of world cinema".|$|E
2500|$|Julian Huxley {{used the}} phrase [...] "the eclipse of Darwinism" [...] to {{describe}} the state of affairs prior to {{what he called the}} modern synthesis, when evolution was widely accepted in scientific circles but relatively few biologists believed that natural selection was its primary mechanism. Historians of science such as Peter J. Bowler have used the same phrase as a label for the period within the history of evolutionary thought from the 1880s to around 1920, when alternatives to natural selection were developed and explored—as many biologists considered natural selection to have been a wrong guess on Charles Darwin's part, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> of relatively minor importance. An alternative term, the interphase of Darwinism, has been proposed to avoid the largely incorrect implication that the putative eclipse was preceded by a period of vigorous Darwinian research.|$|E
2500|$|Dietary {{minerals}} are {{inorganic chemical}} elements required by living organisms, {{other than the}} four elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen that are present in nearly all organic molecules. The term [...] "mineral" [...] is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned, including several metals, which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as calcium carbonate from ground oyster shells). Some minerals are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most famous is likely iodine in iodized salt which prevents goiter.|$|E

And with Snake Eyes, he’s such a strong inspiration for Jinx. We trained in the same dojo and he’s become an icon, he’s a role model.

2500|$|By the 19th century, Circe was ceasing to be {{a mythical}} figure. Poets treated her either as an {{individual}} <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> the type {{of a certain kind}} of woman. The French poet Albert Glatigny addresses “Circé” in his Les vignes folles (1857) and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream, the magnet of masochistic fantasies. Louis-Nicolas Ménard's sonnet in Rêveries d'un païen mystique (1876) describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look, but appearance belies the accursed reality. Poets in English were not far behind in this lurid portrayal. Lord de Tabley's [...] "Circe" [...] (1895) is a thing of decadent perversity likened to a tulip, ‘A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine... With freckled cheeks and splotch’d side serpentine, A gipsy among flowers’. That central image is echoed by the blood-striped flower of T.S.Eliot's student poem “Circe’s Palace" [...] (1909) in the Harvard Advocate. Circe herself does not appear, her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond: panthers, pythons, and peacocks that ‘look at us with the eyes of men whom we knew long ago’. Rather than a temptress, she has become an emasculatory threat.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa, and her {{relationship}} with Clarke, have been well received by critics and fans. Maureen Ryan, writing for The Huffington Post, stated, [...] "In a show packed with morally compromised characters, Lexa stood out; she led a tribe of Earth inhabitants named Grounders {{with a combination of}} deftness, intelligence and unhesitating ferocity." [...] Ryan felt Lexa [...] "does not suffer fools gladly, yet Debnam-Carey made Lexa's vulnerability and her attraction to Clarke Griffin (Eliza Taylor) not just believable, but engrossing." [...] Linda Ge of TheWrap referred to her as a fan-favorite, while Eric Goldman of IGN called her [...] "a standout, highly popular character". The staff for SheWired stated that she [...] "had the best character introduction ever and never stopped being great" [...] and [...] "has proven to be endlessly engaging, even when she's making choices that make us want to crawl into a ball and cry." [...] Dana Piccoli of AfterEllen.com characterized Lexa as a [...] "mysterious queer character" [...] that has caught the audience's attention, and complimented the [...] "chemistry and increasing bond between Lexa and Clarke," [...] adding, [...] "Both are smart, and somehow manage to see the bigger picture. [...] Here are two young women, leading their people to salvation <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> close to salvation as they can get." [...] The A.V. Clubs Kyle Fowle reasoned that Lexa's resolve while facing the reality of protecting the Sky People, the 13th clan, while risking an uprising from the other clans and her own people [...] "is exactly what makes her one of the better characters on TV."

2500|$|The Mystery of the Sea {{received}} reasonably positive reviews {{around the}} time of its publication; the reviewers writing in 1902 tend to focus on Stoker's skill {{and the fact that the}} novel is an engaging read, admitting (in some cases reluctantly, others forcefully) that the novel is melodramatic and contains a somewhat disparate variety of elements. Most of these turn-of-the-century reviewers are quick to identify The Mystery of the Sea as a work of sensation, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>as</b> a work that contains sensational elements, and they are in general agreement that Stoker is a skilled writer of mystery. A reviewer writing for The Bookman calls the novel [...] "one of those weirdly sensational stories that no living author writes better than Mr. Bram Stoker". [...] The Dial categorizes it as [...] "a bit of glowing melodrama" [...] that will [...] "keep one awake o' nights", and admits that it would be hard to get more action…between the covers of a book than will be found here" [...] (an observation which other reviewers do not construe as positive). [...] Punch praises Stoker's [...] "breezy personality" [...] and his ability to create a story with [...] "the rare quality of adventure that enthralls the boys and pleases their parents". This same review is appreciative of Stoker's writing style and depictions of landscape as well. These reviews situate The Mystery of the Sea between the realm of light fiction or juvenile reading and more sophisticated mystery. Other reviewers recognize these same elements of melodrama, but do not characterize them as examples of Stoker's authorial skill. A sarcastic and somewhat hostile review from The Saturday Review says that the novel is [...] "rather overcrowded", and proceeds to list off the tropes that Stoker employs from various genres. This reviewer admits that Stoker weaves the different strands together well, but that he is [...] "hardly justified in framing such colossal machinery to produce results more simply attained by less ambitious sensationalists".|$|E
