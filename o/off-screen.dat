5|$|In 1995, {{a real-life}} range of hotpots and pies {{based on the}} dish were {{launched}} by Hollands Pies, and in 2007, the world's largest Lancashire hotpot was created, based on Betty's recipe. Driver died in October 2011 and Betty was subsequently written out, with the character dying <b>off-screen</b> of illness in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Miles {{returns to}} Home and Away {{with a new}} look. Miles had lost weight, cut his hair short and grew a beard. <b>Off-screen</b> Quong Tart had such a busy {{schedule}} that he lost weight. When he revealed his new look to producers, they were so impressed they decided to change Miles' image, because it suited the storyline.|$|E
5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed <b>off-screen.</b> The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed {{of violence in the}} real world. The focus was not on the direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act.|$|E
5|$|On 16 October 2015, it was {{announced}} that Norwood was to leave EastEnders {{at the end of his}} contract. Details of when or how Fatboy would leave were not revealed but Norwood filmed his final scenes later that month. He departed on 24 December 2015, but was killed <b>off-screen</b> in the next episode.|$|E
5|$|A fan in Australia has {{returned}} small excerpts of <b>off-screen</b> footage, recorded from repeat showings using an 8mm cine film camera. The missing episodes covered include The Reign of Terror, episode 4; Galaxy 4, episode 1; The Myth Makers, episodes 1-2, 4; The Savages, episodes 3-4; The Tenth Planet, episode 4; The Power Of The Daleks, episodes 1-2; The Macra Terror, episode 3; and The Faceless Ones, episode 2.|$|E
5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of <b>off-screen</b> sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|DeGeneres began {{negotiating}} with ABC in 1996 to have Morgan come out. When {{word of the}} negotiations got out, DeGeneres found herself {{at the center of}} intense speculation about when she or her character, or both, would come out. With DeGeneres hinting at her and her character's coming out both <b>off-screen</b> and within the show, the rumors were confirmed when the episode went into production in March 1997.|$|E
5|$|Despite the limitations, Robinett {{was able}} to {{introduce}} concepts {{that at the time}} were unfamiliar to players. He had been able to construct different rooms in the games (thirty in the final version), in days where most games took place only on a single screen. Further, <b>off-screen</b> objects such as the bat would continue to move according to their programming behavior.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, Cagney {{replaced}} Spencer Tracy on the Western film Tribute to a Bad Man for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He received {{praise for}} his performance, and the studio liked his work enough {{to offer him}} These Wilder Years with Barbara Stanwyck. The two stars got on well; they had both previously worked in vaudeville, and they entertained {{the cast and crew}} <b>off-screen</b> by singing and dancing.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to acting in films, Mukerji {{is involved with}} several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show Dance Premier League. Though she is reticent to discuss her personal life in public, her <b>off-screen</b> life {{is the subject of}} substantial media coverage in India. She is married to filmmaker Aditya Chopra, with whom she has a daughter.|$|E
5|$|Rajinikanth has {{received}} numerous awards {{for many of}} his films, mostly in Tamil. He received his first Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Actor in 1984 for Nallavanuku Nallavan. Later he received Filmfare Award nominations for his performances in Sivaji (2007) and Enthiran (2010). As of 2014, Rajinikanth {{has received}} six Tamil Nadu State Film Awards for his performances in various films. He also received numerous awards from Cinema Express and Filmfans' Association for his on-screen performances and <b>off-screen</b> contributions in writing and producing.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters {{at the beginning of}} a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits <b>off-screen.</b> The starting character can tag in the <b>off-screen</b> character at any time during the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, then the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|The DVD's special {{features}} include {{an interview with}} Wiseau, who is asked questions by an <b>off-screen</b> Greg Sestero. Wiseau sits {{directly in front of}} a fireplace, with a mantel cluttered by various props from the film; next to him sits a large framed theatrical poster for the film. A few of Wiseau's answers are dubbed in, although it is evident that the dubbed responses match what he was originally saying. Wiseau fails to answer several of the questions, instead offering non sequiturs.|$|E
5|$|The censors thus {{expanded}} their jurisdiction {{from what was}} seen to what was implied in the spectator's mind. In The Office Wife (1930), several of Joan Blondell's disrobing maneuvers were strictly forbidden and the implied image of the actress being naked just <b>off-screen</b> was deemed too suggestive even though it relied upon the audience using their imaginations, so post-Code releases of the film had scenes which were blurred or rendered indistinct, if allowed at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} written {{specifically}} for Hepburn, and was tailored to her personality. Filming began in September 1937 and wrapped in January 1938; {{it was over}} schedule and over budget. Production was frequently delayed due to uncontrollable laughing fits between Hepburn and Grant. Hepburn struggled with her comedic performance and was coached by her co-star, vaudeville veteran Walter Catlett. A tame leopard was used during the shooting; its trainer was <b>off-screen</b> with a whip for all its scenes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{universe}} references many {{works by}} Walt Disney. Meg appears as Ursula from the 1989 film The Little Mermaid and Herbert appears as the Queen from the 1937 film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Walt Disney's alleged antisemitism is also referenced {{by having the}} universe's occupants attack the Disney version of Mort Goldman when he enters a room, brutally beating him to death <b>off-screen.</b> Discouraged, Brian and Stewie transport themselves to a universe resembling the Adult Swim series Robot Chicken, a show executive-produced by Family Guy cast member Seth Green. The sequence reveals several action figures of cartoon characters: He-Man, Optimus Prime, Lion-O and Duke from G.I. Joe.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses rings, {{scattered throughout the}} levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls <b>off-screen,</b> drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life {{and return to the}} most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings, a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.|$|E
5|$|For {{several weeks}} afterward, Wilson was absent from {{television}} due to personal issues {{she had to}} attend to <b>off-screen.</b> On November 28, Wilson returned to the group {{to participate in a}} six-woman tag team match. Wilson's dog Chloe became an official member of the group on December 26 when she interfered in one of Victoria's matches and became the first dog to have her own WWE.com profile. At Taboo Tuesday in November, Candice Michelle was eliminated from the Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal for the WWE Women's Championship by former rival Ashley Massaro.|$|E
5|$|Haas {{was later}} {{involved}} in an angle {{in which he was}} in a love triangle with Miss Jackie, who was acknowledged on-screen as his fianc√©e, and Dawn Marie. The storyline culminated when Haas served as the special-guest referee in a match at Armageddon 2004 between the two women. After the match, Haas left both women in storyline, although he continued his relationship with Miss Jackie <b>off-screen.</b> In early 2005, he formed a tag team with Hardcore Holly. They were involved in a feud (scripted rivalry) with MNM for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but never won the championship.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} 24, series co-creators Joel Surnow and Robert Cochran executive-produced La Femme Nikita for its entire five-year run on USA Network. Both series deal with anti-terrorist operations, {{and the lead}} {{characters}} of both series are placed in situations in which they must make a tragic choice in order to serve the greater good. There are numerous on- and <b>off-screen</b> creative connections between 24 and La Femme Nikita. Several actors from La Femme Nikita have portrayed similar roles on 24, a number of story concepts from La Femme Nikita have been revisited on 24, {{and many of the}} creative personnel from La Femme Nikita worked on 24 in their same role.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her acting career, Chopra is noted for her philanthropic work. She has worked with UNICEF {{for the last ten}} years and was appointed as the national and global UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights in 2010 and 2016 respectively. She promotes various causes such as environment, health and education, and women's rights and is particularly vocal about gender equality and feminism. Chopra's <b>off-screen</b> life is the subject of substantial media coverage. As a recording artist, she has released three singles. She is also the founder of the production company Purple Pebble Pictures, which released the acclaimed Marathi comedy-drama Ventilator (2016).|$|E
5|$|Married to actor Saif Ali Khan, {{with whom}} she has a son, Kapoor's <b>off-screen</b> life {{is the subject of}} {{widespread}} coverage in India. She has a reputation for being outspoken and assertive, and is recognised for her contributions to the film industry through her fashion style and film roles. In addition to film acting, Kapoor is a stage performer and has contributed as a co-author to three books: an autobiographical memoir and two nutrition guides. She has also launched her own clothing line in association with the retail chain Globus.|$|E
5|$|Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes is {{the third}} entry in the Marvel vs. Capcom series of 2D {{fighting}} games. The game utilizes similar tag team-based game mechanics to its predecessor, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter. Before starting each match, the player selects a team of two fighters to compete in one-on-one combat. The player is free to swap between their characters at any point during battle. While one character fights, their teammate resting <b>off-screen</b> slowly regenerates their life gauge. The first team to exhaust their opponent's vitality wins the match; however, if the timer runs out before either team is knocked out, the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Square Enix {{chose to}} update Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2s {{graphics}} for a remastered release in high-definition. With a production cycle longer than two years, the graphics were not merely upscaled to higher resolutions and feature updated models and textures. Kitase commented {{that he wanted}} to excite new and returning players and added more depth to do so and opened up the possibility of further remasters based on reception. Many views could not simply be reframed to 16:9 because that would reveal characters waiting for their cues <b>off-screen,</b> so the remastering team performed a lot of redrawing and additions to the visuals.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a isometric format and is set on board a haunted galleon named the Blackwyche. Sir Arthur Pendragon's main objective is to free the soul of its former captain, Richard Cavendish. Pendragon can utilise various weapons such as knives, daggers and a magic sword to defend himself from enemy skeletons. The player begins the game with full energy and it will slightly deplete every time the player is hit by an enemy. If Pendragon completely runs out of energy, a large skeletal hand will drag the player <b>off-screen,</b> thus killing him.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller and features a tearful and distraught Stefani, lying in bed as she begins to sing to the camera. In a white inside-out L.A.M.B. T-shirt, she wanders around her apartment lost and questioning her lover, who is in fact absent from the video. The lyrics describe an argument, which she has with an <b>off-screen</b> lover throughout the video. After lying around her apartment and crying during a bath, she leaves her house at night and travels in a car, as she sits tearfully in the back. The video ends with Stefani rolling on the bed.|$|E
5|$|The series {{borrowed}} the uniforms, cheerleaders, fans and stadium of the Pflugerville Panthers. Producers shot Pflugerville games {{and used them}} as game footage in the series. University of Southern California football announcers Peter Arbogast and Paul McDonald provided <b>off-screen</b> commentary during the football game sequences. The facilities, colors and bobcat logos of Texas State University in San Marcos were used as the setting and creative inspiration for the fictional Texas Methodist University. The show features the fictional Herrmann Field, named for George Herrmann, the {{head coach of the}} Pflugerville Panthers.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth {{episode of}} Gundam SEED {{features}} {{a scene in}} which Kira Yamato is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where the teenage girl Flay Allster lies sleeping naked, suggesting a sexual relationship. The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene as the show was aired at 6pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it. The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the <b>off-screen</b> scene with three shots.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the same}} group that set up and {{maintained}} the in-house digital ink and paint systems for Hanna Barbera {{as well as the}} Avid and Pro Tools systems used in Post Production. The group was founded and managed by Stephen Toback. Real Adventures maintained the classic show's realistic violence, featuring <b>off-screen</b> deaths of villains and allies. Japan-based Mook Studios exclusively animated the second season without digital post-processing. The show's format dictated that title sequences be aired first, followed by a short introduction, the first act, and the second act, with commercial breaks between.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{producers}} decided that Friday the 13th {{would not be}} an origin story, they said that they wanted to work out a logical origin story for Jason that would provide a sense of history as the film progressed. Form and Fuller explained that the audience gets to see how Jason attains his famous hockey mask, and is given a reason for why he puts it on. Jason would transition from wearing a bag over his head‚Äîsimilar to the one seen in Friday the 13th Part 2‚Äîto finding and wearing his hockey mask, whereas in Friday the 13th Part III he obtains the mask <b>off-screen</b> and comes out of a barn already wearing it.|$|E
5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies <b>off-screen,</b> slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most enemies, whom serve to deter Crash's progress. Enemies with deadly topsides cannot be jumped on, while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam. Enemies with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash slides into them.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never really know his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his <b>off-screen</b> relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career is}} marked by an unusually, even spectacularly, high degree of {{interpenetration}} between her publicly available private life and her films. The star phenomenon depends upon collapsing {{the distinction between the}} star-as-person and the star-as-performer. This does not usually mean that the incidents of a film's scenario are taken to be actual incidents in the star's life but rather that they 'reveal' or express the personality of the type-of-person of the star. In the case of Turner, however, not only do her vehicles furnish characters and situations in accord with her <b>off-screen</b> image, but frequently incidents in them echo incidents in her life so {{that by the end of}} her career films like Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, Madame X and Love Has Many Faces seem in parts like mere illustrations of her life.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, MNM {{were placed}} in an angle in which they found {{themselves}} in a losing streak against the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In non-title tag team matches, singles matches, and even a six-man tag match, London and Kendrick defeated the duo every time. At the Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2006, MNM lost the tag team championship to London and Kendrick. After the match, Nitro and Mercury started brawling, disbanding the group. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and Nitro were fired from the SmackDown! brand in storyline. <b>Off-screen,</b> Nitro and Mercury did not get along, and WWE management decided to split the tag team and send Nitro and Melina to the Raw brand. In addition, Mercury was about to begin serving a suspension for violating the WWE Wellness program.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, {{during an}} episode of Hollyoaks {{spin-off}} Hollyoaks Later, Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) and Zoe Carpenter (Zo√´ Lister) had a sexual encounter. Up to now both characters had previously been portrayed as heterosexual {{and this was the}} start of Sarah's on-going sexuality crisis. The character of Lydia Hart was created as the new love interest for the sexually confused already established character, Sarah. When the character first appeared on-screen she was revealed to have a younger sister, Persephone Hart (Elizabeth Hadley), who was attending the dance classes taught by Sarah. Little is known about the rest of Lydia's family, although the character did stay with her mother frequently <b>off-screen.</b> The character was also given links to Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki) who arrived in Hollyoaks in June 2009. It was soon revealed that Lydia was Charlotte's ex-girlfriend.|$|E
