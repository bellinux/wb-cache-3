5|$|The {{mechanism}} <b>only</b> <b>works</b> {{if the air}} is {{cooler than}} the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.|$|E

During his last year of study at the Royal Academy, Parry {{appeared}} before Queen Victoria three times, each time by her special request. The Queen made another request of Parry each time he appeared: that he perform <b>only</b> <b>works</b> he had composed. In 1871, Bennett convinced Parry to enter University of Cambridge for a degree in music. While at Cambridge, Parry became the first Welshman to take both the MusB and MusD there. After earning his Bachelor's degree, Parry {{and his family}} returned to Danville, where he operated a school of music {{for the next three}} years. When Aberystwyth University established a chair for music, it was offered to Parry; he moved his family back to Wales, becoming the university's first Professor of Music.|$|E

He emails Neil, claiming that he is now a top DJ at a popular night club, lives in a luxury mansion, and has daily sex with multiple partners. This convinces them to visit him in Australia for their Easter holidays. Once they arrive at the club they find that Jay in fact <b>only</b> <b>works</b> as a toilet attendant and lives in a tent in his Uncle's front garden, while Will meets Katie, an old friend from his private school days, who is backpacking, and she persuades him to join her.|$|E
