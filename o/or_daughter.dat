5|$|A {{native of}} the Pittsburgh suburb of Green Tree, Pennsylvania, Paul is a {{graduate}} of Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, where he earned his medical degree. He served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1968. He worked as an obstetrician-gynecologist from the 1960s to the 1980s. He became the first Representative in history to serve concurrently with a son <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> in the Senate when his son, Rand Paul, was elected to the U.S. Senate from Kentucky in 2010.|$|E
5|$|By {{virtue of}} a Hindu belief that {{killing of a}} brahmin (Bramhatya) was a sin, capital {{punishment}} was not applicable to them. Upper caste kshatriyas (satkshatriya) were also exempt from capital punishment due to their higher position in the caste system. Severe crimes committed were punishable by the severing of a foot or hand. Contemporary literary sources reveal up to ten castes in the Hindu caste system; three among kshatriya, three among brahmin, two among vaishya and two among shudras. Family laws permitted a wife <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> or surviving relatives of a deceased person to claim properties such as his home, land, grain, money etc. {{if there were no}} male heirs. If no claimants to the property existed, the state took possession of these properties as Dharmadeya (charitable asset). Intercaste marriage, child marriage, marriage of a boy to maternal uncles daughter, Svayamvara marriage (where the bride garlands her choice of a groom from among many aspirants) were all in vogue. Memorials containing hero stones (virkal) were erected for fallen heroes and the concerned family received monetary aid for maintenance of the memorial.|$|E

25|$|While {{various sources}} repeat the claims that Agatha was {{daughter}} or sister of either Emperor Henry, {{it seems unlikely}} that such a sibling <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> would have been ignored by the German chroniclers.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s, the Israeli {{government}} finally allowed most {{of those}} who fled to Addis Ababa to immigrate to Israel. Some did so through the Law of Return, which allows an Israeli parent of a non-Jew to petition for his/her son <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> to be allowed to immigrate to Israel. Others were allowed to immigrate to Israel as part of a humanitarian effort.|$|E

25|$|The deification of {{deceased}} emperors had {{precedent in}} Roman domestic cult to the dii parentes (deified ancestors) and the mythic apotheosis of Rome's founders. A deceased emperor granted apotheosis by his successor and the Senate became an official State divus (divinity). Members of the Imperial family could be granted similar honours and cult; an Emperor's deceased wife, sister <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> could be promoted to diva (female divinity).|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{class or}} status is inherited. For example, being the son <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> {{of a wealthy}} individual, may carry a higher status and {{different}} cultural connotations than {{being a member of}} nouveau riche ("new money") or have a planned path of positive freedom. Those taking the functionalist approach to sociology and economics view social classes as components essential for the survival of complex societies such as American society.|$|E
25|$|Pinpointing the {{extinction}} (or pseudoextinction) {{of a species}} requires a clear definition of that species. If {{it is to be}} declared extinct, the species in question must be uniquely distinguishable from any ancestor <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> species, and from any other closely related species. Extinction of a species (or replacement by a daughter species) {{plays a key role in}} the punctuated equilibrium hypothesis of Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge.|$|E

25|$|So {{flexible}} were Egyptian {{myths that}} they could seemingly conflict with each other. Many descriptions {{of the creation of}} the world and the movements of the sun occur in Egyptian texts, some very different from each other. The relationships between gods were fluid, so that, for instance, the goddess Hathor could be called the mother, wife, <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> of the sun god Ra. Separate deities could even be syncretized, or linked, as a single being. Thus the creator god Atum was combined with Ra to form Ra-Atum.|$|E

It is the dirtiest, filthiest, lousiest, most obscene piece of writing that I have ever seen in print.

But it comes from a Negro, and you cannot expect any better from a person of his type.|$|E
25|$|Her rites allowed {{women the}} use of strong wine and blood-sacrifice, things {{otherwise}} forbidden them by Roman tradition. Men were barred from her mysteries and the possession of her true name. Given that male authors had limited knowledge of her rites and attributes, ancient speculations about her identity abound, among them {{that she was an}} aspect of Terra, Ops, Cybele, or Ceres, or a Latin form of the Greek goddess Damia. Most often, she was identified as the wife, sister, <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> of the god Faunus, thus an equivalent or aspect of the nature-goddess Fauna, who could prophesy the fates of women.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by {{the atrocities}} {{committed}} by Unit 731, a Japanese research program during World War II, [...] "Nisei" [...] was {{originally intended to}} be a stand-alone mythology episode, but was lengthened into two separate parts. The episode featured several scenes that required stunt work, which David Duchovny performed himself. The episode's title refers to the term nisei, meaning the son <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> of an Issei couple born outside Japan.|$|E
500|$|Heraclius {{was married}} twice: first to Fabia Eudokia, a {{daughter}} of Rogatus, and then to his niece Martina. He had two children with Fabia and at least nine with Martina, {{most of whom were}} sickly children. [...] Of Martina's children at least two were disabled, which was seen as punishment for the illegality of the marriage: Fabius (Flavius) had a paralyzed neck and Theodosios, who was a deaf-mute, married Nike, daughter of Persian general Shahrbaraz <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> of Niketas, cousin of Heraclius.|$|E
500|$|Grimm theorizes {{that the}} Helhest, a three legged-horse that roams the {{countryside}} [...] "as {{a harbinger of}} plague and pestilence" [...] in Danish folklore, was originally the steed of the goddess Hel, and that on this steed Hel roamed the land [...] "picking up the dead that were her due." [...] In addition, Grimm says that a wagon was once ascribed to Hel, with which Hel made journeys. Grimm says that Hel {{is an example of}} a [...] "half-goddess;" [...] "one who cannot be shown to be either wife <b>or</b> <b>daughter</b> of a god, and who stands in a dependent relation to higher divinities" [...] and that [...] "half-goddesses" [...] stand higher than [...] "half-gods" [...] in Germanic mythology.|$|E
