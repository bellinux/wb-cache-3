5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> <b>and</b> he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|Doris calls Mulder, {{believing that}} Chaco {{wants to kill}} her; after she hangs up, she is {{attacked}} by the masked figure. Scully goes to help Doris while Mulder searches for Chaco at his mansion. There, he finds the shrunken heads of Kearns and other victims in a cabinet. Mulder calls Scully <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> hears her being knocked out by Chaco. She is taken to a secluded field, where Harold has started a bonfire and led the townsfolk in consuming Doris. Chaco berates them for killing one of their own, but Harold chastises him for allowing the Creutzfeldt–Jakob epidemic to occur and has Chaco executed by the masked figure. Scully herself {{is about to be}} killed when Mulder arrives and shoots the figure; he is revealed to be Sheriff Arens. Harold tries to shoot Mulder, but is trampled to death by the fleeing townsfolk.|$|E

5|$|Early in the film, Hoffman {{explains}} to his superiors that the terrorists' retreat to pre-tech age communication methods renders useless the high specification tools the CIA uses, {{and increases the}} worth of Ferris's human intelligence methods. They avoid mobile telephones and computers, preferring face-to-face communication and encoded written messages. By contrast, the Americans use sophisticated communication (Hoffman and Ferris regularly speak <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone)</b> <b>and</b> surveillance (high altitude spy planes offer {{a different point of}} view throughout) technology. David Denby of The New Yorker said that this was Scott's suggestion that the CIA has the technology but not the human intelligence to properly fight terrorism in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes very nervous about going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. He talks with Marge <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> <b>and</b> she says that he ought {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January 1945, {{following}} the Wehrmacht's {{defeat in the}} Battle of the Bulge, Misch {{and the rest of}} Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>and</b> told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into the room next to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> <b>and</b> Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and a room full of mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} MobiAd; a scalable, location-aware, personalised {{and private}} advertising system for mobile platforms. Advertising {{is the driving}} force behind many websites and service providers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Internet. With the ever-increasing number of smart phones, there is a fertile market for personalised and localised advertising. They key benefit of using mobile phones is {{to take advantage of the}} vast amount of information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phones</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> locations of interest to the user in order to provide personalised ads. Preservation of user privacy is however essential for successful deployment of such a system. MobiAd would perform a range of data mining tasks in order to maintain an interest profile <b>on</b> <b>the</b> user’s <b>phone,</b> <b>and</b> use <b>the</b> infrastructure network to download and display relevant ads and reports the clicks via a Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) protocol. In this paper we provide an overview into existing advertising systems and privacy concerns on mobile phones, in addition to the scalable local ad download and privacy-aware DTN-based click report dissemination methods that we propose for MobiAd...|$|R

Stone set the film in 1985 because insider trading scandals culminated in 1985 and 1986.

40|$|Several {{authors have}} studied the risks arising from the growth in mobile phone use (e. g. large debts {{incurred}} by young people, banned or dangerous use of cellular <b>phones).</b> <b>The</b> {{aim of this study}} is to analyse whether impulsivity, which has often been related to various forms of addictive behaviours, is associated with massive use of <b>and</b> dependence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone.</b> In this study, 108 female undergraduate psychology students were screened using a questionnaire evaluating actual use of and perceived dependence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mobile <b>phone,</b> <b>and</b> with <b>the</b> French adaptation of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale. This scale identifies four distinct components associated with impulsive behaviour: Urgency, lack of Premeditation, lack of Perseverance, and Sensation Seeking.
