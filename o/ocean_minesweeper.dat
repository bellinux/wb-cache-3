50|$|U.S. Navy Martin P-5 Marlin {{seaplane}} patrol squadrons, destroyers, <b>ocean</b> <b>minesweepers,</b> PCFs (swift boats) and United States Coast Guard cutters (USCGC) {{performed the}} operation. Also playing {{a key role}} in the interdictions were the Navy’s patrol gunboats (PGs). The PG was uniquely suited for the job because of its ability to go from standard diesel propulsion to gas turbine (turboshaft) propulsion in a matter of a few minutes. The lightweight aluminum and fiberglass ships were not only fast but highly maneuverable because of their variable-pitch propellers. Most of the ships operated in the coastal waters from the Cambodian border around the south tip of Vietnam up north to Đà Nẵng. Supply ships from the Service Force, such as oilers, would bring mail, movies, and fuel.|$|R
50|$|Engage {{also participated}} in Operation End Sweep which began in January 1973. The last {{provision}} of the Vietnam war cease-fire agreement that {{directly related to the}} Navy entailed removal of the U.S. sea mines laid along the North Vietnamese coast and the Mark 36 Destructors dropped into inland waterways. On 28 January, following months of extensive preparation and training, the Seventh Fleets Mine Countermeasures Force (Task Force 78), led by Rear Admiral Brian McCauley, sailed from Subic Bay and shaped course for a staging area off Haiphong. On 6 February, one day after Commander Task Force 78 met in the city to coordinate actions with his North Vietnamese opposite, Colonel Hoang Huu Thai, Operation End Sweep got underway. A total of 10 <b>ocean</b> <b>minesweepers,</b> 9 amphibious ships, 6 fleet tugs, 3 salvage ships, and 19 destroyer types served with Task Force 78 during the six months of Operation End Sweep.|$|R
2500|$|Ten <b>ocean</b> <b>minesweepers</b> (MSOs) were {{assigned}} to Task Force 78 to sweep deep-water approaches to North Vietnamese ports and inland waterways and to serve as helicopter control vessels.

[...] As such, she {{was intended to be}} used for check sweeps through waters which presumably were clear of active mines to ensure that passage indeed was safe. [...] She was pumped full of polyurethane foam so that she would not sink if she struck a mine, was equipped with padding to protect her all-volunteer skeleton crew, and was modified so that her entire crew of six could remain topside during her minesweeping runs, ensuring that they would be blown overboard if she struck a mine rather be injured or killed by slamming into the overhead anywhere below decks.|$|R

5000|$|Although her patrol {{areas may}} change {{from time to}} time during the next several months, her duties will not. Market Time units are {{assigned}} primarily to keep the Communists from sneaking men, arms and other supplies into the Republic of Vietnam. They include U.S. Navy aircraft, destroyer escort radar picket ships, <b>ocean</b> <b>minesweepers</b> and swift boats and Vietnamese Navy Junk Force craft, as well as 82-foot and high endurance Coast Guard cutters. Owasco is one of five of the latter group, which makes up Coast Guard Squadron Three on duty with the Seventh Fleets Cruiser-Destroyer Group in Southeast Asia. In addition to keeping track of shipping in their patrol areas and inspecting and searching suspicious water craft and their occupants, Market Time units are often called upon to lend gunfire support to friendly forces ashore. Owascos 5 inch, [...]38 caliber main battery is well suited to shore bombardment and she also carries 81 mm mortars and [...]50 caliber machine guns for close range engagements with the enemy.|$|R

50|$|Following her {{shakedown}} {{and initial}} operations on the Atlantic seaboard, Wood County was deployed to the Mediterranean {{for the first}} time in the summer of 1960, as part of Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 2. She subsequently conducted her second deployment to the 6th Fleet in the autumn of 1961 after escorting to division of <b>ocean</b> <b>minesweepers</b> from the east coast to the Mediterranean. During that deployment, the tank landing ship visited Polensa Bay, Majorca, Spain and the British Crown Colony of Malta, where she embarked a detachment of British commandos that she eventually landed at Bomba, Libya during an exercise. In addition, the ship also visited Valencia, Rota, and Barcelona, Spain; Messina and La Spezia, Italy; Cannes, France; and Piles and Athens, Greece before she returned to Little Creek, Virginia, her home port, in February 1962. On 1 April 1962 Wood County was transferred to PhibRon 12. Later that month, the tank landing ship participated in a large scale demonstration exercise off Little Creek, an evolution witnessed by President John F. Kennedy and the Shah of Iran. Immediately thereafter, Wood County proceeded to Vieques, Puerto Rico where she participated in Atlantic Fleet Amphibious Exercise 1-62.|$|R

50|$|She {{stood out}} to sea again on 18 July as an element of Task Unit (TU) 29.01, bound for the Pacific <b>Ocean.</b> The motor <b>minesweeper</b> transited the Panama Canal between 29 July and 1 August and reached San Pedro, California, on 13 August. From that port, she shifted south to San Diego, California, where she {{remained}} for seven weeks.|$|R
50|$|Commissioned {{a little}} over a week before Japan capitulated, Waxwing was too late to {{participate}} in World War II. Nevertheless, she was valuable to the Navy during the postwar period, particularly in clearing the minefields which had been planted in Far Eastern waters during the war. The ship set out on Lake Erie, transited the Welland Canal into Lake Ontario, and sailed down the Saint Lawrence River; stopped at Quebec; and then continued on to the Atlantic <b>Ocean.</b> The <b>minesweeper</b> was fitted out at Boston, Massachusetts, and then conducted shakedown in nearby waters. On 28 September, she arrived at the Norfolk, Virginia, operating area to prepare for service in the Pacific Fleet.|$|R
50|$|Although {{completed}} {{too late}} to see service during World War I, Turkey {{took part in the}} gigantic operation to clear the mine barrage which had been laid in the North Sea during this conflict. This system of minefields constituted a formidable obstacle to the resumption of trade {{in the aftermath of the}} war. After steaming across the Atlantic <b>Ocean,</b> the new <b>minesweeper</b> arrived at Kirkwall, Scotland, on 20 April 1919 and joined the American forces massing there to begin clearing the shipping lanes between Scotland and Norway.|$|R

50|$|Drydock 2 was {{completed}} in 1913. Constructed with granite and concrete, the completed drydock was {{the largest in the}} US Navy at that time. In 1917, before the United States entered World War I, the Navy Department decided to build ships at the yard. Drydock 3 was constructed for this purpose, although it was not completed until 1919. By the end of the war, the 6,500 workers at Bremerton had undertaken the construction of 42 vessels, including subchasers, submarines, <b>Minesweeper,</b> <b>ocean</b> tugs, and ammunition ships, in addition to 1,700 small boats. Between the two wars, shipbuilding continued. Light cruiser USS Louisville (CA-28) was launched in 1930 and cruiser USS Astoria (CA-34) in 1933. In the 1930s, Drydock 2 was enlarged to accommodate two new aircraftcarriers, USS Lexington (CV-2) and USS Saratoga (CV-3).|$|R
