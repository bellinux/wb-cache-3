In the early 1990s, Schoemehl worked with business groups {{to develop a}} new ice hockey arena (now known as the Scottrade Center) {{on the site of the}} city's Kiel Auditorium, with the promise that the developer would renovate the adjacent opera house.|$|E

5|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1990s, St. Louis became home to a {{substantial}} Bosnian immigrant community, which became the second-largest in the United States in 1999. The city also began to see an increase in immigrants from Mexico, Vietnam, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Many immigrants reported moving to St. Louis, particularly its south side Bevo Mill neighborhood, due to the low cost of living compared to other American cities. Despite this increase, the foreign-born population <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> region was roughly one-third of the national average in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Flames hired Cliff Fletcher, {{formerly}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Blues, {{to serve}} as the team's general manager. Former Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was hired as the team's head coach. The team stocked its roster via an expansion draft held on June 6, 1972. Fletcher focused on goaltending, choosing Phil Myre with his first selection and rookie Dan Bouchard with his second. Fletcher drafted a competent roster, but one that was young and inexperienced. Two days later, the Flames selected Jacques Richard as the second overall pick in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is divided}} into three {{horizontal}} sections, and architects considered the rivers and other natural characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> area when designing the park. The northern limestone wall represents the Mississippi River bluffs, while the southern snaking meander wall stands is inspired by the region's waterways. Between the two zones are the rain gardens, larger trees, and larger sculptures, an area that meant to represent a floodplain. The main paths of the park were plotted to match the locations of alleyways that park designers saw in a 1916 Sanborn map.|$|E

5|$|That Chandler {{supported}} Robinson and {{the integration}} of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler {{had the power to}} void Robinson's contract, but he chose to approve it. Further, following extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the Philadelphia Phillies and their manager, Ben Chapman, Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race-based taunting. Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick's decision to indefinitely suspend any members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Cardinals who followed through on a threat to strike in protest of integration.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{obtained}} {{younger and}} faster players in 1909; McGraw had Chief Meyers ready to succeed Bresnahan at catcher.

As McGraw {{did not want to}} block Bresnahan from the opportunity, the Giants traded Bresnahan to the Cardinals for Red Murray, Bugs Raymond and Admiral Schlei after the 1908 season. Bresnahan led the Cardinals, who won only 49 games in 1908, to 54 wins in 1909 and 63 wins in 1910. Attendance increased from 205,000 fans in 1908 to 299,000fans in 1909, and 355,000 fans in 1910.|$|E

He was joined in this effort by promoter Herb Simmons, SBAC Member Tony Casta, sports journalist Keith Schildroth, and longtime fan Nick Ridenour. Although these directors oversee the selection process, the St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame is unique because it is the only wrestling hall of fame that allows fans to vote for potential inductees.|$|E
5|$|In June 1897, {{at the age}} of 19, Stivetts {{began his}} {{professional}} baseball career with the Ashland representative of the Central Pennsylvania League. He compiled a 9–5win–loss record(W–L) that season with a 1.35ERA. He returned to the Ashland team in 1888, though he later joined the Allentown Peanuts of the Central League. He began the 1889season with the York representative of the Middle States League. It was there when an umpire named Tim Hurst noticed Stivetts' talent; who then recommended him to Charles Comiskey, the manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Browns of the AA. Comiskey was impressed by the velocity of Stivetts' pitches, and offered him a contract. The Philadelphia Athletics soon made an offer of their own, but he accepted the Browns' salary offer of $275a month, with a $200signing bonus.|$|E
5|$|Musial {{was named}} a vice {{president}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis</b> Cardinals in September 1963, and he remained in that position until after the 1966 season. From February 1964 to January 1967, he also served as President Lyndon Johnson's physical fitness adviser, a part-time position created to promote better fitness among American citizens. Before the 1967 season began, the Cardinals named Musial the team's general manager, and he oversaw the club's World Series championship that year. He won the allegiance of Cardinals players by making fair offers from the outset of player-contract negotiations and creating an in-stadium babysitting service so players' wives could attend games. His longtime business partner Biggie Garagnani died in June 1967, prompting Musial to {{devote more time to}} managing his restaurant and other business interests. He came to realize that the detail-oriented desk job was not his forte. He consequently decided to step down as general manager, before even completing a full year on the job.|$|E
