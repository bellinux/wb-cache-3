5|$|The {{second book}} is largely {{devoted to the}} {{respective}} roles of faith and philosophical argument. Clement contends that while both are important, the fear of God is foremost, because through faith one receives divine wisdom. To Clement, scripture is an innately true primitive philosophy which is complemented by human reason through the Logos. Faith is voluntary, and the decision to believe is a crucial fundamental step in becoming closer to God. It is never irrational, as it is founded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of {{the truth of the}} Logos, but all knowledge proceeds from faith, as first principles are unprovable outside a systematic structure.|$|E

25|$|Drug design, often {{referred}} to as rational drug design or simply rational design, is the inventive process of finding new medications based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of a biological target. The drug is most commonly an organic small molecule that activates or inhibits the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, which in turn results in a therapeutic benefit to the patient. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the biomolecular target with which they interact and therefore will bind to it. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques. This type of modeling is sometimes referred to as computer-aided drug design. Finally, drug design that relies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the three-dimensional structure of the biomolecular target is known as structure-based drug design. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also been developed.|$|E
25|$|According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats, {{strategic}} {{decision making in}} organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed a model of parallel {{strategic decision}} making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding information, storage and retrieval of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives are based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of competing firms, such as their market share.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the current practice of serologic testing of blood types, the progress in molecular diagnostics allows {{the increasing use of}} blood group genotyping. In contrast to serologic tests reporting a direct blood type phenotype, genotyping allows the prediction of a phenotype based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the molecular basis of the currently known antigens. This allows a more detailed determination of the blood type and therefore a better match for transfusion, which can be crucial in particular for patients with needs for many transfusions to prevent allo-immunization.|$|E

25|$|Influenced by European {{astronomy}} {{during the}} late Ming Dynasty, more stars were depicted on the charts but retaining the traditional constellations; new stars observed were incorporated as supplementary stars in old constellations in the southern sky which did not depict any of the traditional stars recorded by ancient Chinese astronomers. Further improvements were made {{during the late}}r part of the Ming Dynasty by Xu Guangqi and Johann Adam Schall von Bell, the German Jesuit and was recorded in Chongzhen Lishu (Calendrical Treatise of Chongzhen Period, 1628). Traditional Chinese star maps incorporated 23 new constellations with 125 stars of the southern hemisphere of the sky based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of western star charts; with this improvement the Chinese Sky was integrated with the World astronomy.|$|E

25|$|Ligand-based drug design (or {{indirect}} drug design) {{relies on}} knowledge of other molecules that bind to the biological target of interest. These other molecules {{may be used}} to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target. In other words, a model of the biological target may be built based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of what binds to it, and this model in turn {{may be used to}} design new molecular entities that interact with the target. Alternatively, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR), in which a correlation between calculated properties of molecules and their experimentally determined biological activity, may be derived. These QSAR relationships in turn may be used to predict the activity of new analogs.|$|E
25|$|Walking with Monsters (also {{distributed}} as Before the Dinosaurs - Walking with Monsters or Walking with Monsters - Life Before Dinosaurs) is {{a three-part}} British documentary film series {{about life in}} the Paleozoic, and briefly into the Mesozoic, bringing to life extinct arthropods, fish, amphibians, synapsids, and reptiles. As with previous Walking with... instalments, it is narrated by Kenneth Branagh. Using state-of-the-art visual effects, this prequel to Walking with Dinosaurs shows an epic 300 million year war between creatures before the dinosaurs. The series draws <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of over 600 scientists and depicts Paleozoic history, from the Cambrian Period (530 million years ago) to the Early Triassic Period (248 million years ago). It was written and directed by Tim Haines. As with some of the other BBC specials, it was renamed in North America, where its title was Before the Dinosaurs: Walking with Monsters. It has also aired as a two-hour special on the Canadian and American Discovery Channel with yet another narrator, although Branagh's narration can still sometimes be heard. At the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006 it won the Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More).|$|E

They succeed, but disappear without a trace. Chor Tempest retreats to secure Simulacrum's holiest site, the Ruins.

Rimone and Dominūra are shown to have landed {{in the distant past}} where they pass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the Emerald Ri Mājon. Chor Tempest continue to fight as they slowly retreat back, and eventually Simulacrum sues for peace. The allied Plumbish and Argentum forces demand in their terms that all sibyllae become adults by visiting the holy Spring, thereby no longer being able to pilot Simoun. While the members Chor Tempest head off to the Spring, Aer and Neviril stay back and soon confess their feelings for each other. The allied occupation arrest them, however with the help of their former choirmates and the Plumbish priestesses, Aer and Neviril break free and say their farewells.
