40|$|In {{the study}} of {{thermodynamics}} for nanoscale quantum systems, a family of quantities known as generalized free energies have been derived as necessary and sufficient conditions that govern state transitions. These free energies become important especially in the regime where the system of interest consists {{of only a few}} (quantum) particles. In this work, we introduce a new family of smoothed generalized free energies, by constructing explicit smoothing procedures that maximize/minimize the free energies over an ε-ball of quantum states. In contrast to previously known smoothed free energies, these quantities now allow us to make an <b>operational</b> <b>statement</b> for approximate thermodynamic state transitions. We show that these newly defined smoothed quantities converge to the standard free energy in the thermodynamic limit.

40|$|As online {{shopping}} {{is widely used}} in the hospitality industry, {{research in this field}} constantly strives to understand the customer behavior in online purchasing activities. Online customer reviews (OCRs) and perceived risk have been extensively evaluated in previous studies in related with online purchasing. In spite of the large body of work on the topic of OCRs effect on consumer behavior, it is still unclear that how OCRs affect the decision process of the consumers when they make online booking. Due to the intangibility of hospitality or tourism product and the nature of online booking, risk perception is considered {{as one of the most}} important factors that impact the buyer 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Thus, it is constructive to investigate the effect of OCRs in the context of consumer perceived risk associated with {{online shopping}}, in the hope of understanding how OCRs affect the decision process and seeking solutions for the hotel marketers to improve their service as well as the online commenting system. In this study, we demonstrated a method which investigates the relationship between consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceived risk associated with online leisure hotel shopping and different types of OCRs (core and peripheral). By evaluating perceived risk associated with online leisure hotel booking caused by different hotel attributes, we addressed the importance of OCRs on various hotel attributes and therefore provided information for E-marketers to fine-tune their E-business strategies in terms of managing proper online customer reviews. Two hundred surveys were distributed. The instrument contained two parts and one scenario: (1) Demographic information, past experience, and attitudes towards OCRs of the participants regarding online leisure hotel booking.

50|$|In late 2012, the Army fielded 58 M3s and 1,500 {{rounds of}} {{ammunition}} to units deployed to Afghanistan to destroy enemy targets out to 1,000 meters. This was because RPG and machine gun teams could attack 900 meters away, while existing weaponry like the M141 Bunker Defeat Munition, M72 LAW, M136 AT-4 and MK153 SMAW had effective ranges of only 500 meters. The AT-4 is lighter and cheaper but is made of reinforced fiberglass, while the M3's rifled metal/carbon fiber launch tube allows for reloading. Employing the 22 lb M3 is easier than the 50 lb FGM-148 Javelin with its launcher with missile and reusable command launch unit, is faster than waiting on mortars, and is cheaper than the Javelin and artillery shells for engaging targets in hard cover. Although Special Operations forces had been using the M3 since the early 1990s, light infantry unit commanders in Afghanistan had to submit <b>operational</b> needs <b>statements</b> to get the weapon. The M3 became an official program of record in the conventional Army in 2014, and a conditional materiel release was authorized in late 2015 to equip all brigade combat teams with one M3 launcher per infantry platoon.|$|R

With the success of the XM395, the Army is seeking a guided 120 mm mortar program of record with comparable accuracy through the High Explosive Guided Mortar (HEGM) proposal. Deliveries would not take place until around 2020, so ATK is pushing to continue orders of the XM395 to avoid an inventory gap if a contingency arises. HEGM seeks to improve upon APMI through increased range, reliability, and lethality. The Army developed its own HEGM prototype called the Guided Enhanced Fragmentation Mortar (GEFM), which will be made available to industry when a request for proposals is released to industry to offer their own smart mortar solutions. The HEGM program objective is to create a round accurate to within one meter CEP, with dual GPS/SAL guidance to hit targets that have relocated and to function in a GPS-degraded environment. The Army closed its initial solicitation period for designs in January 2017, and plans to award multiple contracts {{by the end of the}} year, leading to an open competition in 2018 and production beginning in 2021 with 14,000 HEGM rounds to be produced.|$|R

50|$|The U.S. Army began {{seeking a}} guided mortar in {{response}} to fighting conditions experienced during the War in Afghanistan. Taliban fighters often engaged troops in small unit actions from prepared fighting positions on ridgelines and high ground. These types of ambushes offered limited exposure targets to direct fire weapons, and close air support was limited from rules of engagement and bad weather. Troops also spotted Taliban movements along distant ridgelines or valleys but didn't have the range with direct fire weapons to engage them. Because of this, the Army started the Accelerated Precision Mortar Initiative (APMI) from an urgent <b>operational</b> needs <b>statement</b> in February 2009 to create a GPS-guided 120 mm mortar with accuracy of 5 m CEP at 7,000 m; because APMI was an urgent request, it was accelerated by an Other Transaction Authority rather the traditional acquisition process. GPS was chosen over laser designation as the guidance system because the enemy frequently ducked down behind ridges and rock outcroppings, so laser designation would have limited ability to target them, while a GPS round could give accurate targeting even when taking cover behind obstacles. In April 2010, the Army announced that ATK had won a competitive shoot-off during the winter against competitors Raytheon and General Dynamics, and been selected to provide a new precision-guided mortar under the APMI needs statement.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there were statistically significant differences among the opinions of teachercoordinators, administrators, and guidance counselors concerning cooperative vocational education. Specifically the objectives were: (1) to determine if there were differences in the opinions of the three groups as to the value and the operational procedures of cooperative vocational education; (2) to test the hypothesis that there is no significant difference among the opinions of the three groups;(3) to list recommendations that should be considered for additional research and teacher education activities; (4) to develop guidelines that should be considered in the further development of cooperative vocational education programs in Oregon. THE PROCEDURES The construction and validation of the questionnaire were accomplished through a review of the literature and an evaluation by three juries of experts. A mail survey questionnaire containing 26 value <b>statements</b> and 34 <b>operational</b> procedures together with a five-point Likert-type scale was used to gather the data. The study's population utilized 77 Oregon secondary schools which offered five or more occupational clusters. The sample for the study consisted of 50 full-time administrators, 50 full-time guidance counselors, and 50 full-time teacher-coordinators, all randomly selected from the schools identified in the population. The F statistic was used to analyze contrasts among the mean scores for each statement with the. 05 level of significance being used to determine differences existing among the three groups. A test of Least Significant Difference was used To determine where significant differences existed between means of the statements which were rejected in the analysis of variance test. SELECTED FINDINGS Generally, the analysis of variance test indicated that the three groups were alike in their responses to the statements contained in the questionnaire but significant differences did occur in five of the 26 value statements and seven of the 34 operational procedures. SELECTED CONCLUSIONS The testing of the mean scores indicated that the three groups were similar in their responses. The hypothesis was retained on 48 of the 60 statements. The three groups generally agreed that there was some value in cooperative vocational education programs. They generally agreed on 32 of the 34 operational procedures. SELECTED RECOMMENDATIONS In view of the findings and conclusions of the study, it is recommended that additional research be conducted using students and persons outside education to assess the value and <b>operational</b> procedure <b>statements.</b> It is also recommended that teacher education activities and in-service activities be conducted in relationship to cooperative vocational education. SELECTED GUIDELINES The following guidelines are suggested as essential to program development and growth in Oregon. 1. All students 16 years and older should have an opportunity to enroll. 2. Guidance personnel should become more involved in the organization and operation of the program. 3. The teacher-coordinator should be hired on an extended contract basis. 4. The program should consist of three components; the classroom instruction, the youth organization, and the on-the-job experiences...|$|R
40|$|European Maritime States {{already have}} {{commitments}} to protect species and habitats and maintain quality standards in coastal and offshore waters. These are a {{direct response to}} environmental legislation in Europe and commitments made to biodiversity conservation in OSPAR and at the World Summit on Sustainable Development. An integrated approach to management requires that these {{are consistent with the}} requirements for sustainable development, and include wider social considerations and active stakeholder participation. This review describes a hierarchical framework that incorporates the marine objectives and delivery statements of ecological, social and economic sectors. The framework leads from the UK's guiding principles for sustainable development, through visionary statements and strategic goals for high level delivery, to <b>operational</b> objectives and <b>statements</b> of action which deliver management. Parts of this hierarchy can already be populated for the UK, especially those at the higher levels. At the operational level, however, there is less clarity. The review shows that, despite some gaps, existing commitments for ecological components of the ecosystem are transparent and generally conform to this framework, due largely to high profile government funding of environmental protection and science and a single national vision for the marine environment. Specific objectives for six components of the ecosystem were developed; benthic habitats, seabirds and mammals, phytoplankton and zooplankton, fish, and physical/chemical quality of the water and atmosphere. The objectives included some that avoided limits and others that aimed to achieve targets, and for management to be effective it will be important to have a common understanding of how these can together be interpreted and made operational. In a review of 13 social and economic sectors, few provided a clear breakdown of objectives leading from a high level vision or a sustainable development principle. Six sectors did not have high level government targets for production or other measures of sectoral performance. Such commercial operations generally determine their own operational delivery targets based on market forces. Recent proposals in Europe to create an integrated framework for social, economic and environmental activities will need to carefully balance the development of a strong and competitive marine economy with existing international obligations to environmental protection. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
