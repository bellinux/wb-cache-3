5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or <b>other</b> <b>life)</b> have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were {{hot enough to}} fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the energy}} thus {{captured}} produces biomass and energy that is available for growth and development of <b>other</b> <b>life</b> forms. The majority {{of the rest of}} this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat. The most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respiration.|$|E
5|$|Species {{that were}} unable {{to adapt to the}} {{changing}} environment and competition from <b>other</b> <b>life</b> forms became extinct. However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species. Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.|$|E

5|$|An ugly reef is this of the Dhu Heartach; no {{pleasant}} {{assemblage of}} shelves, and pools, and creeks, about which a child might {{play for a}} whole summer without weariness, like the Bell Rock or the Skerryvore, but one oval nodule of black-trap, sparsely bedabbled with an inconspicuous fucus, and alive in every crevice with a dingy insect between a slater and a bug. No <b>other</b> <b>life</b> was there but of sea-birds, and of the sea itself, that here ran like a mill-race, and growled about the outer reef for ever, and ever and again, in the calmest weather, roared and spouted on the rock itself.|$|E
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour <b>other</b> <b>life</b> forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E
5|$|With {{material}} from previous articles, Weisman uses {{the fate of}} the Mayan civilization to illustrate the possibility of an entrenched society vanishing and how the natural environment quickly conceals evidence. To demonstrate how vegetation could compromise human built infrastructure, Weisman interviewed hydrologists and employees at the Panama Canal, where constant maintenance is required to keep the jungle vegetation and silt away from the dams. To illustrate abandoned cities succumbing to nature, Weisman reports from Chernobyl, Ukraine (abandoned in 1986) and Varosha, Cyprus (abandoned in 1974). Weisman finds that their structures crumble as weather does unrepaired damage and <b>other</b> <b>life</b> forms create new habitats. In Turkey, Weisman contrasts the construction practices of the rapidly growing Istanbul, as typical for large cities in less developed countries, with the underground cities in Cappadocia. Due to a large demand for housing in Istanbul much of it was developed quickly with whatever material was available and could collapse in a major earthquake or other natural disaster. Cappadocian underground cities were built thousands of years ago out of volcanic tuff, and are likely to survive for centuries to come.|$|E

25|$|Forecasting {{the life}} {{expectancy}} directly, generally using ARIMA or other time series extrapolation procedures: that {{has the advantage of}} simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive <b>other</b> <b>life</b> table results.

25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that human theoreticians have underestimated how much alien life might differ from that on Earth. Aliens may be psychologically unwilling to attempt to communicate with human beings.
