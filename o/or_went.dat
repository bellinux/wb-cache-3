5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{accurate}} account of how many Indonesians died, they died in far greater numbers than the Europeans. Estimates of Indonesian deaths in fighting range from 45,000 to 100,000 and civilian dead exceeded 25,000 {{and may have been}} as high as 100,000. A total of 1,200 British soldiers were killed <b>or</b> <b>went</b> missing in Java and Sumatra in 1945 and 1946, most of them Indian soldiers. More than 5,000 Dutch soldiers lost their lives in Indonesia between 1945 and 1949. Many Japanese died; in Bandung alone, 1,057 died, only half of whom died in actual combat, the rest killed in rampages by Indonesians. Seven million people were displaced on Java and Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Army Group South's Donets Campaign {{had cost}} the Red Army some 70,000–80,000 {{personnel}} casualties. Of these troops lost, an estimated 45,200 were killed <b>or</b> <b>went</b> missing, while another 41,200 were wounded. Between April and July 1943, the Red Army took {{its time to}} rebuild its forces {{in the area and}} prepare for an eventual renewal of the German offensive, known as the Battle of Kursk. Overall German casualties are more difficult to come by but clues are provided by examining the casualties of the SS Panzer Corps, taking into consideration that the Waffen-SS divisions were frequently deployed where the fighting was expected to be the harshest. By 17 March, it is estimated that the SS Panzer Corps had lost around 44% of its fighting strength, including around 160 officers and about 4,300 enlisted personnel.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{was also}} close to Elizabeth's sisters. During his {{lifetime}} {{he was even}} rumored to have {{had an affair with}} his wife's older sister, Angelica, who 3 years before Hamilton's marriage to Elizabeth had eloped with John Barker Church, an Englishman who made a fortune in North America during the Revolution and later returned to Europe with his wife and children between 1783 and 1797. Even though the style of their correspondence during Angelica's 14-year residence in Europe was flirtatious, modern historians like Chernow and Fielding agree that despite contemporary gossip there is no conclusive evidence that Hamilton's relationship with Angelica was ever physical <b>or</b> <b>went</b> beyond a strong affinity between in-laws. Hamilton also maintained a correspondence with Elizabeth's younger sister Margarita, nicknamed Peggy, who was the recipient of his first letters praising her sister Elizabeth {{at the time of his}} courtship in early 1780.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, {{elements}} of the Corps participated in the German capture of Travnik, part of Operation Lawine. Afterwards, they withdrew to Slovenia. On 30 April, Shteifon was killed while passing through Zagreb. Colonel Anatoly Rogozhin then took over as commander. On 12 May, Rogozhin surrendered to the British near Klagenfurt. Members of the Corps were allowed to resettle in the West once hostilities had ceased. At the time of surrender, the Corps consisted of 3,500 men, according to Vertepov. Timofejev writes that the Corps consisted of 5,584 men {{by the end of}} the war. Between 1941 and 1945, 6,709 of its members were killed, wounded <b>or</b> <b>went</b> missing. In total, 17,090 men served in its ranks over the course of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Belgrade-based non-government {{organization}} Veritas lists 6,827 {{killed and}} {{missing from the}} Republic of Serbian Krajina, including 4,177 combatants and 2,650 civilians, and 307 JNA members who were from Croatia. Most of them were killed <b>or</b> <b>went</b> missing in 1991 (2,729) and 1995 (2,348). The most deaths occurred in Northern Dalmatia (1,605). The JNA has officially acknowledged 1,279 killed in action. The actual number was probably considerably greater, since casualties were consistently underreported. In one example, official reports spoke of two slightly wounded soldiers after an engagement, however, according to the unit's intelligence officer, the actual number was 50 killed and 150 wounded.|$|E

5|$|When the Chetnik leaders {{appointed}} by Draža Mihailović, Majors Boško Todorović and Dangić, {{became aware of}} the commencement of Operation Southeast Croatia, they advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans, and {{there was no need for}} the Chetniks to get involved. Following this, their units withdrew from their positions on the front line, let the Germans pass through their areas, <b>or</b> <b>went</b> home. Many withdrew across the Drina into German-occupied Serbia to avoid being engaged, which severely weakened the Partisan defences with the result that they suffered significant casualties and lost a great deal of territory. These actions severed any remaining cooperative links that remained between the Chetniks and Partisans in eastern Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to demographic losses through significant migrations, {{the population of}} Croatia suffered significant losses due to wars and epidemics. In the 20th century alone, there were several such events. The first was World War I, when {{the loss of the}} population of Croatia amounted to an estimated 190,000 persons, or about 5.5% of the total population recorded by the 1910 census. The 1918 flu pandemic started to take its toll in Croatia in July 1918, with peaks of the disease occurring in October and November. Available data is scarce, but it is estimated that the pandemic caused at least 15,00020,000 deaths. During World War II, nearly 195,000 people died in the territory of present-day Croatia. The surrender of the armed forces of the Independent State of Croatia and of the civilians accompanying the troops of the British Army at the end of World War II was followed by repatriation and subsequent events that became known as the Bleiburg tragedy. A substantial number of people were executed, but the exact number is disputed. The claims range from 12,00015,000 to as many as 80,000 killed in May 1945. Finally, approximately 20,000 were killed <b>or</b> <b>went</b> missing during the 19911995 Croatian War of Independence. The figure pertains only to those persons who would have been recorded by the 1991 census as living in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} displaced 10,000 Serb {{refugees from}} Mrkonjić Grad, adding {{to a growing}} humanitarian crisis as another 30,000 Serbs fled Sanski Most before the ARBiH captured it {{in the final days}} of Operation Sana. Approximately 6,000 non-Serbs were forced to flee their homes in Prijedor and Novi Grad by Bosnian Serb forces. According to Bosnian Serb sources, 480 Serbs died <b>or</b> <b>went</b> missing in the fighting in the area of Mrkonjić Grad. The figure includes 181 bodies recovered in a mass grave at the town's Serbian Orthodox cemetery. According to the Republika Srpska police who investigated the scene and interviewed witnesses, most of the dead were VRS prisoners of war or civilians who were killed by the 4th Guards Brigade to avenge the death of Colonel Andrija Matijaš, the brigade's deputy commander. The results of the investigation were forwarded to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), but the ICTY did not pursue the matter. , an investigation by the Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities against 27 high-ranking HV and HVO officers and Croatian officials is ongoing. In 2013, an officer and two soldiers of the 7th Guards Brigade charged with killing four Serb civilians near Mrkonjić Grad were acquitted, pending appeal.|$|E
