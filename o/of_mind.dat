5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{plays an}} important role in the development of theory <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> Theory <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> and joint attention are important precursors to a fully developed grasp of another individual's mental activity.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> is the ability to know that the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory <b>of</b> <b>Mind</b> develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory <b>of</b> <b>Mind.</b> It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|Childhood and {{adolescence}} allows {{the development of}} an internal working model useful for forming attachments. This internal working model is related to the individual's state <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> which develops with respect to attachment generally and explores how attachment functions in relationship dynamics based on childhood and adolescent experience. The organization of an internal working model is generally seen as leading to more stable attachments in those who develop such a model, rather than those who rely more on the individual's state <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> alone in forming new attachments.|$|E

5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy <b>of</b> <b>mind.</b> For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense {{in which they have}} free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning what they can and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about the very nature <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
