30|$|Our results {{identify}} risk awareness as {{a mediator}} between overconfidence and risk assessment. The availability heuristic (Schwarz et al. 1991; Tversky and Kahneman 1973) might explain why overconfident project managers perceive risks as less threatening: Overconfidence might reduce the availability <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> in project managers’ memories, and this lower availability <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> decreases the perceived threat <b>of</b> those <b>risks</b> (Pachur et al. 2012). However, in the present study, we did not assess the availability <b>of</b> <b>risks,</b> but only risk awareness as the generic attitude of people toward the threats to project success posed by project risks. Assessing the availability <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> together with overconfidence could advance the understanding of overconfidence by clarifying whether overconfidence indeed reduces the availability <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> in memory. When the availability <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> in project managers’ memories is low, they will find it harder to recall occasions in which risks occurred. This would reduce the estimated risk occurrence probabilities, as availability heuristic suggests that people base their likelihood estimates {{on the availability of}} events in memory (Schwarz et al. 1991; Tversky and Kahneman 1973). We see a research opportunity in evaluating the statement of Van Zant and Moore (2013) in detail, claiming that overconfidence can blind people to the size <b>of</b> the <b>risks</b> they are taking. Future research may investigate whether overconfidence reduces the availability <b>of</b> <b>risks,</b> therefore ‘blinding’ people to the threat posed by said risks.|$|R
