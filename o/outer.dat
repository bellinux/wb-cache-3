5|$|Dhumavati's <b>outer</b> inauspicious, fearful form {{reveals the}} dangers of {{considering}} sensory pleasures as fulfilment-giving. The winnowing basket, used to separate the husk from the grain, symbolizes the need to separate the <b>outer</b> illusory form from the inner reality. Her ugly form teaches the devotee {{to go beyond the}} <b>outer</b> deceptive appearances and seek the inner truths of life.|$|E
5|$|If {{one were}} to read these as written they would show a {{constant}} movement from the <b>outer</b> poetic experience to the inner experience of humor. The movement from the <b>outer</b> to the inner is a theme in Kierkegaard's works.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 NASA {{conducted}} a conceptual study called Human <b>Outer</b> Planets Exploration (HOPE) regarding the future human {{exploration of the}} <b>outer</b> Solar System. The target chosen to consider in detail was Callisto.|$|E

5|$|October 23, 2005– The <b>outer</b> rainbands of Hurricane Wilma drop over 3inches (75mm) of {{precipitation}} in the <b>Outer</b> Banks.|$|E
5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the <b>outer</b> valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the <b>outer</b> electrons are tightly bound. It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed <b>outer</b> valence shell in which its valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E
5|$|<b>Outer</b> space, also simply called space, {{refers to}} the {{relatively}} empty regions of the universe outside the atmospheres of celestial bodies. <b>Outer</b> space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. <b>Outer</b> space within the Solar System is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at {{what is known as}} the heliopause.|$|E
5|$|September 16, 1858– A {{hurricane}} brushes the <b>Outer</b> Banks.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Outer</b> Space Treaty {{provides}} the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of <b>outer</b> space by nation states, and includes in its definition of <b>outer</b> space the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that <b>outer</b> space is free for all nation states {{to explore and}} {{is not subject to}} claims of national sovereignty. It also prohibits the deployment of nuclear weapons in <b>outer</b> space. The treaty was passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of January 1, 2008 the treaty has been ratified by 98 states and signed by an additional 27 states.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt {{may also be}} divided into the inner and <b>outer</b> belts, with the inner belt formed by asteroids orbiting nearer to Mars than the 3:1 Kirkwood gap (2.5AU), and the <b>outer</b> belt formed by those asteroids closer to Jupiter's orbit. (Some authors subdivide the inner and <b>outer</b> belts at the 2:1 resonance gap (3.3 AU), whereas others suggest inner, middle, and <b>outer</b> belts; also see diagram).|$|E
5|$|The eyewall {{may vary}} {{over time in}} the form of eyewall {{replacement}} cycles, particularly in intense tropical cyclones. <b>Outer</b> rainbands can organize into an <b>outer</b> ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward, which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum. When the primary eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The <b>outer</b> eyewall eventually replaces the primary one {{at the end of the}} cycle, at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outer</b> ear is the {{external}} {{portion of the}} ear and includes the fleshy visible pinna (also called the auricle), the ear canal, and the <b>outer</b> layer of the eardrum (also called the tympanic membrane).|$|E
5|$|The <b>outer</b> {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the <b>outer</b> ward, originally within a small recess in the <b>outer</b> curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. The recess was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the <b>outer</b> wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. From the gate, the <b>outer</b> wall continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built leaning on the <b>outer</b> wall, as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the <b>outer</b> gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style that points to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. At the point where the <b>outer</b> wall joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the <b>outer</b> wall's chemin de ronde.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outer</b> {{layer of}} the {{epidermis}} (<b>outer</b> skin) consists of: sensory cells; cells that secrete mucus, which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into other types of cell. In specialized {{parts of the body}} the <b>outer</b> layer also contains colloblasts, found along the surface of tentacles and used in capturing prey, or cells bearing multiple large cilia, for locomotion. The inner {{layer of the}} epidermis contains a nerve net, and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>outer</b> {{wall was}} 2m thick at its base, and {{featured}} arched chambers {{on the level}} of the peribolos, crowned with a battlemented walkway, reaching a height of 8.5–9m. Access to the <b>outer</b> wall from the city was provided either through the main gates or through small posterns on the base of the inner wall's towers. The <b>outer</b> wall likewise had towers, situated approximately midway between the inner wall's towers, and acting in supporting role to them. They are spaced at 48–78m, with an average distance of 50–66m. Only 62 of the <b>outer</b> wall's towers survive. With few exceptions, they are square or crescent-shaped, 12–14m tall and 4m wide. They featured a room with windows {{on the level of}} the peribolos, crowned by a battlemented terrace, while their lower portions were either solid or featured small posterns, which allowed access to the <b>outer</b> terrace. The <b>outer</b> wall was a formidable defensive edifice in its own right: in the sieges of 1422 and 1453, the Byzantines and their allies, being too few to hold both lines of wall, concentrated on the defence of the <b>outer</b> wall.|$|E
5|$|The priory {{buildings}} {{stood at}} the centre of a walled precinct arranged in two courts, inner and <b>outer</b> with gatehouses at the entrances to both; {{the remains of the}} great gate of the inner court are extant but the <b>outer</b> gatehouse no longer survives. The gate comprised an <b>outer</b> porch, an inner gatehall and a porter's lodge on the ground floor with chambers above the arch. It survived intact into the early 18th century but only the <b>outer</b> porch remains. The structure consists of a single large round-headed archway on the <b>outer</b> side with two smaller arches of different sizes, both deeply rebated to accommodate doors, a few metres to the south. The larger arch was for wagons while pedestrians entered through the smaller arch. Little remains of the gatehall or the porter's lodge; the only remnants visible are the stub of its north wall and a latrine shaft.|$|E

5|$|Xenon is {{a member}} of the zero-valence {{elements}} that are called noble or inert gases. It is inert to most common chemical reactions (such as combustion, for example) because the <b>outer</b> valence shell contains eight electrons. This produces a stable, minimum energy configuration in which the <b>outer</b> electrons are tightly bound.|$|E
5|$|A replica wooden bridge {{runs from}} the <b>outer</b> defences over the water to an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked to the inner defences by another replica bridge, {{protected}} with two drawbridges. The ravelin formed a physical barrier to incoming artillery fire aimed {{at the entrance to}} the inner defences and could also have directed fire against enemy forces that breached the <b>outer</b> defensive line.|$|E

5|$|Aided by {{the monsoon}} trough, the <b>outer</b> rainbands of Typhoon Ruby brought an {{extended}} period of heavy rains across eastern Taiwan. According to press reports, one person was killed and another was initially reported as missing. River levels rose drastically, which led to flooding along low-lying areas. High seas associated with the <b>outer</b> rainbands of the storm were responsible for $9.89million in destruction to the Fujian Province.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{size of the}} two <b>outer</b> CO shells remains elusive, {{preliminary}} estimates suggest that one shell extends from about 1.5 to 4.0 arcseconds and the other expands as far as 7.0 arcseconds. Assuming the Jovian orbit of 5.5AU as the star radius, the inner shell would extend roughly 50 to 150 stellar radii (~300 to 800AU) with the <b>outer</b> one as far as 250 stellar radii (~1400AU). The Sun's heliopause is estimated at about 100 AU, so {{the size of this}} <b>outer</b> shell would be almost fourteen {{times the size of the}} Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Although thin, these <b>outer</b> layers {{determine}} the thermal {{evolution of the}} white dwarf. The degenerate electrons in the bulk of a white dwarf conduct heat well. Most of a white dwarf's mass is therefore at almost the same temperature (isothermal), {{and it is also}} hot: a white dwarf with surface temperature between 8,000K and 16,000K will have a core temperature between approximately 5,000,000K and 20,000,000K. The white dwarf is kept from cooling very quickly only by its <b>outer</b> layers' opacity to radiation.|$|E
5|$|Amalthea's orbit lies {{near the}} <b>outer</b> {{edge of the}} Amalthea Gossamer Ring, which is {{composed}} of the dust ejected from the satellite.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Craigmillar Castle is the 14th-century L-plan tower house, built on a rocky outcrop. Wrapped around this is the 15th-century {{courtyard}} wall, with ranges of buildings at the south-east, east, and west. Beyond the wall is a lower <b>outer</b> wall, enclosing a broad <b>outer</b> courtyard. This contained gardens and a chapel. Further gardens lay to the south, where {{the outline of a}} fish pond can be seen.|$|E

5|$|August 6, 1670– The <b>Outer</b> Banks are {{affected}} by a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1958, <b>outer</b> {{space has}} been the subject of {{multiple}} resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of <b>outer</b> space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional space law treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of <b>Outer</b> Space. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and anti-satellite weapons have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 Moon Treaty turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.|$|E
