5|$|The brown honeyeater {{population}} is declining in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> of native vegetation. Numbers are increasing in urban areas, particularly in parks and gardens and around farms; however, the new habitats have increased the incidences of death from cats, cars and collisions with windows. Overall the {{population is}} sufficiently large and widespread for the brown honeyeater to be considered by the IUCN to be of least concern for conservation.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} summer, Greatfoot is {{run over}} and killed while {{crossing}} a freeway during a hunt. The pups begin hearing a strange wolf howl, but when they track it they find a fresh kill and the familiar human scent. New kills appear every few days as the young wolves grow larger and stronger. One night when they hear the unusual howl, they are closer than usual to it and reach the kill in time to meet their benefactor, a human male. The pack stares at the man, before disappearing back into the forest, ignoring his howl. As he goes to leave, however, the six return to the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> and howl.|$|E

25|$|The {{environmental}} problem that attracted most international attention in Brazil in the 1980s was deforestation in the Amazon. Of all Latin American countries, Brazil {{still has the}} largest portion (66%) of its territory covered by forests, but clearing and burning in the Amazon proceeded at alarming rates in the 1970s and 1980s. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> resulted from the activities of ranchers, including large corporate operations, and a smaller portion resulted from slash and burn techniques used by small farmers. Technical changes involved in the transition from horizontal expansion of agriculture to increasing productivity also accounted for decreasing rates of deforestation.|$|E

25|$|If the {{presence}} of humans was relatively discreet since the Stone Age, concentrated principally atop the eskers, the development of mining activity (in particular of iron) has profoundly affected the region. The forests were exploited to feed the water-powered forges which grew up along the river. One {{of the most important}} was that of Gysinge, founded in 1668 and situated right next to the park. In 1975, in reaction to the threat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> of a vast forest, the movement {{for the creation of a}} national park began, culminating in the park's opening in 1998. The park was added to the Natura 2000 Network and included in the Ramsar Convention's list of wetlands.|$|E
25|$|Early on May 5, Warren's V Corps was {{advancing}} {{south toward}} the Plank Road when Ewell's Corps {{appeared in the}} west on the Turnpike. Meade halted his army and directed Warren to attack if the Confederates were a small, isolated group. Ewell's men erected earthworks on the western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> known as Saunders Field. Warren requested a delay from Meade so that Sedgwick's VI Corps could be brought in on his right and extend his line. By 1 p.m., Meade was frustrated by the delay and ordered Warren to attack before Sedgwick could arrive. The brigade of Brig. Gen. Romeyn B. Ayres had to take cover in a gully to avoid enfilading fire. The brigade of Brig. Gen. Joseph J. Bartlett made better progress to Ayres's left and overran the position of Brig. Gen. John M. Jones, who was killed. However, since Ayres's men were unable to advance, Bartlett's right flank was now exposed to attack, and his brigade was forced to flee back across the clearing.|$|E

500|$|Sean {{leaves to}} jog the [...] {{out of the}} forest to find help while Wes and Lauren wait at the Jeep. He comes across some run down {{buildings}} where he finds a hunting paraphernalia, a bear trap, and dead animals. As he leaves, the bear appears. He tries to sneak past the bear, but instead he runs into the bear and it throws him {{on the roof of the}} shack and then he falls into a chicken coop. Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep, but his leg is injured. Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> to see if he can get a signal on his cell phone. It does not work and the Bear nearly catches him. He quickly climbs back down and gets back to the Jeep though it still will not start. He and Lauren hide in the Jeep with the wounded Sean in the back.|$|E
500|$|From {{its peak}} of 235 men, disease, {{injuries}} and casualties had reduced Company B's fighting strength to 18 men. Murphy {{being the only}} officer remaining on 26 January was made the company commander. The company awaited reinforcements as Murphy watched the approaching Germans, [...] "I see the Germans lining up for an attack. Six tanks rumble {{to the outskirts of}} Holtzwihr, split into groups of threes, and fan out toward either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing.</b> Then wave after wave of white dots, barely discernible against the background of snow, start across the field. They are enemy infantrymen". The Germans scored a direct hit on an M10 tank destroyer, setting it on fire and causing its crew to abandon it. Murphy ordered his men to retreat to positions in the woods, remaining alone at his post shooting his M1 carbine and relaying orders via his telephone while the Germans aimed fire directly at his position. Murphy mounted the abandoned, burning tank destroyer and began firing its [...]50 caliber machine gun at the advancing Germans, killing a squad crawling through a ditch towards him.|$|E

2500|$|Heavy cavalry fighting, often dismounted, had {{continued}} on April 7 at Wilson's Farm and Tenmile Bayou. On April 8, Lee boldly charged a small force of Confederate cavalry at the Moss Plantation, three {{miles south of}} Mansfield, Louisiana, and pushed the Confederate horsemen off Honeycutt Hill. Taylor had stationed one infantry division (led by Brigadier General Alfred Mouton) in the woods along the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> just north of Honeycutt Hill and east of the road. Seeing this increase in enemy strength, Lee requested infantry support. Landram's 2,400-man division of the 13th Corps was sent to Lee's aid and deployed to face Mouton. Banks {{went to the front}} to see for himself. Meanwhile, Taylor brought up a second infantry division (Walker's) to the woods {{on the other side of}} the road in the middle of the day. The arrival of Walker's division gave Taylor a numerical edge [...] he had about 9,000 men; Banks had about 5,000 men. More significantly, the Union deployment was aligned to its right, facing Mouton, with only a cavalry brigade holding the left wing.|$|E
2500|$|Early on May 5, Warren's V Corps was {{advancing}} over farm lanes {{toward the}} Plank Road when Ewell's Corps {{appeared in the}} west. Grant was notified of the encounter and instructed [...] "If any opportunity presents itself of pitching into a part of Lee's army, do so without giving time for disposition." [...] Meade halted his army and directed Warren to attack, assuming that the Confederates were a small, isolated group and not an entire infantry corps. Ewell's men erected earthworks on the western end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clearing</b> known as Saunders Field. Warren approached on the eastern end with the division of Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin {{on the right and}} the division of Brig. Gen. James S. Wadsworth on the left, but he hesitated to attack because the Confederate position extended beyond Griffin's right, which would mean that they would be subjected to enfilade fire. He requested a delay from Meade so that Sedgwick's VI Corps could be brought in on his right and extend his line. By 1 p.m., Meade was frustrated by the delay and ordered Warren to attack before Sedgwick could arrive.|$|E
