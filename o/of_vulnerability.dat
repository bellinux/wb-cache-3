5|$|Only {{two of the}} disc's 11 tracks {{attempt a}} genuine {{expression}} <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability.</b> Just one, 'Blank Page,' finds her looking inside and taking some blame. It's a pretty song, if one that blatantly rides Adele's coattails. Not only does 'Page' employ the same piano/voice arrangement as that star's 'Someone Like You,' Aguilera apes the precise length of Adele's notes.|$|E
5|$|Prevalent minorities, {{particularly}} Hindu and Christian, {{feel a sense}} <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> {{because of}} their religious beliefs. Labourers and farmhands comprise the countless Christian villages throughout Punjab; many are descendants of people who converted from Hinduism to Christianity under the British Raj, and considered low caste {{by virtue of their}} birth. A small population of wealthy, well-educated Christians have settled in Karachi; however, as a result of increasing Islamization, religious intolerance in Pakistani society, blashphemy laws and Islamist militancy, most have left Pakistan to settle in other countries where there is more religious tolerance, such as Canada and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Survival horror {{games are}} a subgenre of horror games, where the player {{is unable to}} fully prepare or arm their avatar. The player usually {{encounters}} several factors to make combat unattractive as a primary option, such as {{a limited number of}} weapons or invulnerable enemies, if weapons are available, their ammunition is sparser than in other games, and powerful weapons such as rocket launchers are rare, if even available at all. Thus, players are more vulnerable than in action games, and the hostility of the environment sets up a narrative where the odds are weighed decisively against the avatar. This gameplay shifts away from direct combat, and players must learn to evade enemies or turn the environment against them. Games try to enhance the experience <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> by making the game single player rather than multiplayer, and by giving the player an avatar who is more frail than the typical action game hero.|$|E
40|$|The public part <b>of</b> the <b>vulnerability</b> {{management}} cycle — publication-notificationpatch — is {{of interest}} to system administrators. We describe the architecture <b>of</b> the <b>vulnerability</b> notification Cassandra system 1. The timeliness of Cassandra notifications was evaluated by using the publication dates of CERT Incident Notes as approximations for the dates when vulnerabilities are widely exploited. We found that notifications sent by Cassandra in 2001 (until November) provided a forewarning of 60 days on average. However, these notifications were not always timely. An analysis <b>of</b> the <b>vulnerability</b> information flow identified sources of undesirable delays. A new Cassandra service, CVE Change Logs, was created to report daily changes to the CVE and bypass some sources of delays. Other efforts by MITRE mitigated other sources of delays and consolidated changes on their web site. An unexpected {{finding of this study}} is that the timing and the number <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> involved in the method <b>of</b> disclosing <b>vulnerabilities</b> can contribute to notification delays caused by the limited processing capacity of intermediates and the finite patching capability of system administrators. We conclude that large batch processing <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> contributes to notification and patching delays and is undesirable. For the same reasons, randomly timed disclosures <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> should be undesirable, suggesting the creation of a focused mechanism for the disclosure <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed that these students, although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

25|$|Other causes <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> in Pakistan are the {{everyday}} harassment by corrupt government officials, {{as well as}} their underperformance, exclusion and denial of basic rights to many in Pakistan. Also, lack of adequate health care by the state lead the poor to seek private sources, which are expensive, but still preferable to the possibility of medical malpractice and being given expired medicines in state run medical facilities.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{political}} {{developments in the}} 1980s such as the militant Khalistan movement, the influx of undocumented Bangladeshi immigration into Assam, Muslim mobilisation in the Shah Bano case {{as well as the}} Satanic Verses controversy caused a sense <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> among the Hindus in India. The VHP and the BJP utilised this sense <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> to push forward a militant Hindutva nationalist agenda leading to the Ram Janmabhoomi movement. The BJP officially adopted Hindutva as its ideology in its 1989 Palampur resolution, reversing the 1951 move of its original founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee. This led to the unlawful demolition of the Babri Masjid by rioters in 1992.|$|E

25|$|The {{main effect}} of {{suspension}} bondage {{is to create a}} heightened sense <b>of</b> <b>vulnerability</b> and inescapability, as the subject is made to feel that by attempting to free themselves they may fall and hurt themselves, thus also creating a form of mental bondage in addition to the physical one that holds them. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of objectification, submissiveness and erotic helplessness for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as performance art at BDSM conventions and fetish-themed nightclubs.|$|E
40|$|Vulnerabilities are {{flaws in}} {{software}} that open avenues of attack for operations {{that are not}} initially intended to be performed.

In this research, we introduce a machine learning framework for classifying vulnerabilities and predicting exploitability.

Moreover, we introduce a new system for scoring the severity <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities.</b> We use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to build our classifier {{due to the nature of}} the problem.

40|$|Rigorous {{identification}} <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> {{in program}} code {{is a key}} to implementing and operating secure systems. Unfortunately, only some types <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> can be detected automatically. While techniques from software testing can accelerate the search for security flaws, in the general case discovery <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> is a tedious process that requires significant expertise and time. In this paper, we propose a method for assisted discovery <b>of</b> <b>vulnerabilities</b> in source code. Our method proceeds by embedding code in a vector space and automatically determining API usage patterns using machine learning. Starting from a known vulnerability, these patterns can be exploited to guide the auditing of code and to identify potentially vulnerable code with similar characteristics—a process we refer to as vulnerability extrapolation. We empirically demonstrate the capabilities of our method in different experiments. In a case study with the library FFmpeg, we are able to narrow the search for interesting code from 6, 778 to 20 functions and discover two security flaws, one being a known flaw and the other constituting a zero-day vulnerability. ...|$|R
