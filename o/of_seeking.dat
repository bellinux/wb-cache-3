40|$|Sensation seeking {{is central}} to {{research}} on the prevention of risky health behaviors, but current measures <b>of</b> sensation <b>seeking</b> are fairly long, thereby reducing their chances of inclusion in some research projects. Hence, we developed and evaluated two brief indices <b>of</b> sensation <b>seeking,</b> a four-item measure that retains the framework <b>of</b> the Sensation <b>Seeking</b> Scale-Form V (SSS-V) and a shorter two-item measure focusing on the risk-taking elements <b>of</b> sensation <b>seeking.</b> We compared {{the performance of the}} new indices with that of two well documented but longer measures <b>of</b> sensation <b>seeking.</b> The evaluation was based on data provided by more than 5000 teens and pre-teens in grades 7 through 11. Psychometric analyses revealed that {{the internal consistency of the}} two new measures was very good overall and across grade and sex categories. Additionally, the new indices correlated as expected with a series of risk and protective factors as well as tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use. Both indices performed in ways remarkably similar to the established measures <b>of</b> sensation <b>seeking</b> and should prove useful for future research involving risky health behaviors...|$|R

However, Tekuder's pro-Muslim stance was not popular, and in 1284, Abaqa's Buddhist son Arghun, {{with the support of}} the Great Khan Kublai, led a revolt and had Tekuder executed.

5|$|Diary of a Camper {{is a short}} American film {{made using}} id Software's 1996 first-person shooter video game Quake, {{released}} in 1996. It was created by United Ranger Films, then a subdivision of a popular group of video game players, or clan, known as the Rangers. The film was first released over the Internet as a non-interactive game demo file. The video is generally considered the first known example of machinima—the art of using real-time, virtual 3D environments, often game engines, to create animated films. The story centers on a lone camper, a player waiting in a strategic location instead <b>of</b> <b>seeking</b> active battle, who faces {{five members of the}} Rangers clan in a deathmatch, a type of multiplayer game in which the goal is to kill as many opponents as possible.|$|E

In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the Spanish Match, as it came to be called, against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on the state. As a result of his pro-Spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the Commons, who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the Spanish ambassador's court. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife's death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.|$|E

Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background <b>of</b> <b>seeking</b> out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in the sense of being village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E
