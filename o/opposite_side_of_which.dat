60|$|The canoe behaved {{much better}} under sail than I had hoped--infinitely {{better than the}} battle-ship Sari had--and we made good {{progress}} almost due west across the gulf, upon the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> I hoped to find {{the mouth of the}} river of which Juag had told me.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid her}} fingers upon his arm, {{and they both}} stood still. They had turned into the street, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> were the flats where Anna lived. Glancing idly up at her own window as they had swung round the corner she had seen a strange thing. The {{curtains}} which she had left drawn were open, and the electric lights were turned on. Then, even as they stood there, the room was plunged into darkness.|$|E
60|$|The fort stood, {{as we have}} said, on {{the banks}} of the Assiniboine River, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the land was {{somewhat}} wooded, though not heavily, with oak, maple, poplar, aspens, and willows; while at the back of the fort the great prairie rolled out like a green sea to the horizon, and far beyond that again to the base of the Rocky Mountains. The plains at this time, however, were a sheet of unbroken snow, and the river a mass of solid ice.|$|E
50|$|Kalundborg is a Danish {{city with}} a {{population}} of 16,343 (1 January 2015), the main town of the municipality of the same name and the site of its municipal council. It is situated on the northwestern coast of the largest Danish island, Zealand, on the <b>opposite,</b> eastern <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> lies Copenhagen, 110 km away.|$|R
50|$|The Cabinet Secretariat (Hindi: मंत्रिमंडल सचिवालय; IAST: Mantrimanḍala Sacivālaya) is {{responsible}} for the administration of the Government of India. It functions from the Secretariat Building, New Delhi, where most of the Cabinet of India sits. It comprises a set of two buildings on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> Rajpath <b>which</b> are home {{to some of the most}} important ministries of the Government of India, situated on Raisina Hill, New Delhi, India.|$|R
50|$|The center opened as Lakeshore Plaza in 1970, {{featuring}} Roses Stores and JCPenney. Belk-Gallant {{joined in}} 1973 {{as a third}} anchor. An expansion in 1987 added a new wing on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> JCPenney, <b>which</b> included a Sears, a food court, and a movie theater. Also, the Roses store became a second Belk. In 1998, the mall was sold to Colonial Properties, and again in 2010 to Garrison Investment Group.|$|R
60|$|Day had broken, {{but there}} was little light and Blake, looking out from behind a slab of rock in the shelter of which a few junipers clung, thought that three or four miles would be the longest {{distance}} that he could see. This was peculiarly unfortunate, because he understood that their course led across a wide untimbered stretch, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> one or two isolated bluffs would indicate the neighbourhood of the factory. Disastrous consequences might follow the missing of these woods.|$|E
60|$|The litter {{stopped as}} it {{approached}} the tank, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the Prince was seated on his musnud. Middlemas assisted the Begum to descend, and led her, deeply veiled with silver muslin, towards the platform of marble. The {{rest of the}} retinue of the Begum followed in their richest and most gaudy attire, all males, however; nor was there a symptom of woman being in her train, except that a close litter, guarded by twenty black slaves, having their sabres drawn, remained at some distance in a thicket of flowering shrubs.|$|E
60|$|Setting his cresset {{upon the}} ground, Pan-sat {{commenced}} hurriedly to toss {{the bits of}} broken stone aside, presently revealing a small aperture {{at the base of}} the wall upon the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> there appeared to be a further accumulation of rubble. This he also removed until he had a hole of sufficient size to permit the passage of his body, and leaving the cresset still burning upon the floor the priest crawled through the opening he had made and disappeared from the sight of the watcher hiding in the shadows of the narrow passageway behind him.|$|E
50|$|The monsoon became {{active in}} May as water {{temperatures}} became warm. Twin depressions formed during June on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> India, <b>which</b> helped intensify the monsoon over the country. A notable {{feature of the}} season was the Arabian Sea being more active than the Bay of Bengal. The IMD began naming tropical cyclones within the basin in 2004, beginning after the monsoon season. As such, only two cyclonic storms {{in the latter half}} of the year were named.|$|R
50|$|A user menu {{placed on}} the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the screen, <b>which</b> has been {{available}} since GNOME 2.14 but has become more prominent in GNOME 3.x, holds access to account and system settings as well as options to log out, switch user, and shut down the computer.|$|R
60|$|This broad alley, {{the great}} <b>side</b> alley <b>of</b> the garden {{on the side}} toward the city, was called the Alley of the Oranges. There is another similar alley on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the garden, <b>which</b> is toward the river, and that is called the Alley of the Riverside.|$|R
60|$|Another narrow passage led {{through this}} wall, {{and at its}} end Tarzan and his warriors found {{themselves}} in a broad avenue, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> crumbling edifices of hewn granite loomed dark and forbidding. Upon the crumbling debris along the face of the buildings trees had grown, and vines wound {{in and out of the}} hollow, staring windows; but the building directly opposite them seemed less overgrown than the others, and in a much better state of preservation. It was a massive pile, surmounted by an enormous dome. At either side of its great entrance stood rows of tall pillars, each capped by a huge, grotesque bird carved from the solid rock of the monoliths.|$|E
60|$|Light {{snow was}} driving across the waste before a savage wind when the party sat at breakfast one morning. Day had broken, {{but there was}} little light, and Blake, looking out from behind a slab of rock in the shelter of which a few junipers clung, thought that three or four miles would be the longest {{distance}} that he could see. This was peculiarly unfortunate, because an Indian trapper whom they had met two days before had told them that their course led across a wide untimbered stretch, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> one or two isolated bluffs would indicate the neighborhood of the factory. Disastrous consequences might follow the missing of these woods.|$|E
60|$|The passage {{was a long}} one, {{and seemed}} to pervade the whole square {{basement}} of the Manor House. We traversed but {{one side of the}} square, however, {{and at the end of}} it she stopped, and put her candle down and opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a small paved courtyard, the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was formed by a detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham's room, and like Miss Havisham's watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.|$|E
50|$|A coup-contrecoup injury {{occurs when}} the force {{impacting}} the head is not only strong enough to cause a contusion {{at the site of}} impact but also able to move the brain and cause it to slam into the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the skull, <b>which</b> causes an additional contusion.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the trick}} popularized by Anderson is an illusion, other magicians have {{performed}} the trick {{by a series}} of illusions involving rubber cement and a concealed mechanism with a sharp tip on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the arm, <b>which</b> can be [...] "activated" [...] when one appears to penetrate the arm.|$|R
50|$|A {{pinhole camera}} {{is a simple}} camera without a lens but with a tiny aperture, a pinhole - {{effectively}} a light-proof box with a small hole in one side. Light from a scene passes through the aperture and projects an inverted image on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the box, <b>which</b> {{is known as the}} camera obscura effect.|$|R
60|$|But {{all that}} is neither here nor there; what I {{have to tell you}} now is that Captain Morgan in this open boat with his twenty mates reached the Cape of Salmedina toward the fall of day. Arriving within view of the harbor they {{discovered}} the plate fleet at anchor, with two men-of-war and an armed galley riding as a guard {{at the mouth of the}} harbor, scarce half a league distant from the other ships. Having spied the fleet in this posture, the pirates presently pulled down their sails and rowed along the coast, feigning to be a Spanish vessel from Nombre de Dios. So hugging the shore, they came boldly within the harbor, upon the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> you might see the fortress a considerable distance away.|$|E
60|$|No. 8 St. Oswald's Buildings was a roomy house, which owed its cheapness to its situation, {{this being}} neither in the genteel nor the busy part of Bexley. It {{was tall and}} red, and possessed a good many rooms, and it looked out into a narrow street, the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> {{consisted}} of the long wall of a brewery, which was joined farther on {{to that of the}} stable-yard of the Fortinbras Arms, the principal hotel, which had been much frequented in old posting days, and therefore had offices on a large scale. Only their side, however, was presented to St. Oswald's Buildings, the front, with its arched 'porte cochere,' being in the High Street, as it was still called, though it was a good deal outshone by the newer part of the town.|$|E
60|$|Would he be {{in time to}} rescue? He hoped against hope. At {{least he}} could be revenged, and in his wrath {{it seemed to him}} that he was equal to the task of wiping out the entire {{population}} of that terrible city. It was nearly noon when he reached the great bowlder at the top of which terminated the secret passage to the pits beneath the city. Like a cat he scaled the precipitous sides of the frowning granite KOPJE. A moment later he was running through the darkness of the long, straight tunnel that led to the treasure vault. Through this he passed, then on and on until at last he came to the well-like shaft upon the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> lay the dungeon with the false wall.|$|E
5000|$|The station {{replaced}} {{the original and}} was built to its north, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the bridge <b>which</b> takes the road to Mexborough below the line. The main station building was at road level and this contained the booking office, parcels office and stationmaster's room. This remains, in use, as the offices of a manufacturing company.|$|R
50|$|A four-person gondola is {{situated}} {{next to the}} train station for easy access to Verbier and the ski slopes above. A bus service also runs from the train station to Verbier and to Bruson, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the valley, <b>which</b> offers access to a smaller, quieter, ski area. The main road link to Verbier also runs through Le Châble.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Lavie {{moved to}} New York City where he {{directed}} several workshops on his plays, and gradually shifted his focus to songwriting. In 2003, he relocated to Berlin and began recording his first album, The <b>Opposite</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> the Sea, <b>which</b> he self-produced. The album {{was released in}} Europe in January and February 2007, and in the United States in March 2009.|$|R
60|$|At the {{appointed}} hour, the brothers {{were standing on}} the top of the cliff, with a broad estuary before them; on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> lay the town of Ewmouth at the foot of the old castle, with fresh modern fortifications towards the sea. The town, with its church towers and gas chimneys, sloped away from it; vessels thronged the harbour; and a long weird-looking thready suspension-bridge spanned the broad tide-river to East Ewmouth, the village fast growing into a suburb. There had not been more than time to point out the details to Lance before a waggonet drove up from one of the roads that branched among pleasant 'villa residences;' and in it appeared a white-haired but hearty-looking gentleman, prepossessing and merry, very unlike Lance's notion of attorneys, who shook hands with them warmly, and took care to put the boy under the shade of the driving- seat.|$|E
60|$|So {{day after}} day they traveled, {{sometimes}} in deep ravines, sometimes high up among the hills, sometimes coming upon a stream and taking in a supply of water, and sometimes well-nigh mad with thirst. They had cut up two of the empty water-skins and had made rough shoes for their horses, and believed that they had entirely thrown their pursuers off the trail, winding along on what {{was little more than}} a goat's track up the steep face of a valley, the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was a perpendicular cliff. They had nearly gained the top when the crack of a rifle was heard from the opposite cliff, which was not more than two hundred yards away, although the depth of the gorge was fully a thousand feet. Looking across they saw that nearly opposite to them stood an Indian village, and that a number of redskins were running toward the edge.|$|E
60|$|We {{did not see}} any bear sign. On the {{way back}} to camp we rode out of the forest and down a wide valley, the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> was open slope with patches of alder. Even at a {{distance}} I could discern the color of these open glades and grassy benches. They had a tinge of purple, like purple sage. When I got to them I found a profusion of asters of the most exquisite shades of lavender, pink and purple. That slope was long, and all the way up we rode through these beautiful wild flowers. I shall never forget that sight, nor the many asters that shone like stars out of the green. The pink ones were new to me, and actually did not seem real. I noticed my horse occasionally nipped a bunch and ate them, which seemed to me almost as heartless as to tread them under foot.|$|E
50|$|Is {{about a man}} {{suffering}} a series of terrifying nightmares and encountering she-demons {{in the form of}} little girls who take him to {{what appeared to be a}} paradise that existed on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> waterfalls in <b>which</b> they were swimming in. The sleepers finds out the little girls were not what they appeared to be and screams to escape the nightmare.|$|R
25|$|Lloydminster is a Canadian city {{which has}} the unusual {{geographic}} distinction of straddling the provincial border between Alberta and Saskatchewan. Unlike most such cases (such as Texarkana and Kansas City), Lloydminster is not a pair of twin cities on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a border <b>which</b> merely share the same name, but is incorporated by both provinces as a single city with a single municipal administration.|$|R
50|$|By 1912, the Hartlepool {{business}} had grown further with premises opening on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Lynn Street, <b>which</b> Matthias called The Coliseum and buildings on Whitby Street which he named Birmingham House. The business {{continued to grow}} and in 1914 opened a new department store in Briggate, Leeds. This store was later expanded in 1938 by purchasing neighbouring department store H & D Hart.|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, he soon {{reached an}} open plat of turf, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which,</b> a rock, rising {{abruptly}} from a gently sloping plain, offered its grey and weatherbeaten front to the traveller. Ivy mantled its sides in some places, and in others oaks and holly bushes, whose roots found nourishment in the cliffs of the crag, waved over the precipices below, like the plumage {{of the warrior}} over his steel helmet, giving grace to that whose chief expression was terror. At {{the bottom of the}} rock, and leaning, as it were, against it, was constructed a rude hut, built chiefly of the trunks of trees felled in the neighbouring forest, and secured against the weather by having its crevices stuffed with moss mingled with clay. The stem of a young fir-tree lopped of its branches, with a piece of wood tied across near the top, was planted upright by the door, as a rude emblem of the holy cross. At a little distance on the right hand, a fountain of the purest water trickled out of the rock, and was received in a hollow stone, which labour had formed into a rustic basin. Escaping from thence, the stream murmured down the descent by a channel which its course had long worn, and so wandered through the little plain to lose itself in the neighbouring wood.|$|E
60|$|The {{wind was}} still easterly, {{accompanied}} with rather a heavy swell of sea for the operations in hand. A landing was, however, made this morning, when the artificers were immediately employed in scraping the seaweed off the upper {{course of the}} building, in order to apply the moulds of the first course of the staircase, that the joggle-holes might be marked off in the upper course of the solid. This was also necessary previously to the writer's fixing {{the position of the}} entrance door, which was regulated chiefly by the appearance of the growth of the seaweed on the building, indicating the direction of the heaviest seas, on the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the door was placed. The landing-master's crew succeeded in towing into the creek on the western side of the rock the praam-boat with the balance-crane, which had now been on board of the praam for five days. The several pieces of this machine, having been conveyed along the railways upon the waggons to a position immediately under the bridge, were elevated to its level, or thirty feet above the rock, in the following manner. A chain-tackle was suspended over a pulley from the cross-beam connecting the tops of the kingposts of the bridge, which was worked by a winch-machine with wheel, pinion, and barrel, round which last the chain was wound. This apparatus was placed on the beacon side of the bridge, at the distance of about twelve feet from the cross-beam and pulley {{in the middle of the}} bridge. Immediately under the cross-beam a hatch was formed in the roadway of the bridge, measuring seven feet in length and five feet in breadth, made to shut with folding boards like a double door, through which stones and other articles were raised; the folding doors were then let down, and the stone or load was gently lowered upon a waggon which was wheeled on railway trucks towards the lighthouse. In this manner the several castings of the balance-crane were got up to the top of the solid of the building.|$|E
