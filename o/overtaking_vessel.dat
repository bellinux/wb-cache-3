5000|$|On 6 January 2010 the Ady Gil was {{involved}} in a collision with the Japanese whaling vessel [...] in the Southern Ocean when the Shonan Maru No 2 hit it, and the Ady Gil was subsequently abandoned. An investigation into the collision by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) was inconclusive in assigning blame for the collision. AMSA was unable to verify claims made by Sea Shepherd, while the Japanese government declined to participate with the investigation saying any information it had might be needed for an inquiry by its own authorities. However Maritime New Zealand investigators released a report that the Ady Gil was the stand on vessel and had right of way. The Shonan Maru No 2 was the port side vessel, and the <b>overtaking</b> <b>vessel,</b> and under both circumstances, had an obligation to keep well clear of the Ady Gil. The report did conclude however that the captains of both the Ady Gil and the whaler, the Shonan Maru No 2, [...] "were partly responsible for either contributing to, or failing to respond to the 'close quarters' situation that led to the collision".|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} mainly {{concerned}} with the interaction effects between two vessels and sidewall with a mound. Experimental study on hydrodynamic forces between ship and sidewall with a mound was already shown in the previous paper, measured by varying the distances between ship and sidewall. The ship maneuvering simulation was conducted {{to find out the}} minimum safe distance between vessels, which is needed to avoid sea accident in confined waters. From the inspection of this investigation, it indicates the following result. When and if one vessel passes the other vessel through the proximity of sidewall with a mound, the spacing between two vessels is needed for the velocity ratio of 1. 2, compared to the case of 1. 5. Also, for the case of ship-size estimation, the ship maneuvering motion is more affected by interaction effects for the <b>overtaken</b> small <b>vessel,</b> compared to the <b>overtaking</b> large <b>vessel...</b>|$|R
5000|$|On February 15, 2010, it was {{reported}} that Pete Bethune, the former captain of the Ady Gil, boarded the Shonan Maru at night for the purpose of making a citizens arrest of its captain for attempted murder of his own crew and the destruction of the Ady Gil. Bethune, who reportedly had to overcome spikes and anti-boarding nets to board the Japanese vessel, was also to present the captain with a bill for $3 million USD and a letter outlining the findings of maritime experts who found that the Japanese vessel was at fault for the collision as it was the <b>overtaking</b> <b>vessel</b> and did not have right of way. According to the crew of the Shonan Maru, Bethune had thrown butyric acid onto the ship, giving a chemical burn to one sailor. Paul Watson, group founder and captain of the Steve Irwin, said that the mission was intended as a message to the New Zealand government which the SSCS accuses of hypocrisy and failure to represent the interests of the Ady Gil and its captain. In an interview, Watson said, [...] "If we had sunk a Japanese vessel we would now be under arrest by the Australian navy." [...] Meanwhile, New Zealands government was being criticised by the main opposition party of [...] "washing their hands" [...] of Mr. Bethunes fate (despite the government offering consular assistance), after Foreign Minister McCully declared that Bethune must have been well aware of the consequences of his actions.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrodynamic}} {{interaction between}} two large vessels can't be neglected when two large vessels are closed {{to each other}} in restricted waterways such as in a harbor or narrow channel. This paper is mainly concerned with the ship maneuvering motion based on the hydrodynamic interaction effects between two large vessels moving each other in curved narrow channel. In this research, the characteristic features of the hydrodynamic interaction forces between two large vessels are described and illustrated, and the effects of velocity ratio and the spacing between two vessels are summarized and discussed. Also, the Inchon outer harbor area through the PALMI island channel in Korea was selected, and the ship maneuvering simulation was carried out to propose an appropriate safe speed and distance between two ships, which is required to avoid sea accident in confined waters. From the inspection of this investigation, it indicates the following result. Under the condition of SP 12 ≤ 0. 5 L, it may encounter a dangerous tendency of grounding or collision due to the combined effect of the interaction between ships and external forces. Also considering the interaction and wind effect as a parameter, an overtaken and <b>overtaking</b> <b>vessel</b> in narrow channel can navigate while keeping its own original course under the following conditions; the lateral separation between two ships is about kept at 0. 6 times of ship length and 15 degrees of range in maximum rudder angle. On the other hand, two ships while overtaking in curved narrow channel such as Inchon outer harbor in Korea should be navigated under the following conditions; SP 12 is about kept at 1. 0 times of ship length and the wind velocity should not be stronger than 10  m/s...|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} in marine traffic {{has resulted in}} the need for traffic routing schemes in areas of high vessel density. In order to assess the viability of a scheme before it is brought into use a simulation study can be used. This thesis describes the construction of a computer model to simulate the behaviour of mariners using the concepts of domains and arenas to control their actions. The arena is an area around a ship where one navigator takes account of another ship's presence. The domain is the area around his ship which a navigator wishes to keep clear of other vessels and stationary objects. The model is validated against data gathered in the Dover Strait from the coastguard radar station at St. Margaret's Bay and from experiments conducted in a radar training simulator. The model is shown to produce realistic results for <b>vessels</b> <b>overtaking</b> one another and for vessels meeting with a collision risk 96 per cent of situations can be realistically simulated.

40|$|New Profile for the Amsterdam-Rhinecanal The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a new profile for the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The new profile needs to be well navigable and {{requires}} to have stable bank constructions. Simultaneously several social aspects {{have to be taken}} into consideration. The assignment is summarized as follows: Design a new profile of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal with a stable bank protection that takes future developments, durability and recreation into consideration. The history of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal shows that the draft of the vessels that use this canal has increased from 3. 30 to 4. 00 meters. This four-metre draft has been permitted since 1988 and was based on the dimensions of the push tow units. In the late 90 s of the past century, a new generation of inland vessels made its appearance. Around 2002 problems to the bank constructions due to erosion were detected for the first time, possibly caused by the new generation inland vessels. The number of bigger inland vessels, particularly those in the VIa category has strongly increased over the past years together with the engine power and cargo capacity of many vessels (increase in scale). A representative canal section of the Amsterdam-Rhine canal, just north of Breukelen, has been chosen as research site. At this location erosion ranges from 0. 20 to 1. 70 meters within 15 meters distance of the sheet piles. The possible cause of this erosion has been further investigated in this report. Also research has been done to determine the governing hydraulic load, which is generated by governing <b>vessels</b> <b>overtaking</b> another <b>vessel.</b> The governing situation is defined as follows: a Rijnmaxship (135 x 17 x 4. 00 m) overtaking a four barge push-towing vessel (198 x 22. 8 x 4. 00 m). In this situation, the return current is governing compared to a situation when loads from the main and bow thrusters are considered. The return current has been calculated with the 1 D model DIPRO. DIPRO has also been used to validate the 2 D model in Delft 3 D, to further elaborate the return current in the 2 D model. The 2 D model in Delft 3 D has been used to determine the maximum return currents around the two governing vessels. These values have been translated {{to the bottom of the}} canal by calculating the erosion. From these results can be concluded that canal profile (2) has twice the amount of erosion compared to canal profile (3). In this report canal profile (3) is recommended as the new normative canal profile for the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. Canal profile (3) is a combination of a box profile with a sloped upper bank and bottom, with in the middle a waterdepth of 7. 60 meter. The depth in front of the sheet pile is 6. 00 meter. The wet cross section is 751 m 2. The bank construction consists of a sheet pile with a slope. The outcome of this thesis is a design for a new representative canal profile in the Amsterdam-Rhine canal. The normative hydraulic load (return current) causes minimum erosion to the canal bottom, which keeps the bank construction stable. Next to this the design proves that environmental and recreational purposes can be well combined in coherence with social developments.

5|$|By {{the time}} Nelson {{departed}} Alexandria, his {{first set of}} dispatches were already in French hands. Leander had been discovered off the western coast of Crete on 18 August 1798 by the French ship of the line Généreux, one of Villeneuve's escapees. After separating from Villeneuve's squadron on 17 August, Généreux was sailing to Corfu when it encountered the British fourth rate. The larger French ship soon <b>overtook</b> the British <b>vessel</b> and a heated exchange followed: French efforts to board Leander were driven back with heavy casualties, and Captain Thompson at one stage successfully raked his opponent, but gradually the heavier weight of Généreux inflicted severe damage to the British ship and after {{six and a half}} hours Thompson was forced to surrender. French captain Lejoille then authorised widespread looting of the personal effects of the British crew, whom he also forced to conduct repairs on both ships, an act against the established conventions of naval warfare. The prize was towed to Corfu for repairs, the two battered vessels briefly encountering Mutine, which escaped to the westwards before Généreux could give chase. In captivity Lejoille continued to refuse to allow the British officers medical attention or return their stolen property. Eventually returned to Britain, Thompson and Berry were knighted and heavily praised for their defence of their ship against heavy odds, while Lejoille was also commended for his success, assisted by his incorrect account of the battle published in French newspapers.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, piracy has {{exploded}} {{off the coast of}} Somalia. The Somali pirates congregate on a mother ship and then divide into smaller groups that sail out on tiny skiffs. Using potent weapons like AK- 47 ’s and hand-propelled grenades, the Somali pirates then attack civilian ships carrying cargo through the Gulf of Aden, toward South Africa or Asia. Once they have <b>overtaken</b> the victim <b>vessel,</b> pirates typically hijack the vessel’s cargo and crewmembers. The former is often resold to willing buyers (some of which include terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda). The latter are taken to the Somali shore and kept hostage, until multi-million dollar ransoms are paid by either the hostages’ home country or the ship owners themselves. In most instances, crew members have been released unharmed, but those held hostage by the Somali pirates describe a horrific ordeal, and specify that they were held at gun point during most of their captivity. The pirates themselves routinely go unpunished: once they release the hostages, they simply return to their ships to plan yet another lucrative capture. The reasons for such a high success rate for the Somali pirates are relatively simple. First, the Somali pirates operate for the most part in the Gulf of Aden, a narrow strait of water where thousands of ships sail every year; thus, the number of potential victim vessels is higher in these waters than elsewhere. Second, because these pirates operate in such a narrow body of water, they are able to haul captured cargo and victims quickly and easily onto the Somali mainland. Thus, pirates do not have to risk capture by sailing for long stretches of time on open seas with the hijacked cargo and crewmembers on their own ships, which would be the case if they operated elsewhere. Third, Somalia is a failed state with no central government and no effective police force; thus, pirates are able to operate with impunity from Somali coastal towns. In fact, news accounts confirm that entire towns on the coast of Somalia happily live off the proceeds of piracy. Fourth, piracy is a lucrative business: reports indicate that a single seizure of a ship can earn each individual pirate up to $ 150, 000 ! In a country like Somalia, where average yearly earnings amount to about $ 600, this amount seems more than staggering. Finally, piracy in Somalia has been thriving {{because of a lack of}} global cooperation in suppressing pirate attacks. Pirates work at a supra-national level: they attack a vessel owned by a company headquartered in country A, which flies the flag of country B and employs crewmembers coming from countries C, D, E, and F. Thus, no particular country’s interests are harmed through the pirate attack. Moreover, crewmembers typically come from the developing world, and the major maritime powers like the United States and the United Kingdom have shown relatively little interest in working toward the release of pirate-held non-native hostages. The lack of global cooperation in terms of law enforcement as well as prosecution of the detained pirates has significantly contributed to the high success rate of the Somali pirates. Shipping companies themselves, despite being the most affected by pirate attacks, have done nothing to solve the problem. Instead, through paying increasingly high ransoms to the pirates in exchange for the release of kidnapped crewmembers, shipping companies have exacerbated the problem. This Article argues that the true solution to the Somali piracy problem consists of a globally coordinated effort among major maritime powers, regional countries, and shipping companies themselves to share information, to jointly collect data, to cooperate in maritime patrols and surveillance operations off the Somali coast, to establish jurisdictional networks to ensure that pirates are always prosecuted, and to provide for stiff penalties for apprehended pirates. If Somali piracy continues to thrive, it could dangerously undermine East African regional stability, contribute to the rise of terrorism, further endanger the financial stability of the shipping business, and impose burdensome human and monetary costs on all the parties involved, including major maritime countries like the United States or the United Kingdom. Because of the potential global danger that the Somali piracy poses, any responses thereto must be of a global scale. In order to further address this important issue, this Article describes in Part II why fighting piracy is crucial in today’s volatile world. Part III outlines the existing laws available in the fight against piracy, including domestic criminal statute as well as major international treaties.
