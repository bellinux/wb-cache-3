40|$|E 2015 : 047, Huskvarna Manufacturing is a {{manufacturing}} company within the Husqvarna Group. Huskvarna Manufacturing (referred to as HM) produces construction products, chain saws and <b>brush</b> <b>cutters.</b> To {{be able to}} manufacture these complex products, HM are using several suppliers in order to source material for them. One company among these suppliers is Bufab. Huskvarna Manufacturing has identified problems related to the business relationship with Bufab. The study aims to find root causes to the problems at HM connected to articles from Bufab. The purpose is also to find improvements in order to decrease waste. To make sure the study fulfils this, three questions are to be answered. 1. Which root causes can be found to problems within the material- and information flow between HM and Bufab? Value stream mapping, a tool from lean production, {{has been used in}} order to identify problems. These mappings have been conducted at both HM and Bufab. Interviews have been held with certain personnel. A method called “ 5 whys” has been used to find root causes of the problems. The study has found the following root causes; -­‐ Inventory transactions -­‐ Agreements and contracts -­‐ Only requirements of goods within manufacturing are communicated to Bufab -­‐ Computer systems are inflexible -­‐ Lack of communication -­‐ Manually handling -­‐ The logistic flow of <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> are not treated as one. 2. How severe are root causes when compared? Root caues, which have been found through” 5 whys”, have been ranked according to how many problems that occur from them. The four root causes that are contributing to highest numbers of problems are inventory transactions, only requirements of goods within manufacturing are communicated to Bufab, manually handling, and that the logistic flow of <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> are not treated as one. Agreements and contracts are of such importance for the business relationship, and therefore this root cause was also considered as important. 3. Which improvements are important for HM in order to reduce both the lack of material and also waste connected to articles sourced by Bufab? Improvements are made {{in order to reduce the}} chosen root causes. The improvements have both a short-term and a long-term perspective, and are supposed to fit in with the concept of lean production. The improvements are as follows; -­‐ Continuous update of agreements and contracts, as well as standards to audit them. -­‐ Change the way that the inventory transactions are made, so that accurate articles will be included in product set-ups. -­‐ Separate the need of articles included in manufacturing, from articles included in packaging of manufactured products. II -­‐ Secure that the right articles have been picked from inventory, by scanning the barcode of the article. -­‐ Change working methods used in the brush cutter-flow, by giving the activity when packaging <b>brush</b> <b>cutters,</b> control of the flow. Other observations have been found during the study, and overall recommendations have been found to reduce them. The recommendations are as follows; -­‐ Bin system -­‐ Bufab will source articles by using a separate rack of shelves at the HM facility. -­‐ The pre-packing of kits to the brusch cutters can have a wider time-span in their planning. -­‐ Communication The final conclusion of the study is that value stream mapping is a preferable method to collect know-how within the company, reach a deeper understanding of the internal business and also to identify problems. The importance of effectiveness does not only comprehend the production technologies, but also the information flow.

40|$|In this study, we {{assessed}} the mixed exposure of highway maintenance workers to airborne particles, noise, and gaseous co-pollutants. The {{aim was to}} provide {{a better understanding of the}} workers' exposure to facilitate the evaluation of short-term effects on cardiovascular health endpoints. To quantify the workers' exposure, we monitored 18 subjects during 50 non-consecutive work shifts. Exposure assessment was based on personal and work site measurements and included fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5), particle number concentration (PNC), noise (Leq), and the gaseous co-pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. Mean work shift PM 2. 5 concentrations (gravimetric measurements) ranged from 20. 3 to 321 μg m− 3 (mean 62 μg m− 3) and PNC were between 1. 6 × 104 and 4. 1 × 105 particles cm− 3 (8. 9 × 104 particles cm− 3). Noise levels were generally high with Leq over work shifts from 73. 3 to 96. 0 dB(A); the averaged Leq over all work shifts was 87. 2 dB(A). The highest exposure to fine and ultrafine particles was measured during grass mowing and lumbering when motorized <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> and chain saws were used. Highest noise levels, caused by pneumatic hammers, were measured during paving and guardrail repair. We found moderate Spearman correlations between PNC and PM 2. 5 (r = 0. 56); PNC, PM 2. 5, and CO (r = 0. 60 and r = 0. 50) as well as PNC and noise (r = 0. 50). Variability and correlation of parameters were influenced by work activities that included equipment causing combined air pollutant and noise emissions (e. g. <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> and chain saws). We conclude that highway maintenance workers are frequently exposed to elevated airborne particle and noise levels compared with the average population. This elevated exposure is a consequence of the permanent proximity to highway traffic with additional peak exposures caused by emissions of the work-related equipmen...|$|R

40|$|A popular way {{to reduce}} weight in {{industrial}} products without compromising the strength or stiffness is to replace components made of metal by plastics that have been reinforced by glass fibers. When fibers are introduced in a plastic, the resulting composite usually becomes anisotropic, which makes it much more complex to work with in simulation software. This thesis looks at modeling of such a composite using the multi-scale material modeling tool Digimat. An injection molding simulation of a <b>brush</b> <b>cutter</b> casing made of a short fiber reinforced plastic has been performed {{in order to obtain}} information about the glass fiber orientations, and thus the anisotropy, in each material point. That information has then been transferred over from the injection mesh to the structural mesh via a mapping routine.

Lastly, a finite element analysis simulating a drop test has been performed. The results from the analysis have been compared with a physical drop test in order to evaluate the accuracy of the methodology used.

5000|$|Official {{production}} of the 8N tractor began in July 1947. Equipped with a 4-speed transmission, this model was destined to become the top-selling individual tractor of all time in North America. The most noticeable differences between the 8N and its predecessors was {{the inclusion of a}} 4-speed transmission instead of a 3-speed in the 9N and 2N, and an increase in both PTO and drawbar horsepower. The other big change on the 8N was the addition of a 'Position-control' setting for the hydraulics. This change was made partially to improve flexibility in varying soil conditions, and partially to evade Harry Ferguson's patent on the hydraulic system. The original automatic draft control on the Ferguson system would allow the depth of the implement to vary based on soil conditions, which did not work well for some implements. The new Position Control setting bypassed the draft control and allowed the implement to remain at a consistent position relative to the position of the Touch Control lever. A continued drawback to this series of tractor, was the lack of a [...] "live" [...] PTO. Without a live PTO certain implements such as <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> which store inertial energy could send that back into the transmission. This would cause the tractor to surge forward if the clutch were disengaged. This was addressed {{with the advent of the}} PTO overrunning coupler.|$|R
30|$|Our second fixed {{effect was}} fire. We burned 5 of the 10 stands that {{contained}} plots {{in each of}} the three stand types (n = 15 burned, 15 unburned). Our research site had not been burned in recent history. To ensure that both burned and unburned plots included both fast and slow growing populations, we grouped the 10 plots in each stand type into five pairs matched by similarity in their growth rates (the two with the highest growth rates within that stand type, then the next two, etc.) during the first year of the study. We randomly burned one of each pair in the spring, when bottomlands would have most likely burned (Kaufert 1933). Using a <b>brush</b> <b>cutter,</b> we had previously cut down each burned stand to approximately 30 cm high and left the cut culms to dry on the ground for two weeks. This slash-and-burn technique was necessary because cane stands naturally would have burned only during severe weather that (by definition) would have precluded prescribed burning. On the day of the fires, we cut fire lines around each stand with a bulldozer. We lit the 15 stands by circling each with a drip torch so that fires burned toward the center. We executed all 15 individual fires during two consecutive days on 21 and 22 April 2004. The majority of plots burned completely to ash with only the burned hulls of some culms remaining; three to four plots burned less completely during a period of very high humidity and some light precipitation on the first afternoon. We observed a handful of small- to medium-sized trees in cane stands that died following burning, as did various branches of larger overstory trees.|$|R
40|$|Today, large {{companies}} specialized in forestry or park maintenance may own very large machine fleets consisting {{of hundreds of}} trimmers, chainsaws and <b>brush</b> <b>cutters.</b> Husqvarna Group, whose core business lies within high-end forestry and gardening products, has noticed that such companies tend to buy cheaper, low quality forestry and gardening products. The reason {{is thought to be}} that the companies lack a proper overview of the service status and utilization levels of their machines, leading to insufficient service, causing machines to break prematurely and making it hard to motivate investments in more expensive products.  Hence, the companies usually adopt a consumerist approach, and buy cheaper products that are thrown away upon breaking. To make their products more attractive to machine park owners, Husqvarna want to explore the area of Internet of Things and equip their machines with sensing and communication capabilities. Collected data could be used to provide an overview of machine usage and service requirements to the machine parks owners, and could make it easier for machine park owners to dimension their machine fleet. In addition to this, a machine monitoring system where specific operator behavior can be tracked could enable identification of operators who consistently mistreat their machines by, for example, running the machine engine at non-optimal rotation speeds. In this master's thesis, a demonstrator of the working principle of a Bluetooth Low Energy based Fleet Service System is designed and implemented, complete with an evaluation of if received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is a good enough distance estimator to determine which operator operates a certain machine.   Experiments carried out indicate that while RSSI is not a good estimator of distance, it could be used to determine the operator in closest proximity given that operators are not allowed to work closer than within a 10 m radius of each other...|$|R
5000|$|More recent {{two-stroke}} engines might pump lubrication from {{a separate}} tank of two-stroke oil. The supply of this oil {{is controlled by}} the throttle position and engine speed. Examples are found in Yamaha's PW80 (Pee-wee), a small, 80cc two-stroke dirt bike designed for young children, and many two-stroke snowmobiles. The technology is referred to as auto-lube. This is still a total-loss system with the oil being burnt the same as in the pre-mix system; however, given that the oil is not properly mixed with the fuel when burned in the combustion chamber, it translates into a slightly more efficient lubrication. This lubrication method also pays dividends in terms of user friendliness by eliminating the user's need to mix the gasoline at every refill, makes the motor much less susceptible to atmospheric conditions (Ambient temperature, elevation) and ensures proper engine lubrication, with less oil at light loads (such as idle) and more oil at high loads (such as full throttle). Some companies, such as Bombardier, had some oil pump designs have no oil injected at idle to reduce smoke levels, as the loading on the engine parts was light enough to not require additional lubrication beyond the low levels that the fuel provides. [...] Ultimately oil injection is still the same as premixed gasoline in that the oil is burnt in the combustion chamber (albeit not as completely as pre-mix) and the gas is still mixed with the oil, although not as thoroughly as in pre-mix. In addition, this method requires extra mechanical parts to pump the oil from the separate tank, to the carburetor or throttle body. In applications where performance, simplicity and/or dry weight are significant considerations, the pre-mix lubrication method is almost always used. For example, a two-stroke engine in a motocross bike pays major consideration to performance, simplicity and weight. Chainsaws and <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> must be as light as possible to reduce user fatigue and hazard, especially when used in a professional work environment.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The need {{to control}} exotic grasses in areas of {{ecological}} restoration for long periods is followed by high economical costs of application, collateral damage on regeneration and other less obvious environmental harms. Thus, it is necessary estimate such drawbacks in order to evaluate the cost/benefit rate of the application of these techniques. This study aimed to assess {{the damage caused by}} two control techniques of Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B. K Simon & S. W. L. Jacobs), on pre-existing regeneration (environmental costs) in a 20 -year reforestation site and estimate the economic costs of employing such techniques. Thirty 10 x 20 m plots were divided into three groups: (CON) control, (ROC) mowing (using gas-powered <b>brush</b> <b>cutters)</b> and (HERB) mowing followed by the application of a glyphosate-based herbicide. We did a permanent inventory of all tree and shrub individuals, who were followed over a period of one year. No differences were found in mortality imposed by the initial mowing, neither in the mortality imposed exclusively by mowing nor in the mortality imposed exclusively by herbicide in HERB. After one year, there were no differences between mortality and species richness of the three groups. However, when the three groups were compared with themselves after one year, for plants > 1 m, we found a reduction on abundance in CON and reduction in species richness in HERB; whereas for plants < 1 m, ROC showed a reduction in abundance and HERB showed reduced abundance and species richness. Therefore, both techniques seem to affect more plants < 1 m (i. e., regeneration). The final economic cost of ROC was 34. 1 % bigger than the cost of HERB, and in spite of a likely reduction in costs to perform new interventions, proportional costs increased for scattered interventions over small areas. Both techniques were efficient to control Guinea-grass, but the use of glyphosate-based herbicide should be restricted to areas with low canopy cover, more maintenance-demanding sites, once the technique is more damaging on regeneration, since there was high mortality (73 %) of individuals < 1 m in areas with dense grass infestation (100 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to fine {{particles}} and noise {{has been linked}} to cardiovascular diseases and elevated cardiovascular mortality affecting the worldwide population. Residence and/or work in proximity to emission sources as for example road traffic leads to an elevated exposure and a higher risk for adverse health effects. Highway maintenance workers spend most of their work time in traffic and are exposed regularly to particles and noise. The aims of this thesis were to provide {{a better understanding of the}} workers' mixed exposure to particles and noise and to assess cardiopulmonary short term health effects in relation to this exposure. Exposure and health data were collected in collaboration with 8 maintenance centers of the Swiss Road Maintenance Services located in the cantons Bern, Fribourg and Vaud in western Switzerland. Repeated measurements with 18 subjects were conducted during 50 non-consecutive work shifts between Mai 2010 and February 2012, equally distributed over all seasons. In the first part of this thesis we tested and validated measurements of ultra{{fine particles}} with a miniature diffusion size classifier (miniDiSC) - a novel particle counting device that was used for the exposure assessment during highway maintenance work. We found that particle numbers and average particle size measured by the miniDiSC were highly correlated with data from the P-TRAK, a condensation particle counter (CPC), as well as from a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). However, the miniDiSC measured significantly more particles than the P-TRAK and significantly less than the SMPS in its full size range. Our data suggests that the instrument specific cutoffs were the main reason for the different particle counts. The first main objective of this thesis was to investigate the exposure of highway maintenance workers to air pollutants and noise, in relation to the different maintenance activities. We have seen that the workers are regularly exposed to high particle and noise levels. This was a consequence of close proximity to highway traffic and the use of motorized working equipment such as <b>brush</b> <b>cutters,</b> chain saws, generators and pneumatic hammers during which the highest exposure levels occurred. Although exposure to air pollutants were not critical if compared to occupational exposure limits, the elevated exposure to particles and noise may lead to a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases in this worker population. The second main objective was to investigate cardiopulmonary short-term health effects in relation to the particle and noise exposure during highway maintenance work. We observed a PM 2. 5 related increase of the acute-phase inflammation markers C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A and a decrease of TNFa. Heart rate variability increased as a consequence of particle as well as noise exposure. Increased high frequency power indicated a stronger parasympathetic influence on the heart. Elevated noise levels during recreational time, after work, were related to increased blood pressure. Our data confirmed that highway maintenance workers are exposed to elevated levels of particles and noise as compared to the average population. This exposure poses a cardiovascular health risk and it is therefore important to make efforts to better protect the workers health. The use of cleaner machines during maintenance work would be a major step to improve the workers' situation. Furthermore, regulatory policies with the aim of reducing combustion and non-combustion emissions from road traffic are important for the protection of workers in traffic environments and the entire population...|$|R
40|$|This manual {{summarizes}} the roadside tree and brush control methods used {{by all of}} Iowa's 99 counties. It is based on interviews conducted in Spring 2002 with county engineers, roadside managers and others. The target audience of this manual is the novice county engineer or roadside manager. Iowa law is nearly silent on roadside tree and brush control, so individual counties have been left {{to decide on the}} level of control they want to achieve and maintain. Different solutions have been developed but the goal of every county remains the same: to provide safe roads for the traveling public. Counties in eastern and southern Iowa appear to face the greatest brush control challenge. Most control efforts can be divided into two categories: mechanical and chemical. Mechanical control includes cutting tools and supporting equipment. A chain saw is the most widely used cutting tool. Tractor mounted boom mowers and <b>brush</b> <b>cutters</b> are used to prune miles of brush but have significant safety and aesthetic limitations and boom mowers are easily broken by inexperienced operators. The advent of tree shears and hydraulic thumbs offer unprecedented versatility. Bulldozers are often considered a method of last resort since they reduce large areas to bare ground. Any chipper that violently grabs brush should not be used. Chemical control is the application of herbicide to different parts of a plant: foliar spray is applied to leaves; basal bark spray is applied to the tree trunk; a cut stump treatment is applied to the cambium ring of a cut surface. There is reluctance by many to apply herbicide into the air due to drift concerns. One-third of Iowa counties do not use foliar spray. By contrast, several accepted control methods are directed toward the ground. Freshly cut stumps should be treated to prevent resprouting. Basal bark spray is highly effective in sensitive areas such as near houses. Interest in chemical control is slowly increasing as herbicides and application methods are refined. Fall burning, a third, distinctly separate technique is underused as a brush control method and can be effective if timed correctly. In all, control methods tend to reflect agricultural patterns in a county. The use of chain saws and foliar sprays tends to increase in counties where row crops predominate, and boom mowing tends to increase in counties where grassland predominates. For counties with light to moderate roadside brush, rotational maintenance is the key to effective control. The most comprehensive approach to control is to implement an integrated roadside vegetation management (IRVM) program. An IRVM program is usually directed by a Roadside Manager whose duties may be shared with another position. Funding for control programs comes from the Rural Services Basic portion of a county's budget. The average annual county brush control budget is about 76, 000. That figure is thought not to include shared expenses such as fuel and buildings. Start up costs for an IRVM program are less if an existing control program is converted. In addition, IRVM budgets from three different northeastern Iowa counties are offered for comparison in this manual. The manual also includes a chapter on temporary traffic control in rural work zones, a summary of the Iowa Code as it relates to brush control, and rules on avoiding seasonal disturbance of the endangered Indiana bat.
