5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek them <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather {{early in the}} day {{including}} many people who had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down {{the entire length of the}} Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Dr. Archie Hopper (Sbarge) {{continues}} to evaluate Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), {{who is still}} trying to convince him that he is Jiminy. Meanwhile, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) officially makes Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) his new deputy. An explosion soon after causes the town to shake, followed by a sinkhole that emerges at an abandoned mine shaft. As Emma, Henry, Archie, and the sheriff show up to see the damaged area, Regina (Lana Parrilla) arrives to try to keep everyone from going any further, then comes across a certain object which looks like an ornate piece of glass and puts it in her pocket. She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories.|$|E

5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Okello had given orders to kill no whites, the Americans living in Stone Town {{fled to the}} English Club, where the point for {{evacuation}} was. Those travelling in the car convoy to the English Club were shocked to see the battered bodies of Arab men lying <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Stone Town with their severed penises and testicles shoved into their mouths. As part of Okello's carefully laid out plans, all over the island, gangs of Africans armed with knives, spears and pangas (machetes) went about systemically killing all the Arabs they could find. The American diplomat Don Petterson described his horror as he watched from his house as he saw a gang of African men storm the house of an Arab, behead him in public with a panga, followed by screams from within his house as {{his wife and three}} children were raped and killed, followed by the same scene being repeated at the next house of an Arab, followed by yet another and another. After taking control of Stone Town on the first day, the revolutionaries continued to fight the Manga for control of the countryside for least two days afterwards with whole families of Arabs being massacred after their homes had been stormed.|$|E

25|$|It must be mentioned, {{that during}} the strikes, the workers did not repeat {{mistakes}} of the Poznań 1956 protests and the 1970 events in Pomerania and avoided going <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> instead staying in their factories. They came to work, stood at the machines and did not work. They managed to organise themselves, chose their representatives and negotiated to have their demands met.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} all 19th century towns Liverpool was unsanitary. In 1832 {{there had been}} a cholera epidemic. As panic and fear of this new and {{misunderstood}} disease spread, eight major riots had broken <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> along with several smaller uprisings. In 1849 a second epidemic occurred. When Caine was thirteen the third outbreak of cholera occurred in July 1866. Memories of that time were to stay with him, the deaths, the large volume of funerals and prayer meetings in open spaces that were happening all around him.|$|E

Canada {{bore the}} brunt of several major battles during {{the early stages of the}} war including the use of poison gas attacks at Ypres. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in conscription, despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of French Canadians. In the ensuing Conscription Crisis of 1917, riots broke <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Montreal.

The three {{stayed at the}} Hôtel Au Clair de Lune, Rue André-Antoine. During this time, Marcelle was often left {{alone in the room}} while Piaf and Mômone were <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> or at the club singing. Dupont {{eventually}} came and took Marcelle away, saying that if Édith wanted the child, she must come home. Like her own mother, Piaf decided not to come home, though she did pay for childcare. Marcelle died of meningitis at age two. It is rumored that Piaf slept with a man to pay for Marcelle's funeral.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October 2006, Khaleda Zia's term {{in office}} ended. In {{accordance}} with the constitution, a caretaker government would manage in the 90-day interim before general elections. On {{the eve of the}} last day, rioting broke <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of central Dhaka due to uncertainty over who would become Chief Advisor (head of the Caretaker Government of Bangladesh). Under the constitution, the immediate past Chief Justice was to be appointed. But, Chief Justice Khondokar Mahmud Hasan (K M Hasan) declined the position. President Iajuddin Ahmed, as provided for in the constitution, assumed power as Chief Advisor on 29 October 2006. He tried to arrange elections and bring all political parties to the table during months of violence; 40 people were killed and hundreds injured in the first month after the government's resignation in November 2006.|$|E

Las voces del temblor (Nothing No one: The Voices of the Earthquake) (1988). The {{best known}} of these is La noche de Tlatelolco about the 1968 {{repression}} of student protests in Mexico City. She {{found out about the}} massacre on the evening of October 2, 1968, when her son was only four months old. Afterwards, Poniatowska went <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> in the neighborhood and began interviewing people while there was still blood on the streets and shoes strewn about and women searching for the children who had not come home. The books contains interviews with informants, eyewitnesses, former prisoners which are interspersed with poems by Octavio Paz and Rosario Castellanos, excepts from pre Hispanic texts and newspaper as well as political slogans. Massacre in Mexico was the only book published on the subject for twenty years, contradicting the government's account of the events and the number dead. The government offered her the Xavier Villaurrutia Award in 1970 for the work but she refused it.|$|E

500|$|On Saturday, May 1, {{thousands}} of workers went on strike and rallies were held throughout the United States, with the cry, [...] "Eight-hour day with no cut in pay." [...] Estimates {{of the number of}} striking workers across the U.S. range from 300,000 to half a million. In New York City the number of demonstrators was estimated at 10,000 and in Detroit at 11,000. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, some 10,000 workers turned out. In Chicago, the movement's center, an estimated 30,000-to-40,000 workers had gone on strike and there were perhaps twice as many people <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> participating in various demonstrations and marches, as, for example, a march by 10,000 men employed in the Chicago lumber yards. Though participants in these events added up to 80,000, it is disputed whether there was a march of that number down Michigan Avenue led by anarchist Albert Parsons, founder of the International Working People's Association , his wife Lucy Parsons and their children.|$|E

Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said the [...] "double feature continued the recent hot streak" [...] of episodes, and Michael Slezak of TVLine highlighted this episode's [...] "script that winkingly acknowledged fan complaints that Ryan Murphy & Co. all too often ignore some of Glee original players in favor of new and more-hyped flavors". The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff wrote that it showcased writer and director Ian Brennan's [...] "strengths of acid comedy and sad stories of small-town teenagers who'll never get anything but to sweat it <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of a runaway American dream"; he gave [...] "Props" [...] a [...] "B" [...] grade.

500|$|Leicester won the Premier League on 2 May 2016 after Tottenham {{threw away}} a 2–0 lead against Chelsea, drawing 2–2 at the [...] "Battle of Stamford Bridge". This {{completed}} the fastest seven-year {{rise to the}} title except for Ipswich Town in 1962, and Leicester faced a far more unequal top tier than Ipswich did back then. Bookmakers thought Leicester's victory was so unlikely that Ladbrokes and William Hill offered odds of 5,000–1 for it {{at the start of}} the season. Neither bookmaker had ever paid out such long odds, and the trophy resulted in the largest payout in British sporting history with total winnings of £25million. The scale of the surprise attracted global attention for the club and the city of Leicester. The Economist declared it would be [...] "pored over for management lessons". Several commentators have viewed it as an inspiration to other clubs and fundamentally transforming the expectations similar sized clubs face in English football. Ranieri's Leicester became known for their counterattacking style of play, [...] "incredible pace in the areas it is most essential" [...] and defensive solidarity. Players were often praised for their work ethic and togetherness which was apparent throughout the squad. On 16 May 2016, over 240,000 Leicester City fans turned <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Leicester and Victoria Park to celebrate their team's historic achievement.

In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I do {{get a chance to}} talk to them and hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some of us are luckier than others. Some of us are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E
