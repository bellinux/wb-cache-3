500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained [...] "That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, {{and by the time}} we got around to the point where we were going to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album..." [...] when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained [...] "The self-titled aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world, but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Sting" [...] was {{directed}} by Randall Einhorn and written by Mindy Kaling, who also plays Kelly Kapoor in the show. It was the first episode to feature Timothy Olyphant in a guest appearance as Danny Cordray, a rival paper salesman. Olyphant would return for the season's Halloween special, [...] "Costume Contest", and would appear in a deleted scene for Carell's penultimate episode, [...] "Michael's Last Dundies". Olyphant enjoyed his stint on the show, later telling IGN that filming both [...] "The Sting" [...] and his scenes for other episodes was [...] "a blast" [...] and [...] "a kick to do" [...] because The Office is [...] "such a fun show, the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> The way they do it is just so fun and easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Harriet Weaver {{was among}} the first to suggest that the dream was not that of any one dreamer, but was rather an {{analysis}} of the process of dreaming itself. In a letter to J.S. Atherton she wrote: [...] In particular their ascription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> to a dream of HCE seems to me nonsensical. My view is that Mr. Joyce did not intend the book to be looked upon as the dream of any one character, but that he regarded the dream form with its shiftings and changes and chances as a convenient device, allowing the freest scope to introduce any material he wished—and suited to a night-piece. [...] Bernard Benstock also argued that [...] "The Dreamer in the Wake is more than just a single individual, even if one assumes that on the literal level we are viewing the dream of publican H.C. Earwicker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{altogether}} out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common," [...] {{continued the}} Doctor, [...] "quite out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> But {{if you are}} going to accept old Littlecherry's explanation of it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Probably one of Mr. Lee's jokes. He {{is quite}} capable <b>of</b> turning <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> into ridicule. I dare say he {{considers}} his visit here a prolonged jest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Clara, {{you must}} tell me. It is {{absolutely}} necessary that I should know whether you have given him any hope, and if so, how much. <b>Of</b> course <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> must be stopped at once. Young as you are, you cannot think that a marriage with Mr. Owen Fitzgerald would be a proper match for you to make. <b>Of</b> course <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> must cease at once--at once." [...] Here there was another piteous sigh. [...] "But before I take any steps, I must {{know what you have}} said to him. Surely you have not told him that you have any feeling for him warmer than ordinary regard?" ...|$|R
500|$|Although the {{references}} to Illuminatus! and themselves were in keeping with Drummond and Cauty's tradition, this was also in part {{intended to be a}} self-parodying dredge of The KLF's [...] "myth". [...] Drummond's opinions of the [...] "rock 'n' roll comeback" [...] were recorded by him at the time and aired in 2000: [...] "The history of rock 'n' roll has been littered with pathetic comebacks.... No comeback has ever worked. The motivation behind the comeback has never and {{will never be the same}} as when the group or artist first crawled out of their sub-cult.... If there was fresh original talent, it is now tired and tested, only capable of flicking the nostalgia switch." [...] Designing 2K's parody of the comeback, Drummond wrote that he and Cauty were [...] "getting totally into the institution of The Comeback, drawing on the sad, pathetic nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> the desperation of all concerned to exploit whatever they can from the myth...".|$|E
500|$|Erotica {{remains the}} most rampantly {{misrepresented}} Madonna album with the biggest backlash of her career. Taraborrelli commented that {{it is unfortunate that}} Erotica has to be historically linked to other less memorable ventures in Madonna's career at this time. However, he quipped that the album should be considered on its own merits, not only as one linked to the other two adult-oriented projects, because it has true value. When asked to name her biggest professional disappointment, Madonna answered, [...] "The fact that my Erotica album was overlooked because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> with the Sex book. It just got lost in all that. I think there's some brilliant songs on it and people didn't give it a chance." [...] Brian McNair observed that Madonna took a financial risk with the album and it was not until Ray of Light (1998) that her record sales recovered to pre-Erotica levels. He further asserted that [...] "what she lost in royalty payments, however, Madonna more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence." ...|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing.</b> My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But we had about 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E
6000|$|... "It wasn't we," [...] Matteo put in, as {{he shook}} hands with his kinsman. [...] "We had no more idea of {{escaping}} than we had <b>of</b> flying. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> was entirely <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> Francisco here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Sir. Mr. Caterham sent a flag <b>of</b> truce. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> is {{a hideous}} misunderstanding. That {{is why he}} wants to talk to you, and put his case before you. They insist, Sir, that you should intervene--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Boardman knows; he {{can tell}} you about it," [...] said Dan, from the hall chair he had dropped into. He rose and {{made his way to the}} stairs, with <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> leaving <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> to them.|$|R
500|$|Newsmakers {{believes}} that the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds helped define chamber pop as [...] "intimate, precisely arranged songs with rock's sweep but without its bluesy clamor." [...] Following the album was the group's unfinished 1966–67 work Smile, a collaboration between Brian Wilson and lyricist Van Dyke Parks that also heavily influenced the genre. According to the High Llama's Sean O'Hagan, Pet Sounds had been [...] "the beginning of the great pop experiment. But it wasn't allowed to continue, because rock and roll got hold <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> and stopped it. Pop didn't take off again until this decade [...]" [...] Author Carl Wilson (no relation) says that Brian's [...] "pained vulnerability", [...] "uses of offbeat instruments", [...] "intricate harmonies", and [...] "the Smile saga itself" [...] became a common reference point for chamber pop bands. Just as ork-pop acts shared a love for Wilson, they also held an admiration for one another's work. In the late 1980s, the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records also made sophisticated use of orchestras and voices that embodied and defined the chamber pop style.|$|E
500|$|The group {{recruited}} Oteil Burbridge of the Aquarium Rescue Unit {{to replace}} Woody on bass, and Jack Pearson on guitar. Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts. Pearson, struggling with tinnitus, left {{as a result}} following the 1999 Beacon run. Trucks phoned his nephew, Derek Trucks, to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour. Trucks was very young, at age 20, and younger {{than any of the}} original members when the band formed. [...] "It was an honor to be part of such a great institution from the start," [...] said Derek Trucks. [...] "When I first got the gig, I was just trying to maintain the spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> while hopefully bringing some fire to it, hoping to hold up my end while also expressing my own voice." [...] The Beacon run in 2000, captured on Peakin' at the Beacon, was ironically considered among the band's worst performances; an eight-show spring tour led to even more strained relations in the group. [...] "It had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing," [...] said Allman. Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him for the summer.|$|E
500|$|Kneale's concept {{concerned}} [...] "the {{world of}} the future, {{and a way of}} keeping the population happy without being active". According to Kneale, the notion for the play came from the [...] "worldwide dread of populations exploding out of all control" [...] leading him to devise a world where pornography hooks the population [...] "on a substitute for sex rather than the real thing and so keeping the population down". Kneale was also influenced by the dropout counterculture of the late 1960s, recalling [...] "I didn't like the Sixties at all because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> of 'let it all hang out' and let's stop thinking [...] which was the all too frequent theme of the Sixties which I hated". Dissatisfaction with the youth culture of the time was a preoccupation of Kneale's—in the mid-sixties he had worked on The Big, Big, Giggle, an unmade script about a teenage suicide cult, and following The Year of the Sex Olympics he returned to the theme of youth out of control in his 1969 play Bam! Pow! Zapp!, and in the fourth and final Quatermass serial in 1979. Many cultural icons of the youth movement, including members of The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Monty Python, were fans of Kneale's work. For The Year of the Sex Olympics Kneale extrapolated the possible consequences of the youth movement's desire for freedom from [...] "traditional" [...] cultural inhibitions, asking as the academic John R. Cook puts it, [...] "In a world of no limits, will the result quickly be apathy if there is nothing any more to get excited about, nothing precious or illicit to fight for in the teeth of the censor?".|$|E

2500|$|During 1721, {{because of}} the {{increasing}} size of the Berlin garrison, which was increased to four regiments of infantry and one battalion of artillery, a special commission and treasury were established to examine the manner the new troops were being provided for. [...] At {{the head of this}} commission was General von Forcade, then Commandant of Berlin, who was described as [...] "…a very brave soldier, who knew nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> spoke only very broken German, and could scarcely write his name…".|$|E
2500|$|Page has {{acknowledged}} heavy recreational drug use throughout the 1970s. In {{an interview with}} Guitar World magazine in 2003, he stated: [...] "I can't speak for the , but for me drugs were an integral part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> right from the beginning, right to the end." [...] After the band's 1973 North American tour, Page told Nick Kent: [...] "Oh, everyone went over the top a few times. I know I did and, {{to be honest with}} you, I don't really remember much of what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bradfield {{commented that}} Journal for Plague Lovers {{was an attempt}} to finally secure the legacy of their former member Richey Edwards and the result was that, during the {{recording}} process, it was as close to feeling his presence since his disappearance: [...] "There was a sense of responsibility to do his words justice. That was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> of letting enough time lapse. Once we actually got into the studio, it almost felt as if we were a full band; it [...] as close to him being in the room again as possible." ...|$|E
50|$|The WASP drone had {{a flight}} {{endurance}} of fifteen minutes, including {{ten minutes of}} powered flight and five minutes of glide. It had a tiny camera in its lower fuselage, and relayed both imagery and its own current GPS coordinates back to the warship or artillery battery that fired it. At least two WASP prototypes were built and tested. After initial announcements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effort, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> went quiet, but it certainly remains an interesting possibility.|$|R
60|$|From {{his point}} <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> was a {{thoroughly}} good egg; but Mr. Brewster, his father-in-law, thought differently, Archie had neither money nor occupation, which was distasteful in <b>the</b> eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrious Mr. Brewster; {{but the real}} bar {{was the fact that}} he had once adversely criticised one of his hotels.|$|R

His choice was obvious. He could cut his engagement with Mr Seymour, or he could keep it. The difficulty lay rather in deciding upon one or other <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alternatives. <b>The</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> turned upon <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> penalty in <b>the</b> event <b>of</b> detection.|$|R
2500|$|Flea {{has also}} {{appeared}} in television broadcasts with Red Hot Chili Peppers on several occasions. Several months before Frusciante's departure in 1992, the band performed two songs on Saturday Night Live– Kiedis felt the show was an embarrassment due to the guitarist; he believed, that Frusciante purposely played the song out of tune and incorrectly. Later that year, the band appeared in the popular animated comedy The Simpsons on the episode [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". At Woodstock 1994, Kiedis proposed the band perform the first few songs in metallic suits with giant light bulbs placed on their heads. Flea was initially reluctant but eventually agreed: [...] "...when we got to play, the energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> took over." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{events of}} October 1917 led to Gippius {{severing}} all ties {{with most of}} those who admired her poetry, including Blok, Bryusov and Bely. The history of this schism and the reconstruction of the ideological collisions that made such a catastrophe possible became the subject matter of her memoirs The Living Faces (Живые лица, 1925). While Blok (the man whom she famously refused her hand in 1918) saw the Revolution as a 'purifying storm', Gippius was appalled by the 'suffocating dourness' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>thing,</b> seeing it as one huge monstrosity [...] "leaving one with just one wish: to go blind and deaf." [...] Behind all this, for Gippius, {{there was a kind of}} 'monumental madness'; it was all the more important for her to keep a [...] "healthy mind and strong memory," [...] she explained.|$|E
