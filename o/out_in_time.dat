5|$|On July 16, 2009, {{as workers}} were {{assembling}} Madonna's {{stage at the}} Stade Vélodrome in Marseille for her July 19 concert, the stage collapsed, injuring eight workers and killing two. The accident caused city officials to cancel the concert. Charles Criscenzo, a 53-year-old French worker, was killed outright in the accident, which took place at around 17:15 GMT. The other worker Charles Prow, a 23-year-old from Headingley in Leeds, died overnight {{at a hospital in}} Marseille. Firefighters said the accident occurred when the roof of the stage became unbalanced as it was being lifted by four cranes, toppling one of them. Marseille city councillor Maurice de Nocera said that the roof started shaking and then collapsed gradually. This allowed the other workers to get <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators {{to determine whether a}} blip on their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Soviet {{offensive}} {{continued in}} the north. The offensive liberated Kalinin and the Soviets reached Klin on 7 December, overrunning {{the headquarters of the}} LVI Panzer Corps outside the city. As the Kalinin Front drove west, a bulge developed around Klin. The Soviet front commander, General Ivan Konev, attempted to envelop any German forces remaining. Zhukov diverted more forces to {{the southern end of the}} bulge, to help Konev trap the Third Panzer Army. The Germans pulled their forces <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> Although the encirclement failed, it unhinged the German defenses. A second attempt was made against the Second Panzer Army near Tula, but met strong opposition near Rzhev and was forced to halt, forming a salient that would last until March 1943. In the south, the offensive went equally well, with Southwestern Front forces relieving Tula on 16 December 1941. A major achievement was the encirclement and destruction of the German XXXIX Corps, protecting Guderian's Second Panzer Army's southern flank.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, while US battleships were {{standardized}} {{as much as}} possible, design improvements {{were incorporated}} whenever possible. Most {{of the changes in}} the Tennessees were incorporated prior to any of their keels being laid. However, plans for the underwater protection—the ships' main defense against torpedoes and shells that fell short of the ship but traveled through the water to hit underneath the waterline—could not be worked <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> The problem was that tests in caissons—experiments that would eventually prove that a series of compartments divided between being filled with liquid and being left empty would be a very effective defense against torpedoes—were not yet complete. In order to commence construction of the ships as soon as possible, bids sent out to shipbuilding corporations noted that if they were selected to build the ships, an alteration to the design of the ships three months after their keels were laid must be allowed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{researchers}} at Dalhousie University {{set out to}} address a limitation of PZP vaccines. All the field trials of native PZP vaccines found that 2 or 3 initial doses spaced <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> were necessary before contraceptive efficacy would begin. The Dalhousie researchers developed a way to deliver PZP antigens in liposomes, causing the release of antigens to be delayed. This research {{would result in the}} product SpayVac™. Independent trials of SpayVac™ in deer found that a single initial dose can function as a contraceptive.|$|E
25|$|LORAN was {{a simple}} system that {{compared}} the arrival times of pulses to make a measurement. Ideally, perfectly formed rectangular blips would be displayed on the CRT, whose leading edge could be compared with accuracy. In practice, the transmitters cannot turn on and off instantly, and due {{to a variety of}} factors the resulting blips are spread <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> Adding to this {{is the fact that the}} shape of the resulting blip, the envelope, depends on the frequency of the system, meaning the lower-frequency systems like LORAN will generally have less accuracy than higher-frequency ones like Gee.|$|E
25|$|Barrett went {{up along}} a {{hatchway}} {{to reach the}} starboard side of A Deck where {{there were only two}} lifeboats left. He escaped the sinking ship on lifeboat 13, which was filled with about 65 or 70 people. Lifeboat 15 nearly came down on top of their lifeboat, but they got <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> He was put in charge of the lifeboat for about an hour, until he got cold he had to let someone else take over. At one point a woman put a cloak over him, and he was unable to remember anything that took place after that in the lifeboat. At 4:45am Barrett and the others in the lifeboat were rescued by the RMS Carpathia.|$|E

On 12 July it {{was reported}} that Liverpool and Ajax had agreed a fee in the region of £11.5million, and later Liverpool confirmed that Babel would sign a five-year contract on 13 July. He was unveiled on 13 July with Yossi Benayoun. Babel was handed the number 19 shirt. He made his debut on 17 July against Werder Bremen in a friendly. He was due to play {{in the first round of}} the Barclays Asia Trophy 2007 but had a delay in the granting of international clearance. This was sorted <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> for the final against Portsmouth.|$|E
25|$|Lucero was {{connected}} to the Mk. VIII transmitter, and triggered its own 5µs signal every fifth transmission of the radar. The IFF Mk. III in the remote aircraft contained a receiver circuit fed into a transmitter, causing any received signal to be amplified and stretched <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> This signal was received by the responder side of Lucero, which mixed it in with the signal from the Mk. VIII's own receiver. Since the Lucero antenna was omni-directional, the returns were continuous around the entire face of the display and unrelated to the position of the main dish. The result was a series of line segments, spaced every 10 degrees around the display.|$|E
25|$|For a {{production}} system, the team {{began working with}} a system using a circular J-scope display for improved accuracy. The more common A-scope represents distances {{across the face of}} the tube, while the J-scope presents as the angle around the cathode ray tube's face. This increases the amount of room on the scale by a factor of π for any given display size, improving accuracy. In spite of using the J-scope, and adopting the frequency change for more stability, the team found accurate measurements of range quite difficult. At the time, the procedure for generating sharp pulses of signals was in its infancy, and their signals were considerably spread <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> making measurements difficult.|$|E

25|$|With the {{consideration}} of its high-profile development team, {{as well as the}} fact that it was a front-runner PlayStation 2 release, The Bouncer was highly anticipated. However, the game was perceived as a disappointment by many, and was largely seen as mediocre. Numerous aspects from the E3 trailer, such as destructible scenery, were removed in the final game, possibly in order to get the game <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> to be among the first batch of PlayStation 2 titles. Much of the criticism, however, fell on the gameplay. IGN found the controls average and the camera angles to become a major issue in the later portions of the game, where the player is confined to tight spaces. The game was also seen as having an excessive amount of cutscenes and load screens. GameCritics' Brad Galloway, for example, argued actual gameplay constitutes less than one third of the game's length.|$|E
25|$|The World Logistics Hub is {{also part}} of the Airport City Enterprise Developments in South Manchester. This {{development}} is designed to meet the growing demand for cargo handling space and infrastructure outside of the southeast. Positioned on the southwest side of the A538 road next to the southeast side of the M56 motorway (across the A538 from the World Freight Terminal) providing access to the trunk motorway network via Junction 6. DHL are the first tenant and are already using their shed. Another shed is now externally complete but the inside is now being fitted <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> for September when Amazon will move in. Over the next decade the site will generate around 10,000 jobs. As the site grows increased capacity will be added to the A538 with the extension of the dual carriageway between the M56 and runway tunnels and a traffic light controlled junction; improving access to the Runway Visitor Park and Romper pub.|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is most often}} observed in saturated, loose (low density or uncompacted), sandy soils. This is because a loose sand {{has a tendency to}} compress when a load is applied; dense sands by contrast tend to expand in volume or 'dilate'. If the soil is saturated by water, a condition that often exists when the soil is below the ground water table or sea level, then water fills the gaps between soil grains ('pore spaces'). In response to the soil compressing, this water increases in pressure and attempts to flow out from the soil to zones of low pressure (usually upward towards the ground surface). However, if the loading is rapidly applied and large enough, or is repeated many times (e.g. earthquake shaking, storm wave loading) such that it does not flow <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> before the next cycle of load is applied, the water pressures may build to an extent where they exceed the contact stresses between the grains of soil that keep them in contact with each other. These contacts between grains are the means by which the weight from buildings and overlying soil layers are transferred from the ground surface to layers of soil or rock at greater depths. This loss of soil structure causes it to lose all of its strength (the ability to transfer shear stress) and it may be observed to flow like a liquid (hence 'liquefaction').|$|E
