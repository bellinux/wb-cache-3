500|$|J. P. Davis was {{inspired}} to write the script after observing an older trainer working with a young boxer in a Brooklyn gym: [...] "I watched the guy spar. You could tell he wasn't going anywhere, but you could never convince the trainer. He's almost a caretaker. He's watching <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> completely. You could see the devotion involved." [...] Drawing upon material originally created for his critically acclaimed one-man off-Broadway show [...] "Dreamer Awakens," [...] Davis completed the script in 1999 and moved to Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|The American public, {{the church}} {{organizations}} that have been helping—Protestants, Catholics and Jews will know {{you for what you}} are—an evil beast. So will others who have backed you. You are done. King, there is only one thing left for you to do. You know what it is. You have just 34 days in which to do (this exact number has been selected for a specific reason, it has definite practical significant [...] ). You are done. There is but one way <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> You better take it before your filthy fraudulent self is bared to the nation.|$|E
500|$|Hearing {{that his}} friend and former minor league {{teammate}} Greg Montalbano had died of testicular cancer {{at the age of}} 31 late on August 21, Youkilis dedicated his next game to his friend's memory. After inscribing [...] "GM" [...] in marker on his cap, he hit two home runs in the game against the Yankees, while driving in six runs. Both times as he crossed home plate, he looked up and pointed to the sky. [...] "That was for him", Youkilis said. [...] "There are some crazy things that have happened in my life. You ... feel like there's somebody out there somewhere pushing balls <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and doing great things." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My daughter, {{shall not}} I seek <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> a rest": When Ruth had {{nothing more to}} do on the harvest-fields, where Boaz {{appeared}} daily, and was unremittingly gracious to her, she may have fallen into a pensive mood. Naomi was quick to note the varying 'nuances of feeling', and said [...] "My daughter, shall I not seek <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> a rest?" [...] The expression [...] "rest", or [...] "resting-place", though in itself of generic import, was, when used in such circumstances as environed Ruth, quite specific in application, and would be at once understood. It was a [...] "home" [...] to which Naomi pointed, a home for her daughter's heart. In such a home, if warm and pure, there would be repose for the affections.|$|R
60|$|Live in hope, then, in {{a lively}} hope, that since Christ is {{risen from the}} dead, he lives to make intercession <b>for</b> <b>thee,</b> and that thou shalt reap the blessed benefit of this twofold {{salvation}} that is wrought, and that is working <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>thee,</b> by Jesus Christ our Lord. And thus have we treated of the benefit of his intercession, in that {{he is able to}} save to the uttermost. And this leads me to the third particular.|$|R

500|$|After {{graduating from}} junior hockey, Giordano {{enrolled}} at York University {{and planned to}} study at its school of business when he received a late invitation from the Calgary Flames to attend their summer camp. [...] Former Flames coach Jim Playfair recalled that Giordano stood out among the group of invitees and said that his skill and skating ability set him apart: [...] "Darryl (Sutter) met {{with three or four}} of those kids and gave them all the same contracts: Three years in the American League, and if it works <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> you've got a career. [...] Gio took it and ran with it." [...] The Flames signed him to a contract following the camp.|$|E
500|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus takes bread, breaks it, {{and gives}} it to the disciples, saying, [...] "This is my body, which is given for you". He then has them all drink from a cup, saying, [...] "This cup that is poured <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> is the new {{covenant}} in my blood" [...] (...) [...] The Christian sacrament or ordinance of the Eucharist is based on these events. Although the Gospel of John does not include {{a description of the}} bread-and-wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that [...] (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a eucharistic character and resonates with the institution narratives in the Synoptic Gospels and in the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.|$|E
500|$|When {{casting the}} two leading {{actors in the}} film, Bertino sought Liv Tyler {{for the role of}} Kristen. Tyler, who had not worked for several years after the birth of her son, {{accepted}} the part after being impressed by the script: [...] "I especially liked Bryan's way of saying a lot, but not saying everything. Often in movies, it's all spelled <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and the dialogue is very explanatory. But Bryan doesn't write like that; he writes how normal people communicate—with questions lingering. I knew {{it would be interesting to}} act that." [...] Canadian actor Scott Speedman was cast as James. Speedman was also impressed by the script, stating that [...] "the audience actually gets time to breathe with the characters before things get scary as hell. That got me interested from the first pages".|$|E

2500|$|Generally, Christians {{believe that}} the New Covenant was instituted at the Last Supper {{as part of the}} Eucharist, which in the Gospel of John {{includes}} the New Commandment. A connection between the Blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament with the saying: [...] "this cup that is poured <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> is the new covenant in my blood".|$|E
2500|$|CNN began {{coverage}} of the story as early as September 9. CBS began to cover the story on September 11, {{the day after the}} story aired on Fox News. Breitbart and reporters of Fox News stayed on message, complaining that the [...] "mainstream media" [...] did not respond promptly or cover the story in sufficient depth. On September 11, 2009, Glenn Beck was reported to have said, [...] "FOX has had 133 reports on it, CNN, 90, MSNBC, 10. How's that possible? Hey, ABC, how's it working <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> with two?" ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{a celebration}} tribute to Altman {{a few months}} after his death, he was {{described}} as a [...] "passionate filmmaker" [...] and auteur who rejected convention, creating what director Alan Rudolph called an [...] "Altmanesque" [...] style of films. He preferred large casts of actors, natural overlapping conversations, and encouraged his actors to improvise and express their innate creativity, but without fear of failing. Lily Tomlin compared him to [...] "a great benign patriarch who was always looking <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> as an actor," [...] adding that [...] "you're not afraid to take chances with him." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} Christian eschatologies that further define the New Covenant. [...] For example, an inaugurated eschatology defines and {{describes}} the New Covenant {{as an ongoing}} relationship between Christian believers and God that will be in full fruition after the Second Coming of Christ; that is, it {{will not only be}} in full fruition in believing hearts, but in the future external world as well. The connection between the Blood of Christ and the New Covenant is seen in most modern English translations of the New Testament such as in the statement: [...] "this cup that is poured <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> is the new covenant in my blood".|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1960s, King began {{publicly}} {{criticizing the}} Bureau for giving insufficient {{attention to the}} use of terrorism by white supremacists. [...] Hoover responded by publicly calling King the most [...] "notorious liar" [...] in the United States. [...] In his 1991 memoir, Washington Post journalist Carl Rowan asserted that the FBI had sent at least one anonymous letter to King encouraging him to commit suicide. [...] Historian Taylor Branch documents an anonymous November 21, 1964 [...] "suicide package" [...] sent by the FBI that contained audio recordings of King's sexual indiscretions combined with a letter telling him [...] "There is only one way <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> [...] You better take it before your filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self is bared to the nation." [...] And even by 1969, as has been noted elsewhere, [...] " [...] efforts to 'expose' Martin Luther King, Jr. had not slackened even though King had been dead for a year. [...] furnished ammunition to conservatives to attack King's memory, and...tried to block efforts to honor the slain leader." ...|$|E
