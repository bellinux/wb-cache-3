40|$|Protective {{seam mining}} {{is a major}} and {{critical}} regional measure to prevent coal and gas outbursts (CGO) in coal mines. In this study, a novel method for selecting protective seam against coal and gas outburst was studied {{on the basis of}} gas geology and rock strata control theories and principles for protective seam mining and relevant regulations, which is that theories of gas geology were used to assess the outburst risk inherent in different seams of this mine, and then make preliminary selection of protective seams, and the technical feasibility of the proposed selection method was then analyzed using the theories and principles for protective seam mining and relevant regulations. The case application study results show that the extraction of the upper protective seam (UPS) caused significant decreases in the predicative indicators of outburst risk in the <b>outburst-prone</b> <b>seam</b> and thereby prevented CGO, and the novel method can provide a theoretical basis for selecting protective seam against CGO...|$|E
40|$|Coal {{extraction}} in Huainan area {{is basically}} characterized {{by one of}} typical multi-seam mining conditions observed in China, where coal is mined in soft seams characterized by high gas content, high stress, low permeability and difficult geological conditions. The average mining depth in Huainan area is 875  m and continues to increase by 15 – 25  m annually. The rise in mining depth {{increases the risk of}} coal and gas outbursts and makes it more difficult to control outburst risk in Huainan coalmines. This paper reviews the main achievements (e. g. theories, technologies and equipment) in outburst control in Huainan, and tries to analyze some key challenging issues, and to present associated strategies to address these issues. It suggests that the outburst control in Huainan must take a combination approach of both regional and localized control in which the former plays a dominant role. Other outburst prevention principles include (1) non-outburst seams protecting outburst <b>seams,</b> (2) less <b>outburst-prone</b> <b>seams</b> protecting strong <b>outburst-prone</b> <b>seams,</b> (3) stress-releasing mining, and (4) the combination of ground and underground gas drainage (the model is dubbed as “walking on two legs”). The paper concludes that we should conduct fundamental researches on outburst mechanism, and develop outburst control technologies and equipment to ensure safe and efficient coal mining of deep coal resources in Huainan area...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new {{outburst}} prevention method {{based on}} injecting and freezing, considering {{of the important}} role of gas pressure and the mechanical characteristics of coal in the sprout and occurrence in the coal and gas outburst, was put forward in this paper. The curves of stress and strain with different freezing temperatures were drawn, and the effects of the water content, compaction force as well as freezing temperature on mechanical properties was discussed, through the experiment on the <b>outburst-prone</b> coal <b>seam</b> injected frozen water. It was found that the uniaxial compression strengths of coal obviously rise, its Young's modulus show a rise tendency,, and the effective stresses of gas-filled coal obviously rise and its strengths is further improved after the gas pressure falls with the freezing temperature decreasing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHole {{accidents}} during {{drilling and}} borehole collapse during extracting are bottlenecks restricting gas drainage efficiency in soft <b>outburst-prone</b> coal <b>seams</b> in China. The auger-air combined drilling technique and sieve tube mounting method are an alternative solution to these technology bottlenecks. The auger-air drilling technique combines {{the advantages of}} “dry style” auger drilling and air drilling. Specially designed blade in drill rod can stir up large particles of coal so that large particles {{can be brought to}} ground smoothly using compressed air and is efficient to prevent borehole accidents. After drilling is completed, the sieve tube is tripped in through the inner hole of drilling pipes, and then lifting up drilling pipes, the tube sieve will provide a complete tunnel for gas extraction. Field application proves that with proper drilling parameter selection and appropriate tube install control, it is more promising to double drilling depth and raise gas drainage efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Few {{study has}} been carried out on the {{desorption}} rules of extreme-soft and outburst-prone coal in south of China, especially coal from Hunan Province of which the value of “f ” is normally less than 0. 2. Desorption experiments are conducted on the coal samples from Hongwei and Jiahe Mines in Hunan Province, and the following phenomena can be observed: the calculating mean error by t method and power function method of Hongwei coal samples are 29. 68 % and 68. 33 %, 28. 55 % and 70. 28 % of Jiahe, the calculating result by the two methods is always lower. After comparison we find that the t method is more precise than power function method, so calculation method is improved based on t method, mean error of gas content determination by the new method in experiment and coal mine are 6. 88 % and 5. 24 %, both less than 10 %.
