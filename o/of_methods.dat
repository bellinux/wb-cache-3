30|$|Table  4 is {{the result}} of the {{calculation}} of each evaluation value against each method. The result shows that the highest evaluation values <b>of</b> all <b>methods</b> are acquired using the proposed method. Comparing Method II with III, the precision value <b>of</b> <b>Method</b> II is lower than that <b>of</b> <b>Method</b> III. However, the recall and F-measure values <b>of</b> <b>Method</b> II are higher than those <b>of</b> <b>Method</b> III. This shows that, under occlusion, a target is readily lost without occlusion detection. The detection method helps complete identification but might cause mis-identification. Therefore, the proposed method, which aims to decrease mis-identification, is effective.|$|R
