40|$|Abstract. In this research, {{metallic}} silicon {{was used as}} anode material of lithium ion batteries. Electrochemical lithium storage property <b>of</b> metallic <b>silicon</b> was studied which is compared with pure silicon. The results show that for different content of electrical conductors in electrode, the first discharging and charging specific capacity <b>of</b> metallic <b>silicon</b> is similar to pure silicon. The attenuation on capacity <b>of</b> metallic <b>silicon</b> is slower than pure silicon. The lithium storage mechanism <b>of</b> metallic <b>silicon</b> is similar with pure silicon. The testing results <b>of</b> metallic <b>silicon</b> under different charging and discharging rate show that the lithium storage property <b>of</b> metallic <b>silicon</b> is better under lower charging and discharging rate...|$|R

The thermal oxidation is found to influence on the conductivity <b>of</b> porous <b>silicon</b> measured along various crystal directions in different ways.

5|$|Silicon nitride {{bearings}} {{are both}} full ceramic bearings and ceramic hybrid bearings with balls in ceramics and races in steel. Silicon nitride ceramics have good shock resistance {{compared to other}} ceramics. Therefore, ball bearings made <b>of</b> <b>silicon</b> nitride ceramic are used in performance bearings.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} <b>of</b> <b>silicon</b> {{is generally}} nonmetallic (covalent) in nature. It {{is not known}} to form a cation. Silicon can form alloys with metals such as iron and copper. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. The high strength of the silicon-oxygen bond dominates the chemical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>silicon.</b> Polymeric silicates, built up by tetrahedral SiO4 units sharing their oxygen atoms, are the most abundant and important compounds <b>of</b> <b>silicon.</b> The polymeric borates, comprising linked trigonal and tetrahedral BO3 or BO4 units, are built on similar structural principles. The oxide SiO2 is polymeric in structure, weakly acidic, and a glass former. Traditional organometallic chemistry includes the carbon compounds <b>of</b> <b>silicon</b> (see organosilicon).|$|E

40|$|In {{a process}} for the {{production}} <b>of</b> photoluminescent <b>silicon</b> structures, a silicon wafer is immersed and anodized in an acid bath, whereby the monocrystalline <b>silicon</b> <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> wafer is converted into a microporous, photoluminescent silicon layer at least in areas. In {{order to maintain the}} stability over time of the photoluminescence <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> structure produced in this way, the process according to the invention requires the anodic side <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> wafer to be exposed to an illumination for part of the time during which it is immersed and anodized in the acid bath...|$|R

40|$|We have {{deposited}} a novel form <b>of</b> amorphous <b>silicon</b> through {{molecular beam}} epitaxy in an ultra-high vacuum.

5|$|Silicon carbide (SiC), {{also known}} as {{carborundum}} , is a semiconductor containing silicon and carbon with chemical formula SiC. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite. Synthetic silicon carbide powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an abrasive. Grains <b>of</b> <b>silicon</b> carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Electronic applications <b>of</b> <b>silicon</b> carbide such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and detectors in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals <b>of</b> <b>silicon</b> carbide can be grown by the Lely method; they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. Silicon carbide with high surface area can be produced from SiO2 contained in plant material.|$|E

30|$|To further {{investigate}} the absorption <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> nanowire with different length, we also measured the reflectance <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> nanowire arrays {{with a different}} L coated with and without PEDOT:PSS using a UV/visible/NIR spectrophotometer (shown in Fig.  4 a, b). It is seen that the reflectance <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> nanowire decreases {{with the increase of}} the length <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> nanowire arrays. The reflectance of the cells with L[*]=[*] 0.10 and 0.23  μm is higher than other cells in the short wavelength region. Compared to the EQE and the reflectance <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> nanowire coated with PEDOT:PSS, We postulate that this might be {{due to the fact that}} PEDOT:PSS layer acts as an antireflective coating and then substantially reduces the reflectance of light. This antireflective effect may be stronger than the light-trapping effect arising from the increase <b>of</b> the <b>silicon</b> nanowire arrays, which can also be deduced from the EQE spectra—the EQE in the hybrid solar cell with shorter nanowire arrays is higher than the cell with longer nanowire arrays in the short wavelength region.|$|R
