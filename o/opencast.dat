5|$|Coal is now {{delivered}} to the station mainly using rail transport and is unloaded at the station using a merry-go-round system. Trains supplying the station use the Newbiggin and Lynemouth branch line of the Blyth and Tyne Railway, which also serves the smelter. This line was originally used to export coal from the local coalfield, and also had passenger services. These passenger services ceased in 1964, and now the line is only used to serve the power station and smelter. Coal from the local <b>opencast</b> mines is brought to the station by road using heavy goods vehicles. Coal is graded and washed at the station prior to being burned.|$|E
5|$|In the 1770s and 1780s the {{discovery}} of copper at Parys Mountain in Anglesey which could be cheaply extracted by <b>opencast</b> mining led to a crash in the copper price, and expensive deep mining began to become unviable. As the copper boom came to an end, the mines began to close. In 1788 mining ceased at Dolcoath itself, although some bal maidens continued to be employed picking through the large quantities of ore which had already {{been brought to the}} surface.|$|E
50|$|Trains {{continued}} {{to pass the}} station site until the colliery closed in 1988 and the stockpile was cleared. Arkwright Colliery was subsequently <b>opencasted</b> then landscaped. The <b>opencasted</b> coal was taken away by lorry, a narrative given in detail under Arkwright Town Junction. The landscaping has removed all trace of the station, the colliery and the railway east of the GCR Main Line, opening vistas from (for example) the Sutton Road never seen in the 20th Century.|$|R
50|$|The larger part of {{the hill}} is {{afforested}} with conifers. In between the plantations are areas of past or present <b>opencasting</b> for coal.|$|R
50|$|After the {{colliery}} closed {{methane gas}} {{was found to}} be unstoppably seeping into buildings in the village of Arkwright Town. A new village was built on the North side of the A632 and the old village was demolished. The colliery site was <b>opencasted</b> then landscaped. Coal from the <b>opencasting</b> was hauled by road trucks along the trackbed of the GCR Main Line and put onto trains at Oxcroft Disposal Point. This traffic ended c2005 when the coal was worked out.|$|R
5|$|With {{only one}} {{significant}} <b>opencast</b> {{in the local}} area mining past 2008, along with another smaller <b>opencast</b> at Stony Heap, {{there is a need}} for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local <b>opencast</b> mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would have too high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.|$|E
5|$|Llanelli, Ammanford and {{the upper}} parts of the Gwendraeth Valley are {{situated}} on the South Wales Coalfield. The <b>opencast</b> mining activities in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, {{so that by the}} end of the nineteenth century, Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these industrial activities today. Llanelli and Burry Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries silted up. Country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded.|$|E
5|$|In late 1994, {{the power}} station was flooded to a foot deep of sea water, after a freak high tide and strong winds. This {{led to a}} sea defence system being {{constructed}} to protect the building. The problems came about because of the temporary closure of Ellington Colliery. Tipped waste from the colliery had {{been used as a}} coastal defence measure, but as the colliery had closed, waste was no longer being tipped. The colliery was reopened by RJB Mining, and in July 1999 the station ensured the future of the colliery by signing a contract with RJB Mining to be provided with 3,000,000 tonnes of coal from Ellington Colliery and <b>opencast</b> mines in Northumberland, over the course of three years. The colliery closed for good in 2005, leading to problems with coastal defence again, threatening the station's coal stocking area. This required a £2.5 million new coastal defence scheme be put in place, involving the use of large rocks as a defence wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{trackbed}} from Foxlow Junction to Seymour Junction and Oxcroft Disposal Point {{is protected}} as there remains {{the possibility of}} <b>opencasting</b> in the area. For example, in 2005 UK Coal (now Coalfield Resources), {{expressed an interest in}} extracting c530,000 tons near Mastin Moor.|$|R
50|$|Monktonhall Colliery was {{abandoned}} in 1997 and Blinkbonny mine adit was sealed in 2003 so bringing {{to an end}} {{a long history of}} deep-mining of coal within the coalfield. <b>Opencasting</b> has continued at various sites since then including Blinkbonny, Oxenfoord, Gourlaw and Newbigging Farm.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{trackbed}} of the Oxcroft Branch off the Clowne Branch east of Seymour Junction {{has been}} protected as there remains {{the possibility of}} <b>opencasting</b> in the area. For example, in 2005 UK Coal (now Coalfield Resources), {{expressed an interest in}} extracting c530,000 tons near Mastin Moor.|$|R
25|$|There were collieries {{here and}} <b>opencast</b> coal sites cleared {{many of the}} deep mines in April 1958. Coal {{production}} ceased at Broughton Moor in June 1959, but was started up again sometime after 1964 when the Blooming Heather <b>opencast</b> site extended towards the village from nearby Dearham.|$|E
25|$|Prospecting was {{successful}} and several opencasts are visible below the large tanks built along its length. The only {{exception is the}} final and very large tank, below which are two reservoirs. It is likely that this complex was used for washing powdered ore to collect the gold dust. More leats and tanks can be found below {{the line of the}} main aqueduct, some of which are shown on the map of the site. They surround the lip of the very large <b>opencast</b> and the tank shown at right is one which was built on the main aqueduct. It {{was successful}} in finding a vein, judging by the <b>opencast</b> below, but must have been modified later to feed a washing table built to the left-hand side (near the figure in the picture), probably to wash the crushed ore from the same <b>opencast</b> working. It is labelled Tank C in the schematic diagram. Similar tanks occur below as the Romans followed the large vein down to the road and the main <b>opencast.</b> Most of the <b>opencast</b> workings must therefore be Roman in origin, since one of the aqueducts has been confirmed by carbon 14 dating as to predate all modern workings. Just by the road itself the Carreg Pumsaint has been erected in the space beside a large mound, now thought to be a dump of waste material from mining activities.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, several tanks {{found on}} the site did not show a vein, so were abandoned. The tank shown at right occurs {{not far from the}} north <b>opencast</b> and was {{probably}} intended to find the limits of the deposit located in the adjacent <b>opencast</b> (Tank A in the schematic diagram below). It clearly didn't find the vein, and was thus abandoned. The water supply may have been obtained from a small leat run from a stream up the main Cothi valley before the much larger aqueduct was constructed.|$|E
5000|$|A {{temporary}} reprieve for {{the line}} through the site of Staveley Town station was obtained following the closure of Arkwright Colliery in 1988. The Arkwright site was eventually <b>opencasted</b> then landscaped, with startling visual impact. The <b>opencasted</b> coal was transported by lorry along the trackbed of the Great Central Main Line north of Arkwright, thence to Oxcroft Disposal Point near Shuttlewood where it was loaded onto Merry-go-Round (MGR) trains which ran through Oxcroft Colliery Junction, Seymour Junction,the station site and Hall Lane Junction to join the ex-MR Chesterfield to Rotherham [...] "Back Line" [...] at Foxlow Junction. This traffic came to a natural end in 2006. On 4 March 2006 the Branch Line Society ran a [...] "last train" [...] special through the station site to the disposal point boundary.|$|R
50|$|The Longannet {{power station}} near Kincardine used to source {{much of its}} coal from nearby pits but the Longannet coal mine closed after severe {{flooding}} in 2002, an event which more or less {{marked the end of}} deep mining in Fife and indeed Scotland. <b>Opencasting</b> continues to the present day.|$|R
50|$|The {{line from}} Foxlow Junction through Seymour Junction to Oxcroft Disposal Point has been lifted but {{protected}} from breach or encroachment as there remains {{the possibility of}} <b>opencasting</b> in the area. For example, in 2005 UK Coal (now Coalfield Resources), {{expressed an interest in}} extracting c530,000 tons near Mastin Moor.|$|R
25|$|Visitors {{enter the}} site through an {{entrance}} arch formed by a steam hammer, across a former <b>opencast</b> mining site {{and through a}} converted stable block (from Greencroft, near Lanchester, County Durham).|$|E
25|$|The £90 million Black Law Wind Farm {{is located}} near Forth in Lanarkshire {{and has been}} built on an old <b>opencast</b> coalmine site which was {{completely}} restored to shallow wetlands during the construction programme. It employs seven permanent staff on site and created 200 jobs during construction.|$|E
25|$|Gold {{is still}} mined by OceanaGold in {{commercial}} quantities in Otago at one site - Macraes Mine inland from Palmerston, which started operations in 1990. Macraes Mine, an <b>opencast</b> hard rock mining operation, processes more than 5 million tonnes of ore {{per year and}} had extracted 1.85 million ounces (57,500kg) of gold by 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Oxcroft Colliery, at Stanfree, survived until 27 February 1976. After {{it closed}} its {{facilities}} for loading coal onto trains were retained and developed as the [...] "Oxcroft Disposal Point" [...] for <b>opencasted</b> coal. The site had {{something of a}} Red Letter Day on 9 May 1992 when Class 58 locomotive 58 044 was ceremonially named [...] "Oxcroft Opencast".|$|R
50|$|After closure {{the site}} {{became part of}} a long held plan by Rotherham Borough Council, Sheffield City Council and North East Derbyshire District Council to create the {{northern}} extension to the Rother Valley Country Park. The {{first part of the}} plan, the southern part of which was commenced in 1976, was to extract coal by <b>opencasting</b> from the area before commencement of landscaping.|$|R
50|$|Other {{than the}} area being <b>opencasted,</b> {{much of the}} hill is {{designated}} as open country and therefore available for walkers to wander over at will. Various public footpaths and bridleways provide access over its lower slopes from the communities in the upper Swansea Valley such as Abercraf and Ystradgynlais and from Seven Sisters/Blaendulais {{at the head of}} the Dulais valley to the southeast.|$|R
25|$|Such methods {{could be}} very {{effective}} in <b>opencast</b> mining, but fire-setting was very dangerous when used in underground workings. They were made redundant {{with the introduction of}} explosives, although hydraulic mining is still used on alluvial tin ores. They were also used to produce a controlled supply to wash the crushed ore. It is highly likely that they also developed water-powered stamp mills to crush hard ore, which could be washed to collect the heavy gold dust.|$|E
25|$|OSS Watch {{provides}} both reactive and proactive {{support to}} a wide range of projects. Their mission is to ensure that software developed using public funding is, wherever possible, made available under free and open source licenses. Recent success stories have seen them participate in the creation of <b>Opencast</b> Matterhorn, a worldwide community project building audio and video capture and delivery software, as well as the migration of a W3C Widget standards compliant widget engine from an EU funded project into the Apache Software Foundations Incubator.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{function}} of the cascade {{is related to the}} methods of extracting the final traces of gold from the crushed ore. There were probably washing tables between the two tanks so that a gentle stream of water could be used to wash the ore on the rough surface of the tables, the finer gold being caught in the rougher parts of the tables, and removed {{at the end of the}} process. The cascade would probably have been built towards the end of the 1st century when underground mining commenced following <b>opencast</b> development.|$|E
50|$|Several cairns {{of unknown}} age are found around the summit plateau though that {{formerly}} known as Garn Goch has been obliterated by the <b>opencasting.</b> The remains of numerous nineteenth century tramroads are scattered around the flanks of the hill, notably that of Claypon's Tramroad extension, one of the later parts of the Brecon Forest Tramroad linking Onllwyn with Ystalyfera in the Swansea Valley.|$|R
50|$|Claypon's Tramroad can be {{followed}} {{for much of}} its length. At the Onllwyn end it has been obliterated by <b>opencasting</b> and subsequent land restoration but lengthy sections can {{be followed}} around Mynydd y Drum, including sections where runs of stone blocks still remain. The mile-long incline down into Ystradgynlais can be followed including the ruined remains of the winding engine house at the summit.|$|R
50|$|The company {{remained}} independent {{until it}} {{became part of the}} National Coal Board's (NCB) North Western Division on nationalisation in January 1947 when 760 men were employed underground and 258 on the surface. In 1961 the area became the NCB's East Lancashire Area. The area mined by this company, Shakerley Collieries and James Roscoe's New Lester Colliery was <b>opencasted</b> after the Second World War, removing all traces of the industry.|$|R
25|$|The 54-turbine Black Law Wind Farm has a total {{capacity}} of 124 MW. It is located near Forth in Lanarkshire and {{was built on}} old <b>opencast</b> coalmine site, with an original capacity of 97 MW from 42 turbines. It employs seven permanent staff on site and created 200 jobs during construction. A second phase saw the installation of a further 12 turbines. The project has received wide recognition for its contribution to environmental objectives. Over the period April 2009 to March 2010, Black Law Wind Farm produced 19.19% of its rated capacity.|$|E
25|$|The Old Man slate {{quarries}} {{were believed}} to have started in the 12-13th centuries, although {{there is little evidence}} on site of this. By the 1500s the quarries, working a kind of volcanic slate silver-grey in colour, were well established. The earliest major working shortly after this period was probably at Low Water Quarry, where slate was prized in an <b>opencast</b> manner from cuttings near the summit, Scald Kop Quarry, where a large underground cavern was formed from slate extraction on the surface, and the Saddlestone Quarry, again consisting of two 'caves' where slate had been quarried to form underground workings.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{restoring}} the canal was first developed in 1975, {{as a result}} of legislation requiring planning authorities to produce county structure plans. The West Midlands structure plan included the concept of the restored canal as a linear park, and included a bypass to avoid the section destroyed by <b>opencast</b> mining. Further threats to the route from the proposed Birmingham Northern Relief Road {{led to the formation of}} the Ogley and Hatherton Restoration Society in 1989, after the Inland Waterways Association held a rally at Pelsall to highlight the plight of the canal. The Society later became the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust, while the relief road became the M6 Toll motorway.|$|E
50|$|In the 1830s Shude Hill Pit had a steam winding engine. City Pit and Gatley Pit were in {{operation}} by 1838 {{linked to the}} Worsley Navigable Levels and a horse-drawn tramroad to Mathers Fold. The tramway was extended to link several pits to Bridgewater Canal at Boothstown Basin. These pits worked the Brassey mine (coal seam) at 262 feet and the Rams mine at 360 feet, employed 64 workers in 1852, and were closed in 1877. The area has been <b>opencasted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Coal mining {{has left}} areas of {{derelict}} land and spoil heaps or [...] "rucks" [...] across the coalfield. Some reclamation {{has taken place}} often after <b>opencasting.</b> Subsidence had resulted in [...] "flashes" [...] or shallow lakes {{some of which have}} been landscaped for recreational use such as the Three Sisters at Ashton in Makerfield and Pennington Flash Country Parks in Leigh. The Astley Green Colliery Museum and Gin Pit Miners Welfare in Astley are two of the last tangible reminders of the once thriving industry.|$|R
50|$|Mynydd y Drum is a hill on {{the border}} between the county of Powys and Neath Port Talbot County Borough, south Wales. The summit of the hill is in Neath Port Talbot (formerly the county of Glamorgan) at 298m and lies towards the western end of a broad curving ridge, the larger part of which is in Powys (former county of Brecknockshire). The eastern half of the hill is {{currently}} being <b>opencasted</b> for coal. The hill is sometimes referred to simply as The Drum (Welsh drum pronounced 'drim').|$|R
