5000|$|The tramp trade {{first took}} off in Britain around the mid 19th century. The {{dependability}} and timeliness of steam ships {{was found to be}} more cost-effective than sail. Coal was needed for ships' boilers, and the demand created a business opportunity for moving large amounts of best Welsh coal to various seaports in Britain. Within a few years tramp ships became the workhorses of trade, transporting coal and finished products from British cities {{to the rest of the}} world. [...] The size of tramp ships remained relatively constant from 1900 to 1940, at about 7,000 to 10,000 deadweight tons (dwt.). During the Second World War, the United States created the Liberty Ship; a single design that could be used to carry just about anything, which weighed in at 10,500 dwt. [...] The U.S. produced 2,708 Liberty Ships and they were used on every international trade route. [...] After the Second World War, economies of scale took over and the size of tramp ships exploded to keep up with a booming supply and demand cycle. During this time the bulk carrier became the tramp of choice for many owners and operators. The bulk carrier was designed to carry coal, grain and ore, which gave it more flexibility and could service more ports than some of its ancestors, which only carried a single commodity. [...] Today the tramp trade includes all types of vessels, from bulk carriers to tankers. Each can be used for a specific market, or ships can be combined like the <b>oil,</b> <b>bulk,</b> <b>ore</b> carriers to accommodate many different markets depending where the ship is located and the supply and demand of the area. Tramp ships often carry with them their own gear (booms, cranes, derricks) in case the next port lacks the proper equipment for loading or discharging cargo.|$|E

40|$|Technological {{properties}} and structural characteristics of proteins and lipids, using Raman spectroscopy, of frankfurters formulated with olive <b>oil</b> <b>bulking</b> agents as animal fat replacers were examined during chilling storage. Frankfurters reformulated with <b>oil</b> <b>bulking</b> agents showed lower (P < 0. 05) processing loss and higher (P < 0. 05) hardness and chewiness. Purge loss during chilling storage was relatively low, demonstrating a good water retention in the products. β-Sheet structures were {{enhanced by the}} use of olive <b>oil</b> <b>bulking</b> agents, and this effect was more pronounced in samples containing inulin. Reformulated frankfurters contained the least turns (P < 0. 05). A significant decrease of β-sheets and an increase of turns were observed after 85 days of chilled storage. The lowest (P < 0. 05) values of IνsCH 2 /IνasCH 2 were recorded in frankfurters reformulated with <b>oil</b> <b>bulking</b> agents, which suggests more lipid acyl chain disorder. Structural characteristics were correlated to processing losses, hardness, and chewiness. © 2014 American Chemical Society. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The Tasman Bridge {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} the evening of 5 January 1975, in Hobart, the capital city of Australia's island state of Tasmania, when a <b>bulk</b> <b>ore</b> carrier travelling up the Derwent River collided with several pylons of the Tasman Bridge, causing a large section of the bridge deck to collapse onto the ship and into the river below. Twelve people were killed, including seven crew on board the ship, and the five occupants of four cars which fell 45 m (150 feet) after driving off the bridge. The disaster severed the main link between Hobart and its eastern suburbs, and there were social impacts from the loss of such an important road artery.|$|R

50|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Bobby, a Category 4 cyclone with {{estimated}} {{winds up}} to 270 km/hour near the centre, crossed the Western Australian Pilbara coast {{to the east}} of Onslow between midnight and 0100 on the 25 February 1995. Seven lives were lost when two fishing trawlers were sunk off the coast from Onslow. A <b>bulk</b> <b>ore</b> carrier also ran aground in the cyclone. There was very minor property damage reported from the Karratha area and approximately 20 houses in Onslow suffered superficial roofing damage. Cyclone Bobby also brought heavy rains and extensive flooding to the south of the Pilbara area, which damaged roads, bridges and crops and seriously affected mining production. A motorist was drowned inland from Carnarvon while attempting to cross a flooded creek.|$|R

30|$|Asphaltenes have {{inherent}} {{positive or}} negative charges, depending on the composition of crude oil. Resins have {{a strong desire to}} link asphaltenes and attract opposite charges; consequently, they make a protective layer for asphaltenes. When this protective layer is removed, asphaltene precipitation occurs. The force balance between the adsorbed resins and asphaltenes is the most important factor for crude oil instability (Mullins et al. 2007). Resins naturally act as inhibitors, group contribution of which is a factor which connects the polar (asphaltenes) and non-polar (<b>oil</b> <b>bulk)</b> media.|$|R

50|$|The {{long-term}} growth in imports was facilitated by several major factors. The most important was general {{growth in the}} Japanese economy and income levels. Rising real incomes increased demand for imports, both those consumed directly and those entering into production. Another factor was the shift in the economy toward greater reliance on imported raw materials. Primary energy sources in the late 1940s, for example, were domestic coal and charcoal. The shift to imported oil and coal as major energy sources did not come until the late 1950s and 1960s. The small size and poor quality {{of many of the}} mineral deposits in Japan, combined with innovations in ocean transportation, such as <b>bulk</b> <b>ore</b> carriers, meant that as the economy grew, demand outstripped domestic supply and cheaper imports were utilized.|$|R
