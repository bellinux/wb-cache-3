5|$|The Moon's <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> the Earth is {{inclined}} {{at an angle}} of just over 5 degrees to {{the plane of the}} Earth's <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> the Sun (the ecliptic). Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun. A solar eclipse can occur only when new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecliptic}} is {{the circular}} path on the celestial sphere that the Sun appears to follow {{over the course}} of a year; it is the basis of the ecliptic coordinate system. The term also refers to the plane of this path, which is coplanar with Earth's <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> the Sun (and hence the Sun's apparent <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> Earth).|$|E

25|$|Planets <b>orbiting</b> <b>around</b> one of {{the stars}} in binary systems are more easily detectable, as they cause {{perturbations}} in the orbits of stars themselves. However, with this method, follow-up observations are needed to determine which star the planet <b>orbits</b> <b>around.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{dynamics}} of a particle <b>orbiting</b> <b>around</b> a rotating homogeneous cube, and shows fruitful results that have implications for examining {{the dynamics of}} <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> non-spherical celestial bodies. This study {{can be considered as}} an extension of previous research work on the dynamics of <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> simple shaped bodies, including a straight segment, a circular ring, an annulus disk, and simple planar plates with backgrounds in celestial mechanics. In the synodic reference frame, the model of a rotating cube is established, the equilibria are calculated, and their linear stabilities are determined. Periodic <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> the equilibria are computed using the traditional differential correction method, and their stabilities are determined by the eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix. The existence of homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits connecting periodic <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> the equilibria is examined and proved numerically {{in order to understand the}} global orbit structure of the system. This study contributes to the investigation of irregular shaped celestial bodies that can be divided into a set of cubes.

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} study, the {{existence}} of periodic <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> a fixed homogeneous cube is investigated, and the results have powerful implications for examining periodic <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> non-spherical celestial bodies. In the {{two different types of}} symmetry planes of the fixed cube, periodic orbits are obtained using the method of the Poincaré surface of section. While in general positions, periodic orbits are found by the homotopy method. The results show that periodic orbits exist extensively in symmetry planes of the fixed cube, and also exist near asymmetry planes that contain the regular Hex cross section. The stability of these periodic orbits is determined {{on the basis of the}} eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix. This paper proves that the homotopy method is effective to find periodic orbits in the gravity field of the cube, which provides a new thought of searching for periodic <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> non-spherical celestial bodies. The investigation of <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> the cube could be considered as the first step of the complicated cases, and helps to understand the dynamics of <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> bodies with complicated shapes. The work is an extension of the previous research work about the dynamics of <b>orbits</b> <b>around</b> some simple shaped bodies, including a straight segment, a circular ring, an annulus disk, and simple planar plates.

5|$|The {{origin of}} this pulsar planet is still uncertain, but it {{probably}} did not form where it is found today. Because of the decreased gravitational force when the core of star collapses to a neutron star and ejects most of its mass in a supernova explosion, {{it is unlikely that}} a planet could remain in orbit after such an event. It is more likely that the planet formed in <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> the star that has now evolved into the white dwarf, and that the star and planet were only later captured into <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> the neutron star.|$|E

5|$|However, {{some have}} {{suggested}} that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> the Sun—looking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-8 {{was named}} {{the way it was}} because it is home to the eighth {{planetary}} system confirmed {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA-directed program tasked with searching a region of the sky for terrestrial planets that transit, or cross in front of (and thereby, for a while, make dimmer) the stars that they orbit with respect to Earth. The planet in <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> Kepler-8, Kepler-8b, was the fifth of the first five planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets confirmed by Kepler had been previously discovered, and were only used to verify the accuracy of Kepler's measurements.
