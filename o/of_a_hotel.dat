Christina's marriage to the wealthy William Shand-Kydd introduced her to London high society, and it was at a golf-club function in the country that Veronica and Lucan first met.|$|E
5|$|As Charley {{moved across}} eastern North Carolina, {{hurricane}} warnings were extended northward, first to Virginia Beach; they were later extended to Cape Charles, {{then to the}} Maryland/Delaware border, and ultimately {{as far north as}} Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Prior to its arrival, the storm resulted in the closure of Norfolk International Airport, and more than 9,000people evacuated the coastline for emergency shelters. Tropical storm force winds spread across southeastern Virginia, with wind gusts reaching 82mph (133km/h) on Cape Charles. Offshore, a station on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel recorded sustained winds of 97mph (157km/h) with gusts to 104mph (168km/h). After the gust, the bridge-tunnel was closed overnight. The winds downed many trees, and in Norfolk, a motorist died after crashing into a downed tree. In Virginia Beach, the winds blew off the roof <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hotel</b> and destroyed two homes under construction. Across the area, the storm left about 110,000customers without power. Rainfall in Virginia was fairly light, including a 24-hour total of just over 1in (25mm) in Norfolk. Strong waves destroyed 250ft (76m) of Harrison's Pier in Norfolk. A preliminary damage estimate for the area was $1million (1986USD).|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the initial silver rush, a town site was platted {{and the town}} was built. The first permanent business building established in Silver Reef was a store {{at the intersection of}} the roads from the Buckeye, White, and East reefs. By 1878, the town's business district consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hotel,</b> boarding houses, nine stores, six saloons, five restaurants, a bank, two dance halls, a newspaper called The Silver Echo (which later became the Silver Reef Miner), and eight dry goods stores. Two cemeteries, one Catholic and one Protestant, were located south of Silver Reef's business district. Most of the businesses in Silver Reef were situated along a mile-long Main Street. The mining district consisted of 37 mines and five stamp mills: the Christy, Stormont, Leeds, Buckeye and Barbee & Walker mills. Although it was surrounded by settlements with large Mormon populations, the town never had a Mormon meeting house. A Catholic church was the only church located within the town. After the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, many of the Chinese workers who had been hired to build it were out of work. Some returned to China, but others remained in Utah. A group of 250 of these workers set up a Chinatown in a level area just south of Silver Reef. Silver Reef's Chinatown had a Chinese mayor and several businesses. By 1879, Silver Reef's population had reached 2,000, and the town also had a horse race track, a brewery, and a brass band. Shooting matches among members of the Silver Reef Rifle Club and sometimes residents of nearby towns took place on the horse race track.|$|E
5|$|The former Exchange Building, {{from which}} The Exchange takes its name, was an {{impressive}} structure, designed by William Mason as a Post Office and later {{occupied by the}} University of Otago and the Otago Museum. Next to this was the 1863 Customhouse building, and outside the two was an open space known as Customhouse Square. The Exchange building was pulled down in 1969, and it was largely the destruction of this building that led to changes in attitudes by Dunedinites regarding the change of their cityscape. Since this time, changes to the city's old buildings have been met with vociferous protests. The Customhouse building is also long since gone. Today, {{the site of the}} buildings is the location of Dunedin's biggest office block, John Wickliffe House, and the nearby John Wickliffe Plaza. Both are named for the John Wickliffe, the first of the two ships which brought the Otago Association's settlers to Dunedin (a nearby building, Philip Laing House, is named for the other of these two ships). Despite this, the area is the site of several prominent Victorian buildings, notably former bank buildings at the northern end of the area. Other imposing buildings in the area include the Chief Post Office building, the proposed site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>hotel,</b> and - one block to the east - Consultancy House, a seven-storey 1908 building regarded (by dint of its construction methods) as Dunedin's first skyscraper. John Wickliffe Plaza is also the site of one of Dunedin's more notable public monuments, dedicated to city founder Captain William Cargill. This monument, designed by Charles Robert Swyer and built in 1863-4, was originally sited in the Octagon, but was moved to the Exchange in 1872.|$|E
