5|$|Aaron Ward and Sterett, {{independently}} {{searching for}} targets, both sighted Yūdachi, who appeared unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> {{of the two}} U.S. destroyers. Both U.S.ships hit Yūdachi simultaneously with gunfire and torpedoes, heavily damaging the destroyer and forcing her crew to abandon ship. The ship did not sink right away, however. Continuing on her way, Sterett was suddenly ambushed by Teruzuki, heavily damaged, and forced {{to withdraw from the}} battle area to the east. Aaron Ward wound up in a one-on-one duel with Kirishima, which the destroyer lost with heavy damage. She also tried to retire from the battle area to the east but soon stopped dead in the water because the engines were damaged.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{and compares}} two {{approaches}} for generating Herbrand models of clausal first-order theories: Satchmo by R. Manthey and F. Bry and the method introduced by C. Fermuller and A. Leitsch. A uniform description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>approaches</b> is given for this purpose. <b>The</b> two <b>approaches</b> {{turn out to}} be able to handle similar classes of theories in principle. However, theories are typically handled efficiently by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> and inefficiently by the other. In this sense, <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> are complementary. A characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classes <b>of</b> theories for which each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> is better is given and guidelines for a combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approaches</b> are derived from this characterization...|$|R

5|$|At 10:45am on 12 June Private Haines, a sentry on {{the left}} hand flank, warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of an Indonesian foot patrol along the river bank. The Australians had sited the ambush to engage targets on the river and were {{initially}} at a disadvantage. Ten minutes after the Indonesians were first seen, Private Sneddon, on the extreme left, engaged a group of six Indonesians with a long burst of machine-gun fire, killing two instantly and a third as he ran towards him. Haines subsequently killed a fourth, while a fifth Indonesian continued past him, followed by five others, who then engaged the Australians. The Indonesian patrol continued to advance, taking them towards {{the rear of the}} Australian positions.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E
5|$|During {{the days}} after the landing, the ground forces secured the Jacquinot Bay area. AIB {{personnel}} manned an outpost to warn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of Japanese forces, while the combat troops patrolled and established positions near the main landing area. On 6 November the company from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion was moved by landing craft to the northern shore of Jacquinot Bay, and subsequently guarded the tracks leading to this area. This unit later relieved the AIB of responsibility for maintaining some of its positions to the east of Jacquinot Bay. During this period the 14th/32nd Battalion remained near the landing area, though one of its companies gradually established an outpost between 8 and 12 November.|$|E

When Crassus refused, a portion of Spartacus' forces broke out of confinement and fled toward the mountains west of Petelia (modern Strongoli) in Bruttium, with Crassus' legions in pursuit. The legions managed to catch {{a portion of the}} rebels – under the command of Gannicus and Castus – separated from the main army, killing 12,300.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 Constantine became {{chairman}} of the League of Coloured Peoples, a position he held until the League was discontinued in 1951. In 1948 he {{was elected president of}} the Caribbean Congress of Labour, and between 1947 and 1950 {{was a member of the}} Colonial Office's Colonial Social Welfare Advisory Committee. Also in 1950, he became involved in a controversy over the interracial marriage of Seretse Khama, the future president of Botswana. Constantine lobbied the government on Khama's behalf, organised meetings and even approached the United Nations. Little was achieved, and Constantine disapproved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of the Labour government and its Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, but declined an opportunity to become a Liberal parliamentary candidate.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of royalist {{reinforcements}} and departed, {{but instead}} of marching to London, he headed north with his force towards the county of Somerset. On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias could join up. More recruits joined his disorganised force, which was now around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks). One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.|$|E

5|$|On 23 October, Maruyama's forces {{struggled}} {{through the jungle}} to reach the American lines. Kawaguchi, on his own initiative, began to shift his right wing unit to the east, believing that the American defenses were weaker in that area. Maruyama—through one of his staff officers—ordered Kawaguchi to keep to the original attack plan. When he refused, Kawaguchi was relieved of command and replaced by Colonel Toshinari Shoji, commander of the 230th Infantry Regiment. That evening, after learning that {{the left and right}} wing forces were still struggling to reach the American lines, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained completely unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of Maruyama's forces.|$|E

The decision to switch to manual mode came after the cosmonauts noticed a small deviation in the spacecraft's approach to the targeted docking port. At about 09:32 UT {{on the day of}} docking, the crew prepared to open the hatches between the Soyuz spacecraft and the station. After entering the station the crew stabilized the atmosphere inside Mir and undertook routine maintenance work.|$|E

5|$|The Afghan Emir {{was warned}} by New Delhi <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of the {{expedition}} even while efforts were underway to intercept it in the Persian desert. After it crossed into Afghanistan, the Emir was asked to arrest the members. However, Habibullah humoured the British without obeying the Viceroy's requests. He told the Viceroy {{that he intended to}} remain neutral and could not take any actions that were overtly pro-British. Indian intelligence became aware—after the expedition had already been Kabul for some time—that they carried with them highly inflammatory letters from the Kaiser and the Turkish Sultan. Through British channels, the Russians voiced their concerns about the Emir's tolerance of the German presence and their intrigues with Pro-German Afghan counsellors.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the freeway over Vail Pass is also listed as an engineering marvel. One of the challenges of this portion is {{the management of the}} wildlife that roams this area. Several parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses. At least one underpass is located along a natural migratory path and has been landscaped to encourage deer to cross.|$|E
5|$|The monochord {{served as}} a precise measure of the notes of a musical scale, {{allowing}} more accurate musical arrangements. Mechanical hurdy-gurdies allowed single musicians to play more complicated arrangements than a fiddle would; both were prominent folk instruments in the Middle Ages. Southern Europeans played short and long lutes whose pegs extended to the sides, unlike the rear-facing pegs of Central and Northern European instruments. Idiophones such as bells and clappers served various practical purposes, such as warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of a leper.|$|E

5|$|While Allied naval {{authorities}} were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of the German strike force and {{were successful in}} sinking {{two of the four}} submarines dispatched, efforts to locate and sink U-862 once she reached Australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti-submarine warfare. As the southern coast of Australia was thousands of kilometres behind the active combat front in South-East Asia and had not been raided for several years, it should not be considered surprising that few anti-submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945.|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
5|$|The first Byzantine {{encounter}} with Sayf al-Dawla {{took place in}} 936, {{when he tried to}} relieve Samosata, but a revolt at home forced him to turn back. In another invasion in 938, however, he captured the fort of Charpete and defeated Kourkouas's advance guard, seizing a great amount of booty and forcing Kourkouas to withdraw. In the same year, a peace agreement was signed between Constantinople and the Caliphate. The negotiations were facilitated by the rising power of the Hamdanids, which caused anxiety to both sides. Despite the official peace with the Caliphate, ad hoc warfare continued between the Byzantines and the local Muslim rulers, now aided by the Hamdanids. The Byzantines attempted to besiege Theodosiopolis in 939, but the siege was abandoned at the news <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>approach</b> of Sayf al-Dawla's relief army.|$|E
