It has {{had a profound effect}} on economic, political, and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> and has introduced ways of communicating which have transformed social relationships. The Internet has opened up information exchange on a global scale, offering enormous opportunities and advantages to an hitherto unknown degree. The Internet has also raised a number of serious, and urgent, ethical challenges. The discussions and debate surrounding ethical issues such as trust, security and privacy, amongst others, conducted at all levels (international, government, academia and the popular press) in themselves are evidence of the complexity of the problem of Internet ethics. The research unravels some of the complexity and muddle of Internet ethics, with the objective of providing a foundation for further research. This thesis offers four perspectives on the problems of Internet ethics: technical, conceptual, regulatory and ethical. These different viewpoints are not only useful in drawing out insights concerning the ethical framework of the Internet, they also provide leverage for the analysis of pertinent issues. The work in this thesis thus offers a framework for understanding, and analysis, which can be developed and used in continuing investigations. The research is a combination of theory and practice - both informing each other. The approach taken arose from the author's direct involvement in many of the expert discussions and debates which (together with the literature), identified a need for foundational work.

While 60 percent {{are located in the}} outskirts of existing rural villages, 37 percent live in remote areas, and a very small number reside in the vicinity of existing township. The Orang Asli population has been identified to be among the poorest and the most socio-economically and culturally marginalized in Peninsular Malaysia. This paper attempts to build a simple behavioral model topredict and explain the multi-faceted factors in contributing towards their poverty, especially among the Orang Asli community living within the watershed and environmental protected areas. The preliminary finding shows that the Orang Asli community is quite likely to be poor if they settled in environmental sensitive and protected areas as compared to families under the new resettlement scheme. Access to basic education and employment contributed significantly to the poor economic status of the Orang Asli. Our preliminary findings show that the poor households among Orang Asli faced some difficulty in getting access and support in terms of basic needs such as housing, education, economic livelihood and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> More importantly, the government regulatory structure in terms of managing watershed areas and agricultural land for commodity crops has indirectly. contributed towards the poverty levels of the Orang Asli.

40|$|This paper reviews {{both the}} {{literature}} on aid volatility and also adds to that literature. In general, {{the focus of this}} literature has been on the volatility of overall aid, while we focus more on the volatility of the individual aid sectors, e. g., education aid. In doing this, detailed use is made of the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) database on aid commitments and disbursements, particularly the latter. Key aid sectors in explaining total aid volatility relate to debt, programme assistance, infrastructure and government. This reflects both these sectors' volatility and their size. The most volatile aid sectors per se are debt, industry, humanitarian, NGO and programme assistance. The least volatile are education, health, <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and multi-sector aid. We also find evidence that the volatility of different aid sectors saw a peak around 2006, which was about when debt aid volatility was at its highest. In an asymmetric VAR, we find that both positive and negative aid volatility tend to be corrected for in the following period, rather than there simply being a return to trend. There are also cross-sector effects by which volatility in one sector has subsequent impacts on other sectors. These tend to revolve around government aid and programme assistance. Finally we examine the impact of aid and aid volatility on very specific targets, finding both to be significant. There are several lessons we draw from this: first, in analysing aid's impact, for example, on social targets such as school completion rates, social sector aid rather than overall aid is the relevant variable although not necessarily just education aid. Second, we argue that a complete understanding of aid's impact can only be obtained by an analysis such as this, across a range of targets and then analysing the impact of these targets on the macroeconomy itself. This leads to the further conclusion {{that it is not the}} volatility of total aid which matters so much as the sum of sector and subsector volatilities...|$|E

A review conducted in 2007 of twelve years of individual employment histories found that, generally speaking, the training of unemployed East Germans was beneficial, but involved initial negative (participants cease to actively seek employment for the first twelve to eighteen months of training) lock-in effects and that long-term retraining for construction was misguided.|$|R
40|$|Research {{studies have}} shown that the initial energy {{embodied}} in a building can be as much as 67 % of the operational energy over a 25 year period. With growing global concerns over material and resource consumption and the emissions of CO 2 into the atmosphere, the energy embodied in buildings constructed in town and cities becomes important and one of the key issues that needs to be tackled in the design stages in order to strive towards sustainable buildings design. In this paper, a hybrid embodied carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 eq) methodology used to assess the CO 2 eq embodied in buildings is presented. The hybrid methodology consists of an Input-Output (I-O) and a process-based analysis. The I-O analysis is undertaken using re-derived Supply and Use and Input-Output data for Ireland which includes energy inputs into imported construction products and materials and construction sub-sectoral energy data. The Grand Canal Apartments in Dublin, Ireland is used as a case study. The buildings substructure, internal walls, floors, stairs, frame and roof was analysed in the study. The Irish construction sector is divided into five different sub-sectors, each having direct input-output energy intensities and accounting for different construction activities. The construction sub-sectoral I-O direct energy intensities ranges from 25. 61 tCO 2 eq/m€ for general fit-out to 493. 27 tCO 2 eq/m€ for the use of construction machinery. When embodied CO 2 eq analysis is carried out at the construction sub-sectoral level, there is a methodological improvement in the calculated values for the direct input-output as well as the total energy intensities over other traditional hybrid methods because of the use of disaggregated sub-sector construction data which can be more specifically applied to the type of construction project being considered. This hybrid methodology further makes use of disaggregates factors that disaggregate the energy supply sectors in the Input-Output analysis into individual sub-sectors supplying energy to the construction sector. Increasing population in urban cities and town means that new building and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> needs to be constructed. Embodied CO 2 eq emissions of new buildings should be used as one of the sustainable indicators to measure the whole life sustainability of buildings. The embodied CO 2 eq of a Grand Canal apartment building was estimated to be 0. 00718 tCO 2 eq/€. Energy saving efforts and sustainability initiatives in the construction sector such as considerations to embodied CO 2 eq of building materials, selection and design options can play a significant role in reducing the overall future CO 2 eq of the country. Reduction in the CO 2 eq embodied in buildings helps to tackle environmental pollution but needs however to be balanced with economic and social costs in order to achieve an overall sustainable urban solution...|$|E
40|$|Background: Two-year {{nationwide}} prison recidivism rates {{stand at}} over 60 %, and minorities {{and the poor}} are at greatest risk both of first-time incarceration and of offending repeatedly over time. Initiatives that may address prison inmates’ lack of resources and increase their success in their communities after release are now an important topic {{in the study of}} criminal justice policy. Over {{the course of the past}} two decades, the public health concern of HIV/AIDS has increasingly become a part of this discourse on re-entry, as the disease disproportionately affects minority communities both in and outside of prisons. Affected reentrants face not only the challenges associated with employment, education, housing, and <b>other</b> <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> that impede their long-term re-entry into mainstream society, but must also navigate issues surrounding continuity of medical care and behavioral risk reduction. 	In 2009, Georgia State University received funding to conduct an evaluation of Georgia’s Pre-Release Planning Program (PRPP) for HIV-positive inmates, and conducted semi-structured interviews with 25 former inmates who had received services from PRPP. This thesis work attempts to assess the content of the interviews and the potential impact of such an evaluation on corrections policy, especially in light of other similar programs that have been funded nationwide. Methods: A literature review was conducted to provide information on state and Federal pre-release programs for HIV+ prisoners that have been funded since the 1990 s. A qualitative analysis of the GSU interview transcripts, consisting of coding for major themes, was completed. The goal of the analysis was to determine what program components had been most beneficial to participants, and also what needs had gone unfulfilled. Results: Most participants (23 / 25) in receipt of pre-release planning services in Georgia felt that they had benefitted from the program. A majority (19 / 25) attended the appointments set up for them by the program coordinator. Respondents were generally satisfied with their medical care, though cases existed where respondents had been unable to access a stable provider or medication supply as planned. The greatest aid to participants from PRPP was in the area of medical care. Limitations were perceived in the areas of employment after release and the Department of Labor program to which PRPP referred participants, as well as housing to a lesser degree. Study participants acknowledged and appreciated the program coordinator’s hard work with the resources that she had, and recommended transitional housing and work programs as ideal resources to improve their situations. Almost all (22 / 23) expressed interest in a community mentoring program to aid their progress post-release. Conclusions: Literature showed a variety of education and prevention program models targeting HIV in prisons since the 1990 s. The best program outcomes were associated with the longest period of intervention and the most intensive case management (Rhode Island), but further evaluation is needed, and funding for such programs is a real and consistent concern. 	When combined with the literature on previous and existing programs nationwide, the voices of these participants provide a good idea of what may be next for a successful pre-release program in Georgia. 1) Planning services should begin sooner before release—possibly at the time of admission to prison—and should provide a longer period of follow-up, in order to capitalize on the time available for intervention with this vulnerable population and to more effectively prevent recidivism. The addition of support staff for the Georgia PRPP may allow this to occur. 2) Provision or expansion of the community mentoring program proposed in Spaulding’s 2009 study and supported by participants in these interviews, providing for matching of mentors with mentees by family and ethnic background, may be an important way to improve health outcomes among this population while facing a dearth of funding. 3) Securing and advocating for additional funding for vocational, counseling, and medical support services available to the general prison population is crucial, in order to support opportunities for skills advancement and true corrections in life path among a historically deprived incarcerated population. A cost-effectiveness analysis by state officials is recommended in order to measure the true economic value of such programs—especially in contrast to the public burden of unchecked recidivism. 4) A change in the Georgia laws that severely restrict the civil rights of ex-felons—including the right to vote, to be considered for many job opportunities, to be admitted to certain professional schools, and to receive state or federal financial aid for secondary education—is essential if former inmates are to be realistically expected to succeed outside of prison...|$|E

The study uses structured questionnaire as one of the major research instruments. The method of data analysis utilized descriptive analysis with illustrative data representations.

Most objects of <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> have been passed on balance of the local authorities. In Ukraine the state at the different levels takes measures concerning the stabilization and improvement of position in the <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> However, the estimation of realization results of priority national projects is vague for today. Thereby raises the question of choice of necessary criteria for the state adjusting of <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> the determination of industries which need the state adjusting and the degree of this adjusting in the present social and economic conditions. In addition current researchers don't have a common view of determination of both the essence and the classification of <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> In terms of formulated tasks, in the article it was made the attempt to define the essence of <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in providing conditions not only for the vital functions of individual but the society as a whole and also as a key indicator of the modern technological system. On the basis of the conducted analysis of the facts which influence on the functioning of region <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> there were selected the spheres of <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> where the state adjusting is necessary. There was selected a number of restrictions which are typical for the branches of <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and does not allow to function the business enterprises in this sphere...|$|R

Empirical analysis of the impact that basic and <b>social</b> <b>infrastructures</b> have on economic growth and social development in urban and rural municipalities respectively is however largely lacking. Such estimates {{could be used to}} influence basic and <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> investment decisions towards correcting inequalities that exist between urban and rural municipalities. A balanced panel dataset containing infrastructure, economic, demographic and social indicators are used to compile synthetic indices for basic and <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> (using principal component analysis) and the analysis. Restricted within the least square dummy variable (LSDV), estimation techniques are used to calculate the respective elasticities and to evaluate if the differences between urban and rural municipalities are statistically significant. The results indicate that basic and <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> have different impacts on economic growth and social development in urban and rural municipalities. The results also indicate that both basic and <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> investment generally have a greater economic growth and social development impact in rural municipalities. The research provides an empirical framework and actionable elasticities for the respective impact that basic and <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> investment have on urban and rural municipalities, which is largely under-researched. Knowing that basic and <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> investment have a greater impact on economic growth and social development in rural municipalities can therefore influence policy and investment decisions towards the reduction of inequalities experienced between urban and rural municipalities.

40|$|Competing {{demands for}} public sector {{investment}} for new <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> has prompted Australian governments to increasingly {{turn to the}} private sector to form partnerships in the construction, ownership and operation of <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> assets (PPPs). The research described in this paper focuses on ‘hard <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects’ i. e. projects which relate to the provision of physical infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and prisons. Soft <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects such as social security and community services are outside the scope of this research. Hard <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> projects are characterised as generally being smaller in scale than hard economic infrastructure projects (motorways, bridges, tunnels etc.) and by their very nature, also tend to be complex, particularly in terms of ongoing involvement with the community. Thus private sector bidders for hard <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> PPP projects are often presented with a situation where the financial rewards are less and the operational demands are more complex than for hard economic PPP projects. The paper traces the origins of hard <b>social</b> <b>infrastructure</b> PPPs in Australian and gives an up-to-date account of projects completed to date or in the pipeline. The paper also describes preliminary findings on additional costs likely to be incurred in bidding for hard social PPPs. Particular attention is placed on how PPP consortiums identify risks, opportunities and success factors both in terms of in the construction and operational phases of a project...|$|R
