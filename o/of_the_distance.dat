5|$|After the Norman Conquest of 1066, {{the manor}} of Clevedon was {{granted by the}} King to Matthew de Mortagne, who in turn granted it to his sub-tenant, Hildebert.

Perhaps because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> to the parish church, the manor house included a chapel dedicated, in the 1320s, to Saint Peter.

5|$|As VT74 {{returns to}} the rural {{countryside}} it bends toward the northeast for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> to Cornwall. Through this stretch the highway winds through forests and occasional farmland. VT74 straightens at an intersection with Bates Road. A connector road called North Palmer Road merges with VT74 shortly afterward. VT74 winds again for a stretch and straightens a second time near the intersection with Elmendorf Road as it continues toward Cornwall, intersecting with several township highways and approaching increasingly residential areas. At Clark Road in Cornwall, VT74 turns to the northeast once again, passing through more forests before terminating at VT30 in Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> of Neptune from Earth, its angular {{diameter}} only {{ranges from}} 2.2 to 2.4arcseconds, {{the smallest of}} the Solar System planets.

5|$|By {{matching}} {{up these}} curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of main-sequence {{stars in the}} cluster can also be determined.

40|$|The present master’s thesis {{deals with}} Viviani’s theorem valid in an {{equilateral}} triangle and stating that <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> between any interior {{point and the}} sides equals the triangle’s altitude i. e. that <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> is constant. In the paper it is investigated whether <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> from an interior point to <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> a nonequilateral triangle also equals any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triangle’s altitudes or whether there exists any other relation between <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distances</b> and <b>the</b> altitudes. A further investigation refers to a generalisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theorem to other polygons and polyhedra. The generalisation concept on chosen examples is shown by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> various methods. To this end, convex and concave polygons (or polyhedra) are investigated separately.

5|$|Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) is {{a method}} of {{measuring}} the position of parts of the mouth. EMA uses sensor coils placed on the tongue {{and other parts of}} the mouth to measure their position and movement over time during speech and swallowing. Induction coils around the head produce an electromagnetic field that creates, or induces, a current in the sensors in the mouth. Because the current induced is inversely proportional to the cube <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance,</b> a computer is able to analyse the current produced and determine the sensor coil's location in space.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic articulography {{uses the}} {{principle}} of electromagnetic induction to measure the position and movement of various points {{in and around the}} mouth. A helmet containing electromagnetic transmitters creates a variable magnetic field by running currents through the transmitters at different frequencies. Sensor coils placed midsagittally in the mouth produce current as they move through the magnetic field inversely proportional to the cube <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> from the transmitters. The current induced alternates at the same frequency as the transmitter coil and the composite signal can be separated out to determine the distance from each individual coil, thus determining the position of the sensor in space.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, {{approximately}} a fifth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> that the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity {{has not been}} confirmed. There are currently two models for its orbit, a circular one like Earth's, and an eccentric one like Mercury's.

Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long.|$|E

5|$|In 1943, Walter Baade was {{the first}} person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy. Baade {{identified}} two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II. This nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere. (The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.) Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.|$|E
5|$|In Fig. 1, a body {{is moving}} along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S.

5|$|In the {{historically}} very important case where MN in Fig. 1 {{was part of}} an ellipse and S was one of its foci, Newton showed in Proposition 11 that the limit QR / QT2 was constant at each point on the curve so that the force on the body directed towards the fixed point S varied inversely as the square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> SP.|$|E

Foreign military personnel were restricted from approaching the border to avoid clashes or other unwanted incidents.

5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an important first step to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> to the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to}} the Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E
