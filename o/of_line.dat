5|$|By 20:00, Scheer {{ordered the}} German line to {{complete}} a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold {{and was forced to}} haul out <b>of</b> <b>line</b> to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out <b>of</b> <b>line</b> and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the German line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship {{from the rear of the}} German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.|$|E

5|$|The Grorud and Furuset Line head {{northeast}} into Groruddalen, {{while the}} other two eastern branches head south into Nordstrand. On the west side, the Holmenkoll and Sognsvann Line cover the northern boroughs of Oslo, along with the Ring Line that connects the northeastern and northwestern parts of town. The Kolsås and Røa Line reach deep into the neighbouring municipality of Bærum. All the lines run through the Common Tunnel before reaching out to different lines, or into the Ring. All lines have a base service of four trains per hour while line 2 and the eastern section <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 3 have eight trains per hour weekdays 7–19. The eastern section <b>of</b> <b>line</b> 2 also has eight trains per hour Saturdays 10–19. A reduced half-hourly service operates on all lines during early weekend mornings. Trains run from about 05:00 (06:00 at weekends) to 01:00 the next morning.|$|E
30|$|The average burden rate <b>of</b> <b>lines</b> {{is defined}} as the ratio of the total amount of {{electricity}} to the rated capacity <b>of</b> the <b>lines,</b> which can directly reflect the utilization level <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> capacities in distribution networks.

5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece <b>of</b> <b>line</b> knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow of the ship and the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|A ship of {{the line}} was a large, unarmored wooden sailing ship which mounted a battery of up to 120 smoothbore guns and carronades. The ship {{of the line}} {{developed}} gradually over centuries and, apart from growing in size, it changed little between the adoption <b>of</b> <b>line</b> of battle tactics in the early 17th century {{and the end of}} the sailing battleship's heyday in the 1830s.
