5|$|This {{machine was}} on exhibit in the 1960s at Bellm's Cars <b>of</b> <b>Yesterday</b> in Sarasota, Florida. An 1894 Roper {{velocipede}} was lent from the R. J. Boudeman family collection to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum's 2001 expansion, Guggenheim Las Vegas, where The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition {{was the only}} show there until the expansion closed in 2003. It was the fourth venue for the motorcycle design show which had first opened at the Guggenheim New York in 1998, where the Michaux-Perreaux velocipede {{had been the first}} machine viewers saw upon entering the rotunda of the museum. Later, the Boudeman Roper velocipede was on view at the 2011 Deeley Motorcycle Exhibition in Vancouver. An 1894 Roper was offered for auction in January 2012, with a claimed high bid of $425,000.|$|E

25|$|What {{he has got}} to {{understand}} is that we were speaking the truth for 23 years and apologies have only started to come today from them because <b>of</b> <b>yesterday.</b> It's too little, too late.

25|$|In 1962, Eugen Relgis visited Israel and Jerusalem, {{tightening}} his {{links with}} the Romanian Israeli community, including the Menora Association and Rabbi David Șafran. It was in Israel that Relgis published another volume of memoirs, in his native Romanian language: Mărturii de ieri și de azi ("Testimonies <b>of</b> <b>Yesterday</b> and Today"). In 1972, he was made an honorary staff member of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|From {{a social}} and {{cultural}} standpoint, the Old Casino is significant in that it expresses to this day the lifestyle of the area's wealthy families during {{the early decades of}} the 20th century. It is a reminder of how they lived and how World War II changed that lifestyle for ever. The lavish second floor ballroom was extensively used prior to WWII as the de facto meeting place for the most wealthy and influential families in Ponce and Puerto Rico. The Casino is associated with the social club that made the structure come to life, a club that has ceased to exist as today's way of life have pushed aside the lifestyle of the aristocracy <b>of</b> <b>yesterday.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is daytime {{again and}} Vladimir begins singing a {{recursive}} round {{about the death}} of a dog, but twice forgets the lyrics as he sings. Again, Estragon claims to have been beaten last night, despite no apparent injury. Vladimir comments that the formerly bare tree now has leaves and tries to confirm his recollections <b>of</b> <b>yesterday</b> against Estragon's extremely vague, unreliable memory. Vladimir then triumphantly produces evidence of the previous day's events by showing Estragon the wound from when Lucky kicked him. Noticing Estragon's barefootedness, they also discover his previously forsaken boots nearby, which Estragon insists are not his, although they fit him perfectly. With no carrots left, Vladimir is turned down in offering Estragon a turnip or a radish. He then sings Estragon to sleep with a lullaby before noticing further evidence to confirm his memory: Lucky's hat still lies on the ground. This leads to his waking Estragon and involving him in a frenetic hat-swapping scene. The two then wait again for Godot, while distracting themselves by playfully imitating Pozzo and Lucky, firing insults at each other and then making up, and attempting some fitness routinesall of which fail miserably and end quickly.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the ongoing}} {{proceedings}} relating to whether Thomas should be acquitted or retried, neither the Government of Australia nor the Opposition commented immediately after the case, although Treasurer Peter Costello later said that anti-terrorism legislation {{did not need to}} be strengthened in the wake of the case, and Opposition foreign affairs spokesperson Kevin Rudd said that [...] "What is plain from the events <b>of</b> <b>yesterday</b> is that the Government has bungled– and bungled badly– the prosecution of this case." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{release from}} prison, Kesselring protested {{against what he}} {{regarded}} as the [...] "unjustly smirched reputation of the German soldier". In November 1953, testifying at a war crimes trial, he warned that [...] "there won't be any volunteers for the new German army if the German government continues to try German soldiers for acts committed in World War II". He enthusiastically supported the European Defence Community, and suggested that the [...] "war opponents <b>of</b> <b>yesterday</b> must become the peace comrades and friends of tomorrow". On the other hand, he also declared that he found [...] "astonishing" [...] those who believe [...] "that we must revise our ideas in accordance with democratic principles ... That is more than I can take." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the midst}} of our short {{conversation}} <b>of</b> <b>yesterday,</b> & still more pleasant than short, you expressed a wish to receive a sketch in prose of the thing we desired. I am sure your kindness renders it a duty incumbent on me in return, to afford you every facility in my power. I therefore inclose two scribbles with which I would not otherwise have troubled you. That in small writing is the production of my daughter in her eleventh year, & is strictly modelled, as ar as [...] her infant talents would allow, on Dibdin's song. This may answer {{the purpose of a}} prose sketch. The other is written by a young man of twenty. It is rather unintelligible: but the two first two stanzas may afford you a hint respecting the first two designs.|$|E
500|$|University {{lecturer}} Zaini Ujang viewed Yesterday and Todays comparisons as {{criticisms of}} society, putting forth {{the question of}} whether people should accept [...] "development" [...] to simply mean discarding the old for the new without regards to its value. [...] Professor Fuziah of the National University of Malaysia interpreted the book's ending as a wakeup call to parents, questioning them if they should deny their children a more relaxed childhood. [...] Lent agreed, saying that Lat had asserted the theme from the start, showing him and his childhood friends [...] "not in a hurry to grow up". [...] Redza hinted that Lat's other goal was to point out the [...] "dehumanising environment" [...] that Malaysian urban children are growing up in. [...] A Japanese edition <b>of</b> <b>Yesterday</b> and Today was published by Berita Publishing in 1998.|$|E
500|$|According to Alfred Henry Lewis of Hearst's Journal, {{writing on}} January12, [...] "The {{opposition}} to Hanna was utterly disorganized by the history <b>of</b> <b>yesterday,</b> and practically speaking, went into joint session today somewhat like a routed army might take up some battle {{it could not}} avoid." [...] The 73men pledged to Hanna went to the State House together {{under the protection of}} Hanna adherents. [...] Croly related: [...] "Armed guards were stationed at every important point. [...] The State House was filled with desperate and determined men." [...] In the joint convention, held in the House Chamber, the journals of the two houses were read, detailing the tallies from the previous day. [...] The clerks of the two houses then called the rolls. The only votes to change were those which had gone to Warner and Wiley; both were switched to McKisson. [...] Representative Aquila Wiley was the last person to vote; with Hanna having already received the 73ballots he needed for election, Wiley maintained his vote for Lentz. [...] The final tally, both for the short and long term was Hanna73, McKisson70, and Lentz1. [...] Before the joint convention adjourned, Hanna appeared before it, thanking the legislators for his election. [...] He stated, [...] "I doubly thank you because under the circumstances it comes to me as an assurance of your confidence".|$|E

500|$|The entire 13th Red Army stalled {{because of}} its defeat at Radzymin. After that success the Poles slowly but {{steadily}} pushed the Soviets back beyond {{the first line of}} defences that had been overrun several days before. By the end of 16 August, the 28th and 30th Infantry Regiments manned most of the trench line along the Rządza River, near the village of Dybów. Although initially the Russian command wanted to use the outskirts of Radzymin as a pivot for a tactical withdrawal to the Radzymin–Brześć line, the following day the Soviet commander ordered a full retreat towards Wyszków and later Grodno. Meanwhile, Piłsudski's 4th Army outflanked the surprised Russians and went as far north as the left wing of Nikolai Sollogub's 16th Red Army, which at that time was constantly pressured from the front by the 10th and 15th divisions. This made existing Russian plans obsolete, and Polish forces started a pursuit that ended with the victorious Battle of the Niemen River in September. On the day of Polish victory the Soviets issued a propaganda poster in Moscow proclaiming: [...] "Warsaw has fallen. With it the Poland <b>of</b> <b>yesterday</b> became history. It is nothing but a legend now while the truth of today is the red reality. Long live the Soviets! Long live the invincible Red Army!" ...|$|E
500|$|On 8 October Mahler was {{formally}} appointed to succeed Jahn as the Hofoper's director. His first production {{in his new}} office was Smetana's Czech nationalist opera Dalibor, with a reconstituted finale that left the hero Dalibor alive. This production caused anger among the more extreme Viennese German nationalists, who accused Mahler of [...] "fraternising with the anti-dynastic, inferior Czech nation." [...] The Austrian author Stefan Zweig, in his memoirs The World <b>of</b> <b>Yesterday</b> (1942), described Mahler's appointment {{as an example of}} the Viennese public's general distrust of young artists: [...] "Once, when an amazing exception occurred and Gustav Mahler was named director of the Court Opera at thirty-eight years old, a frightened murmur and astonishment ran through Vienna, because someone had entrusted the highest institute of art to 'such a young person' ... This suspicion—that all young people were 'not very reliable'—ran through all circles at that time." [...] Zweig also wrote that [...] "to have seen Gustav Mahler on the street [...] was an event that one would proudly report to his comrades the next morning as it if were a personal triumph." [...] During Mahler's tenure a total of 33new operas were introduced to the Hofoper; a further 55 were new or totally revamped productions. However, a proposal to stage Richard Strauss's controversial opera Salome in 1905 was rejected by the Viennese censors.|$|E
500|$|In the UK, where [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] was the favoured side, {{the single}} became the best-selling song of 1966, after topping the {{national}} chart {{for four weeks}} during August and September. On Record Retailers LPs chart (later the UK Albums Chart), Revolver entered at number 1 and stayed there for seven weeks during its 34-week run in the top 40. Author Howard Sounes writes that, amid the fine summer weather and England's win in the World Cup, Revolver provided the [...] "soundtrack ... of the season". In America, Capitol were wary of the religious references in [...] "Eleanor Rigby", given the ongoing controversy, and instead pushed [...] "Yellow Submarine". The latter peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it, in Gould's description, [...] "the first 'designated' Beatles single since 1963" [...] not to top that chart. On the Billboard Top LPs chart, Revolver hit number 1 on 10 September, {{a week after the}} end <b>of</b> <b>Yesterday</b> and Todays five-week run at the top. Revolver remained at number 1 there for six weeks. The album had sold 1,187,869 copies in the US by 31 December 1966 and 1,725,276 copies {{by the end of the}} decade. For the only year between 1963 and 1969, the Beatles failed to win the NME readers' best-band poll, losing to the Beach Boys, while Revolver and Pet Sounds were jointly recognised as the magazine's [...] "Album of the Year". In March 1967, Revolver was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. Voormann's cover design won the Grammy for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts.|$|E
