40|$|Variance {{component}} estimation (VCE) {{is applied}} to precise orbit determination (POD) of the ERS- 2 satellite. Twenty 5 -day long arcs in the early three months in 1998 were calculated using the SLR and PRARE data. In the data the adjacent <b>arcs</b> <b>overlap</b> for two days except the intervals for orbit maneuver. The effect of WE orbit determination on the calculation is investigated by an analysis of residuals and comparison of <b>overlapping</b> <b>arcs,</b> and the mean a posteriori standard deviation of each group of measured residuals is given. It is shown by the residuals analysis that the fitting of the measurements is significantly improved by VCD. However, according to Abbey criterion, VCD {{is not able to}} eliminate the systematic errors due to errors in the dynamic and geometric models. The results of the comparison of the <b>overlapping</b> <b>arcs</b> show that (1) WE reduces the mean range deviation of <b>overlapping</b> <b>arcs,</b> especially where there are obviously unreasonable deviations, so that the orbit obtained has a more uniform precision; (2) By using VCE, adjacent arcs tend to close up and this is more apparent in the transverse direction. From the mean a posteriori standard error of each group of measurements, {{it can be seen that}} as far as the single normal point measurement is concerned, the data of some SLR stations are more important than other measurements in POD calculation. Generally speaking, determination of weighting by using VCE is more reasonable than by using initial standard deviation...|$|R

40|$|The precise orbit {{determination}} (POD) for BeiDou satellites is usually {{limited by the}} insufficient quantity and poor distribution of ground tracking stations. To cope with this problem, this study used the GPS and BeiDou joint POD method based on Chinese national continuous operating reference stations (CNCORS) and IGS/MGEX stations. The {{results show that the}} 3 D RMS of the differences of <b>overlapping</b> <b>arcs</b> is better than 22 cm for geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites and better than 10 cm for inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites. The radial RMS is better than 2 cm for all three types of BeiDou satellites. The results of satellite laser ranging (SLR) residuals show that the RMS of the IGSO and MEO satellites is better than 5 cm, whereas the GEO satellite has a systematic bias. This study investigates the contributions of CNCORS to the POD of BeiDou satellites. The results show that after the incorporation of CNCORS, the precision of <b>overlapping</b> <b>arcs</b> of the GEO, IGSO, and MEO satellites is improved by 15. 5 %, 57. 5 %, and 5. 3 %, respectively. In accordance with the improvement in the precision of <b>overlapping</b> <b>arcs,</b> the accuracy of the IGSO and MEO satellites assessed by the SLR is improved by 30. 1 % and 4. 8 %, respectively.
