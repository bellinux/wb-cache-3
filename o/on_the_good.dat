5|$|The {{conversion}} {{brought the}} score to 41–26 with 11:29 {{remaining in the}} game. Florida State received the post-touchdown kickoff, then benefited from a 10-yard holding penalty against Virginia Tech. Three subsequent plays failed to gain another first down, however, and on fourth down, a pass by Manuel was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Davon Morgan {{and returned to the}} Florida State 34-yard line. With 9:29 remaining, Virginia Tech's offense entered the game. The Hokies went three-and-out, but capitalized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> starting field position by kicking a 43-yard field goal that increased their lead to 44–26.|$|E
5|$|Xenophon {{mentions}} Aspasia {{twice in}} his Socratic writings: in Memorabilia and in Oeconomicus. In both cases her advice is recommended to Critobulus by Socrates. In Memorabilia Socrates quotes Aspasia {{as saying that}} the matchmaker should report truthfully <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> characteristics of the man. In Oeconomicus Socrates defers to Aspasia as more knowledgeable about household management and the economic partnership between husband and wife.|$|E

5|$|After 9.Be2 0-0 10.0-0 Black {{can avoid}} the {{immediate}} exchange of his Bb4 against the Nd2 in several ways. The first one, resurrected and elaborated by the grandmaster Pavel Blatny, is to exchange the Bb4 for the Bf4. This can be achieved via 10...Ng6 11.Bg3 (11.Bxc7?? d6 loses a piece) 11...Bd6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6. White still has possibilities to play for an advantage due to his more advanced development, his space advantage on the queenside and the possibility to install his knight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> square d5. Taylor considers this Black's best line, stating that Black has not given White the bishop pair, nor weakened his pawn structure, and {{should be able to}} gradually equalize.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the opening kickoff, Ball State's first drive stalled, and it ultimately went three-and-out. Their punter, Kyle Schmidt, managed only 24 {{yards on the}} punt, and gave Arkansas State the ball at Ball State's 36-yard line. Arkansas State failed to capitalize <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> field position, however, missing a 34-yard field goal attempt. Subsequently, the teams exchanged punts. After being pinned at their own 11-yard line, the Cardinals embarked on a 14-play, 89-yard drive that featured six rushes by Jahwan Edwards {{for a total of}} 44 yards, including one 22-yard rush. Also on the drive, Keith Wenning completed four of five passes, three of which were to Willie Snead, including a 9-yard touchdown pass that was the first score of the game. At the end of the quarter, the Red Wolves had just concluded a drive, that had crossed into Ball State's territory before a punt that was downed inside the 5-yard line. On that drive, Fredi Knighten replaced Adam Kennedy at quarterback.|$|E
5|$|Fertilisation of Orchids {{is a book}} by English naturalist Charles Darwin {{published}} on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> effects of intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, On the Origin of Species, had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin—a relief from the drudgery of writing—developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.|$|E

5|$|Hitler and the Nazi Party held mass {{meetings}} and rallies in Munich and elsewhere {{during the early}} 1920s, attempting to gain supporters in a bid for political power. Inspired by Benito Mussolini's March on Rome, the Nazis attempted to seize power on 8–9 November 1923 in a failed coup known as the Beer Hall Putsch. Göring, who was with Hitler heading up the march to the War Ministry, {{was shot in the}} leg. Fourteen Nazis and four policemen were killed; many top Nazis, including Hitler, were arrested. With Carin's help, Göring was smuggled to Innsbruck, where he received surgery and was given morphine for the pain. He remained in hospital until 24 December. This was the beginning of his morphine addiction, which lasted until his imprisonment at Nuremberg. Meanwhile, the authorities in Munich declared Göring a wanted man. The Görings—acutely short of funds and reliant <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> will of Nazi sympathizers abroad—moved from Austria to Venice. In May 1924 they visited Rome, via Florence and Siena. Göring met Mussolini, who expressed an interest in meeting Hitler, who was by then in prison.|$|E

Afterwards, the band flew home to Los Angeles, where Patrick Wilson and Matt Sharp made a promotional {{appearance on the}} nationally syndicated radio show Modern Rock Live {{in an attempt to}} improve the album's standing on the US album charts. A few days later, on November 1, Weezer launched its tour of North America at the Ventura Theatre in Ventura, California. On November 6, Weezer performed an acoustic set at Shorecrest High School in Seattle due to a contest won by a student. A few of the songs performed at the acoustic set were released in 1997 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Life EP. Weezer continued to tour until Christmas 1996.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials {{who entered}} civil service through {{examinations}} acted as executive officials {{to a much}} larger body of non-ranked personnel called lesser functionaries. They outnumbered officials by four to one; Charles Hucker estimates that they were {{perhaps as many as}} 100,000 throughout the empire. These lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies. Yet they {{should not be confused with}} lowly lictors, runners, and bearers; lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank. The one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> service and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries.|$|E

5|$|This was {{followed}} on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this {{mission was to}} achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines {{in the second and}} third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men, cancelling a third unmanned test.|$|E
5|$|After the Tigers' {{tied the}} game 17–17 on a 41-yard Colby Delahoussaye field goal {{to open the}} second half, the Crimson Tide went on their first of three {{consecutive}} touchdown drives. Their first touchdown came on a four-yard T. J. Yeldon run that capped a 14 play, 79-yard drive that included a successful fake punt. On their next possession, Yeldon scored on a one-yard touchdown run that extended Alabama's lead to 31–17. Odell Beckham Jr. then returned the kickoff that ensued 82-yards to the Crimson Tide 18-yard line. However, the offense was unable to capitalize <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> field position as the Alabama defense forced a turnover on downs. The Crimson Tide then drove 78 yards in eight plays, capping the drive with a three-yard McCarron touchdown pass to Jalston Fowler that made the score 38–17. The Alabama defense then closed the game with three consecutive sacks of Mettenberger, winning 38–17. For his 12 tackle performance, C. J. Mosley was recognized as both the SEC Defensive Player of the Week and as the Lott IMPACT National Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 48–25–5.|$|E
5|$|Starting in {{a neutral}} position, Karma can reach up to Hero <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> side or Infamous on the Evil side. Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, will affect the Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E

5000|$|The {{simplest}} {{missing trader}} fraud {{is where a}} fraudster imports some <b>goods.</b> <b>The</b> <b>goods</b> were zero-rated {{in the country of}} origin, and VAT <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> should be paid in the country where they have been imported. After importing, the fraudster sells <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> to another trader charging the price of <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> plus VAT, but doesn't pass <b>on</b> <b>the</b> VAT to the Government. He becomes a [...] "missing trader". The buyer which has paid the VAT to the fraudster, can deduct the same VAT amount on his VAT return. Afterwards, <b>the</b> same <b>goods</b> will be zero-rated for export. This way, the Government has lost the entire VAT that should be paid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>goods,</b> rather than <b>the</b> fraction of it that would be paid for just one stage of the production process. This situation, where <b>the</b> <b>goods</b> are made available for consumers in the importer's home market is often known as 'acquisition fraud'.|$|R

It is shown that the optimal domestic response to a foreign production subsidy is a partially countervailing tariff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intermediate and final goods. Retaliation with countervailing tariffs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intermediate and final <b>goods</b> deters <b>the</b> foreign country from subsidizing its intermediate-good production. In contrast, retaliation with only a countervailing tariff <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intermediate <b>good</b> fails to deter foreign subsidization...|$|R
