5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative in the terms <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of}} the Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|Krishna-related {{literature}} {{such as the}} Bhagavata Purana accords {{a metaphysical}} significance to the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of Krishna Lila is an act <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> the dharma in the text, {{as a form of}} para bhakti (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.|$|E

5|$|The Day of Reconciliation is {{a public}} holiday in South Africa held {{annually}} on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1994 {{after the end of}} apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity for the country. The date was chosen because it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures. The government chose a meaningful date for both ethnic groups because they recognize the need for racial harmony. The celebration of the Day of Reconciliation can take the form <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> past history, recognizing veteran's contributions, marching and other festivities.|$|E

5|$|It is a {{tradition}} within the Australian Army for soldiers' recreational clubs on military bases to be named after a particular recipient of the Victoria Cross. Australia has a unique means <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> recipients of the Victoria Cross. Remembrance Drive is a path through city streets and highways linking Sydney and Canberra. Trees were planted in February 1954 by Queen Elizabeth II in a park near Sydney Harbour and at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, marking {{either end of the}} route, with various plantations along the roadsides in memory of the fallen. Beginning in 1995, 23 rest stop memorials named for Australian recipients of the VC from World War II onwards have been sited along the route, providing picnic facilities and public amenities to encourage drivers to take a break on long drives. 23 of the 26 memorial sites have been dedicated, with a further three reserved for the surviving VC recipients, including two of the newer Victoria Cross for Australia awards. Edward Kenna, VC, was honoured with the most recent rest stop on 16 August 2012, having died in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Tulving has seminally defined {{three key}} {{properties}} of episodic memory recollection. These are a subjective {{sense of time}} (or mental time travel), connection to the self, and autonoetic consciousness. Autonoetic consciousness refers to {{a special kind of}} consciousness that accompanies the act <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> which enables an individual {{to be aware of the}} self in a subjective time. Aside from Tulving, others named the important aspects of recollection which includes visual imagery, narrative structure, retrieval of semantic information and the feelings of familiarity.|$|E
25|$|Diwali {{has special}} {{significance}} in Jainism. Mahavira, {{the last of}} the Tirthankar of this era, attained Nirvana on this day at Pavapuri on 15 October 527 BCE, on Kartik Krishna Amavasya. According to the Kalpasutra by Acharya Bhadrabahu, 3rd century BC, many gods were present there, illuminating the darkness. Therefore, Jains celebrate Diwali as a day <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> Mahavira. On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Mahavira in all Jain temples all across the world. Gautam Gandhar Swami, the chief disciple of Mahavira achieved omniscience(Kevala Gyan) later the same day.|$|E

25|$|Yashovijaya {{was born}} in a village called Kanoda in the Mehsana {{district}} in Gujarat in 1624 CE. Some sources place his year of birth as 1608 CE. His childhood name was Jasha. He belonged to the endogamous group of Oswal Jains. He lost his father when he was very young and consequently he was brought up by his mother. The inclination towards religious life was inculcated by his mother, who often used to take him to Jain upashrayas. Young Yashovijaya attracted attention of Jain monk Nayavijayaji who was impressed by his impressive memory feat <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> the Bhaktamara Stotra at a very young age.|$|E
25|$|The reminiscence bump {{has been}} studied cross-culturally and has been {{observed}} in various cultural backgrounds and experiences. It {{is important to consider}} that the process <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> occurs in the context of culture, and memories found within the reminiscence bump are congruent with the culture's goals, values, and belief systems. The age of occurrence of the reminiscence bump is culturally influenced and reflects the age at which a culture identifies individuals as adults. In Western societies the reminiscence bump corresponds with adolescence and early adulthood, approximately from the ages of 10 to 30. In Asian cultures the reminiscence bump appears later than in Western cultures because adulthood may not be reached until 30.|$|E
25|$|A {{parallel}} {{phenomenon has}} appeared involving {{the increased use}} of input methods to write Chinese characters and the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> such a large set of characters. The use of word processors allows the user to write using characters that the user does not remember how to write by hand. This resulted in the reappearance in the 1980s in Japan of complex older characters which had been removed from the official lists. The number of characters available for use on a word processor far exceeds the number of characters a person can readily remember how to write by hand. While many have blamed the use of input methods for difficulty remembering how to write the characters by hand, widespread use of input methods may be responsible for a reversal in the decline of kanji use in Japan.|$|E

25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when someone asks you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Sorge's {{reputation}} in West Germany in the 1950s {{was a highly}} negative one, with Sorge depicted as a traitor working for the Soviet Union {{who was responsible for}} the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Wehrmacht soldiers in the winter of 1941-42. The 1950s were a transition moment in the German memory of Nazi Germany as those Germans who had supported the Third Reich sought a version of history that presented them as victims rather than as followers of Hitler, portrayed Nazism as an aberration in German history that had no connections to traditional Prussian values, portrayed the Wehrmacht as an honorable fighting force that had nothing to do with the Holocaust, and presented the Soviets as guilty of crimes that even more horrific than those committed by the Nazis. Given this way <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> the Nazi past in the 1950s, Operation Barbarossa and Germany's war in the East were seen as a heroic and legitimate war against the Soviet Union that Germans should not be ashamed of.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} terms, collective memory {{can be understood}} as the memory of a group of people, and is usually associated with the passing of that memory from generation to generation. However, there are many nuances to this idea; it must also be considered in terms of the processes <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> and forgetting events. Thus, when a typical emotional event is socially shared and propagates to perhaps 50 other people, that event becomes a collective memory for that group or community of people. When the emotional event is particularly intense, the event would be expected to undergo an even larger diffusion. Furthermore, the more intense the emotional event is, the more rapid the diffusion should be and should reach more people in a shorter amount of time. This is especially true for events that are shared via mass media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, internet, etc. In this case, the collective memory is no longer confined to a local population, but instead can become that of a regional, national, or even international population. Besides the propagation of a single person’s emotional event, many people can simultaneously experience a single national emotional event, such as the disappearing of an important person. Such an event also becomes part of a collectively shared memory. However, {{it must be noted that}} each person still has their own personal memory of the event, such as where they were when they experienced the event, what they were doing, etc.|$|E

25|$|Temporal memory {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>remembering</b> when {{a specific}} memory has occurred. In a study participants {{were placed in}} 4 groups; two control groups either given caffeine or a placebo and two groups that were sleep deprived for 36 hours either given caffeine or a placebo. The task used to measure temporal memory consisted of discriminating between recent and less recent face presentations. A set of twelve unfamiliar faces were presented sequentially every 10 seconds. A self-ordered pointing task was used afterwards for 5 minutes to prevent rehearsal and to keep tired participants occupied. This required them to mark any new items seen (either nouns or abstract shapes) presented on 12 sheets. A second set was presented, followed by another self-ordered pointing task, and then a random sequence of 48 faces either containing previously presented faces or new ones were shown to the participant. They {{were asked if they}} recognized the faces and whether they were from the first or second set. Results indicate that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but does produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set). Caffeine was found to have a greater effect on the sleep deprived group as compared to the placebo group deprived of sleep but still performed worse than both control groups. Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Brain imaging studies of those sleep deprived found that the greatest reduction in metabolic rate is in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E
