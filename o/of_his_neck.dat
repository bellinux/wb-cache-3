5|$|Agent Doggett {{returns home}} after work and finds Absalom {{waiting for him}} with a gun. Absalom demands Doggett show the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> to confirm that Doggett is still himself. He tells Doggett that the man killed at the White House, Howard Salt, died for what he knew about an alien invasion. Absalom duct tapes his gun to Doggett's back in a plan to get Salt's {{information}} with Doggett used as a hostage. The two attempt to sneak into the census bureau's database; Absalom claims that the census bureau had data which showed the aliens were already here. Unfortunately, the plan fails because of an X-ray scanner detecting the gun. Security shoots Absalom through the head despite his use of Doggett as a body shield.|$|E

5|$|Wrecking and {{smuggling}} supplemented local incomes. In 1743 John Roberts and Huw Bedward from Y Rhiw {{were found}} guilty {{of the murder of}} two shipwrecked sailors on the beach at Porth Neigwl on 6 January 1742, and hanged; Jonathan Morgan had been killed by a knife thrust into the nape <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> and Edward Halesham, described as a boy, had been choked to death. A ship claimed to be from France unloaded illicit tea and brandy at Aberdaron in 1767, and attempted to sell its cargo to the locals; a Revenue cutter discovered salt being smuggled at Porth Cadlan in 1809; and a schooner en route from Guernsey to Scotland was reported to have offloaded lace, tea, brandy and gin at Y Rhiw in 1824.|$|E

5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The head and neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E
5|$|While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on {{the back}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> {{suggesting}} a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves {{that he did not}} kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway.|$|E

The fatal bullet entered through the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> severed the spinal cord, passed into his brain and exited just under the right eye, severing two sets of veins and arteries.

25|$|Throughout the night, Kilroy was {{tortured}} and sodomized. He was then led {{out to the}} field and Constanzo killed him by chopping the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> and head with a machete. His brain was then boiled on a nganga, an African metal pot that Constanzo used to stew human and animal remains. Kilroy's limbs were chopped off above his knees to facilitate his burial. A wire was inserted in his spinal cord to pull the bones out once the body decomposed. The cult members then dug a hole on the grounds and buried Kilroy's corpse.|$|E
25|$|On {{the initial}} autopsy report in 1950, doctors {{concluded}} that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible furrows {{in the skin}} beneath his chin and at the sides <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> There was no mark, however, {{at the back of}} the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.|$|E

25|$|In 1948 {{he worked}} as a doctor in Renfrew. A resident, Bill Johnston, {{recalled}} the time when, as a lad, Dr. Banda came to his home to see his father who had a nasty boil on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> His father was a respected church elder in the town. Dr. Banda took a small bottle from his case, asked for some boiling water and poured some into the bottle. Emptying the water out, he quickly placed the open end on Bill's father's boil where of course it stuck as the steam condensed. With a cry of anguish, his father leapt to his feet and chased the doctor round the kitchen table with the bottle fastened to his neck. Bill was dumbfounded at hearing his father use language that he had never heard before. Note, however, that this account conflicts with other sources, notably Philip Short's biography which cites a letter from Banda stating that he moved to London in 1945, two months after the armistice, buying a practice in the North London suburb of Harlesden. Initially, he stayed at Mrs. French's house, with Mr. French joining them in October 1945. Later, he bought his own house in Brondesbury Park. Mrs. French moved in as his housekeeper, together with her husband. According to other accounts, he lodged in a hotel, The Conway Court, in Paddington run by Mrs Janet Evans. Reportedly, he avoided returning to Nyasaland for fear that his new-found financial resources would be consumed by his extended family back home.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match that aired, Raw's Edge, Randy Orton, and Jeff Hardy Smackdown!'s King Booker (with Queen Sharmell), Mr. Kennedy, Matt Hardy and Dave Finlay and ECW's CM Punk {{competed in the}} third annual Money in the Bank ladder match. The match {{featured}} many notable spots, including points where Edge performed the Spear on all the other opponents, followed by Randy Orton doing the same by leveling {{many of the participants}} with his RKO later in the match. Mr. Kennedy missed a Kenton Bomb and landed on a ladder on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>neck.</b> He instead received a Swanton Bomb from Jeff Hardy. Several dangerous ladder spots were also featured, including Orton performing an RKO on CM Punk whilst standing on the ladder, and King Booker performing his Book End to Orton {{from the top of the}} ladder as well. Midway through the match, Jeff Hardy climbed a fifteen-foot-high ladder inside the ring and on his brother, Matt Hardy's urging, he performed a leg drop off of that ladder onto Edge, who was lying prone on another ladder outside the ring, set-up on the ring apron and the barricade. Due to the impact, the ladder on which Edge was placed, broke in half and he, along with Jeff, were severely injured. They were carried off on stretchers by the paramedics. Later, when Booker was about to retrieve the contract briefcase, Matt Hardy held Booker's wife, Queen Sharmell as a hostage, threatening to perform his Twist of Fate on her. Booker went to her aid and received the Twist of Fate from Matt. Finlay fought Matt for sometime in the ring, and also performed his Celtic Cross to Matt onto a ladder. Finlay's associate Hornswoggle emerged from under the ring and attempted to retrieve the briefcase for Finlay. He was stopped by Kennedy, who performed his Green Bay Plunge on Hornswoggle. Kennedy went on to win the match, only after knocking CM Punk off a ladder by hitting him with another ladder.|$|E
