50|$|The Church <b>of</b> Our Lord <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> {{has been}} very {{influential}} among African-American Pentecostal churches, and {{has given rise to}} several spin-off bodies. The first major break-away was in 1930, when Sherrod C. Johnson created a rival organization, the Church <b>of</b> the Lord <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>of</b> the Apostolic Faith, through which he challenged Lawson's stance on practical holiness. The most important fracture in the church's history, though, came in 1957 when Smallwood E. Williams led about 70 churches away to form the Bible Way Church <b>of</b> Our Lord <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ.</b> Other organizations that were born from or splintered from this church body include the Progressive Church <b>of</b> Our Lord <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ,</b> the Refuge Temple Assembly of Yahweh, the Evangelistic Churches of Christ, a host of small organizations, and independent churches of varying sizes. Furthermore, there have been splits in many of the offshoot churches: for example, the church founded by Sherrod C. Johnson (Church <b>of</b> the Lord <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>of</b> the Apostolic Faith, also referred to as CLJC) has splintered and re-emerged as the Holy Temple Church <b>of</b> the Lord <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>of</b> the Apostolic Faith, the Apostolic Ministries of America, and the First Church <b>of</b> Our Lord <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ,</b> all <b>of</b> which are actively evangelizing North America, the Caribbean, Europe, and West Africa. Thus, the Church <b>of</b> our Lord <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> is the mother of a family of predominantly African-American Pentecostal Apostolic organizations.|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} church {{within this}} movement, founded in April 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith, was the Church of Christ, which was later named the Church of the Latter Day Saints. It was renamed the Church <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> of Latter Day Saints in 1838 (stylized as the Church <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>Christ</b> of Latter-day Saints in the United Kingdom), which remained its official name until Smith's death in 1844. This organization subsequently splintered into several different denominations, {{each of which}} {{claims to be the}} legitimate continuation of this original church, and most of which dispute the right of other denominations within the movement to claim this distinction.|$|E
