40|$|Current on-line {{solid-phase}} extraction methods {{combined with}} HPLC for shortening the clean-up operation are {{not suitable for}} simultaneously detecting compounds that have {{a wide variety of}} hydrophobicities. To solve these problems, we designed a new on-line sample preparation system. The system consists of an eluting pump, a mixing TEE connector, a 10 -port 2 -position valve and a solid-phase extraction precolumn. The eluate from the precolumn is diluted with a weak solvent from the HPLC at the TEE connection to load low hydrophobic compounds onto the analytical column. The proposed on-line sample preparation system was successfully applied to the simultaneous analysis of 21 pesticides in river water using LC/TOF-MS. In this method, the recoveries from river water samples were 67 to 126 % (mean 83 %), the reproducibility (CV%) was in the range from 1. 1 to 11 % (mean 5. 6 %), the calibration curve was linear in the range from 1 ppb to 500 ppb (r > 0. 999) and the detection limits (S/N = 3) were in the range from 0. 0034 ppb (daimuron) to 3. 3 ppb (<b>oxine-copper).</b> 2006 © The Japan Society for Analytical Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to select effective fungicides for the control of Fusarium head bight (FHB) of wheat. We tested fourteen commercial fungicides against FHB in the laboratory and under field. Fludioxonil FS, Fludioxonil SC, and Benomyl + Thiram WP highly inhibited the mycelial growth ofFusarium graminearum on the medium while <b>Oxine-copper</b> WP, Thiophanate-methyl WP, and Copperhydroxide WP were not effective against FHB. To verify the disease control in field condition, we selected fourfungicides such as Fludioxonil SC, Captan WP, Difenoconazole + propiconazole EC, and Metconazole SC. Their control efficacy on FHB disease severity of wheat was examined after the fungicide treatment twice(30 th April and 10 th May, 2012) in the two field locations (Iksan and Gimje). With no treatment, FHBseverity was 45 % and 33. 7 % in Gimje and Iksan, respectively. FHB disease incidence after fungicidetreatment was between 0. 3 % and 2. 2 % in Gimje, showing over 95 % FHB disease control. FHB diseaseincidence of fungicide-treated sector in Iksan showed slightly higher than Gimje but the control value offungicides exhibited 87 − 90 %. No side effect of the chemicals was observed in fungicide treatment. Theseresults showed that four fungicides were effective in the FHB disease control in wheat...|$|E
