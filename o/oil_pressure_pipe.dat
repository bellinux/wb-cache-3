50|$|In a {{preliminary}} investigation {{report of the}} engine failure of Qantas Flight QF32, released 3 December 2010, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau outlined safety actions taken already, including the issuing of a safety recommendation about potential engine problems with the Trent 900. The safety recommendation relates to a possible manufacturing issue with a misaligned counterbore in some <b>pressured</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipes,</b> {{which could lead to}} fatigue cracking, oil leakage, oil fire, and engine failure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{corridor}} of land beside {{the river is}} a conduit for many services along large parts of its length including electricity, high voltage lines, a high <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> <b>pipe</b> owned by Shell, and high volume sewage pipes. Many of the lower lying areas have been filled and are parks and sports grounds. In spite of this the river and adjacent lands are being recognised for their beauty, history, amenity, environmental value, if not also for potential for improvements.

40|$|For the {{analysis}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system with multiple reservoirs, a numerical algorithm for initializing the flow in the system is developed. This algorithm finds real hydraulic head values in junctions of a <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system by using an iterative method. Also, it determines the orientation and amount of the flow rate for an arbitrary given <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system {{and a number of}} reservoirs. By comparing the presented method with a classical three-reservoir problem, it might be said that the proposed method performs a hydraulic head correction in junctions in an inverse way. The method is implemented in the computer code developed for {{the analysis}} of an arbitrary <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> system...|$|R

Problems with the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit or the connections between it and the driver's display can cause abnormal <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> readings when <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is perfectly acceptable.|$|R

40|$|The {{basis of}} {{the design of the}} oil system of a H. V. oil filled cable circuit is {{considered}} in particular the choice of oil feed locations along the cable route. Methods are established for determining the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tank requirements and the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> response on application of step or pulse loads for typical oil sections of a single core H. V. oil filled cable circuit. These methods are applied to an existing 132 KV installation and minimum <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tankage requirements and the maximum and minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> considering various loading conditions determined. To establish the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> occurring on switching off various continuous loads are compared to that occurring on switching off load shortly after having switched on. Recommendations are made for similar circuits based on the loading condition giving the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Possible ways of verifying the theoretical methods and en electrical analogue of the oil system are considered...|$|R

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is higher}} when {{the engine is}} cold due to the {{increased}} viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert excess flow. <b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may indicate a blocked filter, blocked oil gallery or the wrong grade of <b>oil.</b> Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump.|$|R

Based on dynamic models of two-gear planetary transmission and hydraulic control system, a trajectory tracking model of <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> was built by sliding mode control method. An experiment was designed to verify the validity of hydraulic control system, through which the relationship between duty cycle of on-off valve and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> of clutch was determined. The tracking effect was analyzed by simulation. Results showed that <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> could follow well the optimal trajectory and the shift quality was effectively improved...|$|R

30|$|To sum up, {{numerous}} studies on pipe and shell have been published. However, those studies {{based on the}} engineering background of the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> of the centrifugal compressor are relatively fewer. So for the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> of the centrifugal compressor, free and forced vibration problems should be further discussed. This paper presented the study on the natural characteristics of <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> with SS-SS boundary condition using cylindrical shell model. Based on Sanders’ shell theory, the vibration differential equation was obtained by using the energy method. The displacement shape functions were assumed by beam functions in the axial direction and the trigonometric functions in the circumferential direction. The influences of length to radius ratio, thickness to radius ratio, circumferential wave number and pressure on natural characteristics were analyzed. In the end, the steady responses of the forced vibration for a specific pipe model were obtained and the modal shapes were illustrated to understand the break of the pipe. And the results would be signification {{for the design of}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>pipe</b> in the centrifugal compressor.|$|R

The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but {{the engine is}} not running, as it detects no <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> due to the oil pump not operating (the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running). It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> This tell-tale can bear the legend [...] or a pictogram of an oil can.

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} {{approach is}} carried out to investigate the dynamic behavior of the CFRP strengthened <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> subjected to impact load. In the FE analyses, Johnson-cook model is used to simulate metal subjected to large plastic strains and high strain rates, the fluid and pipe interaction is modeled by the surface-based fluid cavity to include the coupling effect between the deformation of the pipe and the internal pressure. Besides, the Hashin damage model is used to predict the damage of CFRP. The objectives of the numerical simulations are to capture the measured forming and crash history of the CFRP strengthened <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> and gain an insight into the dynamic behavior of CFRP strengthened <b>pressure</b> <b>pipes</b> subject to impact load. The effects of internal pressure and {{the thickness of the}} CFRP are investigated, providing a detailed understanding of parameter sensitivity...|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> 1) no <b>oil</b> or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|R
