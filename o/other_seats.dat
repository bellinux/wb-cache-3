5|$|However, the BC NDP {{were deeply}} unpopular within the province, {{reaching}} a low at 15% support in opinion polls {{at the time}} of Glen Clark's resignation as Premier in August 1999. With Dosanjh as leader, support had risen to 21% by August 2000. Dosanjh was consistently ranked higher personal popularity over opposition leader Gordon Campbell until the run-up to the May 16, 2001, provincial election. Dosanjh and the BC NDP knew they would not be reelected, so they concentrated their campaign to a few ridings in the Lower Mainland which were still considered competitive. Their campaign focused on the expanding economy, issues of health care and education, and Dosanjh's personal popularity over Campbell. Dosanjh conceded defeat a week before the election, but requested voters consider making the NDP a strong opposition party. After the vote, on May 16, Dosanjh lost his seat in Vancouver-Kensington along with all but two members of his Cabinet in the second-worst defeat of a sitting provincial government in Canada. The BC Liberals won all 77 <b>other</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{appointment}} of Zinsou as a civilian leader of the country, Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga tried {{to return to the}} country but were informed that their plane would be shot down if they entered Dahomey airspace; they instead flew to neighboring Togo. Zinsou, who had a history of advocacy against the policies of the military, quickly drew the ire of the military leaders by pursuing a host of policies without consultation with them. In addition, to control continued deficits, Zinsou instituted a number of austerity measures and as a result alienated unions and the urban population. The result was that on 10 December 1969, Zinsou was taken into custody by military officers organized by Kouandété and Zinsou was sent to a remote military garrison near Natitingou. Following the coup, Kouandété found {{that he did not have}} the support to rule throughout the entire military, and so instead Paul-Emile de Souza (the director of military affairs for Zinsou's government) was named the provisional head of state as the head of a three person Military directorate (with Kouandété and Colonel Benoît Sinzogan holding the <b>other</b> <b>seats).</b> The military directorate decided to release Zinsou and hold new presidential elections in 1970 without the restrictions of the 1968 elections, thus allowing Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga to run.|$|E

25|$|The Centre Party contested five {{seats at}} the 1935 state election, and its {{candidates}} placed second to the United Australia Party (UAP) in two electorates, with almost 20% of the vote.

The Centre Party is generally seen as the political extension of the remnant of the New Guard, which had decreased in popularity and influence, and, under Campbell's leadership, had become increasingly inclined towards fascism.|$|E

As the war ended, Știrbei tried to oppose Romania's cession of the Budjak to Russia, seeing it as an act of betrayal.|$|E

25|$|On November 3, 1964, the {{citizens}} of Aberdeen Township voted to change from the Township Committee form of government, in force since 1857, to operate within the Faulkner Act under the Council-Manager (Plan 3), implemented {{in its current form}} based on a direct petition as of January 1, 1990. In this Council-Manager form, all policy making power is concentrated in the council. The Mayor {{is a member of the}} Council and presides over its meetings. The Manager, appointed by the council and fully accountable to it, is the municipal chief executive and administrative official. A seven-member Township Council is elected at large for staggered, four-year terms of office in partisan elections held every in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election; four seats are up together, followed two years later by the three <b>other</b> <b>seats</b> and the mayoral seat. The mayor is directly elected, while the council selects a deputy mayor from among its members.|$|E
25|$|After serving (from 1950) as an Administrative Officer in the Colonial Services, Mara was {{nominated}} {{to one of}} five seats on the Legislative Council reserved for ethnic Fijians in 1953. (There were ten <b>other</b> <b>seats,</b> five reserved for Indians and five for Europeans and other minorities; a further sixteen members were appointed by the colonial Governor). In 1959, Mara {{was appointed to the}} Executive Council, and in 1963 was given responsibility as Leader of Government Business and Member for Natural Resources (officially an advisor to the Governor, but in reality roughly equivalent to a modern cabinet minister). In 1964, he was received into the Great Council of Chiefs, which at that time was empowered to appoint two members to the Legislative Council. In 1966, he founded the Alliance Party, which, supported overwhelmingly by the ethnic Fijian and European communities (but not by most Indo-Fijians), won a majority of the seats in the 1966 election. In preparation for independence, the United Kingdom introduced the Westminster (Cabinet) system of government to Fiji in October 1967. The Executive Council was transformed into a modern Cabinet, and its members, who had hitherto been answerable only to the colonial Governor, were made fully responsible to the legislature. Mara was named to the new position of Chief Minister.|$|E
