40|$|Analyzing {{temporal}} {{series of}} satellite data for regional scale studies demand high accuracy in calibration and precise geo-rectification at higher spatial resolution. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series of satellites provide daily observations {{for the last}} 30 years at a nominal resolution of 1. 1 km at nadir. However, complexities due to on-board malfunctions and <b>orbital</b> <b>drifts</b> with the earlier missions hinder the usage of these images at their original resolution. In this study, we developed a new method using multiple open source tools which can read level 1 B radiances, apply solar and thermal calibration to the channels, remove bow-tie effects on wider zenith angles, correct for clock drifts on earlier images and perform precise geo-rectification by automated generation and filtering of ground control points using a feature matching technique. The entire workflow is reproducible and extendable to any other geographical location. We developed a time series of brightness temperature maps from AVHRR local area coverage images covering the sub alpine lakes of Northern Italy at 1 km resolution (1986 - 2014; 28 years). For the validation of derived brightness temperatures, we extracted Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) for Lake Garda in Northern Italy and performed inter-platform (NOAA-x vs. NOAA-y) and cross-platform (NOAA-x vs. MODIS/ATSR/AATSR) comparisons. The MAE calculated over available same day observations between the pairs-NOAA- 12 / 14, NOAA- 17 / 18 and NOAA- 18 / 19 are 1. 18 K, 0. 67 K, 0. 35 K, respectively. Similarly, for cross-platform pairs, the MAE varied between 0. 5 to 1. 5 K.

The hard X-ray index {{is found to be}} uncorrelated with the radio index (non-simultaneously) measured at the same orbital and superorbital phases. In particular, the absence of an X-ray spectrum softening during the periods of negative radio index does not favor a simple interpretation of the radio index variations in terms of changes of state in a microquasar. We uncover hints for the superorbital variability in the hard X-ray flux, in phase with the superorbital modulation in soft X-rays. An <b>orbital</b> phase <b>drift</b> of radio peak flux and index along the superorbital period is observed in the radio data.

5000|$|Since 1989 Christy, {{along with}} Roy Spencer, has {{maintained}} an atmospheric temperature record derived from satellite microwave sounding unit measurements, commonly called the [...] "UAH" [...] record (see also satellite temperature record). This was once quite controversial: From {{the beginning of}} the satellite record in late 1978 into 1998 it showed a net global cooling trend, although ground measurements and instruments carried aloft by balloons showed warming in many areas. Part of the cooling trend seen by the satellites can be attributed to several years of cooler than normal temperatures and cooling caused by the eruption of the Mount Pinatubo volcano. Part of the discrepancy between the surface and atmospheric trends was resolved {{over a period of several}} years as Christy, Spencer and others identified several factors, including <b>orbital</b> <b>drift</b> and decay, that caused a net cooling bias in the data collected by the satellite instruments. Since the data correction of August 1998 (and the major La Niña Pacific Ocean warming event of the same year), data collected by satellite instruments has shown an average global warming trend in the atmosphere. From November 1978 through March 2011, Earth's atmosphere has warmed at an average rate of about 0.14 C per decade, according to the UAHuntsville satellite record.|$|E
40|$|International audiencethe {{stratosphere}} {{is expected}} to cool, {{in conjunction with the}} global warming at the surface and in the troposphere, due to the increase of greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere, and also to stratospheric ozone loss. this is already observed but the rate of cooling is not constant and there is still a debate on its amplitude. several other factors may influence the evolution of the stratospheric temperature. external forcings, like the solar variability that modulate the UV solar flux and strong volcanic eruptions injecting aerosols in the stratosphere, participate to its decadal variability. the variability of the stratospheric dynamics is also adding some complexity to the system. For instance global climate models predicts an increase of the occurrence frequency of sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events not yet confirmed by the observations. A monitoring of the stratospheric temperature evolution is crucially needed to better understand the complexity of the processes playing a role in the coupling between the stratosphere, the troposphere and the climate. the stratospheric temperature is measured at a global scale by satellite instruments; mainly microwave sounders aMsU (advanced Microwave sounding Unit) on board meteorological satellites. these sounders are very useful to provide the global overview but may suffer from biases and <b>orbital</b> <b>drifts</b> and have a poor vertical resolution in the upper stratosphere. since 2000 radio-occultation sensors, among them the Us-taiwan COsMiC constellation, provide well-resolved and accurate temperature profiles but limited to the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere. rayleigh lidars implemented within the nDaCC (network for the Detection of atmospheric Composition Change) international network measure accurately the temperature profile from the middle stratosphere to the upper mesosphere but in a very few locations. they are used climate change monitoring, dynamics studies and satellite validation. in this presentation we will present an update of the interannual variability and trends in the stratospheric temperature from aMsU, rayleigh lidar and radio- occultation measurements. similarities and differences in the temperature evolution captured by these various sensors will be evaluated. the contribution of anthropogenic and natural forcings to the observed changes will be discussed. a particular focus will be given to the role of SSW events to the stratospheric temperature evolution as a function of latitude and season...|$|R
50|$|A {{non-rotating}} body {{of planetary}} scale or larger would be pulled by gravity into a sphere. Virtually all bodies rotate, however.

Whichever hemisphere the satellite is in it is preferentially pulled slightly toward the equator. This creates a torque on the orbit.

The goals of this paper are to document the effects of variable observation time owing to <b>orbital</b> <b>drift</b> on brightness temperatures (BT) and land surface temperature (LST) calculated from them in the NOAA/NASA Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data set and to consider possible corrections for the resulting trends and discontinuities in the PAL BT data. The drift effects {{were found to be}} greater for bare ground than for vegetated land cover classes, however significant effects were found for most vegetated classes. The magnitude of the <b>orbital</b> <b>drift</b> effect for most global cover types was at least as large as the other errors that affect LST measurement. A simple empirical correction for observation time based on solar zenith angle (SZA) was used to correct the PAL BT time series following Gutman [Int. J. Remote Sens. 20 (1999 a) 3407]. The correction from this method was compared with that predicted by a physically based model and was found to differ {{in the early part of}} each satellite's duty cycle.

We find that Geographos has a thermal inertia of 340 + 140 /- 100 J m- 2 K- 1 s- 1 / 2, a roughness fraction of > 50 %, and a bulk density of 2100 + 550 /- 450 kg m- 3 when using the light-curve-derived shape model with the radar-derived maximum equatorial diameter of 5. 04 +/- 0. 07 km. It is {{also found that the}} radar observations had overestimated the z-axis in Geographos's shape model because of their near-equatorial view. This results in a poor fit to the thermal-infrared observations if its effective diameter is kept fixed in the model fitting. The thermal inertia derived for Geographos is slightly higher than the typical values for a near-Earth asteroid of its size, and its derived bulk density suggests a rubble-pile interior structure. Large uncertainties in shape model z-axes are likely to explain why radar and thermal-infrared observations sometimes give inconsistent diameter determinations for other asteroids.

40|$|Aims. We {{investigate}} the electromagnetic interaction of a relativistic stellar wind with small bodies {{in orbit around}} the star. Methods. Based on our work on the theory of Alfvén wings to relativistic winds presented in a companion paper, we estimate the force exerted by the associated current system on orbiting bodies and evaluate the resulting <b>orbital</b> <b>drift.</b> Results. This Alfvénic structure is found to have no significant influence on planets or smaller bodies orbiting a millisecond pulsar. On the timescale of millions of years, it can however affect the orbit of bodies with a diameter of 100 kilometres around standard pulsars with a period P ∼ 1 s and a magnetic field B ∼ 108 T. Kilometer-sized bodies experience drastic orbital changes on a timescale of 104 years. Key words. pulsars – exoplanets – magnetospheres 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new method for NOAA’s (Na-tional Ocean and Atmospheric Administration) <b>orbital</b> <b>drift</b> cor-rection. This method is pixel-based, and in opposition with most methods previously developed, {{does not need}} explicit knowledge of land cover. This method is applied to AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) channel information, and relies only on the additional knowledge of solar zenithal angle (SZA) and acquisition date information. In a first step, anomalies in SZA and channel time series are retrieved, and screened out for anom-alous values. Then, {{the part of the}} parameter anomaly which is explained by SZA anomaly is removed from the data, to estimate new parameter anomalies, and this iteratively until the influence of SZA anomalies is totally removed from the parameter data. This correction has been applied to bimonthly AVHRR data provided by the GIMMS group (Global Inventory Modeling and Mappin...|$|E
40|$|Finally, the Yarkovsky semimajor axis drift may be {{important}} in transporting to the main resonances {{a large number of}} bodies around 10 m in radius for which Da values of; 0. 1 AU are expected (Fig. 1 C), similar to the distances between the main Kirkwood gaps. These fragments may be removed from the main belt population faster than bodies of other sizes, and in turn this may result into longer collisional lifetimes tdis for the 100 -m objects, which would also become more mo-bile (29). Although a realistic model of the feedback effects between Yarkovsky <b>orbital</b> <b>drift</b> and collisional processing of the asteroid size distribution would be required to assess these effects, we suggest that the Yarkovsky mobility mechanism may provide a plausible explanation for the observed overabundance of bodies 10 to 100 m in diameter in the near-Earth population (18) ...|$|E
40|$|Observations made in Channel 2 (53. 74 GHz) of the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) radiometer, flown {{on-board}} sequential, sun-synchronous, polar orbiting NOAA operational satellites, {{indicate that}} the mean temperature of the atmosphere over the globe increased during the period 1980 to 1999. In this study we have minimized systematic errors in the time series introduced by the satellite <b>orbital</b> <b>drift</b> in an objective manner. This is done with the help the onboard warm black body temperature, which {{is used in the}} calibration of the MSU radiometer. The corrected MSU Channel 2 observations of the NOAA satellite series reveal that the vertically weighted global mean temperature of the atmosphere, with a peak weight near the mid-troposphere, warmed at the rate of 0. 13 K per decade (with an uncertainty of 0. 05 K per decade) during 1980 to 1999. The global warming deduced from conventional meteorological data that have been corrected for urbanization effects agrees reasonably with this satellite deuced result...|$|E
40|$|Dynamical {{resonances}} in {{the asteroid}} belt are the gateway {{for the production of}} near-Earth asteroids(1) (NEAs). To generate the observed number of NEAs, however, requires the injection of many asteroids into those resonant regions. Collisional processes have long been claimed as a possible source(1 - 3), but difficulties with that idea have led to the suggestion that <b>orbital</b> <b>drift</b> arising from the Yarkovsky effect(4 - 7) dominates the injection process(8 - 10). (The Yarkovsky effect is a force arising from differential heating the 'afternoon' side of an asteroid is warmer than the 'morning' side.) The two models predict different rotational properties of NEAs: the usual collisional theories(2) are consistent with a nearly isotropic distribution of rotation vectors, whereas the 'Yarkovsky model' predicts an excess of retrograde rotations. Here we report that the spin vectors of NEAs show a strong and statistically significant excess of retrograde rotations, quantitatively consistent with the theoretical expectations of the Yarkovsky model...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we have {{developed}} time series of global temperature from 1980 - 97 based on the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) Ch 2 (53. 74 GHz) observations taken from polar-orbiting NOAA operational satellites. In order to create these time series, systematic errors (approx. 0. 1 K) in the Ch 2 data arising from inter-satellite differences are removed objectively. On the other hand, smaller systematic errors (approx. 0. 03 K) in the data due to <b>orbital</b> <b>drift</b> of each satellite cannot be removed objectively. Such errors are expected {{to remain in the}} time series and leave an uncertainty in the inferred global temperature trend. With the help of a statistical method, the error in the MSU inferred global temperature trend resulting from orbital drifts and residual inter-satellite differences of all satellites is estimated to be 0. 06 K decade. Incorporating this error, our analysis shows that the global temperature increased at a rate of 0. 13 +/- 0. 06 K decade during 1980 - 97...|$|E

Within the context of this project, nearly ten years of TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite altimetry data (cycle 1 to 364) from the vicinity of the Gavdos Island (Crete, Greece) have been processed and analysed. The results presented here are from the application of a method that incorporates the calculation of a corrected sea surface height from the altimetry data, along-track and cross-track data interpolation because of <b>orbital</b> <b>drift,</b> near coastal error filtering, and the use of a new geoid for the area. This method was applied in order to create ten year time series of sea level and associated parameters for the area around Gavdos island.
