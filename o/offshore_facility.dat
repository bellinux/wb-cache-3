It also constructed pumps and ports for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska, and the world's largest <b>offshore</b> <b>facility</b> for natural gas {{on the island of}} Java in Indonesia. In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices. In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served {{more than half of the}} world's government-owned oil companies.|$|E

50|$|Before the Oil Pollution was enacted, <b>offshore</b> <b>facilities</b> were {{required}} to provide evidence that declared financial responsibility of $35 million. After OPA, these <b>offshore</b> <b>facilities</b> had to increase their proof of financial responsibility by 4 times and OPA's requirement of financial responsibility expanded to include facilities in state waters as well. Facilities in state waters that {{are subject to the}} $150 million requirement includes pipelines, marina fuel docks, tanks, and oil production facilities that are located in, on, or under state coastal waters, and are adjacent to inland channels, lakes, and wetlands. The most evident impact of the enactment of OPA, is on the oil producers within the Gulf of Mexico. Many <b>offshore</b> <b>facilities</b> are located in the Gulf of Mexico and in the marshes and wetlands of Louisiana. Major producers are most likely able to meet OPA's requirement of financial responsibility, however, the major oil companies within the Gulf of Mexico have exponentially withdrawled the operation of their <b>offshore</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|R

2500|$|On 26 October 2005, {{the governments}} of the United States and Japan agreed to move the {{relocation}} site for Futenma from the reef area off Henoko to the interior and coastal portions of the existing Marine base at Camp Schwab, just a few hundred meters away from the previously-planned <b>offshore</b> <b>facility.</b> One of the cited reasons for the change was to reduce the engineering challenge associated with building a runway on reefs in deep water: experts estimate that rather than the 15-plus years required to construct a new airbase at the previous reef location, the Camp Schwab plan will enable Futenma to be relocated sooner.

Raiden joins forces with Snake and later learns that they are all being manipulated by Revolver Ocelot, who has been working for the Patriots.

40|$|Abstract: Tests were {{conducted}} to analyze selected physico-chemical and microbiological parameters from samples of effluent collected from Gulf of Guinea onshore house-boat <b>facilities</b> and <b>offshore</b> oil production platforms at the discharge point to the recipient environment. Among the parameters determined included: Total chlorine, Biochemical Oxygen demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Dissolved Oxygen (DO) and Faecal coliform. The discharge loads were evaluated and monitored for eight weeks. Test {{results indicated that the}} mean value for total chlorine ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 60 mg/l for onshore and from 0. 26 to 1. 4 mg/l for offshore. The BOD 5 mean values for the onshore facilities ranged from 15. 3 to 52. 5 mg/l, for the <b>offshore</b> <b>facilities,</b> it ranged from 27. 60 to 117. 7 mg/l. The onshore result of the TSS mean values ranged from 53. 9 to 62. 4 mg/l, the <b>offshore</b> <b>facilities</b> ranged from 77. 1 to 242. 6 mg/l. The DO mean value results from the onshore facilities ranged from 3. 6 to 6. 2 mg/l and the result from the <b>offshore</b> <b>facilities</b> ranged from 4. 8 to 5. 60 mg/l. The faecal coliform for the onshore facilities had a mean value which ranged from 4. 0 to 30. 1 MPN/ 100 ml, while the <b>offshore</b> <b>facilities</b> had mean value range of 7. 4 to 42. 0 MPN/ 100 ml. Most of these results are higher than limits specified by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and an indication that the recipient environment is polluted and poses a great concern. There is therefore utmost need for further treatment before discharge for those parameters that indicated higher ranges than specified for effluent discharge...|$|R
