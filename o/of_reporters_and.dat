5|$|The Second World War brought havoc to Wearside, with Sunderland one of {{the seven}} most heavily bombed towns in the country. Despite the heavy {{shelling}} of the North East coast and River Wear, the Echo offices and printing plant escaped undamaged. The Shields Gazette, the Echo's nearest rival, was not as fortunate. Its premises in Chapter Row, South Shields, were bombed in September 1941 and, under an emergency wartime arrangement, the paper was printed on the Echo presses. The Echo continued to be published throughout the war, despite paper rationing, a lack <b>of</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> a strict censorship of photographs. The war did have one major impact on the Echo—in the form of its size. Wartime restrictions on newsprint reduced the former broadsheet to its present tabloid size, and this style has been retained ever since.|$|E

The show {{features}} a fictional depiction of the newspaper The Baltimore Sun, and in fact elements of the plot are ripped-from-the-headlines events (such as the Jayson Blair New York Times scandal) and people at the Sun. The season, according to David Simon, deals with [...] "what stories get told and what don't and {{why it is that}} things stay the same." [...] Issues such as the quest for profit, the decrease in the number <b>of</b> <b>reporters,</b> <b>and</b> the end of aspiration for news quality would all be addressed, alongside the theme of homelessness.

500|$|The Americans {{captured}} {{more than}} 36,000 Germans, and evacuated 2,000 wounded, far exceeding {{the estimate of}} 10,000 Germans given to Middleton by Patton before the operation. [...] Ramcke was captured by troops of the 8th Division, and asked the deputy division commander for his credentials. The American general pointed to the M-1 rifles being carried by his soldiers and told Ramcke that those were his credentials. Ramcke appeared at his formal surrender clean shaven and with a well-groomed Irish setter. With plenty <b>of</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> photographers documenting the occasion, Ramcke commented in English that {{he felt like a}} film star. He was soon sent to a prisoner of war camp in Clinton, Mississippi, not more than 50 miles from where Middleton was born and raised. After the war he spent time in a prison camp in England, and then was sent to France where he was tried and soon released following five total years of incarceration. He went back to Germany and entered the concrete business, continuing a correspondence with Middleton for 15 years following the war.|$|E
500|$|In May 1945, the Allied forces {{questioned}} {{banker and}} art dealer Alois Miedl regarding the newly discovered Vermeer.

He was remanded to Weteringschans prison as an alleged Nazi collaborator and plunderer of Dutch cultural property, threatened by the authorities with the death penalty. He labored over his predicament, but eventually confessed to forging paintings attributed to Vermeer and Pieter de Hooch. He exclaimed, [...] "The painting in Göring’s hands is not, as you assume, a Vermeer of Delft, but a Van Meegeren! I painted the picture!" [...] It took some time to verify this and he was detained for several months in the Headquarters of the Military Command at Herengracht 468 in Amsterdam. He painted his last forgery between July and December 1945 in the presence <b>of</b> <b>reporters</b> <b>and</b> court-appointed witnesses: Jesus among the Doctors, also called Young Christ in the Temple in the style of Vermeer. After the trial painting was finished, he was transferred to the fortress prison Blauwkapel. Van Meegeren was released from prison in January or February 1946.|$|E

The album's cover and artwork, both designed by Italian designer Riccardo Tisci, were also premiered at the session. Benjamin Meadows-Ingrim of Billboard, who attended the session, said of the previewed material, [...] "The songs were dramatic and boastful, with Jay-Z often taking the lead lyrically, and the collection showcased {{the differences between the two}} artists – Jay-Z, the technical marksman, and Kanye, the emotive chest beater." [...] On August 1, Jay-Z and West held a listening session for the album at the Rose Center for Earth and Space in New York City's American Museum of Natural History.
