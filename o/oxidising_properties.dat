40|$|Cellobiose {{dehydrogenase}} (CDH) is {{a versatile}} bioelectrocatalyst lately at focus {{due to its}} sugar <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties</b> in combination with its inherent ability for direct electron transfer communication with electrodes {{making it possible to}} be used in bioanodes in the enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs), self-powered biosensors, and biosupercapacitors. During the last 20 years, many new nanomaterials and hybrid nanocomposites have been developed and employed in combination with various oxidoreductases, such as CDH, to increase the overall performance of electrical devices (e. g. biosensors, EFCs etc.). It has also been shown that nanomaterials can be further chemically modified to facilitate electron transfer pathways between the biocomponent and electrodes. Both carbon and metal based nanomaterials and combinations thereof have been used together with CDH to improve the performance. In this review, we resume all the findings related to the influence of effective nanostructuration to improve the electron transfer communication with electrodes yielding higher sensitivity of biosensors or increasing the power output of EFC based on CDH from different sources...|$|E
40|$|Singlet oxygen has {{attracted}} great attention in physical, chemical, {{as well as}} biological studies, mainly due to its high reactivity and strong <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties.</b> In this context, hybrid nanosystems comprised of (inor- ganic) X-ray absorbing nanostructures and (organic) light-sensitive material (photosensitizers) can poten- tially overcome the limitations of visible light penetration in matter. A deep investigation of the interface of such hybrid nanosystems for X-ray induced generation of singlet oxygen is key {{to better understand the}} processes at the hybrid interface, and to control the energy transfer from inorganic to organic counter- parts, which ultimately leads to enhanced singlet oxygen generation. Here, we demonstrate that SiC/SiOx core/shell nanowires functionalized with the tetrakisIJpentafluorophenyl) porphyrin can act as a highly prom- ising and viable strategy to generate singlet oxygen, making this novel hybrid nanosystem attractive for ap- plications in photocatalysis and nanomedical applications. Using different excitation sources (i. e., electrons, visible light, and X-rays) our findings prove that SiC/SiOx core/shell nanowires show X-ray excited optical luminescence, and that optical emission of the photosensitizer is largely enhanced by the nanowires, yield- ing an efficient energy transfer. A consequent singlet oxygen production of the functionalized nanowires is demonstrated after X-ray excitation in a clinical linear accelerator. These findings will provide an insight in developing an effective route to the molecular functionalization of SiC/SiOx core/shell nanowires and their potential use as singlet oxygen generators...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the structure, bonding and pseudorotations of spirophosphoranes is presented. The use of N-chlorodiisopropylamine as a reagent for {{preparing}} spirophosphoranes was developed to {{include the use of}} amine and thiol groupings. Pseudorotations of the resulting unsymmetrical spirophosphoranes were examined and ?G* values obtained. This reaction is thought to proceed via a concerted process. Phosphoranes were also prepared by the enolisation of ?-hydroxyketones and benzhydrazide. The <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties</b> of N-chlorodlisopropylamine were used in a low temperature generation of diimide from hydrazine. A {{review of the}} chemistry of hydroxyphosphoranes is presented. The isomerie phosphates derived from o-phenylene phosphorochloridate and styrene glycol was reinvestigated and their interconversion interpreted in terms of pseudorotations of the tautomeric hydroxyphosphorane oxyanions. Other ester-hydroxyphosphorane equilibria were examined. The eclipsing action of the methyl groups in the pinacol ester displaces the equilibrium in favour of the ester. Azoxaphospholans derived from N-(2 -hydroxyethyl) ethanamide were prepared and ?G* for rotation about the N-ethanoyl bond determined. Pseudorotations of corresponding hexafluoroacetone adducts in which the N-ethanoyl group is placed equatorially have unusually low ?G* values. This is interpreted in terms of a lowering of electron density on the nitrogen atom by the carbonyl group. The hydrolysis of o-phenylene phosphorochloridte, bis-o-phenylene pyrophosphate and biscatecholhydridophosphorane are thought to involve the highly reactive o-phenylene phosphite. The synthesis of phospholans and spirophosphoranes derived from meso-butane- 2, 3 -diol is described. These compounds could not be obtained by hydrogenation of biacetyl adducts as hydrogenolysis occurred. Substitution of the chlorine atom in the o-chloranil adduct of the chlorophospholan was followed by low temperature 31 P. F. T nmr. Reaction with lithim dimethylamide and dimethylamine proceeds with a predominance of inversion of configuration about phosphorus. Sodium with a predominance of inversion of configuration about phosphorus. Sodium phenoxide and phenol/triethylamine give a near equimolar set of isomers that are able to equilibrate via hexacoordinate species. With sodium 2, 6 -dimethylphenoxide this equilibration is much slower due to the steric compression required in the hexacoordinate species...|$|E
40|$|The present paper compares three {{different}} kinds of semiconductor gas sensing materials: metal oxides (MOX), hydrogen-terminated diamond (HD), and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H). Whereas in MOX materials oxygen is the chemically reactive surface species, HD and a-Si:H are covalently bonded semiconductors with hydrogenterminated surfaces. We demonstrate that these dissimilar semiconductor materials exhibit {{the same kind of}} low-temperature gas response. This low-temperature response-mechanism is mediated by a thin layer of adsorbed water with the semiconductor materials themselves acting as pH sensors. In this adsorbate-limited state the gas sensitivity is limited to molecular species that can easily dissolve in H 2 O and subsequently undergo electrolytic dissociation. At higher temperatures, where a closed layer of adsorbed water can no longer exist, the gas response is limited by direct molecule-semiconductor interactions. In this latter mode of operation, MOX gas sensors respond to adsorbed gases according to their different <b>oxidising</b> or reducing <b>properties.</b> Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), on the other hand, exhibits a significantly different cross sensitivity profile, revealing that gas-surface interactions may largely be restricted to analyte molecules with lone-pair and electron-deficient three-centre orbitals...|$|R
40|$|Meat {{and meat}} products, which form {{a major part}} of our diet, are very {{susceptible}} to quality changes resulting from oxidative processes. Quality of fermented food products depends on the course of various physicochemical and biochemical processes. Oxidation of meat components in raw ripening products {{may be the result of}} enzymatic changes occurring as a result of activity of enzymes originating in tissues and microorganisms, as well as lipid peroxidation by free radicals. Primary and secondary products of lipid oxidation are extremely reactive and react with other components of meat, changing their physical and chemical <b>properties.</b> <b>Oxidised</b> proteins take on a yellowish, red through brown hue. Products of lipid and protein degradation create a specifi c fl avour and aroma; furthermore, toxic substances (such as biogenic amines or new substances) are formed as a result of interactions between meat components, e. g. protein-lipid or protein-protein combinations, as well as transverse bonds in protein structures. Oxidation of meat components in raw ripening products is a particularly diffi cult process. On the one hand it is essential, since the enzymatic and non-enzymatic lipid oxidation creates fl avour and aroma compounds characteristic for ripening products; on the other hand excessive amounts or transformations of those compounds may cause the fermented meat product to become a risk to health...|$|R
40|$|Ozone gas (O 3) is {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} bleaching agent due to its strong <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties</b> and less harmful to the environment. The most feasible method to generate O 3 is to connect high-voltage of several kV, high-frequency of about tens of kHz power supply across a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) chamber. Commonly, a resonant power supply with the ferrite transformer is used. However, {{the presence of the}} transformer increases the cost and footprint, while reduces the efficiency of the ozone generator. To overcome these deficiencies, this work proposes a design and implementation of an ozone power supply based on transformerless resonant converter. A standard full-bridge inverter is coupled to a resonant tank circuit, i. e. LC and LCL to achieve the required high voltage. The LCL exhibits a double resonance phenomenon resulting in very high voltage gain (above 150). Consequently, the power supply is capable of delivering sufficient potential to the chamber, even if the source voltage is below 20 V. Experimental measurements show that the efficiency of the proposed generator is 92 %, while the maximum ozone concentration achieved 8. 0 g/m 3 at a flow rate of 1. 0 L/min. This performance is much higher than the existing transformer based resonant converters. This thesis also introduces the concept of ozone generation using multiple chambers. The objective is to maintain a high O 3 concentration at high flow rates. To realise the idea, the same LCL transformerless ozone generator is used to drive three ozone chambers in parallel. The results indicate that the achieved ozone concentration is three times higher than the output of a single chamber. Furthermore, a closed loop regulation to maintain a stable and constant chamber’s output voltage is designed. Another contribution of this work is the introduction of a simple and effective method to characterise the DBD chamber parameters. Traditionally, Lissajous figures are employed to estimate the values of the chamber’s resistor and capacitor. However, this method proves unsatisfactory at high frequencies. Using the proposed method, the chamber parameters can be determined accurately at various frequencies...|$|E
40|$|High-valent iron-oxo {{species have}} been invoked as {{reactive}} intermediates in catalytic cycles of heme and nonheme enzymes. The studies presented herein are devoted {{to the formation of}} compound II model complexes, with the application of a water soluble (TMPS) FeIII(OH) porphyrin ([meso-tetrakis(2, 4, 6 -trimethyl- 3 -sulfonatophenyl) porphinato]iron(III) hydroxide) and hydrogen peroxide as oxidant, and their reactivity toward selected organic substrates. The kinetics of the reaction of H 2 O 2 with (TMPS) FeIII(OH) was studied as a function of temperature and pressure. The negative values of the activation entropy and activation volume for the formation of (TMPS) FeIV[DOUBLE BOND]O(OH) point to the overall associative nature of the process. A pH-dependence study on the formation of (TMPS) FeIV[DOUBLE BOND]O(OH) revealed a very high reactivity of OOH− toward (TMPS) FeIII(OH) in comparison to H 2 O 2. The influence of N-methylimidazole (N-MeIm) ligation on both the formation of iron(IV) -oxo species and their <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties</b> in the reactions with 4 -methoxybenzyl alcohol or 4 -methoxybenzaldehyde, was investigated in detail. Combined experimental and theoretical studies revealed that among the studied complexes, (TMPS) FeIII(H 2 O) (N-MeIm) is highly reactive toward H 2 O 2 to form the iron(IV) -oxo species, (TMPS) FeIV[DOUBLE BOND]O(N-MeIm). The latter species can also be formed in the reaction of (TMPS) FeIII(N-MeIm) 2 with H 2 O 2 or in the direct reaction of (TMPS) FeIV[DOUBLE BOND]O(OH) with N-MeIm. Interestingly, the kinetic studies involving substrate oxidation by (TMPS) FeIV[DOUBLE BOND]O(OH) and (TMPS) FeIV[DOUBLE BOND]O(N-MeIm) do not display a pronounced effect of the N-MeIm axial ligand on the reactivity of the compound II mimic in comparison to the OH− substituted analogue. Similarly, DFT computations revealed that the presence of an axial ligand (OH− or N-MeIm) in the trans position to the oxo group in the iron(IV) -oxo species does not significantly affect the activation barriers calculated for C[BOND]H dehydrogenation of the selected organic substrates...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} (H 2 O 2) {{is widely}} used in many biological systems and industrial processes in the textile, food, pharmaceutical and clinical sectors. The importance of hydrogen peroxide is related to its unique <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties</b> as well as decomposition, which plays {{a very important role}} in the manufacture of industrial water electrolysers, secondary metal-air batteries and fuel cells. Therefore, the accurate and rapid determination of H 2 O 2 is extremely important. Electrochemical H 2 O 2 sensors are shown to be an appropriate alternative to the traditional methods (titrimetry, spectrophotometry and chemiluminescence) because they are rapid, low cost and easy for automation detection. Many metal materials such as Pt, Pd, Cu and Ag have been used as electrodes for the electrochemical determination of H 2 O 2. [1] Recently, an improvement of the catalytic activity of silver screen-printed electrodes towards H 2 O 2 reduction after electrode modification with a mixed surfactant/salt solution has been reported. [2] The combination of dodecyl benzenesulphonic acid and KCl led to changes in both the morphology and chemical composition of the silver paste electrode surface which enhanced the reduction of H 2 O 2 at - 0. 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl up to 80 -fold on such material. In the present work, this phenomenon is further investigated with regard to the effect the type of metal electrode, surfactant and salt have on the reduction of H 2 O 2. Silver paste electrodes were modified with a range of surfactants (dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, sodium dodecyl sulphate, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide, Triton X- 100) and chloride salts and their ability to reduce H 2 O 2 was evaluated. The effect of the modification on the H 2 O 2 reduction was assessed by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) measurements were performed to characterize the electrode surfaces before and after the surfactant-based modification. In addition, the surfactant/salt modifications were performed on a range of metallic substrates such as Au, Pt and other Ag-based electrodes. Comparisons of H 2 O 2 reduction at these electrodes are shown and the effect of their modifications is also studied...|$|E
40|$|S(_ 5) N(_ 5) Cl {{has been}} {{produced}} by a new route and is much more stable than previously reported owing to greater purity. Its chemical reduction to (SN) and reactions with SO and BF were studied. An X-ray structure analysis (R. W. H. Small) revealed secondary cation-anion interactions; the resulting strain in the cation ring could be detected both by bond angle-bond length correlations and MNDO calculations. Electro-reduction of S(_ 5) N(_ 5) Cl in liquid SO(_ 2) produced finely powdered (SN) (_x) {{which could be used}} to form good quality vapour deposited films. Cyclic voltammograms in liquid SO(_ 2) (obtained after spending much time developing an improved procedure) indicated possible solvent participation in the reduction process and so electrocystallization of (SN) by electro-reduction of S(_ 5) N(_ 5) BF(_ 4) (prepared from S(_ 5) N(_ 5) Cl) in acetonitrile was investigated. Cyclic voltammetric evidence was used to propose a mechanism of reduction and bulk electrolyis experiments using bright platinum and (SN) (_x) film cathodes showed the influence of the cathode {{on the nature of the}} (SN) (_x) deposit. Small quantities of NSF were produced in ca. 80 % yield by the solid state reaction of SN(^+) AsF(_ 6) ֿ and excess CsF; an unoptimised larger scale preparation indicated the usefulness of this route. Various gas phase reactions of NSF were studied using infrared spectroscopy. Attempts to prepare the simple fluoride S(_ 4) N(_ 3) F by metathesis from S(_ 4) N(_ 3) BF(_ 4) and CsF were only partially successful owing to reaction with solvent. Reaction of S(_ 3) N(_ 2) (^ 2 +) (AsF(_ 6) ֿ) (_ 2) with CsF (1 : 1) produced S(_ 3) N(_ 2) F(^+) AsFֿ but further conversion to S(_ 3) N(_ 2) F(^ 2) was not possible owing to reaction with solvent. Attempted crystal growth experiments indicated that the S(_ 3) N(_ 2) (^ 2 +) ion existed in an equilibrium mixture containing S(_ 2) N(^+) and SN(^+); this hypothesis was confirmed by its reactions with sulphur and hexafluorobut- 2 -yne. These solution equilibria were exploited by designing more convenient preparations of S(_ 3) N(_ 2) (^ 2 +) (AsF(_ 6) ֿ) (_ 2) and S(_ 2) N(^+) SbCl(_ 6) ֿ. The chemical reactions of SN(^+) AsF(_ 6) ֿ were studied with a view to the preparation of new compounds.

40|$|Vanadium (V) only {{possesses}} <b>oxidising</b> <b>properties</b> in acid solutions. The main species {{present in}} these conditions is that cation VO 2 +, but this is protonated to a small extent to give the more powerfully oxidising species V(OH) 2 3 +. Previous work in this laboratory has shown that vanadium (V) is a one-electron oxidising agent and is reduced by organic compounds to vanadium (IV) only. No vanadium (III) has yet been detected {{in any of these}} oxidation reactions while the presence of free radicals, which are usually associated with one-electron oxidations, has been demonstrated in many vanadium (V) oxidations of organic compounds. To extend the knowledge of these oxidations a number of alcohols, α-hydroxy acids, acyloins and aldehydes, and also pinacol and oxalic acid have been oxidised by acid solutions of vanadium (V). The products of these oxidations have been investigated and in many cases a detailed investigation of the kinetics of the reactions has been made. 1. α-t-Butyl=benzyl alcohol PhCHOH. C(CH 3) 3 was shown to be oxidised initially to benzaldehyde with direct carbon-carbon bond fission. The yield of pivalophenone Ph CO. C(CH 3) 3, which is not oxidised under the conditions used, was only about 10 - 15 %. This direct carbon-carbon bond fission has been noted previously in the oxidation of various secondary alcohols with chromium (VI) and manganese (VII), but in general the yield of fission products is much smaller with these reagents. The following mechanism is proposed for the fission reaction in the vanadium (V) oxidation. [For the diagram omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] 2. 2 -Phenyl=ethyl alcohol was also found to be oxidised by vanadium (V) with carbon-carbon bond fission. Benzaldehyde was the main product of the reaction. Phenyl=acetic acid, which is not oxidised by vanadium (V) was not found in the reaction products. 3. The oxidations of the α-hydroxy acids lactic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid and α-hydroxy iso-butyric acid, and also of pinacol, were found to follow the rate equation -d[V V] ⁄ dt = k[V V][Substrate](1 + a h 0) where a is a constant and h 0 is the Hammett acidity function. The acid independent reaction must be due to VO 2 + while the acid dependent reaction must be due to V(OH) 2 3 +. The above expression contrasts with that obtained for the oxidation of pinacol monomethyl ether:- -d[V V] ⁄ dt = k[V V][ether](H +) This has no acid independent term and {{is the same as the}} expression obtained for the oxidation of cyclohexanol. Apparently pinacol monomethyl ether is oxidised as an alcohol:- [For the diagram omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] The mechanism of oxidation of the hydroxy acids is postulated to be [For the diagram omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] and for pinacol [For the diagram omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] Complex I contains a molecule of water which is not present in II or III and this fact has been used to explain the difference in the observed acidity dependences of the two reactions. The products of the oxidations were shown to be lactic acid → acetaldehyde + carbon dioxide malic acid → acetaldehyde + carbon dioxide mandolic acid → benzaldehyde + carbon dioxide α-hydroxy iso-butyric acid → acetone + carbon dioxide pinacol → Acetone     These products are consistent with the above mechanisms. 4. In two respects the oxidation of oxalic acid is unique among vanadium (V) oxidations which have been investigated so far; firstly oxidation can occur in the complete absence of mineral acid; secondly at acid concentrations above 3. 5 M, the addition of mineral acid decreases the rate of oxidation. The kinetics of the oxidation were found to be somewhat complex and have been interpreted by postulating that a series of complexes is formed between the reactants. It was shown that a complex of formula (H 2 C 2 O 4) 2. V V is formed in the absence of mineral acid. The main reaction at low acidities is probably assisted by the formation of a cyclic chelate structure [For the diagram omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] 5. Acetoin was found to be oxidised by vanadium according to the rate equation -d[V V] ⁄ dt = k[Acetoin][V V]. h 0 but the oxidation of 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl 2 -butanone (methyl acetoin) was found to have the rate equation -d[V V] ⁄ dt = k[Methyl acetoin][V V]. (1 + ah 0) Methyl acetoin must therefore be oxidised in a similar manner to the hydroxy acids giving acetone and acetic acid as products. [For the diagram omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] Acetoin was found to be oxidised to diacetyl initially. In order to account accurately for the observed oxidation kinetics it has been necessary to postulate a vanadium (V) complex containing acetoin as a tridentate ligand. The following mechanism is suggested for the oxidation, [For the diagram omitted here, please consult the PDF. ] and in the discussion it is explained that this mechanism is equivalent to an oxidation of acetoin both as a ketone and as an alcohol. 6. Three aldehydes, propionaldehyde, n-butyraldehye and iso-butyraldehyde were oxidised by vanadium (V) and were found to undergo carbon-carbon bond fission rather than to be oxidised to the corresponding carboxylic acids. CH 3 CH 2 CHO → 4 V V CH 3 CHO + HCOOH CH 3 CH 3 CH 2 CHO → 3 V V CH 3 CHO + 2 HCOOH (CH 3) 2 CH CHO → 4 V V (CH 3) 2 CO + HCOOH The kinetics of the iso-butyraldehyde oxidation followed the rate equation -d[V V] ⁄ dt = k[aldehyde][H +] The rate of oxidation was independent of the concentration of oxidising agent and was equal to the rate of enolisation of the aldehyde. The aldehyde is therefore oxidised in its enolic form. For propionaldehyde and n-butyraldehyde the rate equation was found to be -d[V V] ⁄ dt = k[V V][aldehyde][H +] at low acid concentrations, but the rate increased more rapidly at high acid concentrations than this equation would indicate. The rate of enolisation of these two aldehydes was found to be faster than the rate of oxidation and although the reaction kinetics are consistent with a reaction of the aldehyde in its enolic form, they cannot confirm this definitely. Various possible mechanisms for the reaction have been discussed. </p...|$|E
