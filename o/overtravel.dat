25|$|On April 9, 2008, Ruger {{recalled}} the SR9 model because, under certain conditions, it can fire if dropped with the manual safety off and a {{round in the}} chamber. This condition can occur in pistols manufactured from October 2007 to April 2008. Ruger designed a new trigger group which corrects this issue. It includes, among other things, adding a pivoting inner blade to the trigger itself, similar to that on the Glock pistol. This blade must be depressed to allow the trigger to be pulled. It also serves as an <b>overtravel</b> stop. Ruger also redesigned the magazine release, magazine disconnect & disconnect spring, and the striker blocker and striker blocker spring. Ruger initially announced that, beginning in mid-May 2008, they would retrofit SR9 pistols having a serial number below 330-30000 with the new parts, and include a spare magazine free of charge (approximately 11,000 pistols). SR9 pistols with serial numbers of 330-30000 and higher were manufactured with the safety enhancements and {{are not subject to}} the recall. Ruger began shipping recall boxes to customers in July 2008.|$|E

5000|$|... <b>overtravel,</b> {{which is}} the {{distance}} a trigger moves after the sear releases ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>overtravel</b> can be {{the most}} {{critical}} factor in the trigger pull, as any movement caused at this point will happen as the shot is fired. This is especially important with firearms where there is a sudden release of resistance when the sear breaks, such as in double-action triggers. An <b>overtravel</b> stop will arrest the motion of the trigger just after the break, and prevent movement. Over travel is not always considered bad by some, as the force of the trigger finger does not impact on the gun directly after sear release.|$|E

5000|$|The Smith & Wesson K-38 Combat Masterpiece Revolver Model 15 is a {{derivative}} {{of the classic}} 1899 K-frame (medium frame) Military and Police [...]38 S&W Special (aka [...]38 Special) six-shot double-action revolver. The M&P underwent steady evolution throughout the 20th century and S&W spun off several variations as separate models in the post World War II years. One of these was the K-38 Target Masterpiece, which began production in 1947. The Target Masterpiece included {{a number of new}} and/or special features, including a six-inch barrel with a narrow rib to provide a level sight plane, a Patridge front sight, a micrometer click rear sight, S&W’s [...]375” short-throw hammer, a trigger adjustment for <b>overtravel,</b> and improved grips. Noting the accuracy of the Target Masterpiece, a number of police departments and the FBI soon requested the same revolver with a four-inch barrel and a Baughman Quick Draw front sight. The result was the K-38 Combat Masterpiece. The major distinction between the K-38 Target Masterpiece and the K-38 Combat Masterpiece is the barrel length and the front sight.|$|E

40|$|In culvert-based {{navigation}} lock filling-emptying systems, inertia effects {{have a significant}} influence on the filling-emptying time and cause a (damped) oscillation of the water surface in the lock chamber around its equalization level, {{referred to as the}} <b>overtravel</b> phenomenon. In this paper, the derivation of analytical formulae for the lock filling-emptying time and <b>overtravel</b> peak of systems consisting of a number of identical culverts is revisited. In comparison to earlier publications, the underlying assumptions are made explicit and the importance of accounting for the surface area ratio of lock chamber to upper reservoir in case of filling (or lower reservoir in case of emptying) is pointed out. Additionally, it is shown how the applicability of the analytical formulae can be extended to lock filling-emptying systems with more complex lay-outs by using an "equivalent culvert" approach. The validity of the analytical formulae is thoroughly assessed, first by comparing to an accurate numerical solution of the governing non-linear second-order differential equations, and second, by means of experiments in a physical model...|$|E

40|$|Homogeneity {{for highly}} {{asymmetric}} fields {{has been studied}} for a Siemens PRIMUS linear accelerator. The flattening filter has a radius smaller than the primary collimator one, creating inhomogeneities that affect large fields in areas far from the collimator axis, and asymmetric fields with large offset. Profiles and absolute dose have been measured in fields with two jaws at maximal position (20 cm) {{and the other two}} at maximal <b>overtravel</b> (10 cm.), corresponding to 10 x 10 fields with extreme offset. Profiles have a remarkable gradient decreasing towards the beam edge, making these fields unsuitable for treatments. Results show that the design of the primary collimator and flattening filter assembly has direct consequences in homogeneity. This can have clinical consequences for treatments involving fields that include these inhomogeneous areas. Comparisons with the treatment planning system (Philips Pinnacle) calculations, that computes under the hypotheses of a uniformly flattened beam, result in severe discrepancies.

40|$|Extreme space {{limitations}} {{and the desire}} to reduce the bounce between contacts prompted an investigation of the use of Belleville washers and Sorbothane as part of a spring/damper system in a medium voltage high-speed shorting device. Experimental tests in conjunction with mechanism simulation have been used to optimize a spring and damping system for the minimization of bounce that occurs during the closing of electrical contacts. Through the use of Dynamic Designer, the amount of stiffness and damping required, the identification of the optimum location of the damping system, and the mechanism components that were contributing to the bouncing phenomena were determined. The stiffness of the Belleville washers was tuned to the moving masses but the <b>overtravel</b> of the shaft was damped using a Sorbothane stack.

40|$|The continual {{development}} of high energy photon beam radiotherapy in Norway urges for a revision in dosimetric quality controls. It is favorable to use sharply defined fields, but existing routines for quality assurance are lacking, especially for modalities such as asymmetric fields and IMRT. The thesis suggests a new {{procedure for implementing}} radiochromic film {{as a tool for}} quality assurance in radiotherapy, in cooperation with the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). GafChromic®EBT type film has been used for the experiments. The procedure is based on the general method first suggested by Devic et al, with several modications. Films have been calibrated using the Co- 60 gammatron at the NRPA Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory, and measurements have been performed on 14 treatment units at 7 different hospitals in Norway. In addition to film irradiation, reference dosimetry according to TRS- 398 protocol using an ionization chamber in a water phantom was performed at 13 of 14 linacs. Measurements show that measured doses for a 10 x 10 cm 2 field at reference conditions with an ionization chamber in a water phantom were within 2 % for all linear accelerators, for both 6 MV and 15 MV photon energies. Radiochromic film measurements were inaccurate for absolute dosimetry due to difficulties in the absolute calibration of the film. However, relative measurements using radiochromic film show that values for field size, penumbra, flatness and symmetry are close to expected clinical values. Different asymmetric field setups are also investigated using radiochromic film. In the case where two asymmetric half-collimated fields are spliced together, high over- and underdosages of more than 20 % are detected in the border between the fields, both with and without collimator rotation. These discrepancies are not corrected for in dose planning software. Studies of fields with <b>overtravel</b> collimator parameters in both x- and y-directions show that field sizes vary within 7 % of the desired values, and measured doses do not fully agree with the calculated doses in treatment planning software. Radiochromic film shows promise as a tool in radiotherapy quality assurance, but the existing method is not accurate enough to satisfy needs for clinical use. A modified method is suggested that will potentially improve the detected uncertainties...|$|E
