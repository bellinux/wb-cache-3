25|$|On April 25, 2014 JSAT {{announced}} that it had placed an order with MELCO and its satellite platform DS2000 for its Superbird-8 satellite. It would replace Superbird-B2 and be positioned on the 162°East <b>orbital</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
25|$|On May 5, 2016, at 05:21 UTC, the Falcon 9 {{successfully}} launched JSCAT-14 to a geosynchronous transfer orbit. The rocket's {{first stage}} subsequently landed on an autonomous spaceport drone ship. The next day, SSL {{announced that the}} satellite had deployed the solar arrays, was in full control, and was performing orbital maneuvers to reach its operational position. Renamed JCSAT-2B, it was on track to reach its 154°East <b>orbital</b> <b>slot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dish Network officially began {{operations}} on March 4, 1996, {{as a service}} of EchoStar. EchoStar, a precursor to Dish Network, was formed in 1980 by its {{chairman and chief executive}} officer, Charlie Ergen along with colleagues Candy Ergen and Jim Defranco, as a distributor of C-band satellite television systems. In 1987, EchoStar applied for a direct broadcast satellite broadcast license with the Federal Communications Commission and was granted access to <b>orbital</b> <b>slot</b> 119° west longitude in 1992.|$|E
50|$|Co-location is now {{employed}} at <b>orbital</b> <b>slots</b> across the geostationary orbit by many satellite operators, {{and is used}} by SES for multiple satellites at two of its Astra slots, 19.2°E and 28.2°E.|$|R
5000|$|PAN {{has shown}} an unusual history of {{frequent}} relocations, moving between at least 9 different <b>orbital</b> <b>slots</b> since launch.

25|$|India's first {{exclusive}} defence satellite GSAT-7 {{was successfully}} launched by European space consortium Arianespace's rocket from Kourou spaceport in French Guiana in August 2013. GSAT-7 was fabricated by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to serve {{for at least}} seven years in its <b>orbital</b> <b>slot</b> at 74°E, providing UHF, S-band, C-band and Ku-band relay capacity. Its Ku-band allows high-density data transmission, including both audio and video. This satellite also has a provision to reach smaller and mobile terminals.|$|E
25|$|On November 4, 2015, JSAT and Intelsat made a joined {{statement}} {{that they would}} add a new member to their Horizons joint venture. The satellite, called Horizons 3e, {{would be based on}} the Intelsat EpicNG platform, featuring an optimized C band and high throughput Ku band payload it would offer mobility and broadband connectivity services in the Asia-Pacific region. It was expected to use the 169°East <b>orbital</b> <b>slot</b> and launch by the second half of 2018.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 EchoStar {{purchased}} the broadcasting assets of a satellite broadcasting joint venture of News Corporation and MCI Worldcom, called ASkyB (for American Sky Broadcasting, named after News Corp's BSkyB service in Britain); {{the two companies}} had nearly merged (which called for Dish Network being renamed Sky) before it was called off due to Charlie Ergen's clashes with News Corp. executives. With this purchase EchoStar obtained 28 of the 32 transponder licenses in the 110° West <b>orbital</b> <b>slot,</b> more than doubling existing continental United States broadcasting capacity at a value of $682.5 million; {{some of the other}} assets were picked up by rival PrimeStar, which was sold to DirecTV in 1999. The acquisition (which also included an uplink center in Gilbert, Arizona) inspired the company to introduce a multi satellite system called Dish 500, theoretically capable of receiving more than 500 channels on one Dish. In the same year, Echostar, partnering with Bell Canada, launched Dish Network Canada.|$|E
40|$|Trends in {{communication}} satellites show increasing reuse {{of the frequency}} spectrum through multiple spot beams and orthogonal polarization, as well as consortia operation. Current reliance on orbital arc separation for frequency reuse may be inadequate for the projected traffic growth and the <b>orbital</b> <b>slotting</b> proposals before the ITU. This paper notes that cost advantages can accrue through common use of spacecraft subsystems and multiple users' platforms aboard a common geostationary platform. The rationale for such platforms is described and potential payloads are suggested...|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, all assets of Nahuelsat S.A. were being {{transferred}} to the newly formed ARSAT S.A.. By 2006, Nahuelsat had failed to put a satellite in its second assigned position, 81° West, and had not even ordered a replacement for Nahuel 1A. So the Argentine Government created ARSAT which accepted to assume all Nahuelsat obligations in exchange for all assets of the company. It then ordered the ARSAT-1 and ARSAT-2 from the local INVAP to cover both <b>orbital</b> <b>slots.</b>|$|R
40|$|The single entry {{interference}} {{problem is}} treated for frequency sharing between the broadcasting satellite and intersatellite services near 23 GHz.

When this is done, {{it is found that}} suitable orbit assignments can be determined easily {{with the aid of a}} set of universal curves. An attempt to develop synthesis procedures for optimally assigning frequencies and <b>orbital</b> <b>slots</b> for the broadcasting satellite service in region 2 was initiated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method of manipulating the spatial pattern of a fractionated micro-satellite constellation in Low Earth Orbit. The method developed allows satellites {{to manipulate the}} longitudinal position of their ground-tracks over the Earth’s surface, such that they pass over specified targets. This is achieved firstly by pairing satellites on the constellation to the targets on the Earth’s surface, and then by developing an artificial potential field controller to define the thrust commands which move the satellites into the appropriate <b>orbital</b> <b>slots</b> to converge upon their targets. The latter is achieved using Coupled Selection Equations - a dynamical systems approach to combinatorial optimisation...|$|R

The E-P 2 P refueling problem can be formulated as a three-index assignment problem on an undirected tripartite constellation graph, which can be solved using, say, a Greedy Random Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP).

We formulate the problem as a three-index assignment problem in a tripartite constellation graph.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{method is}} analytically shown for multiplying {{the number of}} <b>orbital</b> <b>slots</b> for synchronous satellites. This is by radially tethering satellites above the synchronous orbit (forces outwards) balanced to satellites below this orbit (forces inwards). The term practical applies because the tether tension force is of second order smallness. Thus, several thousand miles of synchronous satellites can be radiated along a small tether line sized for tension of about one percent of a satellite weight. A vertical tether line also provides a track for transport, that is, a ladder or elevator. Analysis for an optimized diameter tether line is developed which is particularly effective when the tether, line is extended to the ground, thus, making a space ladder. Mars is the best candidate for a space ladder. With the optimized tether the total system mass is minimum when the outer satellite is far out. Tethered satellites have G-forces...|$|R

Various GEO-to-GEO applications were determined that provide potential benefits over existing communication systems. A set of criteria was developed to assess the potential applications. Intersatellite link models, network system architectures, and payload configurations were developed. For each of the chosen ISL applications, ISL versus non-ISL satellite systems architectures were derived.

50|$|In 1993, the Paksat {{programme}} was restarted but, unfortunately, terminated in 1994 after SUPARCO {{lost the}} two <b>orbital</b> <b>slots</b> 38°E longitude and 41°E longitude, which was acquired {{for it in}} the Geo-synchronous orbit. In 2002, SUPARCO again applied for the allocation of five GSo slots (38°E, 41°E, 30°E, 88°E and 101°E) and was filed. Although granted, SUPARCO faced the risk of losing its priority 38°E slot, if it didn’t launch its own satellite by April 2003. Being under pressure and understanding the substantial negative impact on the space programme, SUPARCO made a move to acquire an American satellite-building firm, Hughes Satellite Systems (HGS), at a cost of around $5 million. This second-hand satellite had been originally designed for Indonesia, but after a battery problem occurred making it useless during certain hours of the day, the firm solved the problem and sold the satellite to Pakistan as Paksat-1.|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) refueling of satellites in a circu-lar constellation.

During a CE-P 2 P maneuver, a fuel-sufficient satellite and a fuel-deficient satellite engage in a cooperative ren-dezvous, exchange fuel, and then return to any available <b>orbital</b> <b>slots</b> left vacant by other active satellites. We propose a methodology, based on a network flow formu-lation, to determine the CE-P 2 P maneuvers that use the minimum amount of fuel during the ensuing orbital transfers.
