5|$|At {{the start}} of the awards in 1975, seven {{categories}} were presented: Best Novel, Best Short Fiction, Best Collection, Best Artist, Special Award—Professional, Special Award—Non-professional, and Life Achievement. Only a few categories have changed since then, and no changes have been made to the rules. 1978 saw the addition of the Convention Award, a special award given for general contributions to the genre, and the only award not given every year since the beginning. The Short Fiction award was split into Short Story and Novella awards in 1982, and in 1988 the multi-author anthologies, previously eligible for the Collection award, were split into their <b>own</b> <b>Best</b> Anthology category. No changes have been made since.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{researchers}} at Tufts University Center for Animals and Public Policy estimated that 14–21 million animals {{were used in}} American laboratories in 1992, a reduction {{from a high of}} 50 million used in 1970. In 1986, the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment reported that estimates of the animals used in the U.S. range from 10 million to upwards of 100 million each year, and that their <b>own</b> <b>best</b> estimate was at least 17 million to 22 million. In 2016, the Department of Agriculture listed 60,979 dogs, 18,898 cats, 71,188 non-human primates, 183,237 guinea pigs, 102,633 hamsters, 139,391 rabbits, 83,059 farm animals, and 161,467 other mammals, a total of 820,812, a figure that includes all mammals except purpose-bred mice and rats. The use of dogs and cats in research in the U.S. decreased from 1973 to 2016 from 195,157 to 60,979, and from 66,165 to 18,898, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{responded by}} {{promptly}} moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then {{agreed to a}} truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen may {{have thought it was}} in his <b>own</b> <b>best</b> interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent {{at this point in the}} conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E

The reasoning behind Stephen's decision to release his rival remains unclear. Contemporary chroniclers suggested that Henry argued {{that it would be}} in Stephen's <b>own</b> <b>best</b> interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, and Stephen may have seen Robert, not the Empress, as his main opponent {{at this point in the}} conflict. Stephen also faced a military dilemma at Arundel—the castle was considered almost impregnable, and he may have been worried that he was tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen was certainly known for having a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E
25|$|<b>Own</b> <b>best</b> judge: People are {{considered}} the best judge of their own type. While the MBTI provides a Reported Type, this is considered only an indication of their probable overall Type. A Best Fit Process is usually used to allow respondents to develop {{their understanding of the}} four dichotomies, to form their own hypothesis as to their overall Type, and to compare this against the Reported Type. In more than 20% of cases, the hypothesis and the Reported Type differ in one or more dichotomies. Using the clarity of each preference, any potential for bias in the report, and often, a comparison of two or more whole Types may then help respondents determine their <b>own</b> <b>Best</b> Fit.|$|E

In spite of this Walsh's side bounced back the following year to record a 4-6 to 3-4 defeat of Ballygunner. The victory began another great run of success as further defeats of Abbeyside and Ballygunner gave Mount Sion a hat-trick of championship titles.|$|R

25|$|Autonomy {{can come}} into {{conflict}} with beneficence when patients disagree with recommendations that healthcare professionals believe are in the patient's best interest. When the patient's interests conflict with the patient's welfare, different societies settle the conflict {{in a wide range}} of manners. In general, Western medicine defers to the wishes of a mentally competent patient to make their own decisions, even in cases where the medical team believes that they are not acting in their <b>own</b> <b>best</b> interests. However, many other societies prioritize beneficence over autonomy.|$|E
25|$|Insurance is {{a method}} of {{shifting}} risk from one party to another. Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, {{which is similar to}} calculating gambling odds. Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make. While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an insurable interest, the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one's <b>own</b> <b>best</b> interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).|$|E

500|$|In a 1990 paper, [...] "Elephants Don't Play Chess," [...] {{robotics}} researcher Rodney Brooks took direct aim at {{the physical}} symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since [...] "the world is its <b>own</b> <b>best</b> model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail {{there is to be}} known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough." [...] In the 80s and 90s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert gave {{a largely}} {{positive}} review, stating that, [...] "Kevin Spacey believes {{he was born}} to play Bobby Darin. I believe he was born to play more interesting characters... In his <b>own</b> <b>best</b> work, Spacey has achieved genius; he is better as an actor than Darin ever was as a singer." [...] Stephen Holden of The New York Times felt that [...] "with Beyond the Sea, Spacey crawls back from his doomed quest to be a Tom Hanks-like everyman to his niche on the underbelly of Hollywood's pantheon. The movie's a mess, and at 45, Spacey is far too old to play Darin. Yet the star captures his desperation, his braggadocio, and yes, his magnetism." [...] Peter Travers, writing in Rolling Stone magazine, believed Spacey could not prevent [...] "the movie from groaning {{under the weight of}} biopic clichés. But the actor forges a bond with his subject that rights all wrongs. Doing his own singing (an uncanny imitation), Spacey is a marvel." ...|$|E

According to a behind-the-scenes interview with Entertainment Tonight, Madonna stated that the inspiration behind the video was from the 1997 Arthur Golden novel Memoirs of a Geisha. She later stated, [...] "The whole idea of a geisha is a straight metaphor for being an entertainer because, on one hand you're privileged to be a geisha, {{but on the other}} hand you're a prisoner [...] " [...] Madonna choreographed her own moves in the video, since she [...] " [...] like how other people say how I should move, I'm my <b>own</b> <b>best</b> choreographer."
