50|$|This {{species has}} two {{different}} pollination syndromes, entomophily and anemophily; it is pollinated by insects and wind.

5000|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet,</b> Vespa orientalis, is {{a social}} insect of the Vespidae family. It {{can be found in}} Southwest Asia, Northeast Africa, the island of Madagascar, Israel and parts of Southern Europe. Oriental hornets have also been found in a few {{isolated}} locations such as Mexico due to human introduction. The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> lives in seasonal colonies consisting of caste system dominated by a queen. The hornet builds its nests underground and communicates using sound vibrations. The hornet has a yellow stripe on its cuticle (exoskeleton) which can absorb sunlight to generate a small electrical potential, and {{it has been suggested that}} this might help supply energy for digging. The adult hornet eats nectar and fruits and scavenges for insects and animal proteins to feed to their young. [...] Because they are scavengers, the hornets may also serve as a transmitter of disease following consumption of infected plants. The hornets are a primary pest to honey bees, attacking bee colonies to obtain honey and animal proteins. The sting of an <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> can be quite painful to humans and some humans are allergic to stings.|$|E
50|$|In 1992, 230 <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornets,</b> {{a flight}} {{hardware}} and measuring instruments were packed onto the Space Shuttle Endeavour mission STS-47. The <b>Oriental</b> <b>Hornets</b> {{used in the}} experiment were capable of building combs {{in the direction of}} the gravitational vector and detecting gravitational force changes in real time.|$|R
50|$|The Israeli Space Agency Investigation About Hornets (ISAIAH) was {{a project}} from Tel-Aviv University {{initiated}} in 1984 {{to explore the}} effects of near-zero gravity on <b>oriental</b> <b>hornets,</b> their development, and their nest-building instincts. The experiments {{was funded by the}} Israel Space Agency with the goal of discovering ways to prevent astronauts from suffering headaches, nausea, and vomiting during the missions. The sample of 230 <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornets,</b> flight hardware, and measuring instruments were all packed onto the Space Shuttle Endeavour mission STS-47 in 1992.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oriental</b> <b>hornets</b> capture {{other insects}} such as grasshoppers, flies, honey bees, and yellowjackets {{with which they}} feed the colony's brood. They will also collect other animal {{proteins}} for their young such as pieces of fresh or spoiled meat and fish. The adults eat carbohydrates such as nectar, honeydew, and fruits.|$|R
50|$|A 2010 {{study by}} {{researchers}} at Tel Aviv University discovered that the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa orientalis) converts sunlight into electric power using a pigment called xanthopterin. This is the first scientific evidence {{of a member of}} the animal kingdom engaging in photosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> uses xanthopterin as a light-harvesting {{molecule}} {{to transform}} light into electrical energy, {{which explains why}} the insects are more active when light intensity is greater. It remains an active and important area of scientific research (Plotkin et al., Naturwissenschaften (2010) 97:1067-1076).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> {{occurs in}} {{semi-dry}} sub-tropical areas of Central Asia (Iran, Afghanistan, Oman, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan), southern Europe (Italy, Malta, Albania, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Cyprus), North Africa (Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia), {{and along the}} shores of the Gulf of Aden and in the Middle East. It has been introduced to Madagascar.|$|E
50|$|The Israeli Space Agency Investigation About Hornets (ISAIAH) was project form Tel-Aviv University {{that was}} {{initiated}} {{in the early}} 1990s to explorer the effects of near-zero gravity on <b>oriental</b> <b>hornets,</b> their physical and physiological development and their nest-building instincts. The flight hardware and measuring instruments were commissioned by the ISA and built by ISI. The hope of the mission was to discover ways to prevent astronauts from suffering headaches, nausea, and vomiting during the missions.|$|R
50|$|Materials science {{investigations}} covered such {{fields as}} biotechnology, electronic materials, fluid dynamics and transport phenomena, glasses and ceramics, metals and alloys, and acceleration measurements. Life sciences included experiments on human health, cell separation and biology, developmental biology, animal and human physiology and behavior, space radiation, and biological rhythms. Test subjects included the crew, Japanese koi fish (carp), cultured {{animal and plant}} cells, chicken embryos, fruit flies, fungi, plant seeds, frogs and frog eggs, and <b>oriental</b> <b>hornets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most wasps {{are most}} active {{during the early}} morning. Vespa orientalis is unique in showing a peak of {{activity}} {{during the middle of}} the day. <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornets</b> dig their nests underground by picking up soil in their mandibles, flying a short distance, dropping the soil, and returning to the nest to continue digging. The hornet's digging is correlated with insolation (solar energy). The more insolation, the more active the hornet. This daytime digging behavior of Vespa orientalis may be possible because of the ability of its cuticle to harvest solar energy.|$|R
50|$|Other {{temperate}} species (e.g. {{the yellow}} hornet, V. simillima, or the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet,</b> V. orientalis) have similar cycles. In {{the case of}} tropical species (e.g., V. tropica), life histories may well differ, and in species with both tropical and temperate distributions (such as the Asian giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia), {{it is conceivable that}} the cycle depends on latitude.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> {{typically}} {{lives in}} nests that it digs underground. A nest contains multiple combs {{in which the}} colony lives. While nests are most commonly found underground, some paper nests are constructed in protective hollows such as inside hollow trees, in shipping containers, parked vehicles, and aircraft. To construct the paper nests, the workers strip the bark from twigs, tree branches, and shrubs in order to collect fiber.|$|E
50|$|The cuticle of the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> {{contains}} yellow pigment {{which protects}} the cuticle from harmful UV {{radiation from the}} sun. The brown segments of the hornet's body contain melanin which serves a similar purpose. The brown cuticle is composed of approximately 30 layers, the thickness of which increases from interior to exterior. The brown melanin pigment is found in these layers. The yellow cuticle is composed of 15 layers which contain yellow pigment. The yellow stripe contains xanthopterin in barrel-shaped granules.|$|E
50|$|The {{best place}} for hornets to find a {{combination}} of animal proteins (bees or larvae) and carbohydrates (honey) are bee hives. <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornets</b> {{have been known to}} cause serious damage to bee colonies. They are the primary pest that attacks honey bee colonies in many countries. In defense, Japanese honey bees have been shown to kill predatory hornets by surrounding them by forming a tight ball in which the temperature rises to lethal levels. Cyprian honey bees (Apis mellifera cypria) have developed a slightly different method for killing their major predator. They form a tight, smothering ball around the attacking hornet and kill it by asphyxiation.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oriental</b> <b>hornets</b> live in {{seasonal}} colonies {{which are}} formed {{every year in}} the spring by a single queen who mated during the previous fall. During the fall, the queen lays her eggs which will develop into new queens and drones. After mating, the drones die off while the fertilized queens seek hideouts in which to hibernate for the winter. The colony will grow throughout the spring and summer months until the population and activity of the colony peaks in the late summer and early fall. The peak size of the colony is several thousand individuals and a colony will contain on average 3-6 combs each containing 600-900 individual cells.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oriental</b> <b>hornets</b> {{communicate}} through sound vibrations. There are three main types of vibrations used to communicate: taps to the queen, awakening taps, and larval hunger signals. When workers tap while facing the queen three effects are noted: the queen starts {{to search the}} combs for vacant cells in which to lay her eggs in, the workers go back to performing their typical duties, and hunger signals by larvae cease immediately and are not resumed for at least 30 minutes. The main purpose of these taps seem to be to encourage the queen to lay more eggs. Awakening taps by workers cause a general intensification of activities in the colony. The effects are minimal during the day. At night, however, the vibrations wake the whole colony which causes the larvae commence their hunger signals and the workers to go forage for food to feed the larvae. Larval hunger signals produce no detectable changes in larval activity during the daytime. The workers, however, will {{to pay more attention}} and give more food to the cells which are in the vicinity of where the vibrations originated. At night, the larvae will emulate each other's hunger signals and awake the whole nest.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa orientalis) {{belongs to}} the Vespidae family which {{consists}} of wasps, hornets, and yellowjackets. It {{is a member of}} genus Vespa which constitutes true hornets.Vespa orientalis has unique adaptations to arid climates which disguises its phylogenic relationship to other species of the Vespa genus, making it difficult to map based on morphological data alone. Thus the use of molecular data was crucial to correctly mapping its phylogenetic relationships. Based on molecular phylogenetics V. orientalis is most closely related to Vespa affinis and Vespa mocsaryana.|$|E
50|$|Photoheterotrophs (Gk: photo = light, hetero = (an)other, troph = nourishment) are {{heterotrophic}} phototrophs—that is, {{they are}} organisms that use light for energy, but cannot use carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source. Consequently, they use organic compounds {{from the environment}} to satisfy their carbon requirements; these compounds include carbohydrates, fatty acids, and alcohols. Examples of photoheterotrophic organisms include purple non-sulfur bacteria, green non-sulfur bacteria, and heliobacteria. Recent {{research has indicated that}} the <b>oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> and some aphids may be able to use light to supplement their energy supply.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{example is}} the case of silk caps which cover the pupal cells of the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> Vespa orientalis. Firstly, the silk insulates the pupa from the air outside the cell, and secondly, it acts as a thermostatic regulator. By virtue of its thermoelectric properties, the silk stores excess daytime heat in the form of electric charge which it releases {{in the form of an}} electric current when the temperature falls resulting in heating. Cooling is aided by evaporation of excess water from the pupal cells. When the ambient temperature drops, the silk absorbs moisture and restores the moisture content by spreading water through all parts of its cocoon.|$|E
50|$|Oriental hornets can {{be found}} in Southwest Asia from Turkey to India and Nepal, {{throughout}} the Middle East, in Northeast Africa in countries such as Ethiopia and Somalia, and in parts of Southern Europe in Greece, Bulgaria, Malta and the southern tip of Italy. Oriental hornets have been introduced by humans into additional locations including Madagascar, Mexico, Xinjiang, China as well as the occasional introduction via fruit in Belgium and the UK. The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> is {{the only member of the}} Vespa genus that {{can be found}} in desert climates such as those it inhabits in Northern Africa, the Middle-East, and parts of Southwestern Asia.|$|E
50|$|The adult hornet has {{two pairs}} of wings and a body {{measuring}} between 25 and 35 mm long. Males and workers are smaller in size than the queen. Vespa orientalis is a reddish-brown color and has distinctive thick yellow bands on the abdomen and yellow patches on the head between the eyes. They have very strong jaws and will bite if provoked. Females (workers and queen) have an ovipositor which is a specialized organ shaped like a tube that is used for laying eggs. The ovipositor extends {{from the end of}} the abdomen and is also used as a stinger.Drones (males) can be distinguished from workers (females) by the number of segments on their antenna. Drones have 13 segments while workers only have 12.The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> looks similar to the European hornet (Vespa crabro) and should not be confused with the Asian giant hornet (Vespa mandarinia) of Eastern Asia.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> worker {{correlates}} its digging {{activity with}} solar insolation. Solar radiation {{passes through the}} epicuticle, which exhibits a grating-like structure, and continues to pass through layers of the exo-endocuticle until it is absorbed by the pigment melanin in the brown-colored cuticle or xanthopterin in the yellow-colored cuticle. The correlation between digging activity {{and the ability of}} the cuticle to absorb part of the solar radiation implies that the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> may harvest parts of the solar radiation. In this study, we explore this intriguing possibility by analyzing the biophysical properties of the cuticle. We use rigorous coupled wave analysis simulations to show that the cuticle surfaces are structured to reduced reflectance and act as diffraction gratings to trap light and increase the amount absorbed in the cuticle. A dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was constructed in order to show the ability of xanthopterin to serve as a light-harvesting molecule...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAsian honeybees {{have been}} shown to kill hornets by ‘thermo- balling’, in which they {{surround}} a hornet to form a ball within which the temperature increases to a lethal level.

40|$|Abstract. By gnalysis of the {{acoustical}} spectrum {{within the}} nest of the <b>oriental</b> <b>hornet,</b> three distinct and characteristic categories of sounds have been recognized: (a) Hunger signals {{produced by the}} hungry larvae through the scraping of their mandibles against the comb cell walls; (b) sounds which the workers, arranged in a 'resting circle ' around the queen, produce by tapping their abdomens on the surfaces of the cells. These sounds are temporarily designated as 'the taps of workers facing tlle queen'; and (c) additional worker sounds, also produced as in (b) but of a different rhythm, which have been designated in earlier publications as the 'awakening taps of workers ' (Ishay & Schwartz 1965...|$|E
40|$|On {{the ceiling}} of the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> comb cell, there are mineral {{granules}} of poly-crystalline material known to belong to the group of perovskites. In a comb cell intended to house a worker hornet, the roof base usually carries one or several such perovskite granules containing titanium (Ti), whereas in the roof base of a cell housing a developing queen, there are usually several granules containing a high percentage of silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), calcium (Ca), and iron (Fe), but very little if any Ti. In worker comb cells, Ti usually appears as ilmenite (FeTiO 3). Besides documenting the above-mentioned facts, this report discusses possible reasons for the appearance of ilmenite crystals in worker cells only and not in queen cells.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{set out to}} {{elucidate}} the structure and function of the large subcuticular air sacs encountered in the gaster of the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> Vespa orientalis (Hymenoptera, Vespinae). Gastral segments I, II, III, together with the anterior portion of segment IV, comprise the greater volume of the gaster, and inside them, beneath the cuticle, are contained not only structures that extend throughout their entire length, like the alimentary canal, and the nerve cord with its paired abdominal ganglia, situated near the cuticle in the ventral side, but also the heart, which is actually a muscular and dorsally located blood vessel that pumps blood anteriorly, toward {{the head of the}} hornet. The mentioned structures take up only a small volume of the gaster, while the rest is occupied by air sacs and tracheal ducts that also extend longitudinally. Interposed between the two air sacs, there is a hard partition and above it, at the center – a paired tracheal duct that extends {{the entire length of the}} air sacs. The endothelium of the air sacs is very anfractuous, thereby enlarging and strengthening the surface area. In each gastral segment there is an aperture for the entry of air, namely, a spiracle. Additionally, in each segment, in the antero-lateral aspect of its tergum and situated between two successive segments, there is an intersegmental conjunctive bearing parallel slits of 1 – 2 microM in width and 10 – 30 microM in length. The latter are arranged concentrically around bundles of tracheae that traverse the cuticle from segment to segment. From the upper rims of the slits are suspended downward fringe-like structures or "shutters" ranging between 3 – 10 microM in length. We discuss the possibility that the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> resorts to internal circulation of air, along with a thermoelectric heat pump mechanism, in order to achieve cooling and thermoregulation of its body...|$|E
40|$|Mankind has {{developed}} sophisticated means of maintaining comfortable living conditions around the world. We use many technologies {{that allow us}} to achieve thermoregulation and homeostasis and so live, work and survive in otherwise hostile environments. Many species in nature also practice thermoregulation and homeostasis, {{with some of the most}} interesting being the social insects. Biomimetics is defined as design inspired by nature, and so a biomimetic approach to thermoregulation might enable engineers to develop novel strategies that have less of an impact on natural resources and are more responsive to the environment. The mound building termites of South America, Africa and Australasia construct sophisticated structures that enable the environment within the nest to be regulated. Wind energy is captured to exchange gases between the nest, the mound and the outside by elaborate internal galleries, tunnels, and ducts. Gas exchange and ventilation could be achieved through responsive envelopes and fabric analogous to termite homeostasis. The <b>oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> can maintain a nest temperature of 28 - 32 °C in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate areas. It has been found that when the adult population are removed from the nest, its temperature is maintained for a number of days afterwards. The <b>oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> nest houses both the adult population and combs that contain the brood. Eggs are placed in the walls of the comb and when they hatch the pupa spin a silk weave and form a silk cap at the open entrance, sealing it from the outside. In studying the thermoregulatory properties of hornet nests, it has been shown that the silk cap and walls of the comb have thermoelectric properties that could help regulate the temperature in the comb. It was shown that as ambient temperature increases, the current intensity increases. When the ambient temperature falls the energy stored is discharged with a flow of electric current from high to low potential. The engineering materials with properties closest to the Hornet silk are the conductive polymers, although the thermoelectric properties may be more than 10, 000 times lower than semiconductors used in modern devices they may be useful as heat storage and discharge systems in buildings...|$|E
40|$|In {{the roof}} of cells built by the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet,</b> Vespa orientalis (Vespinae, Hymenoptera), there is one or more grains differing in their {{composition}} and shape from the surrounding structures. These grains have a diameter of 100 - 200 mum and protrude slightly from the roof inward. They contain primarily {{a large percentage of}} Ti but also Fe and occasionally Si. The mineral makeup in the grains is still uncertain, but it seems that the minerals belong to the group called perovskite. These grains in the hornet's comb may originate from the soil around the nest, that is, comprised of ceramic matter, but {{it is also possible that}} they are secreted from a gland within the frons plate of the hornet because the fungus-like secretion in this gland contains elements similar to those in {{the roof of}} the comb cells. We conjecture that the grain in question serves as a reference point for the hornets that build the cell walls in the direction of gravity. The cement whereby the building hornets conjoin the various building materials, whether organic (cellulose and the like) or inorganic (sand grains or tiny stones), is a saliva that is secreted from their oral gland, which upon release hardens into a polymeric glue. The ceramic grain embedded within this polymeric matrix is endowed with different physical properties and can therefore respond differently to the tension or pressure of the surrounding walls...|$|E
40|$|Our study {{deals with}} the ultramicroscopic {{structure}} of the yellow pigmented cuticular stripes on the abdomen of the <b>oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> Vespa orientalis (Hymenoptera, Vespinae). The abdominal cuticle is composed of numerous (more than 25) lamellae which progressively attenuate as one proceeds from the outside interiorly. On a logarithmic scale the pattern of lamellar attenuation is a linear drop to almost asymptotic thickness with the innermost lamellae at least one order of magnitude {{less than that of}} the outermost one and describable by a mathematic equation. Each lamella is a composite structure consisting of two primary elements, namely, a skeleton and filling material. The skeleton is composed of chitin and comprised of parallel 'plates' which visibly separate between the lamellae. These 'plates' are interconnected by: (1) perpendicular 'pillars' which are distributed intermittently at more or less uniform intervals; and (2) by a layer of chitin shaped like a horizontal helix or at times even a double helix whose diameter equals the distance between two successive lamellae. In the space within the skeletal element there is a filling material of variable nature, mostly proteinaceous, which dissolves out and vacates the cuticle during its processing for microscopic observation, leaving behind the skeletal element. Such structure of the cuticle, wherein two different materials combine serially into one duplex structure is typical of composite materials. This duplex structuring of the lamellae, combined with their gradual attenuation and compacting towards the interior, lends the cuticle in the abdominal region the shape of a thin-walled laminated beam endowed with a wide array of mechanical, thermal, electric, optic, acoustic and probably numerous other properties which render the cuticle efficient for multiple purposes.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, several {{characteristics}} of the Cyprian honeybee Apis mellifera cypria were examined, with particular emphasis on its defensive behaviour during natural or simulated attacks by its main enemy, the <b>oriental</b> <b>hornet.</b> Firstly, genetic analyses using mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA were performed and showed that in {{a large part of}} the island, the Cyprus honeybee population is genetically homogeneous. Regarding the growth of colonies over the year, the maximum growth was observed in May and the minimum in August, and this characteristic pattern differs from that of other subspecies. Next, the defensive behaviour of individual colonies against hornets, the way honeybees kill invading hornets and the sound produced by defending workers, were investigated in detail. Analysis of data collected, showed two different patens of defensive behaviour by individual colonies. When attacking hornets approached the hive, defending workers in certain colonies avoided confrontation with the enemy and retreated inside the hive, while in other colonies, defending honeybees moved towards the hornet and massively attacked it if it tried to catch and kill a honeybee. It was observed, that the two types of defensive behaviour were related to the form of propolis barrier erected at the entrance of the hive. An up to now unknown mechanism by which Cyprus honeybees kill an attacking hornet was revealed after careful examination and analysis of data collected: 50 to 250 workers, cluster around the hornet forming a ball and by immobilizing the abdominal segments, they block the respiratory process causing asphyxiation. xiii Defending honeybees produced a very sharp sound (hissing) when attacked by hornets. This sound was recorded in numerous cases and analysed using appropriate software. The results showed that both the dominant frequencies and the amplitude of constituting harmonics were extremely high and beyond the spectrum of respective frequencies recorded for other western honeybee subspecies or for other species of social bees. Collectively, the above results showed the special defensive behaviour of the Cyprus honeybee, a behaviour which is quite different from other subspecies...|$|E
40|$|This article {{traces the}} {{ontogenesis}} of peripheral electromagnetic receptors (PER) in the cuticle of the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa orientalis). in the abdominal cuticle of adult hornets, the PERs are densely distributed throughout, {{but there are}} even more than 30 {{at the margins of}} the segments. These organelles develop as a network in the hornet cuticle immediately upon its completion. Briefly, from each basic cell of a PER grows a bulge towards the exterior, that is, towards the illuminated region of the cuticle. This bulge develops rapidly and as it grows it starts to push out and lift up the various layers of the cuticle, the while pressing them together. By a spiraling movement, the bulge insinuates itself between the layers, whereupon it dissolves and punctures its way through all the layers of the hypocuticle, via the endocuticle up to the exocuticle. The only cuticular layer that remains intact is the epicuticle, but even that undergoes change, assuming the shape of a smooth surface with a depression at its center. The indented part in the epicuticle is circular, similar to 2. 5 mum in diameter and enables the entry of radiation (illumination) from the outside into the PER, which is located half-way down the cuticle, with the distance from the exterior {{to the base of the}} PER being similar to 25 mum. The numerous lamellae of the cuticle run parallel to one another, but in the region of the bulge they are either perpendicular or directed upwards. This ontogeny of the PERs lends the cuticle a sandwich-like shape, being radically perforated by the PERs bulges, yet covered at the top by the epicuticle and at the bottom by basal cells. The PERs also extend shoots into the cuticular layer and these further perforate the cuticle but also interlink the various PERs. From all the above, it is clear that the cuticle forms first and only subsequently does the network of PERs develop and interpenetrate its various layers...|$|E
40|$|In {{the head}} of the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet,</b> beneath the cuticle, there are plaques of hair cells. These are {{distributed}} throughout the upper front part of the head; to wit: in the region of the vertex (i. e., around and behind the ocelli), in the genae around and behind the compound eyes (the ommatidia), and in the region of the forehead or frons. These hair cells are arranged with their thin whip-like part (i. e., cilia) directed outward and morphologically fall into three distinct groups: type (a) thin elongated cilia connected to each other alongside by side-links; type (b) thin elongated cilia of which two or more interconnect at their distal ends via a delicate nerve fiber bearing a knob at its center; and type (c) shorter and thicker cilia that roughly resemble a triangular thorn and are also interconnected by a thin thread, which, however, bears a ball rather then a knob at its center. The knob in the one case and the ball in the other vary in their diameter, but in both instances the interconnecting elements, be they nerve fibers or threads, are seemingly multidirectional. Beneath the frons, in the region of the coronal suture, the hair cells (cilial plaques) are inwardly directed and bear a large trachea at their center. Presumably, the "weighted" cilial cells that are directed toward the exterior of the body aid the hornet in navigation and gravity determination whereas the inwardly directed ciliary cells may possibly serve in acoustic communication. Another element worthy of mention within the hair cells are yellow granules (yg). These yg's originate from the whip-like portion of the ciliary cells that are distributed beneath the frons plate, and also in the yellow stripes of the gastral cuticle. Conceivably, these yellow granules, in both cases, {{may play a role in}} the absorption and storage of solar energy. In summary, ciliary structures are involved in the hornet in gravity sensing, in acoustical communication and in light sensing, i. e., with some similarity with what happens in vertebrates in the inner ear and in the photoreceptor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} cuticular {{structures on}} the abdomen of the <b>Oriental</b> <b>hornet</b> (Vespa orientalis, Vespinae, Hymenoptera) {{in the region}} of the yellow stripes. A cross section in this region reveals the cuticle to resemble a notebook with more than 30 pages, the topmost pages (analogous to layers) being the thicker (up to 5 mu m or more in thickness) while the ones underneath are gradually thinner. The exterior of the cuticle displays pores which are dispersed at distances of 10 - 50 mu m apart. These pores are actually cuticular depressions which frequently possess eaves on their cephalic side whose internal diameter is 1 - 3 mu m near the surface but further down, {{in the region of}} the yellow pigment and the hypocuticle, this internal diameter broadens to about 20 - 30 mu m. These pores thus extend from the exocuticle down to the hypocuticle. In the spaces between the pores in the endocuticular region there are sinuses. Within these sinuses granules of yellow pigment are located. As for the pores, each of them represents the external outlet of a canal that is perpendicular to the cuticle. The canal walls are composed of the same layers making up the cuticle. Structurally, the canal encasing the pore resembles an upside down arrow. This arrow extends to about 35 - 40 mu m in depth and is narrow and hollow in its upper part-the shaft-for about 1 - 3 mu m, broadens into the shape of an onion in its lower head part (some 20 - 30 mu m in diameter). Down to its tip it becomes slightly sharpened to close at the hypocuticle by forming a concentric, dome shape structure that terminates in a nipple-shaped protuberance. Permeating through all layers of the cuticle are hemolymph, nerve fibers and tracheae. The parallel lamellae associated in the cuticle give the impression of an electrical capacitor. The present article discusses the structure of the cuticle as a photovoltaic system in which the endocuticle-lamellar layer and yellow pigment serves as a solar cell linked to an electrical capacitor. The manner whereby light energy and heat are collected, converted into electric energy, accumulated, transformed and used by the hornet is discussed. We assume that this source of energy is used for their thermoregulation by thermoelectric circuits...|$|E
