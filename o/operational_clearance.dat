The data for normalized Rayleigh-steip and nonrotating tapered-bore seals were in reasonable agreement with theory, but data for the rotating tapered-bore seals were not. The tapered-bore-seal <b>operational</b> <b>clearances</b> estimated from the flow data were significantly larger than calculated. Although clearances are influenced by wear from conical to cylindrical geometry and errors in clearance corrections, the problem was isolated to the shaft temperature - rotational speed clearance correction.

40|$|As the {{capabilities}} of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model full aircraft configurations improve, and the speeds of massively parallel machines increase, {{it is expected that}} CFD simulations will be used more and more to steer or in some cases even replace traditional flight test analyses. The mission of the US Air Force SEEK EAGLE office is to clear any new weapon configurations and loadings for operational use. As more complex weapons are developed and highly asymmetric loadings are requested, the SEEK EAGLE office is tasked with providing <b>operational</b> <b>clearances</b> for literally thousands of different flight configurations. High-fidelity CFD simulations employing the turbulent Navier–Stokes equations are in a prime position to help reduce some of the required wind-tunnel and/or flight test workload. However, these types of CFD simulations are still too time consuming to populate a full stability and control parameter database in a brute-force manner. This article reviews results previously published by the authors, which validate the ability of high-fidelity CFD techniques to compute static force and moment characteristics of aircraft configurations. A methodology to generate efficient but non-linear reduced-order aerodynamic loads models from dynamic CFD solutions, which in-turn may be used to quickly analyse various stability and control characteristics at a particular flight condition, is introduced, and the results based on the US Air Force F- 16 C fighter aircraft that exemplify the process are discussed...|$|R

Preface As the Norwegian People’s Aid celebrates its 70 years as a humanitarian relief organisation, it may add a clear success to its achievements. This evaluation report on the humanitarian mine action activities concludes that Norwegian People’s Aid is not {{only one of the}} leading worldwide organisations in main action, but it is one of very few organisations that is engaged in <b>operational</b> mine <b>clearance</b> programmes, development of new methodologies as well as advocacy, areas that are mutually reinforcing. The report states that the organisation has “demonstrated world class competency” in refining and improving tools for landmine surveys. It is a leader with regards to integration of different types of demining technologies, but also keen to share its knowledge with others within the mine action community. The objectives set for mine action in programmes that have been studied have in general been achieved. Interestingly enough capacity building – often a weak point in development programme...|$|R

50|$|On 10 January 2011, IOC, {{allowing}} IAF {{pilots to}} fly the Tejas, was awarded by Defence Minister A K Antony to Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal P V Naik. The IAF plans to raise the first squadron in Bangalore to iron out issues with ADA and HAL, and eventually base these fighters at Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. In October 2011, Tejas' Final <b>Operational</b> <b>Clearance</b> (FOC) was reportedly delayed from December 2012 until mid-2013 or later. In mid-2012, some sources claimed that the aircraft would not reach FOC and become fully combat capable until 2015. This was later pushed to June 2017.|$|E
50|$|The Final <b>Operational</b> <b>Clearance</b> (FOC) {{campaign}} {{began in}} December 2013, with three aircraft from Tejas flight-line successfully completing advanced weapon trials. The campaign {{was held in}} Jamnagar. New weapons were integrated on the aircraft. As part of the FOC, the aircraft is being readied for all-weather trials in Bangalore and in Gwalior. Tejas took its maiden flight in January 2001, and by December 2013, it had completed 2,587 sorties covering over 1,750 hours. In July 2014, the FOC was pushed back as six or more aircraft were needed for testing and only one had been produced then. Tejas received IOC-II clearance on 17 January 2015 and the FOC was expected by year's end for induction in the Indian Air Force, but has been further pushed down to end of 2016.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this technical note is to document {{the details of the}} infrastructure development process that was realized at the A 0 photo injector facility to establish RF cold testing capability for 1. 3 GHz superconducting niobium single cell cavities. The activity began the last quarter of CY 2006 and ended the first quarter of CY 2009. The whole process involved addressing various aspects such as design of vertical insert and lifting fixture, modification of existing RF test station and design of new couplers, development of a Temperature Mapping (T-Map) system, radiation considerations for the test location (north cave), update of existing High Pressure Rinse (HPR) system, preparation of necessary safety documents and eventually obtaining an <b>Operational</b> Readiness <b>Clearance</b> (ORC). Figure 1 illustrates the various components of the development process. In the past, the north cave test station at A 0 has supported the cold testing 3. 9 GHz nine cell and single cell cavities, thus some of the components were available for use and some needed modification. The test dewar had the capacity to accommodate 1. 3 GHz single cells although a new vertical insert that could handle both cavity types (1. 3 and 3. 9 GHz) had to be designed. The existing cryogenic system with an average capacity of {approx} 0. 5 g/sec was deemed sufficient. The RF system was updated with broadband components and an additional amplifier with higher power capacity to handle higher gradients usually achieved in 1. 3 GHz cavities. The initial testing phase was arbitrated to proceed with fixed power coupling. A new temperature mapping system was developed to provide the diagnostic tool for hot spot studies, quench characterization and field emission studies. The defining feature of this system was the use of diode sensors instead of the traditional carbon resistors as sensing elements. The unidirectional current carrying capacity (forward bias) of the diodes provided for the ease of multiplexing of the system, thus substantially reducing the number of cables required to power the sensors. The high gradient capacity of the 1. 3 GHz cavities required a revision of the radiation shielding and interlocks. The cave was updated as per the recommendations of the radiation safety committee. The high pressure rinse system was updated with new adapters to assist the rinsing 1. 3 GHz single cell cavities. Finally, a proposal for cold testing 1. 3 GHz single cell cavities at A 0 north cave was made to the small experiments approval committee, radiation safety committee and the Tevatron cryogenic safety sub-committee for an <b>operational</b> readiness <b>clearance</b> and the same was approved. The project was classified under research and development of single cell cavities (project 18) and was allocated a budget of $ 200, 000 in FY 2007...|$|R
40|$|Longwall mining {{in lower}} seam heights may necessitate {{the use of}} single-drum shearers to {{overcome}} size constraints associated with standard double-drum shearers. To avoid the <b>operational</b> problem of <b>clearance</b> in the tailgate entry with one single-drum shearer, two single-drum machines can be operated on the same face, with each shearer responsible for mining a predefined portion of the face. However, utilization of two shearers on the same face necessitates the positioning of one shearer operator and a jacksetter in the return air of the upwind shearer, thus complicating respirable dust control on the longwall. In an effort to evaluate the unique dust control problems associated {{with this type of}} mining, the U. S. Bureau of Mines conducted dust surveys on two multiple-machine longwall operations. Sampling was done to quantify major sources of respirable dust and to identify potential solutions to problem areas. Sampling results indicate that the cutting sequences utilized on multiple-machine faces may have to be designed to minimize dust exposure, as opposed to optimizing productivity or facilitating operational requirements. Also, state-of-the-art dust control techniques typically found on double-drum shearer longwalls must be employed to help minimize the exposure of all face personnel to traditional dust sources...|$|R
5000|$|HAL {{initiated}} the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) programme in 1983 {{to develop a}} replacement aircraft for IAF's ageing MiG-21. The remaining MiG-21 Bisons of IAF {{are scheduled to be}} phased out by 2019. After development during the 80s and 90s the first flight occurred in 2001. The aircraft has since been named HAL Tejas. Finally after Initial Operation Clearance status (IOC) Tejas is officially inducted in IAF for Final <b>Operational</b> <b>Clearance</b> (FOC) on 10 January 2014. The IAF plans to order 10 squadrons of the aircraft. [...] The IAF is reported to have a requirement for 200 single-seat and 20 two-seat conversion trainers. It has ordered 40 Tejas. In October 2015 IAF announced that it will induct 100-120 Tejas Mk-IA instead of Mk-I standard. The Mk-IA variant will feature an AESA Radar and improved specifications which will improve its performance.|$|E
50|$|HAL was {{instructed}} by the Indian government to strictly adhere to deadlines to ensure Initial Operational Clearance-II {{by the end}} of 2013 and Final <b>Operational</b> <b>Clearance</b> (FOC) {{by the end of}} 2014.

The first squadron of 18 to 20 Tejas will be based at Sulur Air Force Station, Coimbatore in the state of Tamil Nadu, and it will work to achieve FOC by December 2014. To fulfill the IOC-II standard, the aircraft was certified to carry close to three tons of weapons which include laser-guided 500 kg bombs and short-range R-73 missiles, reach top speeds of 1,350 km per hour, withstand turns up to 7 g, reach angle of attack of 24 degrees (from 17 degrees initially), and have an operational radius of 400-500 km.|$|E
5000|$|A {{week after}} the crash, Bolivian police {{detained}} two individuals on criminal charges related to the crash of Flight 2933. The general director of LaMia was detained on various charges, including involuntary manslaughter. His son, {{who worked for the}} DGAC, was detained for allegedly using his influence to have the aircraft be given an <b>operational</b> <b>clearance.</b> A prosecutor involved with the case told reporters that [...] "the prosecution has collected statements and evidence showing the participation of the accused in the crimes of misusing influence, conduct incompatible with public office and a breach of duties." [...] An arrest warrant was issued for the employee of AASANA in Santa Cruz who had initially refused to approve Flight 2933's flight plan before takeoff and later approved. She fled the country seeking political asylum in Brazil, claiming that after the crash she had been pressured by her superiors to alter a report she had made before the aircraft took off and fearing that Bolivia would not give her a fair trial. A warrant was also issued for the arrest of another of LaMia's co-owners, but he still had not been located four weeks after the crash.|$|E
5000|$|On 19 February 2014 the Indian MOD {{submitted}} {{a statement that}} the development of IJT is in the advanced stages of certification with more than 800 test flights completed so far. The activities are progressing well with completion of sea level trials, night flying trials, high altitude trials as well as weapon and drop tank trials. The activities left for obtaining Final <b>Operational</b> <b>Clearance</b> (FOC) are the refinement of stall characteristics and spin testing which will be commenced as soon as stall characteristics are refined.All efforts are being made to achieve FOC by December 2014. Production of aircraft will commence immediately thereafter. However the stall cannot be tested until HAL redesigns the entire aircraft to correct its [...] "inherent asymmetry". BAE was consulted on certain design changes, specifically the tail. Afterwards the design was put to mathematical and wind tunnel tests. The modified aircraft is expected to complete the spin tests in September 2015 and the production of 85 aircraft for the Indian Air Force to begin. The initial spin trials in 2016 were a success. However, in March 2017 Jane's reported that due to the HJT-36's [...] "unresolvable" [...] issues associated with critical stall and spin characteristics the aircraft is not ready to serve as an intermediate jet trainer for Indian Air Force pilots.|$|E
40|$|Electrically {{conducting}} sheet guideways for levitation offer potential advantages over discrete coil guideways in construction cost and ride quality. Sheet configurations, however, have lower electromagnetic lift to drag ratios than some coil-based EDS (eg- null-flux systems). Sheet guideways {{can have a}} large <b>operational</b> <b>clearance</b> capability if superconducting coils are used, and they are sufficiently “soft ” so that a secondary suspension is not necessary on the vehicle. To compensate for the low damping constant of the suspension, however, feedback control using the propulsion system, aerodynamic control sufaces or other means are required. The lift and drag forces are essentially constant at a given velocity for a sheet guideway as opposed to coil based EDS guideways in which the discrete nature of the coils necessarily results in time varying forces and, in turn, induced vibrations. Parametric results for sheet guideway levitation are presented for lift, drag, and minimum lift-off velocity, together with estimated spring constants for guidance in sample configurations. Design examples are presented and the potential advantages discussed. The latter includes lift per unit weight and drag per unit weight estimates for superconducting and permanent magnet levitation systems...|$|E
40|$|An {{essential}} part of <b>operational</b> <b>clearance</b> of a new aircraft is to certify that {{it is safe to}} fly even when wake vortices generated by another aircraft are encountered. For certification, it must be demonstrated that the aircraft can safely cross the wake at a certain separation distance. When the wake is encountered, air data sensors that measure the directional of airflow in terms of Angle of Attack (AOA / Alpha), Angle of Side Slip (AOSS / Beta / SSA) and pressures (Total and Static Pressure) show large fluctuations. The ADS measurements are used for feedback to the fly-by-wire control laws. These large and rapid fluctuations in the ADS signals affects the commands generated by the fly-by-wire control laws and in turn results in generating high loads on the aircraft. Therefore, before actual flight tests it is necessary to predict the behaviour of Air Data System (ADS) on encountering wake. Appropriate wake encounter protection features should be incorporated in the ADS algorithms. The behaviour of the ADS including the wake protection features during wake must be cleared in a simulation environment. The simulation environment for wake analysis, behaviour of the ADS measurements with and without wake protection features are presented in this paper for a generic high performance aircraft. Paper also briefly presents the wake protection features incorporated in the ADS algorithms...|$|E
