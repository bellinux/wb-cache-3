In addition, <b>the</b> linewidth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> phonon sideband in CuCl QD’s in NaCl crystals was found to increase abruptly from 0. 3 meV to about 1. 2 meV at a confinement energy of about 23 meV, which appears to result from <b>the</b> exciton-phonon mixing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> phonon mode with the first excited state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exciton.

40|$|Recent work on {{receivers}} for the 60 GHz {{band has}} considered various frequency plans to ease <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building blocks, particularly <b>the</b> local oscillator (<b>LO)</b> and <b>the</b> frequency dividers [1 - 3].

The literature in accounting education calls {{for a change in}} traditional teaching methods in order to produce accounting graduates whose skills are more appropriate for the contemporary business and professional environment. To address this deficiency accounting educators have started to explore and use teaching innovations. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> concept has been adapted to a teaching environment, in contrast to most research which has focused on LO in business settings. The paper, through <b>the</b> examination <b>of</b> empirical evidence arising from a natural experiment, was able to determine some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impacts arising from <b>the</b> adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> concept to teaching in a university setting. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper suggest that <b>the</b> adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>LO</b> concept not only resulted in improved student learning outcomes, but also influenced life-long learning.
