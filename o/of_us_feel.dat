500|$|Although Clements and Musker had {{originally}} intended to hire animator Glen Keane to animate Ursula due to his history of animating Disney villains, Keane specifically requested that he be allowed to animate Ariel after hearing Benson sing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for the first time. Captivated by her performance, he {{decided to make the}} scene his most important assignment, volunteering to animate the entire [...] "Part of Your World" [...] musical sequence himself and becoming its lead animator. Animating one particular scene to appear as though the camera is rotating around Ariel while she sings [...] "Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold?" [...] was particularly challenging for the animators to perfect without the aid of computer animation, taking them considerably longer to complete. Keane described the song as the moment [...] "the audience starts thinking of Ariel as this real, living thing. A girl who's dreaming of something more. And since so many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> just like that ... that's when the audience falls in love with this character." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But it sure is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E
2500|$|Destruction: If {{the sublime}} is pulled down to banality, some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> validated. Generally, this is funnier than the contrary. Therefore many humorous transformations {{are made up}} this way: Jesus may love you – but will he respect you in the morning? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess, fellows," [...] said he, [...] "that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feels</b> {{much like}} {{continuing}} our game after what's happened. What {{do you say}} if we {{spend the rest of}} the afternoon showing Pat around the park? Those in favor say aye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} let us all have a hand in that, Andy," [...] put in Spouter. [...] "I believe every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feels</b> the same way {{when it comes to}} old Lemon. He may have a vast amount of {{learning}} stored in his cranium, but his font of the milk of human kindness is completely dried up. Were he to realize, or have the least conception----" ...|$|R
5000|$|.....every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> is in {{one sense}} a born explorer: our only choice is what world we will explore, our only doubt whether our {{exploration}} will be worth the trouble. ... And the idlest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> wonders: the stupidest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> stares: the most ignorant <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feels</b> curiosity: while the thief actively explores his neighbour's pocket or breaks into the [...] "world" [...] of his neighbour's house and plate-closet".

2500|$|Many leading Kurdish {{politicians}} were {{highly critical of}} the report, particularly its recommendation that the Iraqi central government should maintain tight control over the nation's oil revenues. Qubad Talabani, the Kurdistan representative in Washington and the son of Jalal Talbani, complained that [...] "Many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> that centralized tyrannies have led us to what we have today, which is a failed state." [...] Massoud Barzani, the president of the northern Iraqi Kurdistan region, offered similar criticisms, as did Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman.|$|E
2500|$|Haley and {{his work}} have been {{excluded}} from the Norton Anthology of African-American Literature, despite his status as the United States' best-selling African-American author. Harvard University professor Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Jr., one of the anthology's general editors, has denied that the controversies surrounding Haley's works are {{the reason for this}} exclusion. In 1998 Dr. Gates acknowledged the doubts surrounding Haley's claims about Roots, saying, [...] "Most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> it's highly unlikely that Alex actually found the village whence his ancestors sprang. Roots is a work of the imagination rather than strict historical scholarship." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of Nine, Yeston left his {{position}} as associate professor at Yale, although he continued to teach a course there every other semester on songwriting. [...] He turned to writing a musical version of Gaston Leroux's novel, The Phantom of the Opera. [...] He was approached with the idea by actor/director Geoffrey Holder, who held the American rights to the novel. [...] Initially, Yeston was skeptical of the project. [...] "I laughed and laughed.... That's the worst idea in the world! [...] Why {{would you want to}} write a musical based on a horror story?.... And then {{it occurred to me that}} the story could be somewhat changed.... would be a Quasimodo character, an Elephant Man. [...] Don't all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel,</b> despite outward imperfections, that deep inside we're good? [...] And that is a character you cry for." ...|$|E
60|$|I had a {{note from}} Henley, very brief and very sad. We none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> yet <b>feel</b> the loss; but we know {{what he would have}} said and wished.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I said," [...] replied Chebec. [...] "He is Scrapper the Kingbird, as {{of course}} you know. The rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> always <b>feel</b> safe when he is about." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a review}} of the first 6 winners of the ALS Gold Medal, [...] "J.K.E." [...] in The West Australian noted that [...] "The {{characterisation}} is vivid and the writer has the power <b>of</b> making <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> the reality <b>of</b> her people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wish to {{goodness}} you'd give {{up these}} horrible explorations,' cried Dick. 'They make the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> so abominably unadventurous.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have decided}} {{to remain in the}} army and see this war to a finish," [...] said Dave. [...] "We've got the French and their Indian allies on the run, as they call it, and both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> that it's our duty to remain at the front." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I thought I knew {{something}} of women by this time,' Henry said, appealing privately to Lady Montbarry for consolation. 'But Agnes completely puzzles me. It {{is a year}} since Montbarry's death; and she remains as devoted to his memory {{as if he had}} died faithful to her--she still feels the loss of him, as none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|His wife {{drew the}} {{newspaper}} {{out of his}} reach. [...] "Wait a little," [...] she said, quietly; [...] "some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> may <b>feel</b> {{that it is no}} part of our duty to conceal the truth." ...|$|R
60|$|THE EMPEROR. And now, my friends, though I do not, as you see, fear this lion, yet {{the strain}} of his {{presence}} is considerable; for none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can <b>feel</b> quite sure {{what he will do}} next.|$|R
40|$|In What Money Can’t Buy, Sandel {{examines}} one of {{the biggest}} ethical questions of our time and provokes a debate that’s been missing in our market-driven age: What is the proper role of markets in a democratic society, and how can we protect the moral and civic goods that markets do not honour and money cannot buy? Gil Shidlo feels that Sandel brings the issue to be debated and raises it in a way each one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feels</b> fully equipped to voice concerns.

6000|$|... "We must husband {{our supply}} of the gas," [...] said he. [...] "The {{atmosphere}} of the room is now strongly hyperoxygenated, and I take it that none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> any distressing symptoms. We can only determine by actual experiments what amount added to the air will serve to neutralize the poison. Let us see how that will do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] he continued, [...] "that Lord Cheisford {{and in fact}} all {{the others}} are {{inclined}} to accept you on my estimate. We all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> {{that we are the}} victims of some unique and very marvellous piece of roguery {{on the part of some}} one or other. I believe myself that we are on the eve of a discovery." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing about Italy, but {{something}} from Italy," [...] said Hans, with a peculiarity {{in his tone}} and manner which set his mother interpreting. Imagine how some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> and behave when an event, not disagreeable seems to be confirming and carrying out our private constructions. We say, [...] "What do you think?" [...] in a pregnant tone to some innocent person who has not embarked his wisdom {{in the same boat}} with ours, and finds our information flat.|$|E
60|$|Billy Robinson {{was hurt}} last week. A cow kicked him. I {{suppose it is}} wicked <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to <b>feel</b> glad but we all do feel glad {{because of the way}} he cheated us with the magic seed last summer.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are more}} {{wonderful}} even than I thought," [...] he continued softly. [...] "You say so little and you live so near the truth. It is those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>feel</b> as you do--who understand--to whom {{this war is}} so terrible." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grooten smiled upon us--much as a sphynx {{might have}} smiled. It {{had the effect}} <b>of</b> making <b>us</b> both <b>feel</b> very young.|$|R
60|$|Helena sighed, {{and walked}} down the platform. Her heart was beating thickly; she could hardly breathe. The station lamps hung low, so they made a ceiling of heat and dusty light. She suffocated under them. For a moment she beat with hysteria, feeling, as most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> when sick on a hot summer night, as if she must {{certainly}} go crazed, smothered under the grey, woolly blanket of heat. Siegmund was late. It was already twenty-five minutes past ten.|$|E
60|$|I am not {{the first}} who has dared to {{approach}} you in the Shades; for just after your own death the author of 'Les Dialogues des Morts' gave you Paracelsus as a companion, {{and the author of}} 'Le Jugement de Pluton' made the 'mighty warder' decide that 'Moliére should not talk philosophy.' These writers, like most <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>feel</b> that, after all, the comedies of the Contemplateur, of the translator of Lucretius, are a philosophy of life in themselves, and that in them we read the lessons of human experience writ small and clear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Aunt Ruey, you mustn't," [...] said Mara, with a {{voice of}} gentle authority. [...] "We mustn't any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> so any more. There is no harm done, no real evil is coming, only a good which we do not understand. I am {{perfectly}} satisfied--perfectly at rest now. I was foolish and weak to feel as I did this morning, but I shall not feel so any more. I shall comfort you all. Is it anything so dreadful {{for me to go}} to heaven? How little while it will be before you all come to me! Oh, how little--little while!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Reports of the character's return {{arose in}} 2007, with Atkinson {{supposedly}} signing a £100,000 a year {{deal with the}} show. This was eventually denied by {{a spokeswoman for the}} show, who told Digital Spy:"There are no current plans for Gemma Atkinson to return to Hollyoaks in the foreseeable future." [...] Hollyoaks series producer at that time, Bryan Kirkwood, also commented on the speculation of her return: [...] "Gemma's a real star and I have chatted with her and her agent {{about the possibility of a}} future return. None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feels</b> that it's right at the moment but there's a chance it could happen in the future. There's nothing signed and nothing planned for the foreseeable future." ...|$|R
40|$|The other {{transforms}} me into {{an object}} and denies me, I transform {{him into an}} object and deny him. In fact the other's gaze transforms me into an object, and mine him, only if both us withdraw into {{the core of our}} thinking nature, if we both make ourselves into an inhuman gaze, if each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feels</b> his actions to be not taken up and understood, but observed as if they were an insect's. This is what happens, for instance, when I fall under the gaze of a stranger. But even then, the objectification of each by the other's gaze is felt as unbearable only because it takes the place of possible communication. Merleau-Ponty (1962) pp. 360 - 1...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There {{are plenty}} of trains in the afternoon,' said Nutty. 'I don't suppose either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will <b>feel</b> like getting up early. I'll call for you here at half-past six, and we'll have an early dinner and catch the seven-fifteen, shall we? We live very simply, you know. You won't mind that?' ...|$|R
60|$|How like Norman he looks! thought Ethel, as {{she cast}} her last glance and departed. Can he {{be going to}} be ill? If he would only tell when {{anything}} is the matter! I know papa says that some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> with our bodies, and some with our minds; but then I never knew Tom much affected any way, and {{what is all this}} to him? And a sigh betrayed the suppressed heartache that underlaid all her sensations. I am afraid it must be illness; but any way, he will neither tell nor bear to have it noticed, so I can only watch.|$|E
60|$|Let me deal {{first with}} its {{redundancy}}. So far as redundancy goes, {{a great deal}} of the Book of Leviticus, for example, seems not vitally necessary for the ordinary citizen of to-day; there are long explicit directions for temple worship and sacrificial procedure. There is again, so far as the latter day citizen is concerned, an excess of information about the minor Kings of Israel and Judah. And there is more light than most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> we require nowadays upon the foreign policies of Assyria and Egypt. It stirs our pulses feebly, it helps us only very indirectly to learn that Attai begat Nathan and Nathan begat Zabad, or that Obed begat Jehu and Jehu begat Azariah, and so on for two or three hundred verses.|$|E
6000|$|The banker laughed again. [...] "Oh, he {{drew the}} line there, did he? Well, {{we all have to}} draw the line somewhere. Our friend is a novelist, and I will tell you in strict {{confidence}} that the line he has drawn is imaginary. We don't honor any kind of work any more than any other people. If a fellow gets up, the papers make a great ado over his having been a woodchopper or a bobbin-boy, or something of that kind, but I doubt if the fellow himself likes it; he doesn't if he's got any sense. The rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> that it's infra dig., and hope nobody will find out that we ever worked with our hands for a living. I'll go further," [...] said the banker, with the effect of whistling prudence down the wind, [...] "and I will challenge any of you to gainsay me from his own experience or observation. How does esteem usually express itself? When we wish, to honor a man, what do we do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will know}} that it was nothing, my dear. He is good-humoured and playful, and likes the feeling <b>of</b> making <b>us</b> <b>feel</b> that we are not strangers." [...] But Marion knew that Lord Hampstead would not take it as meaning nothing. Though she could see no more than his back as {{he walked out of the}} room, she knew that he was glowing with triumph.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} on so well together," [...] she resumed, [...] "that {{it will not}} be easy for either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to <b>feel</b> {{reconciled}} to a change in our lives. At my age, it will fall hardest on me. What shall I do, Grace, when the day comes for parting with my adopted daughter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One year more," [...] said Bibb, [...] "and I'll {{go back to}} God's country. Oh, I know it's pretty here, and you get dolce far niente {{handed to}} you in chunks, but this country wasn't made for a white man to live in. You've got to have to plug through snow now and then, and see a game of {{baseball}} and wear a stiff collar and have a policeman cuss you. Still, La Paz is a good sort of a pipe-dreamy old hole. And Mrs. Conant is here. When any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>feels</b> particularly like jumping into the sea we rush around to her house and propose. It's nicer to be rejected by Mrs. Conant {{than it is to}} be drowned. And they say drowning is a delightful sensation." ...|$|R
