50|$|They {{fortunately}} had {{a backup}} {{in the form}} of the computers on the ground. They made their first burn to put them into a 265 by 272 km orbit. However Young didn't realize that during the next burn, he had the spacecraft turned slightly, which meant that they introduced an <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error.</b> This meant two extra burns were necessary, and by the time they had docked with the Agena, 60% of their fuel had been consumed. It was decided to keep the Gemini docked to the Agena as long as possible, as this would mean that they could use the fuel on board the Agena for attitude control.|$|E
40|$|A lateral {{guidance}} algorithm which controls {{the location of}} the line of intersection between the actual and desired orbital planes (the hinge line) is developed for the aerobraking phase of a lift-modulated orbital transfer vehicle. The on-board targeting algorithm associated with this {{lateral guidance}} algorithm is simple and concise which is very desirable since computation time and space are limited on an on-board flight computer. A variational equation which describes the movement of the hinge line is derived. Simple relationships between the plane error, the desired hinge line position, the position <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error,</b> and the velocity <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error</b> are found. A computer simulation is developed to test the lateral guidance algorithm for a variety of operating conditions. The algorithm does reduce the total burn magnitude needed to achieve the desired orbit by allowing the plane correction and perigee-raising burn to be combined in a single maneuver. The algorithm performs well under vacuum perigee dispersions, pot-hole density disturbance, and thick atmospheres. The results for many different operating conditions are presented...|$|E
40|$|Results of {{processing}} seven mutual occultation lightcurves are presented. The lightcurves were obtained using the 60 -in. telescope (152 cm) at Mt. Wilson to observe six J 1 occulting J 2 events and one J 3 occulting J 2 event. Using a uniformly illuminated disk model, local satellite Jovicentric longitude corrections of 675 {{plus or minus}} 150 km, 275 plus or minus 240 km, and 1175 plus or minus 350 km for J 1, J 2, and J 3, respectively, were determined. These corrections enabled the event midpoint times to be computed to within 5 sec of the observed midpoint times for all seven events. These longitude corrections have been verified by Pioneer 10 and recent (1973 and 1974) conventional Jovian eclipse observations. A relative J 1 :J 2 <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error</b> of less than a few hundred kilometers has been indicated; however, {{it appears that the}} relative J 3 :J 2 <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error</b> is larger than 600 km. Deficiencies in both the uniformly illuminated disk model and Sampson's theory of the Galilean satellite motions for the reduction of mutual event data are described...|$|E

40|$|In this study, a multi-dimensional strain {{estimation}} method {{is presented to}} assess local relative deformation in three orthogonal directions in 3 D space of skeletal muscles during voluntary contractions. A rigid translation and compressive deformation of a block phantom, that mimics muscle contraction, is used as experimental validation of the 3 D technique and to compare its performance {{with respect to a}} 2 D based technique. Axial, lateral and (in case of 3 D) elevational displacements are estimated using a cross-correlation based displacement estimation algorithm. After transformation of the displacements to a Cartesian coordinate system, strain is derived using a least-squares strain estimator. The performance of both methods is compared by calculating the root-mean-squared error of the estimated displacements with the calculated theoretical displacements of the phantom experiments. We observe that the 3 D technique delivers more accurate displacement estimations compared to the 2 D technique, especially in the translation experiment where out-of-plane motion hampers the 2 D technique. In vivo application of the 3 D technique in the musculus vastus intermedius shows good resemblance between measured strain and the force pattern. Similarity of the strain curves of repetitive measurements indicates the reproducibility of voluntary contractions. These results indicate that 3 D ultrasound is a valuable imaging tool to quantify complex tissue motion, especially when there is motion in three directions, which results in <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>errors</b> for 2 D techniques...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} misalignments in ply orientation, uniform variations in ply thickness, and through-thickness thermal gradients on the post-cure shape errors for symmetric cross-ply laminates constructed from ultra-thin composite materials. Photogrammetry-based surface measurements are performed for laminates cured at elevated temperatures. Significant <b>out-of-plane</b> shape <b>errors</b> are observed, with amplitudes ∼ 75 times the laminate thickness. The magnitude of each imperfection is also characterized experimentally on coupon-level samples. A non-linear finite element model is developed and demonstrates that these imperfections result in cylindrical and twisting modes of deformation. Results are compared to Classical Lamination Theory predictions which are shown to be inadequate in predicting shape errors that require changes in Gaussian curvature. Through these studies, it is determined that thickness variations between {{the top and bottom}} plies have the most pronounced effect on shape errors...|$|R

Although these observations numbered only 17 out of the 520 that produced the final ground-based Ida ephemeris for the Galileo spacecraft flyby, their inclusion decreased Ida's downtrack error from 78 to 60 km and its <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error</b> from 58 to 44 km...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of knee joint laxity is clinically important but its quantification remains elusive. Calibrated, low dosage fluoroscopy, combined with registered surfaces and controlled external loading may offer possible solutions for quantifying relative tibio-femoral motion without soft tissue artefact, even in native joints. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the accuracy of registration using CT and MRI derived 3 D bone models, as well as metallic implants, to 2 D single-plane fluoroscopic datasets, to assess their suitability for examining knee joint laxity. Four cadaveric knees and one knee implant were positioned using a micromanipulator. After fluoroscopy, the accuracy of registering each surface to the 2 D fluoroscopic images was determined by comparison against known translations from the micromanipulator measurements. Dynamic measurements were also performed to assess the relative tibio-femoral error. For CT and MRI derived 3 D femur and tibia models during static testing, the in-plane error was 0. 4 mm and 0. 9 mm, and <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error</b> 2. 6 mm and 9. 3 mm respectively. For metallic implants, the in-plane error was 0. 2 mm and <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error</b> 1. 5 mm. The relative tibio-femoral error during dynamic measurements was 0. 9 mm, 1. 2 mm and 0. 7 mm in-plane, and 3. 9 mm, 10. 4 mm and 2. 5 mm out-of-plane for CT and MRI based models and metallic implants respectively. The rotational errors ranged from 0. 5 ° to 1. 9 ° for CT, 0. 5 – 4. 3 ° for MRI and 0. 1 – 0. 8 ° for metallic implants. The results of this study indicate that single-plane fluoroscopic analysis can provide accurate information in the investigation of knee joint laxity, but should be limited to static or quasi-static evaluations when assessing native bones, where possible. With this knowledge of registration accuracy, targeted approaches for the determination of tibio-femoral laxity could now determine objective in vivo measures for the identification of ligament reconstruction candidates as well as improve our understanding of the consequences of knee joint instability in TKA...|$|E
40|$|The {{applications}} of shearography technique for NDT and material evaluation have been acknowledged by many industries. However, the application is mainly limited to qualitative measurement. Studies {{show that the}} major problem encountered in quantitative measurement using this technique is related to error associated in the measurement system and other geometrical factors. In this paper, {{the analysis of the}} shearography equipment for field {{applications of}} out-of-plane and in-plane analysis is presented and discussed. The optical phase analysis when considering the error associated with the curvature of beam illumination and the imaging angle in the measurement are also presented. It was observed that the errors due to the curvature illumination and the imaging angle are higher than ± 10 % at object distance of less than 100 cm. The in-plane error is found more predominantly compared to <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error.</b> The theoretical error functions for both in-plane and out-of-plane measurements are also presented. 1...|$|E
40|$|A three dimensional, automatic, anatomy-based {{system for}} portal {{verification}} {{has been developed}} based on an FFT implementation of Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC). The PCC requires no anatomy or point-pair identification, is robust when encountering changes in scaling and shifts in image amplitudes and requires no priori knowledge of the anatomy, which makes it an ideal candidate for portal-to-DRR image registration. Features for matching are selected from orthogonal portal images and compared to the corresponding megavoltage DRR. The position of the highest correlation value is then converted into beam-to-patient geometry and compared with the actual patient setup. By continuously generating DRRs, the system is capable of verifying translation errors, in-plane rotation and <b>out-of-plane</b> rotation <b>errors.</b> The mean accuracy of translation and rotation registrations tests were 0. 58 mm and 0. 79 ° respectively for DRR-to-DRR matching, and 1. 22 mm and 1. 31 ° respectively for portal-to-DRR matching...|$|R
40|$|Planar (XY) {{motion is}} {{traditionally}} achieved by stacking two linear slides. Moreover, to achieve high system accuracy, stacking of two additional short-stroke high-resolution linear stages might be required. Downsides from this approach are bulkiness, a cumulative loss of stiffness, and cumulative in-plane and <b>out-of-plane</b> motion <b>errors.</b> Since these downsides all result from serial {{integration of the}} degrees of freedom, a system with parallel kinematics is proposed. As {{is shown in the}} above Figure, a ring-shaped rotor which holds either three or six Leuven piezomotors, has been built. The Leuven motor is an ultrasonic piezomotor with additional scanning and stick-slip drive modes. Its balanced design allows stiff fixation to the ring-shaped motor. The Leuven motors are therefore able to both carry and drive the system. Moreover, active out-of-plane stiffness regulation can be achieved. The design of the system and initial experimental results are presented. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the next}} {{generation}} of mine hunting sonars, in particular on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS) will play an important role. The benefit of SAS is to increase resolution and signal-tonoise ratio by coherent processing of successive pings. A challenge in SAS is the computational load. This is caused primarily by the actual transformation of motion compensated acoustic data into an image, i. e. beamforming. The major issue for the fastest method, wavenumber frequency processing, is the assumption that the synthetic aperture is a uniform linear anay. Platform deviations from the straight track degrade performance. This paper describes two methods to compensate for these deviations. Theoretical performance of the methods is presented for both in-plane and <b>out-of-plane</b> path <b>errors.</b> They are tested {{for a wide range of}} system conhgurations, including experimental navigation data from the HUGIN AUV. The result is a proof of operational validity of the proposed methods...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to tactile extensometers 2 D digital image correlation (2 D-DIC) works contactless and thus without slip. It measures {{not only the}} average strain between two points, it also allows for full-field analysis, e. g. the analysis of material failure cause. While these advantages also apply to the standard DIC systems available today, such systems so far have a significant disadvantage – their slow measuring speed with maximum sampling rates below 100 Hz. Strain-controlled fatigue measurements with such sensors are possible but limited by their low speed. According to ASTM E 606, at least 400 images per fatigue cycle are necessary to resolve strain amplitude better than 1 %. Hence the fatigue cycle frequency is limited to 0. 25 Hz for such DIC systems resulting in a measurement time of more than 11 h for a typical strain-controlled low cycle fatigue experiment with 10. 000 cycles. So far, mechanical extensometers have sampling frequencies in the kHz range and thus accelerate those experiments to less than 1 h. To overcome this limitation of slow optical measurement, the 2 D-DIC evaluation was implemented on a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 graphics processing unit (GPU) allowing for up to 25. 000 FFT evaluations per second (both, forward and backward) of 256 x 256 pixel ROIs. For subpixel displacement calculation, 2 D polynomials of second order are fitted to the 3 x 3 pixel area surrounding the correlation maximum. The standard deviation of the “Low Contrast Subpixel Contrast Images” was below 0. 01 pixels (1 sigma) for a 30 x 30 pixel kernel size. This high-speed GPU evaluation was paired with a high-resolution telecentric lens with 10 mm FOV minimizing the <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>error,</b> coaxial LED illumination allowing for an exposure time of 300 µs, and a fast CameraLink camera acquiring 2040 x 256 pixel images with 1. 3 kHz. This is sufficient to resolve the microstructure even on polished cylindrical samples. A blue LED was used to separate the blackbody radiation from the illumination light by a short pass filter. The result is a high-speed DIC system with a strain measurement rate of 1. 2 kHz, 6 ms delay time and a total error {{in the range of}} 2 * 10 (- 5) (1 sigma). The strain signals were even less noisy than those measured mechanically and they were sufficient to resolve the turning points of a 10 Hz triangular force controlled measurement. So the DIC sensor is well suited for strain-controlled measurements combing the advantages of both, marker-free optical and fast tactile mechanical extensometers...|$|E
40|$|Although the orientations of {{the hand}} and forearm vary for {{different}} wrist rehabilitation protocols, their effect on muscle forces has not been quantified. Physiologic simulators enable a biomechanical evaluation of the joint by recreating functional motions in cadaveric specimens. Control strategies used to actuate joints in 5 physiologic simulators usually employ position or force feedback alone to achieve optimum load distribution across the muscles. After successful tests on a phantom limb, unique combinations of position and force feedback – hybrid control and cascade control – were used to simulate multiple cyclic wrist motions of flexion-extension, radioulnar deviation, dart thrower’s motion, and 10 circumduction using six muscles in ten cadaveric specimens. Low kinematic errors and coefficients of variation of muscle forces were observed for planar and complex wrist motions using both novel control strategies. The effect of gravity was most pronounced when the hand was in the horizontal orientation, resulting in higher extensor forces (p< 0. 017) and higher <b>out-of-plane</b> kinematic <b>errors</b> (p< 0. 007), {{as compared to the}} vertically 15 upward or downward orientations. Muscle forces were also affected by the direction of rotation during circumduction. The peak force of flexor carpi radialis was higher in clockwise circumduction (p= 0. 017), while that of flexor carpi ulnaris was higher in anticlockwise circumduction (p= 0. 013). Thus, the physiologic wrist simulator accurately replicated cyclic planar and complex motions in cadaveric specimens. Moreover, the dependence of muscle 20 forces on the hand orientation and the direction of circumduction could be vital in the specification of such parameters during wrist rehabilitation...|$|R
40|$|A major {{component}} of total resistive force in cycling is aerodynamic drag. For speeds greater than ~ 14 m/s aerodynamic drag accounts for approximately 90 % of total resistive force (Debraux et al., 2009 : International Journal of Sports Medicine, 30, 266 - 272). Together with the air density, the coefficient of drag and the velocity of the cyclist-bike, an important determinant of aerodynamic drag is projected frontal area. Several techniques {{have been used to}} estimate the projected frontal area of a cyclist-bike, including the weighing of photographs and image digitising (Debraux et al., 2009). These techniques are similar as they involve extracting the cyclist-bike from a two-dimensional (2 D) image and using scaling information from a plane of known dimensions. With the weighing photographs method this is done physically using sensitive weighing scales whereas image processing software is used for the image digitising technique. Both techniques require the collection of a calibration plane, involve considerable post-processing and cannot be performed in real time. We have developed a depth camera-based system for estimating cyclist-bike projected frontal area which addresses these issues. The depth camera algorithm works by creating a metrically scaled, three-dimensional point cloud of the cyclist-bike. The point cloud is projected on to a 2 D representation of the scene and the area of the point cloud is calculated using a technique similar to ‘voxelization’; points in the cloud occupy spaces in a fine grid – the sum of the occupied grid spaces gives total area. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the agreement between our new method and the image digitising technique. After institutional ethics approval, eight regular cyclists volunteered to participate and provided written informed consent. Participants wore their normal cycling clothing and their bicycle was mounted on a stationary indoor trainer. The bicycle was positioned against a white background to help with the image digitising method. Participants placed their feet on the pedals and held the cranks parallel to the floor. A digital camera (Canon EOS 400 D, 10. 1 megapixel) and Kinect depth camera (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) were mounted on tripods at a height of 1. 1 m and positioned 5 m and 2. 2 m in front of the participant, respectively. Similar to Debraux et al. (2009), participants adopted two positions on the bike: 1. Upright – upright torso with hands close to the stem and 2. Drops Position – hands on the drops. Three repeat captures were performed in each position, with the participant relaxing between each capture. The digitising method was performed as described by Debraux et al. (2009). Agreement between methods was assessed using limits of agreement (LOA - Bland and Altman, 1986 : Lancet, 1, 307 - 310). A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (method by position) was used to assess the effect of cyclist position on the systematic difference between measurement methods. There was no interaction between cyclist position and measurement method (p = 0. 201) indicating that the same effect of cyclist position was observed using both measurement techniques. A significant main effect for cyclist position (p = 0. 017) indicated that projected frontal area was smaller with hands on the drops (upright: 0. 485 m 2, drops: 0. 434 m 2). There was also a significant main effect for measurement method (p < 0. 001) indicating a significantly smaller estimation of projected frontal area using the Kinect (Kinect: 0. 416 m 2, Image: 0. 503 m 2). A predominantly systematic difference between methods was also suggested by the LOA analysis (upright: 0. 086 ± 0. 029 m 2, drops: 0. 090 ± 0. 033 m 2). The aim of this study was to assess the agreement between a common method of estimating cyclist-bike frontal area and a new depth camera-based technique. The new technique estimated systematically smaller projected frontal area than the image digitisation method but there was relatively little random variation and the same effect of cyclist position was observed with both techniques. Which technique gives the most accurate estimate of projected frontal area is not clear as the image digitisation technique - to which the new technique was compared - has associated errors e. g. identification of the cyclist-bike outline and <b>out-of-plane</b> <b>errors.</b> However, it was apparent during testing that the depth camera-based system often failed to identify parts of the bike and this is most likely the cause of the difference between techniques. Regardless, the results of this study suggest that the new technique can be used to assess changes in projected frontal area – as the cyclist changes position, for example. Further, the new technique offers the possibility of analysing changes in projected frontal area in real time – there is no requirement for calibration or post-processing...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from quantitative {{assessments of the}} accuracy of velocity gradients measured by a dual-plane stereo particle image velocimetry (DSPIV) technique that allows direct, highly resolved, nonintrusive measurements of all nine simultaneous components of the velocity gradient tensor fields ∂ui/∂xj∂ui∕∂xj at the quasi-universal intermediate and small scales of turbulent shear flows. The present results systematically determine the sources of errors in DSPIV measurements and the resulting accuracy of velocity gradients obtained from such measurements. Intrinsic errors resulting from asymmetric stereo imaging are found by synthetic particle imaging to be no larger than 0. 8 %. True particle imaging in finite-thickness light sheets is found from single-plane imaging tests to produce net errors in measured velocity differences of 6 % for in-plane components and 10 % for <b>out-of-plane</b> components. Further <b>errors</b> from limits on the accuracy of independent dual light sheet generation and positioning are found from coincident-plane imaging tests to produce overall errors of 9 % and 16 % in the in-plane and out-of-plane velocity differences. Practical DSPIV velocity gradient component measurements are found from separated-plane imaging tests in a turbulent shear flow to show excellent similarity in on-diagonal (i = j) (i=j) and off-diagonal (i ≠ j) (i≠j) components of ∂ui/∂xj∂ui∕∂xj, as well as mean-square gradient values showing agreement within 1 %– 4 % of ideal isotropic limit values. The resulting measured divergence values are consistent with overall rms errors obtained from the coincident-plane imaging tests. Collectively, these results establish the accuracy with which all nine simultaneous components of the velocity gradient tensor fields ∂ui/∂xj∂ui∕∂xj {{can be obtained from}} DSPIV measurements at the quasi-universal intermediate and small scales of turbulent shear flows...|$|R
