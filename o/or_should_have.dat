Some other isotopes in this region are predicted to have comparable or even longer half-lives, with the longest-lived predicted isotope being 272Sg {{which is expected to}} have a half-life of about an hour. Additionally, 263Sg, 265Sg, 265mSg, as well as the predicted 268Sg have <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> half-lives measured in seconds. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives measured in milliseconds, {{with the exception of the}} shortest-lived isotope, 261mSg, with a half-life of only 92microseconds.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{returned}} {{to file a}} lawsuit in Tennessee state court in October 2003 {{on behalf of the}} victims of two teenage stepbrothers who had pleaded guilty to reckless homicide, endangerment, and assault. Since the boys told investigators they were inspired by Grand Theft Auto III, Thompson sought $246 million in damages from the publisher, Take-Two Interactive, along with PlayStation 2 maker Sony Computer Entertainment America and retailer Wal-Mart. The suit charged that the defendants knew <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> known that the game would cause copycat violence. On October 22, 2003, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Two days later, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal, and the case was closed.|$|E

25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1930–31, Hobbs was invited to join a private team run by the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram which toured India and Ceylon. Sutcliffe joined him, and he was {{accompanied}} by his wife. Both Hobbs and Sutcliffe were extremely popular.

25|$|T had conceded {{before the}} trial that Mrs Hancock's and Mr Margereson's {{illnesses}} were caused by asbestos from the factory, but any compensation depended on proving that the company knew <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> known the dangers the dust could cause. Three months after the hearing ended Mr. Justice Holland handed down a written judgment, finding for the plaintiffs, and awarded damages of £65,000 to June Hancock and £50,000 to Evelyn Margereson. The judge ruled that the defendant was liable {{on the grounds that}} the risks of asbestos dust exposure had been known by the defendant since 1933 and it was foreseeable that children allowed to play in the vicinity of the factory would be exposed to the risk of pulmonary disease. This was a landmark decision, extending as it did the duty of care beyond factory employees to those outside a factory's walls.|$|E

25|$|On 19 February 2013, Strate {{applied for}} a trial de novo based on {{evidence}} that the presiding judge had committed numerous instances of perversion of justice against Mollath in the case. According to Strate, the judge was responsible for Mollath's detention for almost three weeks without disclosure of the charges or presentation to a judge, failure to respond to Mollath's complaints or forward them to the higher court that should have decided them, manipulation of the court's composition, obvious misrepresentations in {{the reasons for the}} judgment, and unconscionable refusal to discharge Mollath's assigned counsel in spite of many petitions to do so, followed by use of said counsel as a witness against his own client. To prevent duplication of effort with the prosecution, which was preparing a similar application of its own, the application was based exclusively on material that was, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been, available to the original court {{at the time of the}} original verdict. The application was debated in the legal committee of the Bavarian Parliament.|$|E

The evidence that petitioner was ready and willing to commit the offense came only after the Government had devoted 2½ years to convincing him that he had <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> the right to engage in the very behavior proscribed by law.|$|E

He played several representative matches and took part in the 150th century opening partnership of his career. In total, he scored 2,418 first-class runs in the season at 56.23. In 1932, despite missing several matches owing to injuries and fatigue, he scored 1,764 runs at 56.90, including centuries in each innings against Essex. According to Mason, this latter performance prompted Douglas Jardine to nickname Hobbs [...] "The Master". Hobbs scored 161 not out for the Players against the Gentlemen, his 16th century in the fixture, to pass the record total of Grace for the Gentlemen.|$|E
500|$|... or [...] "with-knowledge". The English word implies {{internal}} {{awareness of}} a moral standard in the mind concerning the quality of one's motives, {{as well as a}} consciousness of our own actions. Thus conscience considered philosophically may be first, and perhaps most commonly, a largely unexamined [...] "gut feeling" [...] or [...] "vague sense of guilt" [...] about what ought to be <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been done. Conscience in this sense is not necessarily the product of a process of rational consideration of the moral features of a situation (or the applicable normative principles, rules or laws) and can arise from parental, peer group, religious, state or corporate indoctrination, {{which may or may not}} be presently consciously acceptable to the person ("traditional conscience"). Conscience may be defined as the practical reason employed when applying moral convictions to a situation ("critical conscience"). In purportedly morally mature mystical people who have developed this capacity through daily contemplation or meditation combined with selfless service to others, critical conscience can be aided by a [...] "spark" [...] of intuitive insight or revelation (called marifa in Islamic Sufi philosophy and synderesis in medieval Christian scholastic moral philosophy). Conscience is accompanied in each case by an internal awareness of 'inner light' and approbation or 'inner darkness' and condemnation as well as a resulting conviction of right or duty either followed or declined.|$|E
