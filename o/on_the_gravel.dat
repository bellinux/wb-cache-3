From 1993 Widerøe started {{replacing}} these with the larger de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, but had to keep one Twin Otter in operation past 1995 because it could not land <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> runway at Båtsfjord. To allow for Dash 8 services, a new airport was built further up in the valley. It opened on 9 September 1999, {{the same day the}} old airport was closed.|$|E
25|$|The adult beluga {{is rarely}} mistaken {{for any other}} species, because it is {{completely}} white or whitish-grey in colour. Calves are usually born grey, {{and by the time}} they are a month old, have turned dark grey or blue grey. They then start to progressively lose their pigmentation until they attain their distinctive white colouration, at the age of seven years in females and 9 in males. The white colouration of the skin is an adaptation to life in the Arctic that allows belugas to camouflage themselves in the polar ice caps as protection against their main predators, polar bears and killer whales. Unlike other cetaceans, the belugas seasonally shed their skin. During the winter, the epidermis thickens and the skin can become yellowish, mainly on the back and fins. When they migrate to the estuaries during the summer, they rub themselves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> of the riverbeds to remove the cutaneous covering.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{possibility}} is that the longphort was established <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> ridge overlooking the Black Pool – the most easily defended location in Dublin – and that its remains were subsequently buried or obliterated by the later 10th century settlement of Dyflinn, which {{was built in the}} same location (not to mention Dublin Castle, which presently occupies the site). The discovery of what are thought to be late 9th-century earthen banks in Ross Road and Werburgh Street (immediately west of Dublin Castle) lends some support to this theory. The other {{possibility is that}} the longphort was situated on the eastern or southern side of the Black Pool, and that Norse settlement began here, expanding northwards and westwards across the Poddle in the late 9th century. Norse houses to the west of these banks all appear to date from the Second Viking Age (917–1170). It is also a possibility that the location of the longphort was changed after the destruction of the original settlement in 849.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, {{he began}} racing on asphalt ovals {{when he entered}} the American Speed Association (ASA) as well as {{part-time}} in the NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series). In the same year, Johnson won the ASA Pat Schauer Memorial Rookie title. One year later, he had two wins and finished third in the standings. In 2000, he was announced the driver for Herzog Motorsports in the Busch Series. During the season, he had a spectacular accident on lap 46 during the Lysol 200 at Watkins Glen when his brakes failed entering the first turn. He had to swerve quickly to the right to avoid the 86 of Dennis Demers, but went into the grass on the inside of turn one, then went back across the track, caught some air <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> trap before finally crashing head-on into the carafoam barriers {{at the far end of}} the turn while still more than 150+ MPH. Many feared that this accident could have resulted in career ending injuries or potentially have killed him, but he climbed out of the car unscathed and raised his fists in the air like he'd won the race, much to the delight of the crowd. Otherwise, in a rather uneventful season which featured one DNQ at Daytona and 6 top-10's, he finished tenth in the point standings. During the 2001 season, Johnson recorded one win, which was at Chicagoland Speedway, and finished eighth in the point standings. He also began racing in the Winston Cup Series (now Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) for Hendrick Motorsports. In the following season, Johnson left Herzog Motorsports to move to Hendrick Motorsports in the Winston Cup Series, driving the No. 48 Lowe's Chevrolet.|$|E
500|$|Massa's {{touch on}} Hamilton's car on lap two was {{labelled}} by the McLaren driver [...] "as deliberate {{as it could}} be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying [...] "I had two wheels <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel.</b> I could not stop the car and I was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> because he pushed me into the gravel." [...] Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for The Daily Telegraph, said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was [...] "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.|$|E
500|$|Following the 1962 mining {{accident}} {{and the subsequent}} Kings Bay Affair, Ny-Ålesund was transformed from a mining town to a research outpost. The need for an airport to support commercial activity in Ny-Ålesund arose in 1965 {{with the construction of}} Kongsfjord Telemetry Station. The Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research needed to have an aviation connection with Longyearbyen to send magnetic tapes with the downloaded data to Germany. A road was built from the settlement to Hamnerabben, the site of the telemetry station. The top of the hill was sufficiently flat that a runway could be constructed. It was built by giving a [...] long straight section of the road a width of [...] Waste oil was poured <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> to bind it. A smaller road was built {{to the north of the}} runway to allow road transport while the runway was in use.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{electrification}} of American {{cities in}} the 1880s, the young Goddard became interested in science—specifically, engineering and technology. When his father showed him how to generate static electricity on the family's carpet, the five-year-old's imagination was sparked. Robert experimented, believing he could jump higher if the zinc from a battery could be charged by scuffing his feet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> walk. But, holding the zinc, he could jump no higher than usual. Goddard halted the experiments after a warning from his mother that if he succeeded, he could [...] "go sailing away and {{might not be able}} to come back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thorpe Park Resort is a {{theme park}} resort located between the towns of Chertsey and Staines-upon-Thames in Surrey. It is {{operated}} and owned by Merlin Entertainments. After demolition of the Thorpe Park Estate in the 1930s, the site became a gravel pit. Thorpe Park Resort {{was built in the}} 1970s <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> pit which was partially flooded, creating a water-based theme for the park. This essentially allows guests to view the park as an island, which is where the park's current [...] "island like no other" [...] slogan originates from. It was officially opened to the public by the late Lord Louis Mountbatten in 1979. It has since grown into one of the major theme parks in the UK and now also features a hotel.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, Top Hat {{customers}} would park their automobiles anywhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> {{parking lot and}} walk up to place their orders. However, {{on a trip to}} Louisiana, Smith saw a drive-in that used speakers for ordering. He suspected that he could increase his sales by controlling the parking and having the customers order from speakers at their cars, with carhops delivering the food to the cars. Smith borrowed several automobiles from a friend who owned a used-car lot to establish a layout for controlled parking. He also had some so-called [...] "jukebox boys" [...] come in and wire an intercom system in the parking lot. Sales immediately tripled. Charles Woodrow Pappe, an entrepreneur, chanced upon the Shawnee drive-in and was impressed. He and Smith negotiated the first franchise location in Woodward, Oklahoma, in 1956, based on nothing more than a handshake. By 1958, two more drive-ins were built, in Enid and Stillwater.|$|E
2500|$|During the winter, travel {{along the}} {{roads in the}} basin can become {{difficult}} to impossible depending on snow accumulation, particularly on the more remote gravel roads that are not regularly plowed. If road conditions or car trouble strand a motorist in the more remote areas of the basin, during the pulses of intense winter cold common to this area, {{there is a real}} risk of death or injury by freezing. The Tongue River basin does not have the [...] "gumbo" [...] type mud that affects road travel in wet weather {{on the north side of}} the Yellowstone River. Traffic <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> and dirt roads of the Tongue River basin is a problem at sharp corners, blind hilltops, concealed entrances to side roads, and when suddenly encountering oversized slow ranch/farm vehicles. In warm weather it is a good idea to keep an eye out ahead for dust clouds indicating approaching vehicles. The motorist traveling in the Tongue River basin should keep a constant look out for livestock on the road, and especially for deer (particularly at dawn, dusk and at night).|$|E
2500|$|The {{landscape}} {{has been}} described as [...] "Kahn's most elegant built example of landscape planning" [...] by Philadelphia landscape architect George Patton. Approaching the main entrance past a lawn edged by pools with running water, the visitor enters a courtyard through a grove of Yaupon Holly trees. The sound of footsteps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>gravel</b> walkway echoes from the walls {{on either side of the}} courtyard and is magnified under the curved ceiling of the entry porch. [...] After that subtle preparation, the visitor enters the hushed museum with silvery light spread across its ceiling. Harriet Pattison played the lead role in the landscape design and is also the person who suggested that open porches flanking the entrance would create a good transition from the lawn and courtyard to the galleries inside. [...] Pattison, who had also worked with Kahn on other projects, was an employee of Patton. She is the mother of film director Nathaniel Kahn, Louis Kahn's son who made the film [...] "My Architect" [...] about his father.|$|E

There are exposures of Blisworth clay, Blisworth Limestone, Upper Estuarine Series, and Upper Lincolnshire Limestone. Holywell’s quarries supplied stone for various building projects including Windsor Castle.|$|R
