40|$|The choanoflagellates (Choanoflagellatea) {{comprise}} a major group of nanoflagellates, which are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. Recent molecular phylogenies have shown {{them to be}} the sister group to the Metazoa. However, the phylogeny of the choanoflagellates is still far from understood. We present here a 29 taxon, multigene phylogeny that robustly places {{the root of the}} choanoflagellates. One of the original nonloricate families, Codonosigidae is shown to be a polyphyletic assemblage nested within the Salpingoecidae. We elaborate on a revised taxonomy that divides Choanoflagellatea into two orders: Craspedida and Acanthoecida. Craspedida is composed of species that possess an <b>organic</b> cell <b>coating</b> and contains the single family Salpingoecidae. Members of the predominantly marine Acanthoecida produce a siliceous lorica in addition to an <b>organic</b> <b>coat</b> and are contained in two families—the Acanthoecidae and Stephanoecidae fam. n. Previous studies of choanoflagellates have been hindered by cases of taxon misidentification as well as the limited resolution of 18 S small subunit (SSU) rDNA phylogenies. Unfortunately, cases of misidentification have been heavily repeated in the literature. In an attempt to avoid further confusion, we highlight known instances of misnamed taxa. We also examine the suitability of SSU rDNA sequences alone for choanoflagellate phylogenetics and recommend the use of protein-coding genes, such as hsp 90 and tubA, whenever possible...|$|R

50|$|Clays, zeolites, {{and other}} natural {{material}} have a high capacity for cation exchange. They do this by creating a net negative charge by substituting lower-valent cations (e.g. Al3+) with a higher-valent cation (e.g. Si4+) within the mineral structure. Adding sorbed surfactants can change the affinity for anions and nonpolar organic compounds. Surfactants that have accumulated at the surface will create a hydrophobic <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> that promotes sorption of non-polar organic compounds. Surfactant Modified Zeolites (SMZs) are promising for treating non-polar organic contaminants. However, clay's low permeability means it cannot be used in flow-through PRBs, but have been proposed for use in slurry walls, landfill liners, and containment barriers. Zeolites; however, have cavities to maintain hydraulic conductivity, allowing their use in PRBs.|$|E

The model gives sizes closer to those seen with TEM (e.g., 70 nm for the platelet), indicating that the samples probably {{have a lot of}} ligand present, reducing their density.

Thus, we established a model this way: calculate the extinction efficiency of a Ag-Tween 80 alloy ellipsoid (Ag/Tween 80 = 7 : 3), whose ratio of the major axis to minor axis equals to 2 : 1. Then, mix it with Ag-Tween 80 alloy sphere particles (Ag/Tween 80 = 8 : 2).

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that using <b>organic</b> <b>coated</b> bubbles (“oily” bubbles) could {{increase}} bitumen recovery rate in flotation. One way to coat bubbles is that used in the air-assisted solvent extraction process where solvent foam is formed and injected through a capillary to release solvent coated bubbles {{in a controlled manner}} into the aqueous system. To investigate adapting this approach, the foaming properties of some organics (Hexane, Heptane, Hexadecane, Petroleum Ether, Toluene, Benzene and Kerosene and their binary mixtures) of potential interest in oily bubble bitumen flotation were investigated. Silicone oil was found to be a good foaming agent in some cases. Bubble stability and film thickness experiments were carried out to help select candidate organics. Surface tension and dynamic viscosity measurements were conducted to examine the mechanism of foaming. Attachment studies showed that droplets of the selected organics readily attached to a bitumen surface compared to air bubbles. From a combination of criteria, 25 : 75 Hexadecane/Heptane appears to be a promising candidate...|$|R

Also, great effort has been spent to understand the mechanisms of the coatings degradation as well as the mechanisms of anticorrosion protection given by the pigments. In this way, the results of interest have been delivered to scientific community via a number of publications in different journals as well as congresses participations. Lastly, the activities in this thesis were supported by the SteelCoat project.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{properties of}} magnesium alloys, especially the high strength/weight ratio, make them desirable {{materials in the}} automotive industry. However, their high corrosion susceptibility has greatly limited or even prevented their larger scale use for various applications. <b>Organic</b> <b>coating</b> {{is one of the}} most effective ways to prevent magnesium alloys from corrosion. In this report, the recent progress of organic coatings on magnesium alloys and techniques for evaluating the performance of organic coatings are reviewed. As a critical layer in a normal coating system, <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> has great potential to prevent magnesium alloys from corrosion attack. However, some unsolved problems currently limit the application of organic coatings. Firstly, organic coatings usually have poor adhesion if they are applied without an appropriate pre-treatment. Sol-gel coating or plasma polymerization requires the least pre-treatment prior to deposition. However, the corrosion and wear resistance of these coatings have not been documented. Secondly, it is difficult to prepare a uniform, pore-free organic layer. So, it is usually necessary to apply multiple layers of these coatings to provide sufficient/optimum corrosion and wear resistance. Finally, a number of <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> techniques are still solvent based, which poses an environmental concern. New water-borne and powder coating technologies should be developed. In order to evaluate the performance of organic coatings on magnesium, both electrochemical and non-electrochemical techniques have been developed. Information from different techniques gives insight into the organic coating/magnesium alloy interface in different aspects. Comprehensive knowledge about the interface is indispensible for understanding the degradation of the <b>organic</b> <b>coating</b> and developing new coating strategies. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM.

40|$|Unionid shells are {{characterized}} by an outer aragonitic prismatic layer and an inner nacreous layer. The prisms {{of the outer shell}} layer are composed of single-crystal fibres radiating from spheruliths. During prism development, fibres progressively recline to the growth front. There is competition between prisms, leading to the selection of bigger, evenly sized prisms. A new model explains this competition process between prisms, using fibres as elementary units of competition. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray texture analysis show that, during prism growth, fibres become progressively orientated with their three crystallographic axes aligned, which results from geometric constraints and space limitations. Interestingly transition to the nacreous layer does not occur until a high degree of orientation of fibres is attained. There is no selection of crystal orientation in the nacreous layer and, as a result, the preferential orientation of crystals deteriorates. Deterioration of crystal orientation is most probably due to accumulation of errors as the epitaxial growth is suppressed by thick or continuous <b>organic</b> <b>coats</b> on some nacre crystals. In conclusion, the microstructural arrangement of the unionid shell is, to a large extent, self-organized with the main constraints being crystallographic and geometrical laws...|$|R
