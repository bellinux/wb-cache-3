5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast would be much better for a man <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E

I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears {{revealed}} {{she felt}} inspired by hip hop {{artists such as}} Jay-Z and The Neptunes and {{wanted to create a}} record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift. On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with [...] "Overprotected" [...] being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Additional recording was done in April 2001 at Maratone in Sweden, in which the song's vocals were completed. Background vocals were provided by Spears and Bosslady, with the track being mixed by Martin and Rami at Maratone Studios. Her third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears concluded she can relate to [...] "Overprotected" [...] "on a personal basis, because I feel kind of overprotected. When I want to go out, everything has to be organized in advance. I think that other kids <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> can relate to it to a certain extent." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible. So, it is up to my friends in Uttar Pradesh to have a whole India; it is up to them to have a Hindi-India. The choice is theirs.|$|E

I hated the Britpop thing and {{what was happening in}} America, but Aphex was totally beautiful, and he's kind <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>age</b> too."

2500|$|Resnais {{was often}} {{linked with the}} group of French filmmakers who made their {{breakthrough}} as the New Wave or nouvelle vague in the late 1950s, but by then he had already established a significant reputation through his ten years of work on documentary short films. He defined his own relationship by saying: [...] "Although I was not fully part of the New Wave because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> there was some mutual sympathy and respect between myself and Rivette, Bazin, Demy, Truffaut... So I felt friendly with that team." [...] He nevertheless acknowledged his debt to the New Wave because it created the conditions of production, and particularly the financial conditions, which allowed {{him to make a}} film like Hiroshima mon amour, his first feature film.|$|E
2500|$|Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey {{was born}} into slavery on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Talbot County, Maryland. The {{plantation}} was between Hillsboro and Cordova; his birthplace was likely his grandmother's cabin east of Tappers Corner, (...) and west of Tuckahoe Creek. The exact date of his birth is unknown, and he later chose to celebrate his birthday on February 14. In his first autobiography, Douglass stated: [...] "I have no accurate knowledge <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> never having seen any authentic record containing it."Frederick Douglass began his own story thus: [...] "I was born in Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot county, Maryland." [...] (Tuckahoe is not a town; {{it refers to the}} area west of the creek in Talbot County.) In successive autobiographies, Douglass gave more precise estimates of when he was born, his final estimate being 1817. He adopted February 14 as his birthday because his mother Harriet Bailey used to call him her [...] "little valentine".|$|E
2500|$|Christina Aguilera was {{recorded}} between 1998 and 1999, with Ron Fair {{serving as the}} album's executive producer. The label reportedly spent $1 million on writers, producers and voice lessons. According to Fair, [...] "She {{was very much a}} raw talent, so building a collection of songs that would become her first album was a time-consuming process. We wanted to find the ones that could knock the door down and put her up there." [...] The album was built around pop songs, which was against Aguilera's will, since she wanted a more R album. She further explained during an interview for The Washington Post: [...] "I was held back a lot from doing more R ad-libbing. They clearly wanted to make a fresh-sounding young pop record and that's not always the direction I wanted to go in. Sometimes they didn't get it, didn't want to hear me out because <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>age,</b> and that was a little bit frustrating. Since all the success, it's a little easier to get my opinions across." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a teenager, Yorke's {{favourite}} artists included Queen, Joy Division, R.E.M., Siouxsie and the Banshees and Bob Dylan. He {{wrote that}} Mark Mulcahy of Miracle Legion had affected him [...] "a great deal" [...] at this time: [...] "It {{was the voice}} of someone who was only truly happy when he was singing... it changed the way I thought about songs and singing." [...] He has cited the Pixies, Björk and PJ Harvey as artists who [...] "changed his life", and in 2006 he told Pitchfork that Radiohead had [...] "ripped off R.E.M. blind for years". He cited Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante as an influence on his guitar playing for In Rainbows. In 2013, Yorke named the electronic artist Aphex Twin as his biggest influence, saying: [...] "He burns a heavy shadow...

Moreover, when answering a question during this time about whether young people were misunderstood by the older generation, she said [...] "Yes, but I'm sure that's been the case down the ages. It's too much to expect people of the older generation completely to understand people <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>age.</b> Some {{of the ways in which}} we behave were unheard of in my mother's young days, but each generation finds different symbols to express its discontent." [...] Also, when asked at the same time about how she felt about her rapid rise to stardom at such a young age, Bazlen said [...] "I realise what a lucky person I am and I'm anxious to repay the trust a lot of important people have placed in me. Reaching so high so young has put a lot of responsibility on my shoulders, but I feel that responsibility is part of the pattern of living and it is not to be taken lightly." ...|$|E
