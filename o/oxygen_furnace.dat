The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It {{can also be used}} to raise tap temperatures and adjust the carbon and silicon content. Silicon carbide is cheaper than a combination of ferrosilicon and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-quality}} {{flake graphite}} product that closely resembles natural flake graphite {{can be made}} from steelmaking kish. Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace,</b> and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate. Leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down.|$|E
2500|$|Bessemer steel became brittle {{with age}} because {{nitrogen}} was introduced when air was blown in. [...] The Bessemer process was also restricted to certain ores (low phosphate hematite).

[...] After World War II the OHF was displaced by the basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace</b> (BOF), which used oxygen instead of air and required about 35–40 minutes to produce a batch of steel compared to 8 to 9 hours for the OHF. The BOF also was more energy efficient.|$|E
5000|$|This {{ability is}} {{particularly}} desirable for cement kiln emission reduction and {{for control of}} emissions from basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces</b> in the steel industry, where the inlet gas enters the scrubber at temperatures greater than 350 °C (660 °F).|$|R
50|$|In an {{integrated}} steel mill, iron ore {{is reduced to}} metallic iron. In the US, this is done in blast furnaces. The direct-reduction method of producing iron from ore has not {{been used in the}} US since 2012. Some of the iron from the blast furnaces is converted to steel; today this is done in basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Iron ore, coke, and flux are fed into the blast furnace and heated. The coke reduces the iron oxide in the ore to metallic iron, and the molten mass separates into slag and iron. Some of the iron from the blast furnace is cooled, and marketed as pig iron; the rest flows into basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces,</b> where it is converted into steel. Iron and steel scrap may be added to both the blast furnace and the basic iron furnace.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 China was the world's fifth-largest {{producer}} {{of iron and}} steel, but lagged far behind developed countries in production methods and quality. Most steel capacity was in open-hearth <b>furnaces</b> with basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces,</b> electric furnaces, and side-blown converters. Much of the iron and coking coal used in making steel was of low quality. Approximately 25 percent of the country's coal went for steel production in 1985. In 1985 capital construction, considered excessive by the Chinese, exacerbated existing shortages of rolled steel, and imports filled 25 percent of domestic demand.|$|R

50|$|From 1972 to 1977 {{the largest}} {{expansion}} period for Vanderbijlpark Works followed. Iron making facilities were extended and the steel making processes modernised by the commissioning of basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces</b> and electric arc furnaces.

40|$|Executive summary This Reference Document on best {{available}} techniques in the Iron and Steel Industry reflects an information exchange carried out according to Article 16 (2) of Council Directive 96 / 61 /EC. The document has {{to be seen in}} the light of the preface, which describes the objectives of the document and its use. Scope It covers the environmental aspects of iron and steel making in integrated steelworks (sinter plants, pelletisation plants, coke oven plants, blast <b>furnaces</b> and basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces</b> including continuous or ingot casting) and electric arc furnace steelmaking. Ferrous metal processing downstream to casting is not covered in this document. Submitted information The most important environmental issues of iron and steelmaking relate to emissions to air and to solid wastes/by-products. Wastewater emissions from coke oven plants, blast <b>furnaces</b> and basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces</b> are the most relevant emissions to water in this sector. It is no surprise, therefore, that there is good information available on these aspects but only limited information is available about noise/vibration emissions and related measures to minimise them. The same is for soil pollution, health & safety and also for natural aspects. Inaddition, little information is available on the sampling methods, analysis methods, time intervals, computation methods and reference conditions used as a basis for the data submitted...|$|R
5000|$|The AISI {{system used}} a letter prefix to denote the {{steelmaking}} process. The prefix [...] "C" [...] denoted open-hearth furnace, {{electric arc furnace}} or basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace,</b> while [...] "E" [...] denotes electric arc furnace steel. A letter [...] "L" [...] within the grade name indicates lead as an added ingredient; for example, 12L14 is a common grade that is 1214 with lead added for machinability.|$|E
5000|$|Open {{hearth furnace}} was first {{developed}} by German-born engineer Carl Wilhelm Siemens. In 1865, the French engineer Pierre-Émile Martin {{took out a}} license from Siemens and first applied his regenerative furnace for making steel. Their process {{was known as the}} Siemens-Martin process, and the furnace as an [...] "open-hearth" [...] furnace. Most open hearth furnaces were closed by the early 1990s, not least because of their slow operation, being replaced by the basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace</b> or electric arc furnace.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the blast furnace/open hearth steelmaking process, CF&I also used the basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace</b> (BOF) process {{for a number of}} years. This process was later replaced by electric arc furnaces (EAF). Currently, one EAF is used at the facility to convert over a million tons of scrap per year into steel billets of various sizes. The billets are then distributed to the three steel finishing facilities (rail mill, rod & bar mill, seamless tube mill) for processing into the various finished products.|$|E
50|$|Disadvantages of the process, {{compared}} to non-rotating <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces</b> (e.g. LD type) were the higher capital cost, {{more difficult to}} upscale to higher outputs, and additional complexity (i.e. rotating parts and loading thereof). Advantages included {{the ability to use}} a high proportion of scrap metal, and good controllability of final steel specification. At the Park Gate works conversion time was 90 minutes, with up to 45% scrap loading, with a capacity of 75t in a 500t total, 16 ft diameter converter, with a rotation speed of 40 revs per minute.|$|R
50|$|Algoma {{currently}} has {{a capacity of}} 4 million tons per year. Primary steel making facilities include two blast furnaces, three coke batteries, two, 260 short ton basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces,</b> with two ladle metallurgy stations for refining and alloying. Algoma has a direct strip production complex manufactured by Danieli of Italy, which casts strip directly and then rolls it to finished strip {{in the range of}} 0.047 inches to 0.625 inches in thickness, and widths to 64 inches. Algoma also operates a hot strip mill, a plate mill, and a cold strip mill. Algoma also manufactures welded structural beams.|$|R
40|$|Basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces</b> (BOF) slag is {{the main}} problem at all iron and steel factories. About more than 6 million tons/year of BOF slag has been {{accumulated}} from the waste stockyards in Turkey. Dumps slags can be revaluated by a processing technology which {{makes it possible to}} obtain products that meet the requirements of sintering and blast furnace production. The slags with particle size of - 10 mm were enriched by the magnetic separator resulting and increase in Fe grade from 18 % to 33 %. The use of BOF slag in sinter blend provided additional Mn, CaO, MgO and introduced a good solution to environmental problems...|$|R

50|$|Iron {{and steel}} are the world's most {{recycled}} materials, {{and among the}} easiest materials to reprocess, {{as they can be}} separated magnetically from the waste stream. Recycling is via a steelworks: scrap is either remelted in an electric arc furnace (90-100% scrap), or used as part of the charge in a Basic <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Furnace</b> (around 25% scrap). Any grade of steel can be recycled to top quality new metal, with no 'downgrading' from prime to lower quality materials as steel is recycled repeatedly. 42% of crude steel produced is recycled material.|$|E

40|$|A {{new version}} of the <b>oxygen</b> blast <b>furnace</b> {{ironmaking}} process, a Balanced <b>Oxygen</b> Blast <b>Furnace</b> (BOBF) process where injection of a large amount of pulverized coal via the tuyeres for replacement of expensive coke, has been presented. The ratio of oxygen to nitrogen, seen in relation to coal type and injection ratio and total fuel rate, {{has been used as a}} major parameter for balancing the operation of the furnace without using recirculation of top gas and without the use of hot stoves. The main advantages of the process are low energy costs, high productivity, equipment simplicity, operation easiness and its adaptability for application to existing blast furnaces even of large volume...|$|R
50|$|It is {{the home}} of the multibillion-dollar Ajaokuta Steel Rolling Mill. Ajaokuta Steel Project is located on 24,000 {{hectares}} of sprawling green-field land-mass. The Steel Plant itself is built on 800-hectares of land. The chosen Technology for Steel Production is the time tested Blast-Furnace - Basic <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Furnace</b> route for Steel Production. The complex is meant to be used to generate important upstream and downstream industrial and economic activities that are critical to the diversification of the Nigerian economy into an industrial one. Ajaokuta Steel Plant is therefore aptly tagged as the “Bedrock of Nigeria’s industrialization”.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{raw materials}} for an integrated mill are iron ore, limestone, and coal (or coke). These materials are charged in batches into a blast furnace where the iron compounds in the ore give up excess oxygen and become liquid iron. At intervals of a few hours, the accumulated liquid iron is tapped from the blast furnace and either cast into pig iron or directed to other vessels for further steel making operations. Historically the Bessemer process was a major advancement {{in the production of}} economical steel, but it has now been entirely replaced by other processes such as the basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... ==History of US iron- and steel-making== The US {{iron and}} steel {{industry}} has paralleled the industry in other countries in technological developments. In the 1800s, the US switched from charcoal to coke in ore smelting, adopted the Bessemer process, and saw the rise of very large integrated steel mills. In the 20th century, the US industry successively adopted the open hearth process, then the basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace.</b> Since the American industry peaked in the 1940s and 1950s, the US industry has shifted to small mini-mills and specialty mills, using {{iron and steel}} scrap as feedstock, rather than iron ore.|$|E
50|$|Integrated steel {{plants are}} large, handle {{everything}} in one complex - from putting together raw material to steel making, rolling and shaping. Iron ore, coke, and flux are {{fed into the}} blast furnace and heated. The coke reduces the iron oxide in the ore to metallic iron, and the molten mass separates into slag and iron. Some of the iron from the blast furnace is cooled, and marketed as pig iron; the rest flows into basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces,</b> where it is converted into steel. Iron and steel scrap may be added to both to the blast furnace and to the basic iron furnace. There are about five integrated SAIL plants in India.|$|R
40|$|Steel {{production}} is an energy- and water-intensive process: {{large quantities of}} water are used for cooling, process and environmental-technical applications. Wastewater emissions from coke oven plants, blast <b>furnaces</b> and basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces</b> are the most relevant emissions to water in this sector. The steel industry continues {{to make use of}} diverse technical options to improve its closed-loop water management practices. Steelwork Zenica has been in existence for more than 115 years. The factory ceased its work during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995. The full re-initiation of the Steelwork is planned to take place in the summer of 2008 and raises the issue of future quantities and quality of wastewater and additional pollution of the Bosna river...|$|R
50|$|Duluth Works {{was caught}} up in {{industrial}} restructuring during the early 1970s to the mid-1980s, as was other heavy industry in the Midwest. The story was the same as at other plants all over the country; Youngstown. Homestead. Duquesne. Fairless. McKeesport. Many plants that were once powerhouses within U.S. Steel and the industry as a whole, were demolished by cutting torches. The dumping of artificially low-priced foreign steel in the United States was partly to blame, but the Duluth Works and many other plants had not been modernized with the Basic <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Furnaces</b> (BOF) to replace its outdated open hearth technology. This has been introduced when the plant was first built. Duluth Works was located in a market where other plants could meet its own output and demand.|$|R
5000|$|Until recently, {{pig iron}} was {{typically}} poured {{directly out of}} {{the bottom of the}} blast furnace through a [...] into a ladle car for transfer to the steel mill in mostly liquid form; in this state, the pig iron was referred to as hot metal. The hot metal was then poured into a steelmaking vessel to produce steel, typically an electric arc furnace, induction furnace or basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace,</b> where the excess carbon is burned off and the alloy composition controlled. Earlier processes for this included the finery forge, the puddling furnace, the Bessemer process, and the open hearth furnace.|$|E
50|$|A {{high-quality}} {{flake graphite}} product that closely resembles natural flake graphite {{can be made}} from steelmaking kish. Kish is a large-volume near-molten waste skimmed from the molten iron feed to a basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace,</b> and consists of a mix of graphite (precipitated out of the supersaturated iron), lime-rich slag, and some iron. The iron is recycled on site, leaving a mixture of graphite and slag. The best recovery process uses hydraulic classification (which utilizes a flow of water to separate minerals by specific gravity: graphite is light and settles nearly last) to get a 70% graphite rough concentrate. Leaching this concentrate with hydrochloric acid gives a 95% graphite product with a flake size ranging from 10 mesh down.|$|E
50|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1954, the Trenton Plant was {{dedicated}} and McLouth Steel became {{able to produce}} iron as an integrated steel mill. Number One blast furnace was constructed with a capacity of 1250 tons a day. The three original 60 ton basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnace</b> (BOF) vessels were installed and McLouth became the first plant in North America to make steel via the basic oxygen process. Adding to the melt shop were two 200 ton electric arc furnaces. The reversing Steckel mill {{was replaced by a}} six stand continuous 60 in hot strip rolling mill and a roughing stand was added to compliment the blooming mill. More soaking pits were installed as well as a plant to supply the BOP with oxygen. Two pickle lines were also added along with the slitters.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the global}} {{environmental}} deterioration, the greenhouse effect {{and a series of}} other problems, the necessity for the development on new ironmaking technology of <b>oxygen</b> blast <b>furnace</b> and gas-recycle in China was discussed. The new technology use coal and oxygen as the main raw materials. The development situation of new technology and its technical advantages over the conventional ones were introduced detailedly. The development situation of related technology abroad was described. The application prospect of this new technology was analyzed from the perspective of energy consumption and CO 2 emission. Using the new ironmaking technology of <b>oxygen</b> blast <b>furnace</b> and gas-recycle, It bound to increase steel plant’s overall technological level in china, enhance industry competition and the effect of energy saving as well as emission reduction, promote low-carbon economy development...|$|R
5000|$|When Nucor—now one of {{the largest}} steel {{producers}} in the U.S.—decided to enter the long products market in 1969, they chose to start up a mini-mill, with an EAF as its steelmaking furnace, soon followed by other manufacturers. Whilst Nucor expanded rapidly in the Eastern US, the companies that followed them into mini-mill operations concentrated on local markets for long products, where the use of an EAF allowed the plants to vary production according to local demand. This pattern was also followed globally, with EAF steel production primarily used for long products, while integrated mills, using blast <b>furnaces</b> and basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>furnaces,</b> cornered the markets for [...] "flat products"—sheet steel and heavier steel plate. In 1987, Nucor made the decision to expand into the flat products market, still using the EAF production method.|$|R
