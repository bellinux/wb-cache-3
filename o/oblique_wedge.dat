Although Grotefend's Memoir was presented to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities on September 4, 1802, the Academy refused to publish it; it was subsequently published in Heeren's work in 1815, but was overlooked by most researchers at the time.|$|E

In {{the earliest}} exercises of Stage 1, students repeatedly copied out the three elements of a cuneiform sign: the vertical wedge, the horizontal wedge, and the <b>oblique</b> <b>wedge.</b> Once the wedge shapes had been mastered, the student could start combining them to make simple signs. Some exercise tablets show the student practicing a simple sign or signs over and over again. Next, the student learned to write out a list of signs known as Syllable Alphabet B (also sometimes referred to as the “Sumerian Primer” [...] ). Each entry in this list comprised a few signs, or syllables, which sometimes resembled Sumerian words or personal names but actually contained little meaning. They were designed to teach the student the correct sign forms. [...] Outside of Nippur, a similar list - known as Syllable Alphabet A -- was taught in place of Syllable Alphabet B. In some cases, the student also had to write out columns of Akkadian words, forming a list known as Syllable Vocabulary A.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionPostoperative {{radiotherapy}} of {{the parotid}} gland could be achieved with various radiotherapy techniques. However they irradiate differently the surrounding organs at risk (OARs) in particular the cochlea, oral cavity & contralateral parotid causing {{significant increase in the}} risk of oral mucositis, xerostomia, and hearing deficits on the irradiated side. ObjectivesThe aim {{of this study was to}} compare radiation doses received by target volume and different surrounding OARs using three different parotid irradiation techniques aiming to achieve the optimum technique which shows adequate target coverage and sparing of surrounding OARs during postoperative 3 DCRT treatment of parotid gland cancer patients. MethodologyTen patients diagnosed as having parotid cancer were included in this study. They were subjected to CT simulation and scans were transferred to the treatment planning system. Target volumes and contralateral parotid, oral cavity, cochlea, spinal cord, brain stem, eyes, lenses and optic nerves were contoured. Three plans were done using (a) ipsilateral <b>oblique</b> <b>wedged</b> photon pair, (b) <b>oblique</b> <b>wedged</b> photon pair and direct lateral field, and (c) ipsilateral mixed photon electron beams. For three plans, the dose volume parameters (DVPs) for target volume and surrounding OARs were compared and analyzed statistically. ResultsTarget dose coverage was adequate and comparable for techniques 1 and 2. Technique 2 showed the best dose homogeneity and conformity and lowest max dose to PTV and to the whole body and although the dose to OARs was higher compared to technique 1 it was far lower than OARs tolerance. On the other hand, technique 3 showed unaccepted underdose & dose inhomogeneity within the PTV, the highest doses to OARs and the highest PTV max and body max dose. ConclusionThe ipsilateral <b>oblique</b> <b>wedged</b> photon pair and direct lateral photon field technique is an optimal treatment technique for parotid cancer patients in comparison to other plans...|$|R

In 1995, a 7 -year-old boy presented in Emergency with a 3 -day history of severe radicular back pain and associated muscle spasms, exacerbated by lying on his back. Both bone scan and plain X-rays were unremarkable; however, MRI showed a 3 -cm space-occupying lesion at the level of T 5 -T 6. The patient proceeded to biopsy and partial excision of the tumour through laminectomy, histology confirming an anaplastic astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme), St Anne Mayo grade 4. Treatment consisted of a radical course of radiotherapy alone, delivering a total dose of 44. 8 Gy at 1. 6 Gy per fraction. The treatment comprised of three phases using two <b>oblique</b> <b>wedged</b> fields on a 6 MV linear accelerator. The patient remains disease free 7 years post treatment, with the only effect noted being a slight kyphoscoliosis {{at the site of the}} laminectomy and radiation. This report highlights the efficacy of combined surgery and radiation therapy in the management of spinal cord glioblastoma multiforme in preventing tumour recurrence, with acceptable morbidity. Further evaluation of the treatment efficacy would be difficult because of the scarcity of such cases. C Oake, MF Borg, A Hanieh and RW Byar...|$|R
40|$|Background: External beam {{radiotherapy}} is {{a common}} and effective modality in treating patients with spinal metastases. Simple field arrangements would be used in conventional 2 D radiotherapy including single posterior and anterior-posterior posterior-anterior (AP-PA) opposing fields. Different prescription method, field size and beam weighting was used commonly, and were investigated in this study. 3 D conformal radiation therapy (3 DCRT) will also be investigated. Dosimetric comparison on dose homogeneity in target volume and the organ at risk (OARs) dose was performed using three-dimensional dosimetric data. Methods: Computed tomography simulation scans of 15 patients with thoracic spinal bone metastases who received conventional 2 D radiotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. Five different treatment plans were created for each patient using different radiotherapy technique: (1) single posterior field with oncologists’ prescribed field size; (2) single posterior field with ICRU prescription point; (3) single posterior field with local prescription method (85 % isodose level prescribed to Dmax); (4) AP-PA opposing fields with AP-PA ratio = 1 : 2; (5) AP-PA opposing fields with equal weighting. Conformity, homogeneity, minimum, maximum and mean dose of planning target volume (PTV) were compared. (6) 3 DCRT with posterior and posterior <b>oblique</b> <b>wedged</b> fields. OARs dose including spinal cord, esophagus, heart, lung and liver dose was analyzed. Results: In OAR sparing, all OARs were safe and well tolerated in all plans. In PTV dosimetric results, all single posterior and AP-PA opposing technique did not demonstrate satisfactory PTV coverage and homogeneity. While 3 DCRT achieved the best PTV homogeneity (homogeneity index 0. 11 compared with 0. 15 - 0. 35 in other plans) and PTV coverage (PTV min dose 17. 1 ± 2. 8 and PTV max dose 22. 4 ± 0. 4 Gy). Conclusion: The 3 DCRT achieved the best coverage and homogeneity of PTV. Moreover, it can well spare the mid-line structures including the heart and esophagus with the doses to other OARs were below the tolerance limit. Therefore, the optimal and recommended treatment technique to thoracic spinal irradiation would be the 3 DCRT treatment technique if it is flexible to do so. published_or_final_versionMedicineMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{strength}} of a material is relevant to a variety of applications including automobile collisions, armor penetration and inertial confinement fusion. Although dynamic behavior of materials at high pressures and strain-rates has been studied extensively using plate impact experiments, the results provide measurements in one direction only. Material behavior that is dependent on strength is unaccounted for. The research in this study proposes two novel configurations to mitigate this problem. The first configuration introduced is the <b>oblique</b> <b>wedge</b> experiment, which is comprised of a driver material, an angled target of interest and a backing material used to measure in-situ velocities. Upon impact, a shock wave is generated in the driver material. As the shock encounters the angled target, it is reflected back into the driver and transmitted into the target. Due to the angle of obliquity of the incident wave, a transverse wave is generated that allows the target to be subjected to shear while being compressed by the initial longitudinal shock such that the material does not slip. Using numerical simulations, this study shows that a variety of <b>oblique</b> <b>wedge</b> configurations can be used to study the shear response of materials and this can be extended to strength measurement as well. Experiments were performed on an <b>oblique</b> <b>wedge</b> setup with a copper impactor, polymethylmethacrylate driver, aluminum 6061 -t 6 target, and a lithium fluoride window. Particle velocities were measured using laser interferometry and results agree well with the simulations. The second novel configuration is the y-cut quartz sandwich design, which uses the anisotropic properties of y-cut quartz to generate a shear wave that is transmitted into a thin sample. By using an anvil material to back the thin sample, particle velocities measured at the rear surface of the backing plate can be implemented to calculate the shear stress in the material and subsequently the strength. Numerical simulations were conducted to show that this configuration has the ability to measure the strength for a variety of materials. ...|$|E

We hypothesized a lateral <b>oblique</b> closing <b>wedge</b> osteotomy with a larger contact area and fixation with a lag screw plus early motion would provide stable fixation and early motion recovery in adults with cubitus varus deformity. Twelve consecutive patients who needed surgery were treated using this procedure. They were allowed active motion exercises 1  week postoperatively. The age of the patients {{at the time of}} surgery averaged 39  years (range, 31 – 48  years). The minimum followup was 15  months. All patients achieved healing of the osteotomy, and regained preoperative arcs of elbow motion at a mean of 7. 3  weeks (range, 2 – 12  weeks) postoperatively. The average humerus-elbow-wrist angle improved from − 23. 3 ° to 8 ° (p <  0. 002) by a mean gain of 29. 6 °. The mean lateral prominence index did not increase postoperatively.

40|$|Plio-Quaternary basinward-prograding heterozoan {{carbonate}} wedges with seaward-dipping, steep clinoforms {{and significant}} along-strike extension, are common both {{on land and}} along the submerged margins of the Mediterranean area. They developed as distally steepened ramps on storm-dominated, relatively steep-gradient margins, commonly controlled by tectonics. Dispersal of the skeletal hash was mainly due to storm-driven downwelling and geostrophic currents, changing into gravity flows down the clinoformed ramp margin. Due to active winnowing and bypass in the shallow-water settings, biocalcarenite ramps were entirely detached from the shoreline.

Its footprint {{has been defined}} as approximately 10  mm in anteroposterior width (Nimura et al., 2014), its true tendinous length is approximately 16  mm (Keijsers et al., 2016), its thickness at the radiocapitelar joint is 4.4  mm (Toprak et al., 2012), the average width of the CET at the musculotendinous junction though not previously defined, was 35  mm in the current study. Calculating the volume of an <b>oblique</b> <b>wedge</b> (Stocker & Harris, 1998) ([...] V=bh/ 6 (2 a+c)), from these figures yields a volume of 938.66  mm 3, which is similar to the mean total volume, derived from the pixel density, found in the current study (1040  mm 3). The volume of 1 and 3  ml injections clearly equates to a fluid volume of 1000 and 3000  mm 3. Therefore, with localised injection of common injectate volumes, in an area of densely packed collagen, it is unsurprising that the tendon itself is both damaged and that the injectate is disseminated down a path of least resistance. With the delicate anterior capsular edge presenting as a likely route, joint contamination becomes inevitable. Dependent on the injection substance, this finding may be clinically relevant to the practitioner, particularly {{in the context of a}} patient with an otherwise pathology free elbow joint.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the rapid free-surface {{granular}} flows that are driven under gravitational acceleration has attracted much attention in recent years. This is not only because such flows occur in many industrial and natural examples, but also because their transport mechanisms can be observed through small-scale lab experiments, modeled with continuum theories, and simulated by computers. When granular particles rapidly propagate around obstacles, the resulting phenomena - shock waves, particle free regions or granular vacua, expansion fans and stagnation zones - are of particular theoretical and practical importance. In this paper we develop a computational method for a hydraulic-type avalanche model that is able to simulate such phenomena. It numerically solves the avalanche model over a structured grid by including the topography of the obstacles. Different finite-difference TVD methods based on the non-oscillatory central (NOC) scheme are tested in computation to compare {{the resolution of the}} shock waves when granular flows propagate against an <b>oblique</b> <b>wedge.</b> This is also involved in the choice of the limiters, but which are shown rather insensitive in such computations. A level set formulation is coupled into the governing equations to follow the evolution of the boundaries of the granular vacua. It is tested in a situation when granular particles flow around a circular cylinder, where bow shock waves, granular vacua, expansion fans and stationary zones are all captured in the computation. These results agree well and consistently with the laboratory experiment...|$|E

A computational and experimental study {{has been carried out}} on the near-field flow around a wedge model placed in a Mach 2. 4 wind tunnel, where a Nd:YAG laser beam is used to breakdown the air upstream of the wedge, leading to a hot spot of gas which interacts with the <b>wedge</b> <b>oblique</b> shock. These interactions are studied with the help of time-resolved Schlieren (using a MHz rate camera) and using four sequentially placed pressure sensors, located in the region of impingement of the oblique shock on the floor; here they measure the effect of the energy deposition on the shockinduced pressures on the floor. 2 D Euler calculations are compared with the wind tunnel results. Both numerical and experimental results agree quite well in the relative pressure levels before and after the shock impingement position, and also in the qualitative behavior of the pressure levels as a function of time after the discharge. The presence of other extraneous shocks and also the well-developed, large, turbulent boundary layer on the tunnel floor hindered a further quantitative comparison of experimental and computational results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- The Mesozoic accretionary {{wedge of}} south-central Alaska is cut by {{an array of}} faults {{including}} dextral and sinistral strike-slip faults, synthetic and antithetic thrust faults, and synthetic and antithetic normal faults. The three fault sets are characterized by quartz:tcalcite:tchlorite:tprehnite slickensides, and are all relatively late, i. e. all truncate ductile fabrics of the host rocks. Cross-cutting relationships suggest that the thrust fault sets predate the late normal and strike-slip fault sets. Together, the normal and strike-slip fault system exhibits orthorhombic symmetry. Thrust faulting shortened the wedge subhorizontally perpendicular to strike, and then normal and strike-slip faulting extended the <b>wedge</b> <b>oblique</b> to orogenic strike. Strongly curved slickenlines on some faults of each set reveal that displacement directions changed over time. On dip-slip faults (thrust and normal), slickenlines tend to become steeper with younger increments of slip, whereas on strike-slip faults, slickenlines become shallower with younger strain increments. These patterns may result from progressive exhumation of the accretionary wedge while the faults were active, with the curvature of the slickenlines tracking the change from a non-Andersonian stress field at depth to a more Andersonian system «(11 or (12 nearly vertical) at shallower crustal levels. We interpret this complex fault array as a progressive deformation that is one response to Paleocene-Eocene subduction of the Kula-Farallon spreading center beneath the accretionary complex because: (I) on the Kenai Peninsula, ENE-striking dextral faults of this array exhibit mutually cross-cutting relationships with Paleocene...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} adjuvant irradiation of the scrotum {{in primary}} testicular lymphoma (PTL) {{by means of}} a literature review in MEDLINE, a telephone survey among Dutch institutes, and an in silico planning comparative study on scrotal irradiation in PTL. We did not find any uniform adjuvant irradiation technique assuring a safe planning target volume (PTV) coverage in published reports, and the definition of the clinical target volume is unclear. Histopathologic studies of PTL show a high invasion rate of the tunica albuginea, the epididymis, and the spermatic cord. In retrospective studies, a prescribed dose of at least 30 Gy involving the scrotum is associated with best survival. The majority of Dutch institutes irradiate the whole scrotum without using a planning computed tomography scan, with a single electron beam and a total dose of 30 Gy. The in silico planning comparative study showed that all evaluated approaches met a D- 95 % scrotal dose of at least 85 % of the prescription dose, without exceeding the dose limits of critical organs. Photon irradiation with 2 <b>oblique</b> beams using <b>wedges</b> resulted in the best PTV coverage, with a mean value of 95 % of the prescribed dose, with lowest maximum dose. Adjuvant photon or electron irradiation of the whole scrotum including the contralateral testicle with a minimum dose of 30 Gy is recommended in PTL.

40|$|International audienceA NE-SW magnetotelluric 110 km-long profile {{including}} 18 sites {{was acquired}} across the western Rif Cordillera along the Eurasian-African plate boundary, allowing to constrain its poorly known deep structure. It {{extends from the}} Internal Zones, close to the Alboran coast, crossing the External Zones {{and up to the}} Gharb foreland basin. The periods recorded range from 0. 001 s to 1000 s. The combination of magnetotelluric data with available geological data provides new insight regarding the relationship between deep and shallow crustal structures of the Rif Cordillera. Analyses of structural dimensionality suggest a preferential NW-SE direction, and a 2 D joint inversion was performed. A 3 D inversion extending the 2 D model along the strike confirmed the reliability of this approach. The magnetotelluric model shows a heterogeneous upper crust in agreement with the geological structures observed at surface. The Internal Zones correspond to resistive (metamorphic rocks) and conductive (peridotites) bodies, while the External Zones and the foreland basin are characterized by large conductive bodies of variable thickness. A crustal detachment level separating shallow geological units from a probable variscan basement was inferred. At depth, the most relevant feature consists of large resistive bodies with a shallow irregular top, located below the frontal part of the Rif. The outcrops of exotic metapelitic, granitic and gneissic blocks in the frontal part of the Cordillera suggest that these large resistive bodies may correspond to a gneissic or granitic basement surrounded by metapelitic rocks. Late contractive thrust and diapiric processes were responsible for their uplift and shallow emplacement.

Sc. in physics, College of Science, King Saud Univerisity, 2006 G - 1427 HAn extensive set of measured data was developed to verify the accuracy of a photon dose-calculation algorithm for the treatment planning system (Eclipse). Dose distributions from a linear accelerator were measured using an ion chamber in a water phantom and thermoluminescent dosimeters in a heterogeneous anthropomorphic phantom. Test cases included square fields, rectangular fields, fields having different source-to-surface distances, wedged fields, irregular fields, obliquely incident fields, asymmetrically collimated fields with wedges, multileafe collimator-shaped fields, and two heterogeneous density cases. The data set was used to validate the photon dose calculation algorithm in a radiation treatment planning system (Eclipse). Eclipse calculated photon doses to within the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 53 (TG- 53) criteria for 99 % of points in the buildup region, 93 % of points in the inner region, 90 % of points in the outer region, and 88 % of points in the penumbra. For the heterogeneous phantoms, calculations agreed with actual measurements to within ± 7 %. The monitor unit tests revealed that the 6 MV open square fields, rectangular fields, <b>wedged</b> fields, <b>oblique</b> incidence, SSD variation, mantle field, half beam block, and <b>oblique</b> incidence with <b>wedge</b> test cases did not meet the TG- 53 criteria all the time.

40|$|Multichannel seismic {{reflection}} {{data were}} used to determine the evolutionary history of the forearc region of the central Aleutian Ridge. Since at least late Miocene time this sector of the ridge has been obliquely underthrust 30 ° west of orthogonal convergence by the northwestward converging Pacific plate at a rate of 80 – 90 km/m. y. Our data indicate that prior to late Eocene time the forearc region was composed of rocks of the arc massif thinly mantled by slope deposits; the forearc region probably lacked both major depositional basins and a tectonically attached accretionary prism of offscraped oceanic deposits. Beginning in latest Miocene or earliest Pliocene time, a zone of outer-arc structural highs and a forearc basin began to form. Formation of these companion intraarc structures may be linked to the late Neogene growth of an accretionary wedge that formed {{as the result of the}} deposition of a thick turbidite wedge in the Aleutian Trench. Initial structures of the zone of outer-arc highs formed as the thickening wedge underran, compressively deformed, and uplifted the seaward edge of the arc massif above a landward dipping backstop thrust. Forearc basin strata ponded arcward of the elevating zone of outer-arc highs. However, most younger structures of the zone of outer-arc highs cannot be ascribed simply to the orthogonal effects of an underrunning <b>wedge.</b> <b>Oblique</b> convergence created a major right-lateral shear zone (the Hawley Ridge shear zone) that longitudinally disrupted the zone of outer-arc highs, truncating the seaward flank of the forearc basin and shearing the southern limb of Hawley Ridge, an exceptionally large antiformal outer-arc high structure. Slivers of forearc basement rocks and overlying strata have been transported along the shear zone that is flanked by differentially elevated structures attributed to localized transpressive and transtensional processes. Uplift of Hawley Ridge may be related to the thickening of the arc massif by westward directed basement duplexes. In addition, the forearc is disrupted by structures transverse to the margin that occur where unusually high-stress accumulations have resulted in the rupture of repeated great earthquakes. It is likely that many ancient active margins evolved in tectonic and depositional settings similar to those of the central Aleutian Ridge. Great structural complexity, including the close juxtaposition of coeval structures recording compression, extension, differential vertical movements, and strike-slip displacement, should be expected, even within areas of generally kindred tectonostratigraphic terranes...|$|R
