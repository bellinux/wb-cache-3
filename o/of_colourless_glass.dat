In the sealing-wax was the impression of a seal--probably of a signet-ring, bearing the initials of a monogram; but the impression had been hastily made, and the letters were past anything more certain than a shrewd conjecture. Ida Payne had always worn a signet-ring in preference to any other finger decoration. Geddie thought he could make out the familiar [...] "I P"; and a queer sensation of disquietude went over him.

5000|$|The {{situation}} is not so simple; these workshops are dated from the 6th to the 11th century AD and although similar the compositions do not exactly match those of the earlier Roman period. Pliny, writing in the 1st century AD, describes glass making in the Levantine coast but also in Italy, Spain and Gaul - however the installations that produced the large quantities of primary glass needed to supply the Roman industry {{have yet to be}} located. These same authors report a difference in isotopic ratios for oxygen and strontium that differentiates between Middle eastern and Roman glasses. Other authors counter idea of a unique centralised production with primary production reported from Northern Europe and inferred for Italy.

That there was a large scale and centralised production even this early is evidenced by the Ouest Embiez I shipwreck - 3rd century - carrying 8 tons of raw glass.

The Julia Felix, also sunk during the 3rd century AD, was carrying as part of its cargo glass cullet presumably for recycling.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on the natural degradation of glass from Italian archaeological sites, both marine and land-based, with the aim of understanding the role that the chemico-physical conditions of the environment had on the morphology and composition of the alteration products.

Buried glass presents only iridescent lamellae as alteration products. These are mainly composed of a hydrated "silica gel", differing essentially in the extension of alteration lamellae in both submerged and buried glass. The principal events in the process may be summarised as ion exchange reaction, which causes selective leaching of alkalis and protons entering the glass to produce a hydrated, alkali-deficient layer, and congruent dissolution of the glass matrix, with destruction of the silica network and subsequent precipitation of hydrous silica-gel layers as secondary alteration products...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the major and trace element composition and Pb and Sr isotope {{characteristics of a}} series of about 20 colourless glass objects from a single high-status Roman burial from the Netherlands (Bocholtz). The major elements show a relatively homogeneous group, with one outlier. This is corroborated by the Sr isotopes. Based on the Sb and Pb content, three major groups can be discerned, with two other outliers. This grouping is corroborated by the contents of the trace elements Bi, Sn, Ag, As and Mo, and by variations in lead isotopic ratios. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the glass of all objects was probably made with sand and lime from the same source. The variation in trace elements and lead isotope composition is most likely the result of variations in the composition of the sulphidic antimony ore(s) that were used to decolourize the glass. The composition of the Bocholtz glass is compared with that of other Roman glass, and implications for production models, trade and use <b>of</b> <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> objects are discussed. On the basis of isotopic and major element variation, we conclude that the antimony ore presumably originated from different mines. © 2009 University of Oxford...|$|E

30|$|The earlier <b>colourless</b> <b>glasses</b> from Vergina, Pydna and Gordion (mid 4 th–early 2 nd century BCE) were decoloured with antimony, {{which is}} at {{variance}} with the manganese decolourant process practiced in the production <b>of</b> later <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> from Tel Anafa, and for most <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> from Jebel Khalid (mid 2 nd–early 1 st century BCE). Pherai and the Rhodes Bead Factory group, slightly earlier than and contemporary with Tel Anafa and Jebel Khalid, have samples fully decoloured with antimony. From the Rhodes Necropolis bowls group {{there is only one}} sample decoloured with antimony, while another two contained both decolourants (i.e., antimony and manganese). There are samples from the Rhodes Bead Factory and one from Pherai that contain both antimony and manganese, seen also in four glasses from Jebel Khalid. If the elevated concentrations of both antimony and manganese in colourless samples JK 13 and JK 52, and in imperfectly decoloured samples JK 20 and JK 35, were intentional, this might suggest several scenarios. (1) It is possible that both decolourants were added to achieve <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> (2) The cullet used to make the vessels was acquired from two different traditions, from more than one source, and was mixed together (for examples of ancient Hellenistic cullet see [8 : p. 51, 10, 49]), possibly as a result of recycling [10 : p. 284, 15 : pp. 95 – 96, 28 : pp. 771 – 772]. The presence of lead suggested recycling in other Pherai glasses ([15 : p. 94]; see also [27]). (3) The inclusion of antimony could also have been intended for the purpose of fining of the glass melt. Jackson [28 : p. 705] noted that antimony is usually found only as a trace in glassmaking raw materials, so to be at detectable levels it must have been intentionally or coincidentally added, perhaps due to the mixing of different cullet from two different colourant traditions, either as a result of recycling, or of the mixing of raw glass from two different contemporary primary production centres.|$|R

Due to its high alkali and alumina content per unit weight, it has been a formidable competition to feldspar. In ceramic industry, the low fusion point of nepheline syenite lowers the melting temperature, promotes faster melting, higher productivity, fuel savings; the high fluxing capacity of nepheline, allows it to act as a good vitrifying agent. In glass, nepheline syenite also supplies alumina, which gives improved thermal endurance, increased chemical durability and increased resistance to scratching and breaking [4, 7]. The presence of Fe 2 O 3 rich opaque minerals within the foid bearing, may cause to act one of the major factors in preventing the development of many of the worlds nepheline syenite deposits, although magnetic separation can remove Fe 2 O 3 bearing minerals such as biotite, ilmenite and magnetite, its applicaition solely is not found sufficient.

40|$|The {{techniques}} used to analyse glass in forensics and archaeology differ: forensic analysis relies almost completely on Refractive Index, whereas archaeology uses compositional analyses. This thesis focuses on examining, explaining and challenging those differences through the analysis <b>of</b> <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> from forensic and archaeological contexts. Two major studies are undertaken, one focussing on stained and painted glass from Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford, and {{one based on}} modern automotive glass. The analytical techniques common to each discipline are applied to the samples of glass used in the research. The studies each focus on individual research questions; the Christ Church study investigates the 17 th century Van Linge window scheme, the compositions of fragments of glass from throughout the cathedral’s history are investigated, and shown to separate into distinct compositional groups. The study also successfully recreates the Van Linge window scheme; and the historical and compositional analyses allowed the study {{of one of the}} in-situ painted windows in the cathedral. The automotive glass study investigates the complex relationship between glass manufacturers and vehicle manufacturers. The research revealed that certain makes of vehicle were beginning to group and glass from specific areas of the world was also grouping together. This study highlights the potential use for glass as a tool for intelligence gathering rather than just as evidence. The application of the different analytical techniques to each study is discussed along with the merits of using each of the techniques. The potential of using forensic techniques in archaeology and archaeological techniques in forensics is evaluated. Specifically, LA-ICP-MS, which is rarely used in forensics, could be an innovative and potentially important tool for the forensic evaluation of cars and other glass evidence.

40|$|Research on {{the cargo}} of {{glass in the}} Roman ship Iulia Felix, wrecked off the town of Grado (province of Udine, North Italy) {{in the first half}} of the 3 rd century AD and {{composed}} of recycling cullet carefully selected for colour and type, provided much information on Roman glass production technology. A combined approach, involving analytical, statistical, and archaeological evidence, included chemical analyses (X-ray fluorescence, electron microprobe), which indicated that the coloured samples were all soda-lime-silica in composition, with natron as flux, although cluster analysis identified many compositional groups. Comparisons among the compositional groups of the colourless glass, previously studied, and those of coloured glass showed that the production technologies of the colourless glass vessels constitute two well-defined technological end-members, also related to group types, into which those of the coloured glass samples fall. In particular, coloured glass samples - all bottles, low-status vessels - were produced with mainly beach siliceous-feldspar-calcareous sand. However, unlike the colourless type, strict control of raw materials and decolourising processes was not adopted, and recycling was also practised, as demonstrated by the Sb 2 O 3, Cu and Pb patterns. In this context, a ‘‘recycling index’’ (RI) - [(Sb 2 O 3) X/(Sb 2 O 3) Ref]* 100 - proposed here for the first time, in order to quantify the extent of recycling of antimony colourless glass in the batch. RI is valid for glass containing abundant Sb from an end-member <b>of</b> <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> In conclusion, although it cannot be stated unequivocally that the identified compositional trends are related to different production centres or different raw materials, the strong evidence of compositional variability among all the Iulia Felix glass samples, both colourless and coloured, supports the dispersed production model for Roman glassware and the common practice of recycling in Roman imperial times, especially for low-status vessels...|$|E
25|$|Roman glass objects {{have been}} {{recovered}} across the Roman Empire in domestic, industrial and funerary contexts.

However, during the 1st century AD the industry underwent rapid technical growth that saw the introduction of glass blowing and the dominance <b>of</b> <b>colourless</b> or ‘aqua’ <b>glasses.</b> Production of raw glass was undertaken in geographically separate locations to the working of glass into finished vessels, {{and by the end of}} the 1st century AD large scale manufacturing resulted in the establishment of glass as a commonly available material in the Roman world, and one which also had technically very difficult specialized types of luxury glass, which must have been very expensive.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the compositional analysis of Roman and early post-Roman glass from both domestic assemblages and the remains derived from glass working and producing sites in Britain, using Inductively Coupled Plasma Spectrometry (ICPS). Samples analysed were from glassworking waste from Mancetter (midsecond century), Leicester (third century) and Worcester (first to third centuries), glass production debris, probably manufactured from the raw materials, in conjuncton with a domestic assemblage, from Coppergate (first to fourth centuries, or possibly later), and a domestic assemblage from Fishergate (spanning both the Roman and immediate post- Roman periods). All the glass analysed was shown to be of a typical and uniform soda-limesilica composition, except for a small number of vessel fragments from York which were higher in calcium.

40|$|Arheološko-konzervatorska istraživanja lokaliteta St Blek 1 donijela su nova saznanja o građevinskom sklopu koji je već prije definiran s tri glavne faze življenja. Na antičku vilu rusticu, koja je bila u privrednoj funkciji unutar porečkog agera, sjela je kasnoantička kula i dijelom iskoristila zidove ranije faze, a najočitiji ostaci kasnoantičkog doba su gljivasti otvor i crkva do kule. Srednjovjekovni dio se očituje u pronalascima pleterne ornamentike, stupića prozorskih otvora i ziđa. Radovima u 2008. godini definirani su prije otkriveni dijelovi zidova kule, a unutar jedne srednjovjekovne nadogradnje otkriven je sloj prve polovine 14. stoljeća, datiran mletačkom novcem i staklenim inventarom. Archaeological rescue {{excavations}} at the St Blek site engendered a {{new understanding}} of the previously defined construction complex, with three main stages of living. A tower was constructed in Late Antiquity atop a villa rustica from an earlier period of Antiquity in the Poreč ager. The tower partially used the walls from the earlier stage. The most obvious remains of Late Antiquity are a mushroom-shaped door and the church near the tower. The medieval portion is evident in finds of braidwork ornaments, pillars in window openings and the walls. In excavations conducted in 2008, the previously uncovered parts of the tower walls were defined. On the northern side of the northern wall, in the immediate vicinity of the eastern doors with a mushroom-shaped door, the remains of two stairs were discovered that led to the tower’s upper floors (Fig. 1). Along {{the northern part of the}} stairs, a part of the wall was preserved. It was made of the same yellowish mortar as the stairs, as well as dressed stone. This kind of mortar has not been identified on the walls of this structure, and the steps were built in a separate construction phase. It is precisely into these stairs that the pillar from the church was built. As the stairs commence precisely from the mushroom-shaped door, it is assumed that the door functioned at that time. Apart from defining the single wall sections that were not clear from before, in the room in the western side of the northern tower wall (Cuscito, Riavez 2008, 731, Plate 1. No. 5) a layer (Fig. 2) was found in which four silver Venetian coins from the second half of the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries were found. These are the denari (piccolo o denaro scodellato) of three doges: Lorenzo Tiepolo (1268 - 1275), Giovanni Dandolo (1280 - 1289), two pieces, and Pietro Gradenigo (1289 - 1311). In the same layer, the remains of several glass bottles were unearthed, mostly bottles and glasses that – based on their shapes – belong to the fourteenth century, and are probably of Venetian origin. The bottle’s necks were preserved with a discoid extension in the middle of the necks and with rims outward (Fig. 3). The bottoms are inverted in the shape of a cone, with ring-shaped rims (Fig. 4). The middles of the glass bottoms are conically imprinted. The walls of beakers are straight or spirally ribbed. Some are decorated by a blue thread on the edge. Such glasses are a standard product of the late thirteenth century and the entire fifteenth century (Lazar 2003, 81). Also interesting are the broad necks of vessels with a broadly and flatly inverted rim made <b>of</b> <b>colourless</b> <b>glass,</b> which may be defined as urological vessels (urinals). These vessels were used from the thirteenth to seventeenth centuries for medical purposes. The finds from this layer are the first genuine experience of fourteenth century life and economy at the site. The coins and glass suggest that a richer class lived in the tower, since in the fourteenth century glass was a luxury good. Thus, Stari Tar (Old Tar), functioned simultaneously with the Novi Tar (New Tar), and probably at this time the administrator of this part of the Poreč region lived in the Stari Tar tower...|$|E

40|$|A {{group of}} Roman glass {{objects from the}} Bocholtz burial in the SW of Limburg (The Netherlands) {{was found to have}} been subject to varying degrees of degradation. Many <b>of</b> the 25 <b>colourless</b> <b>glass</b> objects were {{fragmented}} to pieces < 0. 1 cm ("sugared"), whereas the three transparent blue-green glass objects were in near-pristine state. Analyses using SEM, XRF and EDS revealed that the fragmentation was the direct result of the intense leaching of Na 2 O from the glass structure and its replacement with water. The resulting gel layers with low-Na 2 O contents and large amounts of water are sensitive to cracking when they dry out. Thin-walled glass appears to be less sensitive to cracking from the resulting stress than thick-walled glass. Local differences in the moisture regime during burial also influence the severity of the glass degradation. Glass with low concentrations of CaO seems to be the most sensitive to this form of degradation. The typical blue-green Roman glass is less sensitive as it generally has considerably higher concentrations of CaO. "Sugared" glass has - until now - only been reported in a small number of high-status burials. However, glass fragments that are degraded as strongly as some of the objects in the Bocholtz burial may have been overlooked in other archaeological settings (e. g. settlements), especially in coarse-grained soils or soils containing debris or rock fragments. As a result, the archaeological record for Roman glass may be biased towards the "typical" blue-green transparent glass objects. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|The {{best way}} for glassmakers to have avoided the {{colouring}} effects of iron was to use pure raw materials, because the use of sand in natron glasses commonly incorporated iron. <b>Colourless</b> <b>glass</b> could also be achieved by adding a decolourant [28 : p. 764, 66 : p. 97].|$|R

30|$|All {{but one of}} {{the glasses}} have a similar iron content, and this oxide is {{probably}} responsible for producing the various shades of green and light blue.

25|$|Experimenting {{with the}} new technology, the forest glassmakers found it {{difficult}} to achieve the high standards of clarity and colour of the Roman methods, due mainly to the great variability of colour-controlling elements in the raw materials. European sand and soil is generally higher in iron and manganese. Iron gives a blue-green tinge to glass under usual furnace atmosphere conditions, but also may give a yellow colour. Manganese has its own purple colour which may balance out the iron colour to make <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> For instance, glass made from beech wood grown on meagre lime-rich soil (e.g. Kleinlutzel, Jura) is high in manganese and thus, nearly colourless while that in a clay-rich area (e.g. Court-Chalvet, Jura) is olive green. Thus, a variety of colours may be produced and experimentation allowed the glassmakers to progress from the early muddy green-yellow-brown colours toward clear-coloured and <b>colourless</b> <b>glass.</b> Local conditions allowed some areas to produce finer glass at an earlier stage. In Bohemia {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century the decolourising powers of manganese were used to produce a clear glass suitable for engraving. The amount of carbon left in the wood ash also may affect the colour of the glass by modifying the furnace atmosphere. The glass in York Minster has been shown to be 90% naturally coloured, without added colorants.|$|R

Chemical {{evidence shows that}} different silica raw materials were used in imperial and early Byzantine times for blue and green <b>glass</b> found locally. <b>Colourless</b> <b>glass</b> shows no clear difference in chemical composition and hence in silica raw materials between late Roman and early Byzantine times. Locally found early Byzantine yellow-green glass and chunks correspond to the previously defined Byzantine HIMT glass type. The chemical composition of the glass chunks found, identical {{to that of the}} contemporary glass of the same colour, strongly indicates that these chunks were used for the manufacture of early Byzantine green, <b>colourless</b> and yellow-green <b>glass</b> at Sagalassos. status: publishe...|$|R
