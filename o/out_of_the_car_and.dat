If the player arrives too early, the enemy gangsters will attempt to escape. If the player arrives too late, the building will be found vacant. A timetable of all meetings {{are included in the}} game's instruction manual. The aesthetic interior of buildings include two rooms, with limited decorations such as a pool table and chairs.

The player can apprehend him by either catching or trapping him. Once caught, the player may take him to the city hall to interrogate him in order to receive information such as the location of the next gangster meetup. Points are gained by apprehending criminals, returning evidence bags or destroying cars.|$|E
