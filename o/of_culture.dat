40|$|A {{comparison}} is {{made between the}} use of a stratified universe and an unstratified universe <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> for sampling purposes. Samples are taken from the Ethnographic Atlas (1) by selecting from culture clusters (a first level <b>of</b> stratification <b>of</b> <b>cultures)</b> and (2) by a random selection from the total list <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> in the Atlas. The analysis is done regionally, for Africa and North America. A chi-square, two-sample test indicates the essential similarity of the stratified and the unstratified universes; no significant statistical difference is found among the samples. Matched-pair, signed-ranks tests are used to determine (1) the comparative stability of successive samples taken from the stratified universe and those taken from the unstratified universe and (2) the interchangeability <b>of</b> cul-tures within <b>culture</b> clusters. Results for Africa indicate no significantly greater similarity of successive samples based on culture clusters compared with successive random samples based on the totality <b>of</b> <b>cultures.</b> For North America, successive samples from culture clusters seem to be significantly more stable than random samples from the totality <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> only in regard to Ethnographic Atlas data. General interchangeability <b>of</b> <b>cultures</b> within culture clusters is not borne out by the data examined. [Accepted for publication: April 1970. ...|$|R
