5|$|Luciferin-luciferase {{reactions}} {{are not the}} <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> organisms produce light. The parchment worm Chaetopterus (a marine Polychaete) makes use of another photoprotein, aequorin, instead of luciferase. When calcium ions are added, the aequorin's rapid catalysis creates a brief flash quite unlike the prolonged glow produced by luciferase. In a second, much slower, step luciferin is regenerated from the oxidised (oxyluciferin) form, allowing it to recombine with aequorin, in readiness for a subsequent flash. Photoproteins are thus enzymes, but with unusual reaction kinetics.|$|E
5|$|The Arévalo {{government}} also floated {{the idea of}} a Central American Federation, as being the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> a democratic government could survive in the region. He approached several leaders of democratic Central American countries, but was rejected by all except Castañeda Castro, the president of El Salvador. The two leaders began talks to build a union, and set up several commissions to look into the issue. In late 1945 they announced the formation of the union, but the formalization of the process got delayed by internal troubles in both countries, and in 1948 the Castro government was toppled in a military coup led by Óscar Osorio.|$|E
5|$|The {{authors of}} Kepler-14b's {{discovery}} paper noted that, {{had they not}} discovered that Kepler-14 was indeed a binary system, the parameters for Kepler-14b would have been extremely inaccurate. They noted that other planets discovered using radial velocity measurements might not have accounted {{for the possibility that}} their host stars were binary systems; the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> this was definitely known in the case of Kepler-14 was through the use of high-resolution imaging. If the less prominent portion of the Kepler-14 binary system had not been detected, Kepler-14b's mass would have been incorrect by nearly 60%, and its radius too small by about 10%.|$|E

5|$|The {{notion of}} a book, as a topological space, was defined by C. A. Persinger and Gail Atneosen in the 1960s. As part of this work, Atneosen already {{considered}} embeddings of graphs in books. The embeddings he studied used the same definition as embeddings of graphs into any other topological space: vertices are represented by distinct points, edges are represented by curves, and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> two edges can intersect {{is for them to}} meet at a common endpoint.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{duplication}} {{is not the}} <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> venom {{has become}} more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor {{is believed to have}} had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and {{to be related to the}} prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest of the organism.|$|E
5|$|His fiancée is {{determined}} to prove his innocence, but knows not how to establish it. She meets a homeless man, who closely resembles Jack, {{who is about to}} commit a crime by smashing a window. The man desires to go to prison, believing it to be the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> he will have food and shelter. The girl recognizes the opportunity and plans to pay him for taking the place of her fiancée in prison. The man consents and the heiress concocts a clever substitution that proves successful via change of clothes. Jack, now free, confronts the aunt—who believes that his reappearance is a ghostly one. The aunt confesses that the baron's wounds were self-inflicted and the circumstantial evidence that the servant and policeman had seen was an erroneous. The substitute convict is pardoned and released from prison without the swap ever being known. For his plot, the French baron is convicted for perjury and sent to the state prison.|$|E

5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} chain counter, {{consisting}} of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air. The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a warrior-type role; Ravager, a black mage-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a paladin. Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the player can control the AI characters during battle. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.|$|E
5|$|The Paradigm {{system allows}} the player to program six {{different}} roles, which the characters can assume to perform certain formations in battle {{in response to}} specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, which uses non-elemental attacks to stabilize the Chain Gauge; Ravager, which uses elemental attacks to fill the Chain Gauge; Medic, a White Mage-type role which can heal the party; Saboteur, which can weaken enemies; Synergist, which can strengthen allies; and Sentinel, which has protective abilities. The two main characters can initially assume three roles, but they can learn others at the player's choosing as the game progresses. The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters use while outside or during battle, which is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> the player can control the AI characters during a fight. The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up before the battle. Monsters only have one role; different ones are used when the player switches paradigms. The player selects up to three monsters they wish to use in paradigms outside of battle. Unlike in Final Fantasy XIII, the player cannot summon the Eidolons, as the giant creatures were only available to the protagonists of that game.|$|E

25|$|Although several {{witnesses}} came to {{the conclusion}} that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect. Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey. The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal bleeding or circulatory shock. The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the canine teeth, are to be expected since this is the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> most land carnivores have to catch their prey.|$|E

Boca played its home matches in the Ferro Carril Oeste ground in Caballito until it was completed in May 25, 1940. A third level was added in 1953, originating then its nickname La Bombonera ('The Chocolate Box'). The stand opposite the Casa Amarilla railway platforms remained mostly undeveloped until 1996, when it was upgraded with new balconies and quite expensive VIP boxes. Three sides of the Bombonera are thus made up of traditional sloping stadium stands, but the fourth side was built vertically, with several seating areas stacked {{one on top of the}} other, the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> makes it stand into the club premises.|$|E

British intelligence registered the Turkish national movement as a movement of the Muslim citizens of Anatolia.
