5|$|After the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Ante Pavelić, {{the leader of the}} newly created Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), offered Adolf Hitler volunteers to serve on the Eastern Front. This offer soon resulted in the formation and deployment of army, air force and naval detachments which, after being trained and equipped by Germany, were committed to fighting the Red Army. The largest element was the 369th Croatian Reinforced Infantry Regiment, which was part of the 100th Jäger Division, but was decimated at Stalingrad in January 1943. The Croatian forces performed creditably on the Eastern Front, and the Germans continued to support the development of NDH forces with the aim of raising several divisions to serve there. Due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> leaders and staff, these divisions were raised using a German cadre.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore {{dimensions}} {{that relate to the}} training systems effectiveness in a number of industry categories. The training system is taken as part of the reproducer boundary subsystem within the organisation (Miller 1978). The research has been developed on the assumption that no single criterion is appropriate as a measure of effectiveness <b>of</b> a <b>training</b> system (Campbell et al 1970). An index of criteria based on the different organisational variables that interact within an organisation is employed {{in the development of the}} study. In this research the structural variables (independent variables) including industry category, size and formalisation factors of the sample organisations will be related to the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>training</b> systems in their organisations. This research attempts to formulate hypotheses in the field <b>of</b> <b>training</b> system research to contribute to a theory <b>of</b> <b>training</b> system impact studies. The popular areas of research in the field <b>of</b> <b>training</b> have mainly tended to focus separately on the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>training</b> programmes, the economics <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> the social impact <b>of</b> <b>training</b> and the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> To my knowledge there is no research work that tests the relationship between structure and the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>training</b> systems...|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, a {{combination}} of low recruitment and retention rates across the RAN resulted in the number <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> submariners falling below 40% of that required. As an attempt to retain submariners, the RAN offered a one-off A$35,000 bonus in 1999. Other measures introduced {{around the same time}} included priority transfer of volunteers for submarine training and rotating submariners between sea and shore assignments to relieve them from continual sea service and prevent burnout. A year later, these measures had increased submariner numbers to 55% of requirements.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, the Australian government decided to raise an all-volunteer force for service overseas due to the provisions of the Defence Act (1903), which precluded compelling the Militia to serve outside of Australian territory. This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF). Although the 2nd AIF would be raised upon a cadre <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> officers and non-commissioned officers drawn from the Militia, the Militia's main role at this time was to provide training to the men called up as part of the compulsory training scheme that was readopted in early 1940. Throughout 1940–41 the battalion undertook a number of short periods of continuous training, however, following the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor and invasion of Malaya in December 1941, it was mobilised for war service.|$|E

5|$|Other {{problems}} faced by the ZNG included a shortage <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> officers, inadequate troop training, a shortage of weapons and especially a shortage of ammunition. Mobilisation proved particularly successful, however, and troops were plentiful; in Zagreb, approximately 80 percent of those called up in September and October reported for service. The ZNG were short of uniforms; 20 percent of those drafted in Zagreb during this period received uniforms, while the remainder fought in civilian clothes. The ZNG also relied on the civilian infrastructure for food, fuel and medical care.|$|E
5|$|The average Soviet soldier {{suffered}} from inexperience. With the Soviet debacle {{of the previous}} year ameliorated only by the barest victory at Moscow, most of the original manpower of the Red Army had been killed, wounded or captured by the Germans, with casualties of almost 1,000,000 just from the Battle of Moscow. The typical soldier in the Red Army was a conscript and had little to no combat experience, and tactical training was practically nonexistent. Coupled with the lack <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> soldiers, the Red Army also began to suffer from the loss of Soviet industrial areas, and a temporary strategic defense was considered necessary.|$|E
5|$|The rise of {{centralized}} kingdoms {{among the}} Sakalava, Merina and {{other ethnic groups}} produced the island's first standing armies by the 16th century, initially equipped with spears but later with muskets, cannons and other firearms. By the early 19th century, the Merina sovereigns of the Kingdom of Madagascar had brought much of the island under their control by mobilizing an army <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> and armed soldiers numbering as high as 30,000. French attacks on coastal towns in the later {{part of the century}} prompted then-Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to solicit British assistance to provide training to the Merina monarchy's army. Despite the training and leadership provided by British military advisers, the Malagasy army was unable to withstand French weaponry and was forced to surrender following an attack on the royal palace at Antananarivo. Madagascar was declared a colony of France in 1897.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount and}} type <b>of</b> <b>training</b> given to peace {{officers}} differs between agencies. The requirement <b>of</b> <b>training</b> for police officers is {{a minimum of}} 635 hours, the requirement for full-time peace officers is a minimum of 100 hours <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> and the requirement for part-time peace officers is a minimum of 10 hours <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> However, each agency can give their officers as much training as they want {{as long as it}} meets the minimum requirement. For example, NYPD Auxiliary Police Officers go through 54 hours <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> exceeding the minimum requirement of 10 hours <b>of</b> <b>training</b> for part-time peace officers, and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority Officers go through more than 500 hours <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> exceeding the minimum requirement of 100 hours <b>of</b> <b>training</b> for full-time peace officers. All training courses for peace officers include training in criminal law, police science, powers they have, what they can and can't do, some physical training, arrest procedures, how to properly make arrests, and how to properly use their equipment. Peace Officers who are armed must be trained with their firearm before they can carry it, and must re-qualify yearly. Agencies may also give their officers additional types <b>of</b> <b>training</b> such as homeland security training and emergency vehicle operation.|$|R
40|$|Employee {{training}} programs {{need to develop}} ways of increasing the likelihood that learned skills and behaviours are used when employees return to their jobs, i. e., that "transfer of training" occurs. One way to facilitate transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> is to perform a post-training intervention designed to increase transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> This dissertation has four main purposes. The first purpose was to test the effects of two post-training interventions, relapse prevention and transfer enhancement, in a 2 x 2 experimental design. The two interventions were designed to increase transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> by increasing self-efficacy for the training task, or a person's belief {{in his or her}} ability to perform the training task. Subjects were 147 nurses from one hospital who participated in a two day workshop. Self-efficacy and transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> were measured by both self-reports and supervisor reports at two and six months following training. Contrary to prediction, the two post-training interventions did not result in higher transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> than the control group. It is suggested that the training itself was effective in increasing self-efficacy and in leading to transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> in control subjects, making post-training interventions redundant for this training program. The second purpose was to test the effect of "motivation to learn" on transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> Strong support was found for the hypothesis that "motivation to learn" is positively related to transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> The third purpose of the dissertation was to examine the process by which transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> occurs. This study hypothesized that self-efficacy would be positively related to transfer <b>of</b> <b>training,</b> and strong support was found for this hypothesis. The fourth purpose of the dissertation was to examine the influence of transfer climate on transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> It was found that supervisor and coworker support had a positive effect on self-reported but not supervisor-reported transfer <b>of</b> <b>training.</b> A model <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>training</b> is presented and recommendations for research and practice are discusse...|$|R

Apprenticeship is mainly an alternative educational track for school-leavers from Junior Secondary Vocational Education while, for school- leavers, industrial training serves mainly as a substitute for any deficiencies in their skills. ...|$|R
5|$|At {{independence}} on 30 June 1960, {{the army}} {{suffered from a}} dramatic deficit <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> leaders, particularly in the officer corps. This was because the Force Publique had always only been officered by Belgian or other expatriate whites. The Belgian Government {{made no effort to}} train Congolese commissioned officers until {{the very end of the}} colonial period, and in 1958, only 23 African cadets had been admitted even to the military secondary school. The highest rank available to Congolese was adjutant, which only four soldiers achieved before independence. Though 14 Congolese cadets were enrolled in the Royal Military Academy in Brussels in May, they were not scheduled to graduate as second lieutenants until 1963. Ill-advised actions by Belgian officers led to an enlisted ranks' rebellion on 5 July 1960, which helped spark the Congo Crisis. Lieutenant General Émile Janssens, the Force Publique commander, wrote during a meeting of soldiers that 'Before independence=After Independence', pouring cold water on the soldiers' desires for an immediate raise in their status.|$|E
5|$|By late 1942, {{training}} became sufficient {{in quality}} {{and the number of}} crews increased. For example, No. 17 Group RAF produced 238 trained crews in August 1943, using the 1,007 aircraft available. During that year, 1,863 crews totalling some 11,482 men, were trained on 14 different types of aircraft in 255,800 hours. A combination of changed requirements and the formation of more specialist and advanced training overseas reduced the need for further expansion in 1944. The figures in 1943 proved to be the highest annual out put <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> crews in wartime. With sufficient manpower now available, four OTUs were closed in 1944. By July 1944 the 26 syllabuses increased to 38 and the course hours increased to 12 weeks and 87 hours. A/S training was soon set in two stages; conversion training taking five to six weeks and 32 day and night flying training and then an operational phase, in which another 55 hours and 30 sorties were flown in five weeks. This phase included ten flights on radar and gunnery training.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, the French Republic, {{under the rule of}} the National Convention, was at war with all its neighbours. With famine imminent, the French Committee of Public Safety looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an {{infusion}} of grain; this was to be convoyed across the Atlantic during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the Bay of Biscay. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the French Navy's ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by Lord Howe, knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with {{the main body of the}} Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the weather gage from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.|$|E

5|$|In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's {{official}} romanization system. GR {{was used}} to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from a small number <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to Pinyin and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators {{have been used in}} romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of Shaanxi (shǎnxī, 陝西), which cannot be distinguished from Shanxi (shānxī, 山西) when written in pinyin without diacritics.|$|E
5|$|In February 1793, the National Convention that governed the French Republic {{expanded}} the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars by declaring war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. The light vessels of the British Royal Navy had {{been preparing for}} the conflict for several months, having concentrated in June 1792 at Spithead {{in anticipation of the}} outbreak of war. These ships were stationed in large numbers in the North Sea and the English Channel to defend British maritime trade against the threat of French commerce raiders operating from the French Channel ports. The French Navy by contrast was riven with the same social divisions that had divided France {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution four years earlier. This had led to the collapse of the professional officer corps and the elimination of the rank <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> seamen-gunners on the grounds of elitism, resulting in a dearth of experience both in seamanship and naval combat.|$|E
