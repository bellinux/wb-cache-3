5|$|An <b>observational</b> <b>study</b> by Logan {{demonstrates}} that the female is continuously {{evaluating the quality of}} the male and his territory. The assessment is usually triggered by the arrival of a new male in a neighboring territory {{at the beginning of a}} new breeding season. In those cases, the mated female is constantly seen flying over both the original and the new male’s territory, evaluating the qualities of both territories and exchanging calls with both males. The social mate displays aggressive behaviors towards the female, while the new male shows less aggression and sings softer songs. At the same time, both the mated male and the new male will fly over other territories to attract other females as well. Divorce, mate switching and extra-pair matings do occur in northern mockingbirds.|$|E

50|$|Fundamentally, however, <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> are not experiments. By definition, <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> {{lack the}} {{manipulation}} required for Baconian experiments. In addition, <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> (e.g., in biological or social systems) often involve variables {{that are difficult}} to quantify or control. <b>Observational</b> <b>studies</b> are limited because they lack the statistical properties of randomized experiments. In a randomized experiment, the method of randomization specified in the experimental protocol guides the statistical analysis, which is usually specified also by the experimental protocol. Without a statistical model that reflects an objective randomization, the statistical analysis relies on a subjective model. Inferences from subjective models are unreliable in theory and practice. In fact, there are several cases where carefully conducted <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> consistently give wrong results, that is, where the results of the <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> are inconsistent and also differ from the results of experiments. For example, epidemiological studies of colon cancer consistently show beneficial correlations with broccoli consumption, while experiments find no benefit.|$|R
5|$|The next era of Kīlauea's history {{began with}} the {{establishment}} of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory on the volcano's rim in 1912. The first permanent such installation in the United States, the observatory was the brainchild of Thomas Jaggar, head of geology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; after witnessing the devastation of the 1908 Messina earthquake near Mount Etna in Italy, he declared that something must be done to support systematic volcanic and seismic study, and chose Kīlauea as the site of the first such establishment. After securing initial funding from MIT and the University of Hawaii, Jaggar took directorship of the observatory and, whilst its head between 1912 and 1940, pioneered seismological and <b>observational</b> <b>study</b> and observation of active volcanoes. After initial funding ran out, the Observatory was successively funded by the National Weather Service, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Park Service, before settling on the USGS, under whose banner the observatory has been operating since 1947. The main building has been moved twice since establishment, and today is positioned on the northwest rim of Kīlauea's caldera.|$|E

A case-control study is another type of <b>observational</b> <b>study</b> in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.|$|E
40|$|Randomized {{clinical}} trials have limitations because {{they focus on}} small samples of highly selected patients. <b>Observational</b> <b>studies,</b> which follow large cohorts of typical patients receiving pharmacological treatments, should overcome some of these trial limitations and provide information that cannot be generated with {{clinical trials}}. The present study aimed to compare experimental and <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> of clozapine-treated subjects with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. A systematic review of experimental and <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> evaluating clozapine-treated subjects in treatment-resistant schizophrenia was carried out. We identified 50 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Less than one-third of clinical trials enrolled more than 50 patients compared to 44 % of prospective and nearly 90 % of retrospective studies. In addition, 78 % of prospective and 89 % of retrospective <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> lasted more than 12 weeks, {{while the majority of}} trials lasted less than 8 weeks. Most clinical trials defined treatment-resistant schizophrenia according to Kane's criteria, while the majority of <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> adopted implicit criteria. In comparison with clinical trials, <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> provided a higher weighted mean rate of clozapine-responders and a lower weighted mean rate of clozapine-dropouts. This literature survey suggests that the role of <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> in the evaluation of medicines should be reconsidered.

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} a potential efficacy-effectiveness gap and possible explanations (drivers of effectiveness) for differences between results of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> investigating glucose-lowering drugs. METHODS: A systematic literature review {{was conducted in}} English language articles published between 1 January, 2000 and 31 January, 2015 describing either RCTs or <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> comparing glucagon-like peptide- 1 analogs (GLP- 1) with insulin or comparing dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors (DPP- 4 i) with sulfonylurea, all with change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) as outcome. Medline, Embase, Current Content, and Biosis were searched. Information on effect estimates, baseline characteristics of the study population, publication year, study duration, and number of patients, and for <b>observational</b> <b>studies,</b> characteristics related to confounding adjustment and selection- and information bias were extracted. RESULTS: From 312 hits, 11 RCTs and 7 <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> comparing GLP- 1 with insulin, and from 474 hits, 16 RCTs and 4 <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> comparing DPP- 4 i with sulfonylurea were finally included. No differences were observed in baseline characteristics of the study populations (age, sex, body mass index, time since diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and HbA 1 c) or effect sizes across study designs. Mean effect sizes ranged from - 0. 43 to 0. 91 and from - 0. 80 to 1. 13 in RCTs and <b>observational</b> <b>studies,</b> respectively, comparing GLP- 1 with insulin, and from - 0. 13 to 2. 70 and - 0. 20 to 0. 30 in RCTs and <b>observational</b> <b>studies,</b> respectively, comparing DPP- 4 i and sulfonylurea. Generally, the identified <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> held potential flaws with regard to confounding adjustment and selection- and information bias. CONCLUSIONS: Neither potential drivers of effectiveness nor an efficacy-effectiveness gap were identified. However, {{the limited number of}} studies and potential problems with confounding adjustment, selection- and information bias in the <b>observational</b> <b>studies,</b> may have hidden a true efficacy-effectiveness gap...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the lines}} of {{difference}} in interpretation is whether to treat the regressors as random variables, or as predefined constants.

In the other interpretation (fixed design), the regressors X are treated as known constants set by a design, and y is sampled conditionally on the values of X as in an experiment. For practical purposes, this distinction is often unimportant, since estimation and inference is carried out while conditioning on X. All results stated {{in this article are}} within the random design framework.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To explore {{external}} validity of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of hypertension within China from {{the view of}} sample representation. Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were performed in Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCTR) et al and advanced search strategies were used to locate hypertension RCTs as well as <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> conducted in China during 1996 to 2009 synchronously. The risk of bias in RCTs and <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> was assessed by two modified scales respectively, and then both types of studies with 3 or more grading scores were included {{for the purpose of}} evaluating of {{external validity}}. Following that the study characteristics relative to sample representation were extracted from RCTs and <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> synchronously, and the later were taken as external references for validating sample representation of RCTs. Results: 226 hypertension RCTs and 21 <b>observational</b> <b>studies</b> were included for final analysis.

25|$|Sleep in fish is not {{extensively}} studied. Typically fish exhibit {{periods of}} inactivity but show no significant reactions to deprivation of this condition. Some species that always live in shoals or that swim continuously (because {{of a need}} for ram ventilation of the gills, for example) are suspected never to sleep. There is also doubt about certain blind species that live in caves. Other fish seem to sleep, however. For example, zebrafish, tilapia, tench, brown bullhead, and swell shark become motionless and unresponsive at night (or by day, {{in the case of}} the swell shark); Spanish hogfish and blue-headed wrasse can even be lifted by hand all the way to the surface without evoking a response.

On the other hand, sleep patterns are easily disrupted and may even disappear during periods of migration, spawning, and parental care.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{multiple}} firms announced {{devices that}} could be inserted via a leg catheter rather than invasive surgery.

Engineers and scientists are currently working on this type of device. In November 2014 a patient, Bill Pike of Fairbanks, Alaska, received a Medtronic Micra pacemaker in Providence St Vincent Hospital in Portland Oregon. D. Randolph Jones was the EP doctor. In 2014 also St. Jude Medical Inc. announced the first enrollments in the company’s leadless Pacemaker <b>Observational</b> <b>Study</b> evaluating the Nanostim leadless pacing technology.
