5|$|Starting {{with the}} {{founding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> in 1947 as {{the successor to}} the Office of Strategic Services, the author provides the reader with a chronological overview of the agency's history. He documents the CIA's involvement in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, and provides a biographical assessment of the motivations of Mohammad Mosaddegh, the Iranian leader deposed in the coup. In briefly describing individuals, organizations and events related to the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> Smith notes Russian intelligence Colonel Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel), and discusses the U.S. intelligence operation that used a front company called Zenith Technical Enterprises. The chronological presentation of CIA history is used to provide additional background {{with regard to the}} agency's involvement with the War on Terror. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in March 2003.|$|E

5|$|After 1952, the {{building}} {{served as the}} European centre of the American armed forces and {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. V Corps. It later became the headquarters for the Northern Area Command until 1994. The IG Farben Building was also the headquarters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> in Germany, which led to its sobriquet 'the Pentagon of Europe'. On April 16, 1975, the US Army renamed {{the building}} the General Creighton W. Abrams Building. The renaming did not have full authority in law, because the US was technically leasing the building from the German government and thus was not the rightful owner.|$|E
5|$|Amin's {{short-lived}} {{presidency was}} marked by controversies from beginning to end. He came to power by ordering {{the death of his}} predecessor Nur Muhammad Taraki. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The Soviet Union, which alleged that Amin was an agent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> intervened in Afghanistan while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets in December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, having ruled for slightly longer than three months.|$|E
5|$|Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency is a 2003 book by W. Thomas Smith, Jr. It is an encyclopedic {{work on the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), {{the only}} {{independent}} agency of the United States federal government that is tasked with intelligence-gathering. The work chronicles {{the history of the}} agency from its founding in 1947 through the War on Terror, which began after September 11, 2001. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in 2003. It provides approximately 550 entries across 282 pages on topics including notable contributors, intelligence operations, historical events, and depictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> in fictional media.|$|E

25|$|Two {{contract}} psychologists devised <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> enhanced {{interrogation techniques}} {{and played a}} central role in the operation, assessments, and management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> Detention and Interrogation Program.

50|$|Between 1966-1970, {{during the}} Vietnam War, Clines worked as Ted Shackley's deputy in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> secret war in Laos.|$|R
5|$|He {{graduated}} from the University of Michigan in 1949 and worked for the U.S. Forest Service {{for the next two}} years. He was reassigned to Washington, D.C. in 1951, where he was hired by the CIA to investigate forests of the Eastern Bloc. In 1956, Miskovsky obtained a law degree from the George Washington University Law School. He joined the legal office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> and was eventually promoted to the rank of assistant general counsel.|$|E
5|$|Smith gave an {{interview}} to the Columbia newspaper The State about his book and his interest in researching {{the history of the}} Central Intelligence Agency. He explained that he was long interested in researching military history, and was initially asked by the American Society of Journalists and Authors to put together a monograph on the 1944 Invasion of Normandy by Western Allied forces during Operation Overlord in World War II. His literary representative later telephoned him to ask if he would instead be interested in writing an encyclopedia detailing the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> Smith agreed as he felt the CIA was highly relevant to military history.|$|E
5|$|The Culinary Institute of America is {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} governed by a 24-member board of trustees. These trustees are elected to three-year terms by the Members of the Corporation, the stakeholders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> Each trustee can serve a maximum of four terms. The board appoints the president and votes on major initiatives for operation of the college, including tuition and fees, nomination of new trustees, operating and capital budgets, planning, major construction projects, and bylaw changes and amendments. The school's board of trustees has 24 members, including Ralph Brennan, Fred Carl, Jr., Thomas Keller, Michael Mina, Robert A. Muh, Charlie Palmer, Roy Yamaguchi, and chairman Jon L. Luther.|$|E
50|$|I {{should note}} that for most, if not all, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA’s</b> Detention and Interrogation Program, the now acting general counsel was a lawyer in <b>the</b> <b>CIA’s</b> Counterterrorism Center—the unit within which <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> managed and carried out this program.|$|R

5|$|The Intelligence Support Activity (ISA, The Activity) is {{the support}} branch of JSOC and USSOCOM. Its primary {{missions}} are to provide Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and Signal Intelligence (SIGINT) mainly for Delta and DEVGRU's operations. Before the establishing of the Strategic Support Branch in 2001, the ISA required the permission <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> to conduct covert operations, which considerably lessened its effectiveness in {{its support of}} JSOC operations as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{argued that}} pressure to fill fund raising quotas {{had led to}} 2,000 instances of credit card fraud, and that organization members had sought to obstruct the investigation. The defense presented {{the case that the}} prosecution was the culmination of a 20-year campaign of harassment by the FBI and CIA, and that the prosecution was acting on the orders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses.|$|E
5|$|After {{the credits}} roll, Ocelot is heard {{talking to the}} KGB Chief Director over the telephone. After {{suggesting}} that the KGB use the knowledge of both the Virtuous Mission and Operation Snake Eater to blackmail the United States during future negotiations, he then calls another, unidentified man. Ocelot informs him that the microfilm stolen by EVA was a fake and {{that half of the}} Philosopher's Legacy is now in America's hands, with the other half held by the KGB. It transpires that Ocelot has been triple-crossing everyone from the very beginning. He then reveals that he is in fact ADAM, that he is talking to the director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> and that he has been working for the said agency all this time.|$|E

5|$|Back in 1959 a Laotian Lieutenant Colonel of the {{minority}} Hmong tribe had been taken under the wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> effort in Laos. The highland Hmong were more aggressive than the lowland Lao and Vang Pao was quickly elevated to their leadership in hopes of creating a paramilitary force that would counter the Pathet Lao in the northeast. During 1961, the first weapons were delivered to the Hmong and their training was begun. Nine CIA specialists, nine U.S. Army Special Forces personnel, and 99 Thai members of the Police Aerial Reconnaissance Unit (PARU) participated in the training and equipping of {{what became known as}} the Armée Clandestine or the secret army.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} by School Library Journal, Smith's {{encyclopedia}} was praised for its reference value. The review called the encyclopedia comprehensive, and noted it contained helpful appendices including a glossary, lists of executive staff members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> {{and a large}} bibliography and index. Booklist commented in its review that the encyclopedia was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the encyclopedia and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded that the book was still a useful reference work.|$|E
5|$|Shoup opposed {{military}} action against Cuba, warning against any attempt to intervene militarily against Fidel Castro. He was initially not involved or aware of {{the plans for the}} Bay of Pigs invasion. He was asked by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to furnish an officer, but became furious when he learned the CIA was requisitioning Marine supplies without his permission. He finally learned the intent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> when the officer, Colonel Jack Hawkins, contacted him {{on the night of the}} invasion, pleading with him to appeal to Kennedy for air support. Following the failure of the operation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were blamed, which Shoup thought was unfair, as they had not been aware of the early planning.|$|E

5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict in Laos was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He {{was also one of}} the most controversial. Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that he alone maintain complete control over every aspect of American military operations in Laos and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of his detractors, however, considered the difficulties of the ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and this had to be done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, an ally in all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Camp Chapman {{attack was}} a suicide attack by Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi against the Central Intelligence Agency {{facility}} inside Forward Operating Base Chapman on December 30, 2009. FOB Chapman is located near the eastern Afghanistan city of Khost, which is about 10 miles northwest of the border with Pakistan. One of the main tasks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> personnel stationed at the base was to provide intelligence supporting drone attacks against targets in Pakistan. Seven American CIA officers and contractors, an officer of Jordan's intelligence service, and an Afghan working for the CIA were killed when al-Balawi detonated a bomb sewn into a vest he was wearing. Six other American CIA officers were wounded. The bombing was the most lethal attack against the CIA in more than 25 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{first phase}} of the {{operation}} began soon after Árbenz's resignation on June 27, 1954, with several agents being dispatched to Guatemala beginning on July 4. These included agents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> and the Office of Intelligence Research (OIR). The first phase involved the collection of 150,000 documents from sources including Árbenz's personal possessions, trade union offices, and police agencies. The ruling military junta led by Carlos Castillo Armas aided these efforts. Following a presentation made to US President Dwight Eisenhower on July 20, a decision was taken to accelerate the operation, and the number of people working in Guatemala was increased. The new team members posed as unaffiliated with the US government to maintain plausible deniability. The operation helped set up the Guatemalan National Committee of Defense Against Communism, which was covertly funded by the CIA: agents of the committee became involved in PBHistory. The team studied over 500,000 documents in total, and finished processing documents on 28 September 1954.|$|E

2500|$|The United States' Office of Legal Counsel in August 2002 {{responded to}} the request by <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> for a legal opinion {{regarding}} <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> certain interrogation techniques.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>CIA</b> had {{different}} demands placed on {{it by the}} different bodies overseeing it. Truman wanted a centralized group to organize the information that reached him, <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Defense wanted military intelligence and covert action, and the State Department wanted to create global political change favorable to the US. Thus <b>the</b> two areas <b>of</b> responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> were covert action and covert intelligence. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main targets for intelligence gathering was the Soviet Union, which had also been a priority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> predecessors.|$|R
