That same year, she became a teacher in Lima and made scientific translations, as she spoke five languages. When World War II broke out, German citizens were detained in Peru.|$|E
500|$|In March 1809 {{a miracle}} was {{reported}} as occurring at the convent. It is recorded {{that one of}} the nuns, Sister Mary Ann Wood, sustained a deep cut across her arm while opening a sash window. She was attended by a local surgeon, who judged that the muscles, and most of the tendons had been severed. The wound healed over after three weeks, but she continued to suffer sharp pain for four months. During all this time, she was not able to use her hand or arm, and despite attempting a variety of different methods to repair the broken tendons, the doctor eventually declared that she may regain use of her forefinger and thumb, but not the rest <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers.</b> By this time, her arm and hand had withered, and Sister Mary Ann decided to make a novena (nine prayers) to Saint Winifred. She began her prayers on 6 August, and placed a piece of moss on her arm; she said that she felt intense pain, and considered removing the moss, but opted not to. The following morning, she awoke, and her hand and arm were returned to full strength. The surgeon who had been tending to her was said to have [...] "at first declared the case a miracle; but human respect prevented him from publicly attesting it." [...] The Right Reverend Peter Collingridge, Vicar Apostolic of the Western District, after consulting a Catholic surgeon in London, declared [...] "that the cure was supernatural and an evident miracle." ...|$|E

60|$|Following the {{pointing}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> {{he took up}} a leg <b>of</b> <b>her</b> soiled drawers {{from the}} bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking: rumpled, shiny sole.|$|R
500|$|The revamped show in 2014 {{received}} acclaim by critics. Isabel Mohan from The Daily Telegraph acclaimed the revamped show {{praising the}} singer's sex appeal {{and noted that}} although the set included many new songs, the singer [...] "remained strikingly composed and confident throughout a show which proved her talent, charisma and awe-inspiring thighs". Sidney Madden who praised the upgraded set list further commended the show's fashion. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey felt that the show's set list {{was better than the}} original one describing the tour as [...] "wall-to-wall amazing Beyoncé". He concluded in his review, [...] "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers the entire thing with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire praised the singer's ranuchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, [...] "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a click <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>fingers,</b> and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest. She sings (with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour) and dances (flawlessly) for more than one and a half hours." [...] David Pollock of The Independent felt that, [...] "this near two-hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era. It was, at the very least, one of the hardest working shows likely to be witnessed on a stage this year, and with barely a drop of minutely-choreographed sweat to be seen." ...|$|E

60|$|Millicent {{staggered}} {{a little}} under the blow, which had been a heavy one, but her wits were clear, and, moving swiftly to a bell button, the pressure <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> was answered by a tinkle below.|$|R

60|$|Terrified {{that she}} would be gone--in my dressing-gown and {{slippers}} I groped my way across the room and was soon, with my door open, in the night air. She had heard me, and with a beckon <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>finger,</b> turned as if to lead me on.|$|R
