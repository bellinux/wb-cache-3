Nancy accompanies Liz {{to one of the}} activities, and is concerned when Liz speaks critically of everyone there and rebuffs a man whom Nancy has drawn into conversation. Nancy encourages Liz to focus not on the negative, but <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> does want from a man. Liz tries to follow Nancy's advice the next day at a dodgeball game, and she tells a man (Ariel Shafir), whom she hit in the face during a previous dodgeball game, what traits she wants from a man. However, the man does not speak English, and a disappointed Liz hits him with another ball.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{resigned}} from her {{position at the}} U.S. Department of Transportation in order {{to blow the whistle}} <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> saw as deficiencies in safety practices by the federal government's oversight of the airline industry. She was publicly critical of high-ranking U.S. aviation officials regarding the ValuJet Flight 592 passenger jet crash in the Florida Everglades which resulted in the deaths of all 110 people aboard. Schiavo appeared on ABC's Nightline program the night after the crash and was highly critical of FAA safety inspections methods. After resigning her position as Inspector General Schiavo taught courses at Ohio State University, and in April 1997 she joined the staff of Ohio State University in the position of Enarson Executive-in-Residence.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} well {{received}} by critics, {{many of whom}} complimented the lyrics, as well as Carey's vocals. The song was not commercially successful due to its limited release and other factors. The song {{was the center of}} a very public controversy between Carey and her label Sony Music, based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> perceived to be weak promotion of the single. It peaked at number 40 in Belgium Wallonia, number 45 in Italy and number 65 in the Netherlands. Stateside, due to Billboard rules at the time, it was not eligible to chart on the Hot 100, though it managed to reach number six on the dance chart.|$|E

5|$|Alphonse {{is guided}} by the homunculus Wrath to the {{underground}} city beneath Amestris' Central City to reopen the Gate of Alchemy. There, they are attacked by the homunculus Gluttony, who fights and mortally wounds Wrath. At Wrath's insistence, Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use as material to open the Gate. Meanwhile, in Munich, the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open the Gate based <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had learned from reading Edward's mind. Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society {{plans to use the}} weapons from his world to help Adolf Hitler in his attempt to start a revolution, and heads to stop them. Hohenheim and Envy are both transmuted {{at the same time that}} Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and Wrath. With the Gate opened, Eckhart leads a fleet into the other world, where she gains the ability to use alchemy. However, she begins to go mad with power and fear of her new surroundings and launches an attack on Central City. Alfons launches Edward in a rocket-powered plane to return him to his world before being gunned down.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E

25|$|Ethel's {{original}} character outline {{states that}} {{she was born in}} 1920. However, during the series this was altered to 1916 and for many years her birthday fell on 19 February. When Ethel came back to Walford to die in 2000, she revealed to Dot that she had lied about her age for many years. She was actually 86, not 85 (the character was aged two years, in a dramatic technique known as SORAS making her birthday fall in 1914). Ethel died <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> claimed was the night of her 86th birthday in September 2000, and although Dot knew very well her birthday was in February, she organised a party at Ethel's request to give her one last 'birthday' before she died. 19 February is also the day that EastEnders was first broadcast.|$|E

[...] In April 2016, Combs announced that after this last album and tour, he plans to retire from the music industry to focus on acting.|$|E

500|$|British author Georgette Heyer {{essentially}} {{invented the}} Regency romance in 1935 {{with the publication}} of Regency Buck, and her early Regencies were quite successful. In 1950 she began to work <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> called [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years", a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster between 1393 and 1435. To earn income, she periodically interrupted her research to write additional Regency romances; Lady of Quality, published in 1972, was the last of them, and the last of her novels to be published during her lifetime. Heyer suffered a stroke in July 1973 and was in ill health until her death the following year.|$|E
500|$|Fortune {{was among}} those who popularised the idea of a {{division}} between the left-hand path and right-hand path which had been introduced to Western esotericism by the Theosophist Helena Blavatsky. In doing so Fortune connected her disparaging views <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> considered to be the left hand path to the moral panic surrounding homosexuality in British society. Her works contained commentaries in which she condemned the [...] "homosexual techniques" [...] of malevolent male magicians, and she claimed that the acceptance of homosexuality was the cause of the downfall of the ancient Greek and Roman civilisations. The manner in which she sought to demonise the left hand path has been compared to that found in the work of English novelist Dennis Wheatley.|$|E
500|$|Georgette Heyer is {{best known}} for writing romantic stories set in the Regency era, but her body of work {{encompassed}} many different historical periods, including the English Civil War and the Middle Ages. One of her favoured periods centred on the House of Lancaster's peak of power, between 1393 and 1435. In 1950, Heyer began working <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> called [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years", a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster during that period. She estimated that she would need five years to complete this project. Her impatient readers continually clamoured for new books, however; to satisfy them and her tax liabilities, Heyer interrupted herself to write Regency romances, such as April Lady (1957) and Charity Girl (1970).|$|E

500|$|Davison {{developed}} the new tactic of {{setting fire to}} postboxes in December 1911. She was arrested for arson on the postbox outside parliament and admitted to setting fire to two others. Sentenced to six months in Holloway Prison, she did not go on hunger strike, but the authorities required that she be force-fed between 29 February and 7 March 1912 because they considered her health and appetite to be in decline. In June she and other suffragette inmates barricaded themselves in their cells and went on hunger strike; the authorities broke down the cell doors and force-fed the strikers. Following the force-feeding, Davison decided <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> described as a [...] "desperate protest... made {{to put a stop}} to the hideous torture, which was now our lot" [...] and jumped from one of the interior balconies of the prison.

500|$|The Quest Begins {{began as}} a request from HarperCollins who wanted Victoria Holmes, editor and creator of the Warriors series which {{followed}} the adventures of feral cats, to write another series about animals. The company suggested dogs to Holmes, but the idea was rejected since dogs behave very similarly to the cats in the Warriors series. Both horses and dolphins were suggested, but rejected due to their tendency to run away rather than fight and the slowness of battles underwater. Out of ideas, HarperCollins consulted with Holmes <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wanted to write about. After a bit of thinking Holmes replied, [...] "BEARS! They live much more solitary lifestyles than cats, they are wild through and through with no history of domestication whatsoever (performing bears don’t count), and they are much bigger animals, with {{a whole lot more}} potential for fighting".|$|E

[...] Tapping believed the reason why Magnus chose Will was that [...] "she doesn't want a yes man," [...] and wanted someone [...] "intelligent enough and ballsy enough to call her <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> doing wrong."
