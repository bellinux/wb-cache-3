5|$|Flies are {{adapted for}} aerial {{movement}} and typically have short and streamlined bodies. The first tagma of the fly, the head, bears the eyes, the antennae, and the mouthparts (the labrum, labium, mandible, and maxilla {{make up the}} mouthparts). The second tagma, the thorax, bears the wings and contains the flight muscles on the second segment, which is greatly enlarged; {{the first and third}} segments have been reduced to collar-like structures, and the third segment bears the halteres, which help to balance the insect during flight. The third tagma is the abdomen consisting of 11 segments, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> fused, and with the 3 hindermost segments modified for reproduction.|$|E

5|$|Insects possess {{segmented}} bodies {{supported by}} a hard-jointed outer covering, the exoskeleton, made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax {{and one or two}} pairs of wings. The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems. There is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts, especially wings, legs, antennae and mouthparts.|$|E
5|$|Most insects, however, lead short {{lives as}} adults, and rarely {{interact}} {{with one another}} except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of parental care, where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical for most species of bees and various types of wasps.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike games create random tile-based levels, monster encounters, and {{treasure}} through procedural generation on each new game. Preferably roguelikes {{adhering to the}} Berlin Interpretation use ASCII-based graphics. They may include pre-determined levels as well, such as a town level common to the Moria family where the player can buy and sell equipment. Generated layouts typically incorporate rooms connected by corridors, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> preset to some degree (e.g., monster lairs or treasuries). Open areas or natural features, such as rivers, may occur, though these are considered against the Berlin Interpretation. While early roguelikes would have levels confined to the bounds of the terminal screen, other roguelikes enabled a much larger level size, only a portion shown to the player as they moved around it.|$|E

Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores {{are also a}} cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E

A row of sculptures lines {{the west side of the}} structure, including six monuments, a stela and an altar.

5|$|The Gila monster has one close living relative, the {{beaded lizard}} (H. horridum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, the evolutionary history <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> traced back to the Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana lived, and fragments of osteoderms from the Gila monster have been found in late Pleistocene (10,000–8,000 years ago) deposits near Las Vegas, Nevada. Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the Gila monster appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia and Australia, their wide geographical separation and the unique features not found in the varanids indicate the Gila monster is better placed in a separate family.|$|E

In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E
5|$|There are {{variations}} on the potbelly theme including complete potbelly sculptures, headless potbellies, some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> deliberately headless, and potbelly sculptures that consist of only a bodiless head that are recognised as belonging to the style {{even though they have}} no potbelly body. Some potbelly sculptures are wearing collars or clothing while others are apparently naked. There are examples with very prominent navels while other sculptures have no emphasis on the navel at all. Some examples of potbelly sculpture have chest ornaments and some sculptures are seated on pedestals. There are examples of potbelly sculptures corresponding to the general type that are not so fat as is the norm.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – some <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{on the ground}} for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E

5|$|Non-human animals may {{experience}} both spontaneous and traumatic pneumothorax. Spontaneous pneumothorax is, as in humans, classified as primary or secondary, while traumatic pneumothorax {{is divided into}} open and closed (with or without chest wall damage). The diagnosis may be apparent to the veterinary physician because the animal exhibits difficulty breathing in, or has shallow breathing. Pneumothoraces may arise from lung lesions (such as bullae) or from trauma to the chest wall. In horses, traumatic pneumothorax may involve both hemithoraces, as the mediastinum is incomplete {{and there is a}} direct connection between the two halves of the chest. Tension pneumothorax – the presence <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> suspected due to rapidly deteriorating heart function, absent lung sounds throughout the thorax, and a barrel-shaped chest – is treated with an incision in the animal's chest to relieve the pressure, followed by insertion of a chest tube.|$|E
