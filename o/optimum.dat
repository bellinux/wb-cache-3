Deterministic optimization strategies, such as the Newton–family algorithms, have been widely applied {{for the detection of}} global <b>optimums.</b> However, in the case of discontinuous /non-differentiable /non-convex complex functions, this approach is not valid. In such cases, stochastic optimization strategies simulating evolution process have proved to be a valuable tool. In this paper, a novel evolutionary algorithm based on Number Theoretic Net for detecting global <b>optimums</b> of Complex functions is introduced. It can be applied to any functions with multiple local <b>optimums.</b> With some established techniques, such as the ideas of genetic algorithms and sequential number theoretic optimization to improve the property of convergence in large scale, the deflection and stretching of objective function to guarantee the detection of a different minimizer, it detects <b>optimums</b> of a function through adding genetic operations to the feasible points generated by number theoretic net sequentially.

40|$|In machine learning, nonconvex {{optimization}} {{problems with}} multiple local <b>optimums</b> are often encountered. Graduated Optimization Algorithm (GOA) {{is a popular}} heuristic method to obtain global <b>optimums</b> of nonconvex problems through progressively minimizing a series of convex approximations to the nonconvex problems more and more accurate. Recently, such an algorithm GradOpt based on GOA is proposed with amazing theoretical and experimental results, but it mainly studies the problem which consists of one nonconvex part. This paper aims to find the global solution of a nonconvex objective with a convex part plus a nonconvex part based on GOA. By graduating approximating non-convex {{part of the problem}} and minimizing them with the Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) or proximal SVRG, two new algorithms, SVRG-GOA and PSVRG-GOA, are proposed. We prove that the new algorithms have lower iteration complexity (O(1 /ε)) than GradOpt (O(1 /ε^ 2)). Some tricks, such as enlarging shrink factor, using project step, stochastic gradient, and mini-batch skills, are also given to accelerate the convergence speed of the proposed algorithms. Experimental results illustrate that the new algorithms with the similar performance can converge to 'global' <b>optimums</b> of the nonconvex problems, and they converge faster than the GradOpt and the nonconvex proximal SVRG.

50|$|The glowworm swarm {{optimization}} (GSO) {{algorithm is}} an optimization technique developed for simultaneous capture of multiple <b>optimums</b> of multi-modal functions. The algorithm utilizes agents called glowworms which use a luminescent quantity called Luciferin to (indirectly) communicate the function-profile information at their current location to their neighbors. The glowworm {{depends on a}} variable local-decision domain, which is bounded above by a circular sensor range, to identify its neighbors and compute its movements. Each glowworm selects a neighbor that has a Luciferin value more than its own, using a probabilistic mechanism, and moves towards it. These movements that are based only on local information enable the swarm of glowworms to split into disjoint subgroups, exhibit simultaneous taxis-behavior towards, and rendezvous at multiple <b>optimums</b> (not necessarily equal) of a given multi-modal function. The algorithm was tested on a custom designed system of robots called Kinbots.|$|R

Based on the archive of solutions, an iterative control operation is designed in the algorithm to guide the evolutionary process towards a promising space and avoid unnecessary and worthless search processes. Finally, numerical experiments based {{on a set of}} eight well-known constrained optimization problems are carried out to investigate the performance of the proposed method, and the experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithm is robust, effective and efficient in solving constrained global optimization problems...|$|R
