The study took into account the manufacturer's suggested retail price, taxes, credits, destination charge, electric charging station, fuel cost, maintenance cost, and additional cost due to the use of a gasoline vehicle for trips beyond the range of the Leaf.|$|E

The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure for himself and the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|By 1893 {{there were}} more than 75 collieries within the Rhondda Valleys and {{although}} most were initially owned by a small group of private individuals this trend changed towards the start of the 20th century as companies began buying up the existing collieries. The widespread adoption of limited liability status began a trend towards a concentration <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> reducing some of the economic risks involved in coalmining: unstable coal prices, inflated acquisitions, geological difficulties, and large scale accidents. The emerging companies were formed by the individuals and families who sank the original collieries; but by the start of the 20th century, they were no more than principal shareholders. These companies included the Davies's Ocean Coal Company, Archibald Hood's Glamorgan Coal Company and David Davis & Son.|$|E
5|$|Ifs {{new owner}} was Robert Guinn, of Galaxy Publishing. The change <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> was abrupt {{and led to}} a delay in publication, with the first issue under new editorship not {{appearing}} until July 1959. The editor was Horace Gold, who was also the editor of Galaxy Science Fiction; Galaxy had gone from a monthly to a bimonthly schedule at the start of 1959, and If and Galaxy appeared in alternate months for the next few years. In a 1975 retrospective article, Gold commented that his policy with If was to experiment, using new writers who had not yet established themselves. In the judgement of science-fiction historian Mike Ashley, the effect was that If became the weaker of the two magazines, printing stories that were of lower quality than those Gold selected for Galaxy.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} a neglected aspect of financial systems of many {{countries around the}} world: government <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> banks. We assemble data which establish four findings. First, government <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> banks is large and pervasive around the world. Second, such ownership is particularly significant in countries {{with low levels of}} per capita income, underdeveloped financial systems, interventionist and inefficient governments, and poor protection of property rights. Third, government <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> banks is associated with slower subsequent financial development. Finally, government <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> banks is associated with lower subsequent growth of per capita income, and in particular with lower growth of productivity rather than slower factor accumulation. This evidence is inconsistent with the optimistic development' theories <b>of</b> government <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> banks common in the 1960 s, but supports the more recent political' theories of the effects <b>of</b> government <b>ownership</b> <b>of</b> firms. ...|$|R
