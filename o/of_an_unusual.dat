5|$|Its {{orbital period}} of 20.16155 days is about 5.0% from a 1:3 mean-motion {{resonance}} with the Charon–Pluto orbital period of 6.387 days. With the other moons Nix, Kerberos and Hydra, it forms part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> 1:3:4:5:6 (period ratio) sequence of near resonances. In contrast to its orbit, Styx's rotation is very chaotic; {{like the other}} small Plutonian moons, Styx's rotation is not tidally locked, and it varies rapidly over short timescales (with {{a rate of about}} 3.239 days {{at the time of the}} New Horizons flyby).|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus forms part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> {{and highly}} {{regarded}} dish in North America, {{being one of}} several species parasitized by the lobster mushroom Hypomyces lactifluorum. Once colonized by the parasite, an orange-red crust forms {{over the surface of}} the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the parasite infiltrates its host's tissues. It is also a common source of food among red squirrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge over}} Swinefleet Warping Drain {{was the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> request from Colonel Thompson in 1906, who asked {{permission}} for 16 of his female potato pickers to cross it to reach their place of work. To access it, {{they would need to}} walk through the goods yard and along the main line, but it would save them having to walk much further each day. The request was granted, provided that the Colonel indemnified the railway against any claims made if the ladies were involved in an accident.|$|E

5|$|Clifford's Tower is <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> design. The two-storey tower has a quatrefoil {{plan with}} four {{circular}} lobes. Each lobe measures 22 feet (6.5 metres) across, with walls 9 feet 6inches (3 metres) thick; at its widest, the tower is 79 feet (24 metres) across. A square gatehouse, 21 feet (6.5 metres) wide, protected the entrance {{on the south}} side between two of the lobes. There are defensive turrets between the other lobes. Large corbels and a central pier supported the huge weight of stone and the first floor. Loopholes of a design unique to York Castle provided firing points. A chapel was built over the entrance, measuring 15 feet by 14 feet (4.5 metres by 4.2 metres), doubling as a portcullis chamber as at Harlech and Chepstow Castles. The tower is believed to be an experiment in improving flanking fire by making more ground visible from the summit of the keep. Although unique to England, the design of the tower closely resembles that at Étampes in France, and may have influenced the design of the future keep of Pontefract Castle. Henry employed master mason Henry de Rayns and chief carpenter Simon of Northampton for the project, and the cost of the tower accounted {{for the majority of the}} overall expenditure on the castle during this period of work.|$|E

The goatfish school alongside the snapper, with this behavior attributed to predatory protection. The goatfish are presumably a more preferred prey than bluestripe snapper.|$|E

Based on these associations, he tentatively concluded that the animal was aquatic.|$|E

Thus, while the first reports <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> outbreak were in Chinese, an English report was not generated until January 21, 2003.|$|E
25|$|During {{the regular}} season on July 8, 2000, the Yankees {{defeated}} the Mets by identical 4-2 scores in both ends <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> day-night doubleheader. With the first game played at Shea Stadium and the nightcap at Yankee Stadium, {{it was the first}} time since 1903 that two teams played two games in different stadiums on the same day. Dwight Gooden won the first game with a six inning effort in his first start since returning to the Yankees. Roger Clemens won the nightcap. However, in the second game of that double header, an event occurred that made the rivalry between the two teams more contentious. Clemens hit Mets' star Mike Piazza in the helmet with an inside fastball, causing Piazza to suffer a concussion and placing him on the disabled list.|$|E
25|$|Before the First World War Leeds was {{the home}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> modernist arts organisation, called the Leeds Arts Club, founded by Alfred Orage, which lasted from 1903 to 1923. Notable members {{included}} Jacob Kramer, Herbert Read, Frank Rutter and Michael Sadler. As well as advocating a radical political agenda, supporting the Suffragettes, the Independent Labour Party and the Fabian Society, and promoting the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, the Leeds Arts Club was almost unique in Britain as being an exponent of German Expressionist ideas about art and culture. As a result, it staged very early British exhibitions of work by European expressionist artists, such as Wassily Kandinsky, showing their work in the city as early as 1913, and produced its own English Expressionist artists, including Jacob Kramer and Bruce Turner.|$|E

25|$|Southern California was in {{the midst}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> drought; in Los Angeles, California, with only 3.21in(82mm) of {{precipitation}} in 2006–2007, it was the driest year on record. The combination of wind, heat, and dryness turned the chaparral into fire fuel. Officials believed that some of the fires generated their own winds, similar to the Oakland Firestorm of 1991. The effects of the smoke were felt as far away as Brentwood, California (in the East Bay, near Stockton), where it impacted local weather. The high-speed Santa Ana winds also rendered the use of dropping water from fire fighting aircraft inefficient; until such winds abate, most payloads of water are just dispersed by the wind over an area so large that the water evaporates before it can reach a large fire on the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{foregoing}} examples {{present the}} Salticidae as textbook examples of active hunters; they would hardly {{seem likely to}} build webs other than those used in reproductive activities, and in fact, most species really do not build webs to catch prey. However, exceptions occur, though even those that do build capture webs generally also go hunting like other salticids. Some Portia species, for example, spin capture webs that are functional, though not as impressive as some orb webs of the Araneidae; Portia webs are <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> funnel shape and apparently adapted to the capture of other spiders. Spartaeus species, on the other hand, largely capture moths in their webs. In their review of the ethology of Salticidae, Richman and Jackson speculate on whether such web building is {{a relic of the}} evolution of this family from web-building ancestors.|$|E
25|$|In search <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>unusual</b> {{gift for}} her father, Maggie chances to wander into Jarvis' shop, and he shows her the bowl {{he had set}} aside for Charlotte years ago. Maggie agrees to buy it and asks that it be {{delivered}} to her home. When Jarvis discovers the barely discernible crack Amerigo had noticed, he brings it to Maggie himself, reveals the defect, and offers it at half price. While waiting {{for her in the}} drawing room, he recognizes Amerigo and Charlotte in photographs on a table, and he innocently reveals they were the couple who originally considered purchasing the bowl, three days before the wedding. Maggie realizes that the two were not meeting for the first time, as she had always assumed. She confronts Amerigo, who confesses to his past with Charlotte and to their affair.|$|E
