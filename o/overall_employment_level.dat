40|$|Against the {{background}} of the existing theoretical and empirical evidence of skill-biased technological and organisational change, this paper investigates the effects of organisational change on labour demand between 1996 and 2004 using linked-employer-employee-data (LIAB) from the German Institute for Employment Research. By estimating dynamic labour demand functions for western and eastern Germany, we are able to show that the introduction of new work and/or production patterns has a positive effect on the <b>overall</b> <b>employment</b> <b>level.</b> In addition, we find significant shifts in labour demand at the expense of unskilled workers due to organisational change, while organisational change increases the demand for skilled workers.

40|$|The Bureau of Labor Statistic’s Job Opening and Labor Turnover survey (JOLTS) {{attempts}} to measure US labor market dynamics {{on a monthly}} basis. The JOLTS survey estimates both the flow of employment into business establishments (hires) and the flow of employment out of business establishments (separations). In theory, {{it is assumed that}} the levels of these two types of flow should relate directly and proportionately to the trend in the <b>overall</b> <b>employment</b> <b>level.</b> A number of factors prevent the employment trend and the net flow of hires and separations from equilibrating on a monthly basis. However, it is expected in theory that over time this equilibration should eventually occur. We will present evidence that even over time, for reported JOLTS data, the net flow of hires minus separations greatly exceeds reported employment trend and that this disequilibrium {{is the result of a}} significant deficiency in reported separations or excess of reported hires. Finally, we will present the corrective action adopted by JOLTS to account for the divergence between Current Employment Survey (CES) employment and JOLTS hires minus separations...|$|E
30|$|There is {{also some}} {{previous}} empirical {{evidence for the}} case of Indonesia. Using a repeated cross-sectional labor force survey (Sakernas) pooled at the provincial level, Rama (2001) finds that doubling the minimum wage in the early 1990 s led {{to an increase in}} formal average wages of 5 to 15 % and a decrease in urban wage employment of 0 to 5 %. Extending Rama’s study, Islam & Nazara (2000) also find negative effects on formal employment, and Suryahadi et al. (2003) report negative impacts on overall urban formal employment; yet these effects are positive for white collar workers. Del Carpio et al. (2012) argue that using provincial data might lead to an endogeneity bias since the local governments participating in the minimum wage setting process take the labor market conditions in their provinces into consideration. Hence, they use a firm-level dataset Survei Industri (SI) to analyze the formal manufacturing sector and report negative employment effects for small but not for large firms with a negative overall impact. Firm-level data was also used by Harrison & Scorse (2010), who find that more than doubling the minimum wages had increased wages for unskilled production workers but decreased employment of them. Alatas & Cameron (2008) apply a difference-in-difference approach adapted from Card & Krueger (1994) and match similar firms from Botabek and Jakarta. Like Del Carpio et al., they report statistically significant and negative effects only for small firms that, however, become insignificant when reducing the control group to firms situated on the border of the two regions. While most studies on Indonesia focus on formal sector employment, {{there are only a few}} that consider informality as well. Comola & de Mello (2011), using Sakernas data and data from the National Socio-Economic Survey (Susenas) on district level, find that an increase in informal employment more than compensates for job losses in the formal sector. Similar employment effects are found by The World Bank (2010), where the authors use Sakernas as well and report a shift from the formal to the informal sector, although minimum wages do not appear to change the <b>overall</b> <b>employment</b> <b>level.</b> Magruder (2013) opposes these results by observing that an increase in minimum wages in one district relative to its adjacent districts leads to more employment in the formal sector and to a decrease in informality. Finally, Chun & Khor (2010) use the IFLS and apply an estimation strategy developed by Neumark et al. (2004) which includes dummies in order to indicate an individual’s wage distribution position. While they find positive wage and negative employment effects for individuals at the lower end of the wage distribution in the formal sector, they do not observe such effects in the informal sector.|$|E

5000|$|All {{participants}} in the technological employment debates agree that temporary job losses can result from technological innovation. Similarly, there is no dispute that innovation sometimes has positive effects on workers. Disagreement focuses on whether {{it is possible for}} innovation to have a lasting negative impact on <b>overall</b> <b>employment.</b> <b>Levels</b> of persistent unemployment can be quantified empirically, but the causes are subject to debate. Optimists accept short term unemployment may be caused by innovation, yet claim that after a while, compensation effects will always create at least as many jobs as were originally destroyed. While this optimistic view has been continually challenged, it was dominant among mainstream economists for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, labor economists Jacob Mincer and Stephan Danninger develop an empirical study using micro-data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and find that although in the short run, technological progress seems to have unclear effects on aggregate unemployment, it reduces unemployment in the long run. When they include a 5-year lag, however, the evidence supporting a short-run employment effect of technology seems to disappear as well, suggesting that technological unemployment [...] "appears to be a myth".|$|R
30|$|Our {{findings}} using cross-sectional {{and time}} series data helped to {{explain some of}} the seemingly contradictory results in the previous literature. The empirical results also allowed us to rationalize some of the adjustments observed in countries following trade liberalization episodes. Moreover, we validated empirically the intuition that the tax evasion-formality channel is a relevant firm adjustment mechanism that allows some smoothing of the effect of the reforms. This additional adjustment mechanism operates in the sectors exposed to the trade reform, but also in the non-exposed sectors, and it constitutes a transmission mechanism for general equilibrium effects in developing countries beyond those documented for developed countries (e.g., Acemoglu et al. 2016). This {{may be one of the}} reasons why governments in developing countries seem reluctant to increase their enforcement efforts, at least during episodes of reform. While workers suffer in the form of lower quality jobs, this additional margin helps to maintain <b>overall</b> <b>employment</b> <b>levels,</b> and this is the trade-off faced by economic policy makers. However, by distinguishing between the within-industry adjustment and the general equilibrium effects, our results also indicated that there is an additional dimension for this trade-off. In Argentina’s specific case, in general equilibrium labor informality fell in the tradable sector as a consequence of trade liberalization, but it increased in the non-tradable sector.|$|R

40|$|Employers are {{reporting}} shortages of skilled labour, yet unskilled workers are sitting idle on welfare. Many commentators think both {{problems can be}} solved by more education and training, but this paper disputes this. The solution to the skills shortage lies in policies like delayed retirement and increased female participation in the workforce. The solution to unskilled joblessness lies in generating more unskilled employment. Many welfare recipients are unskilled. Demand for their services has fallen over {{the last forty years}} because of technological change and globalisation. Fewer than 60 % of unskilled men aged twenty-five to fifty-nine are now in full-time employment. There are only two possible ways to get unskilled welfare recipients into jobs. One is to offer them education and training in the hope they will gain the skills employers want; the other is to reduce the cost of employing unskilled labour so they can find jobs. The training option is widely supported by commentators, but while it helps mature age women return to the labour force, it achieves much less for other groups and has little impact on <b>overall</b> <b>employment</b> <b>levels.</b> There is also widespread support for increasing the number of students remaining in school to year 12, but we are now encountering diminishing marginal returns as more students are pushed through courses for which they are not suited. Education and training improves the earnings and job prospects of higher ability people but does not lead to comparable outcomes for those of lower ability. Commentators have confused average benefits with marginal benefits. Persistent calls for more education and training ignore the distribution of intelligence in the population. The employment prospects of those in the bottom quartile of the IQ distribution will not be helped by more spending on education and vocational training courses from which they are unlikely to benefit. The best way to help them is to increase the demand for unskilled labour and to equip them with the social skills needed to perform these jobs successfully...|$|R
40|$|Levels of interregional {{migration}} in Germany are relatively low in international comparison and {{may contribute to}} lower <b>overall</b> <b>employment</b> <b>levels,</b> lower economic growth and persistent regional <b>employment</b> disparities. Increasing <b>levels</b> of geographic mobility may thus be a means of realising potential welfare gains and reducing regional employment disparities. Against this background, the willingness and ability of unemployed individuals to seek employment elsewhere is of central concern if geographic mobility is to contribute to higher <b>overall</b> <b>employment</b> <b>levels</b> and to an accelerated regional convergence. The effectiveness of migration {{as a means of}} realising these desirable goals, however, depends on the heterogeneous disincentive and incentives that shape individual mobility decisions. The major objective of this empirically and microeconometrically oriented dissertation thus is to shed light on the determinants of individual mobility decisions for heterogeneous groups of unemployed. In particular, the thesis examines whether different groups of unemployed jobseekers adjust their search strategies to local labour market conditions. Such responsiveness to local labour market conditions is desirable if migration is to contribute to a reduction of regional employment disparities. Empirical results indicate that only skilled and well-earning individuals respond to unfavourable local labour demand conditions by higher levels of migration. As a next step, the thesis thus examines to what extent institutional factors such as active and passive labour market policies are responsible for the immobility of certain labour market segments. While the empirical results point towards a limited mobility-reducing impact of the local supply of active labour market programs, several results throughout the theses indicate that the unemployment compensation, especially prolonged entitlements to unemployment benefits as well as higher income replacement rates, noticeably reduce mobility levels. Since low-skilled unemployed tend to have very high income replacement ratios, the relatively generous unemployment compensation system in Germany could be one explanation for the low mobility level and weak responsiveness to regional labour market conditions among low-skilled unemployed. This thesis thus reveals institutional barriers to mobility, especially for low-skilled unemployed, and hence identifies some scope for increasing geographic mobility and realising some of the aforementioned welfare gains. In addition to the potential welfare gains from raising interregional mobility in Germany, there are also a number of possible downsides. Besides a potential loss of social capital due to the interruption of social networks that are important for the informal organization of child care and the care for the elderly, costs to the society may arise from the necessity to adjust the public infrastructure in net in-migration and net out-migration regions to the changing level and composition of the local population. In addition, the negative selection of those remaining in depressed regions in terms of age and qualification may undermine the future growth potential of these regions, thus triggering a self-reinforcing decline. Higher levels of interregional mobility may thus have a divergent rather than a convergent impact on the regional system. Policies to realise the potential welfare gains from higher levels of interregional mobility should thus be complemented by compensating social and economic policies that aim at mitigating its possible negative consequences. As a contribution to such a comprehensive policy approach, a second objective of this thesis is to provide insights on how to cushion one particular downside of a higher level of geographic mobility, namely its potentially divergent effect on the regional system. This is of high relevance given the net migration of skilled individuals from eastern to western Germany which may reinforce the existing regional employment and wage disparities between both parts of Germany. The thesis thus aims at identifying the scope for counteracting the brain drain in eastern Germany by empirically examining the factors that determine the skill composition of migration flows in Germany. For this purpose, the study looks at destination choices of heterogeneous skill groups. The findings indicate that spatial job matching patterns by high-skilled individuals are mainly driven by interregional income differentials, while interregional job matches by less-skilled individuals are mainly affected by interregional differentials in job-finding opportunities. Economic policy could thus contribute to reducing the brain drain from eastern Germany without raising east-west migration among less-skilled by creating the conditions for an increasing skill premium and stable unemployment levels for less-skilled workers. Besides measures for raising eastern productivity levels, regionally tailored wage agreements which allow for regionally higher levels of wage dispersion, may thus be a promising policy direction. This dissertation thus contributes to designing a comprehensive policy approach that, one the one hand, aims at reducing institutional disincentives in order to raise geographic mobility and realise its potential welfare gains and that, at the same time, tries to cushion the possible downsides of a higher level of interregional mobility...|$|R
40|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} has {{played an important}} role in the development of the Scottish economy in the post war period. Accounting for over 90, 000 jobs in Scottish manufacturing industry or around 16 % of manufacturing employment, Scotland is marginally more dependent on investment from overseas than the UK as a whole (at around 15 %). An important dimension of foreign {{direct investment}} in Scotland over the past ten years has been a substantial decline in employment in some of the long established plants of major corporations, especially those with mechanical or mechanical engineering orientations. While the explanations of this trend are complex the net effect has been a growing recognition that in order to "guarantee stability of employment (in the foreign sector overall) there would have to be continued pressure to add significantly to the 'feed-stock' of new entrants to offset the employment decline in the integrating and rationalising corporations". The problems in even attempting to maintain the existing <b>overall</b> <b>employment</b> <b>levels</b> in the foreign owned sector are substantial, given the recession conditions, reduced levels of foreign direct investment from the US, the dramatic increase in competition for mobile projects and so on. It is perhaps not surprising, given this environment, that the past year has seen a growing interest in improving the effectiveness of Scottish efforts to attract additional, and develop existing, foreign corporations. Such an evaluation of Scottish practice is long overdue. Nor has this solely been of concern in Scotland since the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs has also been collecting evidence on the same issue in the recent past. The purpose of this paper is to make a critical appraisal of policy towards inward direct investment in Scotland. Having identified the crucial issues, the policy directions are considered in the light both of the findings of the Committee on Scottish Affairs (August 1980) and of the Government response (March 1981). Thereafter a proposed programme of action is examined for both the newly-established 'Locate in Scotland' (LIS) unit and for the UK as a whole over the next few years...|$|R

After documenting the average trends across countries in the labor-market outcomes up to ten years on either side of each country’s structural reform year, we run fixed-effects ordinary least squares as well as instrumental variables regressions to account for the likely endogeneity of structural reforms to labor-market outcomes. Overall the results suggest that structural reforms lead to positive outcomes for labor.

40|$|Over recent years, in {{the context}} of the global {{financial}} crisis and economic recession, the demand for and supply of labour have changed. The labour market has moved from being described as 'tight' to being described as 'loose'. A tight labour market is a seller's or jobseeker's market, where organizations find it more difficult to source employees due to high <b>overall</b> national <b>employment</b> <b>levels.</b> On the other hand, a loose labour market is a buyer's or employer's market, where organizations have a large pool of potential and available employees to hire for positions, since jobs are scarce, with jobseekers competing with many others for the same position. A loose labour market, with high unemployment rates, has significant effects on the recruitment of staff, which include: • a significant number of people applying for each vacant position • wages can be reduced • many of the people applying for scarce vacant positions are overqualified. With this context in mind, in this chapter we look at human resource planning (HRP) in organizations and how an organization's human resource plans link in with its overall business strategy and corresponding recruitment strategy. First, we look at the key concepts of the chapter, namely HRP, recruitment and labour flexibility. Next, you will learn more about the different stages in the HRP process. Then we focus on the recruitment aspect. We go on to look at flexible work practices and the different types of labour/workforce flexibility.
