40|$|Objectives: The {{lung cancer}} {{mortality}} in Korea has increased remarkably {{during the last}} 20 years, and has been the first leading cause of cancer-related deaths since 2000. The aim {{of the current study}} was to examine the time trends of <b>occupational</b> lung <b>cancer</b> and carcinogens exposure during the period 2006 - 2009 in South Korea, by assessing the proportion of occupational burden. Methods: We defined <b>occupational</b> lung <b>cancer</b> for surveillance, and developed a reporting protocol and reporting website for the surveillance of <b>occupational</b> lung <b>cancer.</b> The study patients were chosen from 9 participating university hospitals in the following 7 areas: Seoul, Incheon, Wonju, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, and Gwangju. Results: The combined proportion of definite and probable <b>occupational</b> lung <b>cancer</b> among all lung cancers investigated in this study was 10. 0 %, 8. 6 %, 10. 7 %, and 15. 8 % in the years 2006 to 2009, respectively, with an average of 11. 7 % over the four-year study period. The main carcinogens were asbestos, crystalline silica, radon, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), diesel exhaust particles, chromium, and nickel. Conclusion: We estimated that about 11. 7 % of the incident lung cancer was preventable. This reveals the potential to considerably reduce lung cancer by intervention in occupational fields...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{epidemiological}} profile, risk {{factors in the}} workplace environment and prevention methods for professionals at risk of skin cancer. Method: A systematic review of articles on <b>occupational</b> skin <b>cancer,</b> published in the Lilacs, Scielo, Medline and Cochrane Library from January 1 st, 2008, to December 31 st, 2013, was performed. The search included the following terms: &# 8220;neoplasias cutâneas&# 8221; (DeCS), &# 8220;exposição ocupacional&# 8221; (DeCS), &# 8220;epidemiologia&# 8221; (DeCS) {{as well as the}} keyword &# 8220;prevenção&# 8221;, and their equivalents in English. Results: After analyzing the titles and summaries of articles, the search strategy resulted in 83 references, of which 22 articles met the eligibility criteria. Discussion: We found that sun exposure is the main occupational risk factor for skin cancer, causing outdoor workers to be the most vulnerable to developing <b>occupational</b> skin <b>cancer.</b> Professionals with low levels of education and European descent are at increased risk of developing this cancer. Conclusion: Outdoor workers are more vulnerable to developing <b>occupational</b> skin <b>cancer,</b> estimating that professionals with low level of education and European descent are at increased risk of developing this cancer.

40|$|Objectives: Determining the work-relatedness of lung <b>cancer</b> {{developed}} through <b>occupational</b> exposures is very difficult. Aims {{of the present}} study are to develop a decision tree of <b>occupational</b> lung <b>cancer</b> Methods: 153 cases of lung cancer surveyed by the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute (OSHRI) from 1992 - 2007 were included. The target variable was whether the case was approved as work-related lung cancer, and independent variables were age, sex, pack-years of smoking, histological type, type of industry, latency, working period and exposure material in the workplace. The Classification and Regression Test (CART) model was used in searching for predictors of <b>occupational</b> lung <b>cancer.</b> Results: In the CART model, the best predictor was exposure to known lung carcinogens. The second best predictor was 8. 6 years or higher latency and the third best predictor was smoking history of less than 11. 25 pack-years. The CART model must be used sparingly in deciding the work-relatedness of lung cancer because it is not absolute.

50|$|The {{neighborhoods and}} areas people live in, {{as well as}} their occupation, make up the {{environment}} in which they exist. People living in poverty stricken neighborhoods are at a greater risk for heart disease, possibly because the supermarkets in their area do not sell healthy foods and there is increased availability of stores selling alcohol and tobacco than in more affluent parts of town. People living in rural areas are also more susceptible to heart disease, as well. An agriculturally based diet rich in fat and cholesterol, combined with an isolated environment in which there is limited access to health care and ways to distribute information probably creates a pattern in which people living in rural environments have higher levels of heart disease. <b>Occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> is one way in which the environment one works in can increase their rate of disease. Employees exposed to smoke, asbestos, diesel fumes, paint, and chemicals in factories can develop cancer from their workplace. All of these jobs tend to be low-paying and typically held by low income individuals. The decreased amount of healthy food in stores located in low-income areas also contributes to the increased rates of diabetes for persons living in those neighborhoods.|$|E
40|$|This {{monograph}} {{summarizes the}} current research on the epidemiology and prevention of <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> in Europe. Eleven peer-reviewed articles offer a composite view of the current status and future perspectives of this discipline {{at a time of}} major economic and political changes in Europe. The monograph includes a brief history of <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> research in Europe and the current burden of cancer from occupational exposure. A large portion of the monograph is devoted to reviews of <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> in various European countries or groups of countries. The first two reviews describe those regions with the strongest tradition of research in the field: the Nordic countries and the United Kingdom. These countries are characterized by high-quality cancer registries and routinely collected information on occupation, e. g., on the occasion of censuses, allowing record linkage studies. Four articles address the situation in the remaining large Western European countries [...] France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. Although these countries have a strong tradition in occupational health research, {{with the possible exception of}} Spain, their epidemiologic research dates back only to the 1970 s and 1980 s; in recent years, however, research on <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> has expanded considerably. The last two articles of the geographic overview describe the <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> research in the Central European countries and the European territories of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The authors of these two articles critically review the available data on <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> from former Socialist countries and provide reliable information on the extent and amount of occupational exposure to carcinogens. The two final articles of the monograph address specific thematic issues: the importance of asbestos as an occupational carcinogen in Europe and the use of routinely collected data to investigate <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> in women, based on the experience in England and Wales. Despite the heterogeneity of these articles, which reflects to a large extent the differences in quality and completeness of the available data on <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer,</b> they represent an original attempt to provide a systematic overview of <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> research in Europe. This publication is originally a partial result of two projects on <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> in Europe funded by the European Commission, Directorate General XII (grants BMH 1 -CT 92 - 1110 and BMH 1 -CT 95 - 1100) and has been expanded to include non-European Union countries...|$|E
40|$|Although only a {{relatively}} small proportion of cancer is attributable to occupational exposure to carcinogenic agents, the estimated number of deaths due to <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> is high {{when compared to other}} deaths due to work-related ill health and injury. However, risk from occupational exposure to carcinogens can be minimised through proportionate but effective risk management. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) is the regulator of workplace health and safety in Great Britain. As part of its aim to reduce ill health arising from failures to control properly exposure to hazards at work, HSE commissioned the research presented elsewhere in this supplement to enable it to identify priorities for preventing <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer.</b> The research has shown that <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> remains a key health issue and that low-level exposure {{of a large number of}} workers to carcinogens is important. The finding that a small number of carcinogens have been responsible for the majority of the burden of <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> provides key evidence in the development of priorities for significant reduction of <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer.</b> Although the research presented in this supplement reflects the consequences of past exposures to carcinogens, <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> remains a problem. The potential for exposure to the agents considered in this research is still present in the workplace and the findings are relevant to prevention of future disease. In this article, the principle approaches for risk reduction are described. It provides supporting information on some of the initiatives already being undertaken, or those being put in place, to reduce <b>occupational</b> <b>cancer</b> in Great Britain. The need also for systematic collection of exposure information and the importance of raising awareness and changing behaviours are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to review {{occupational}} reproductive abnormalities and <b>occupational</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> in Korea and to discuss their toxicological implications. Reproductive dysfunction as a result of 2 -bromopropane poisoning was first reported in Korean workers. In 1995, 23 of the 33 workers (25 female and 8 male workers) who were exposed to 2 -bromopropane during the assembly of tactile switch parts developed reproductive and/or hematopoietic disorders. A total of 17 (68 %) workers were diagnosed with ovarian failure. Two of the eight male workers experienced azoospermia and four workers experienced some degree of oligospermia or reduced sperm motility. In summary, 2 -bromopropane poisoning caused severe reproductive effects in Korean workers. The prognosis was poor for reproductive dysfunction. A few cases of <b>occupational</b> bladder <b>cancer</b> have been reported in Korea, whereas other cancers of the urinary tract have not been reported after occupational exposure.
