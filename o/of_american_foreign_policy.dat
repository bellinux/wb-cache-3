5|$|In a {{prepared}} speech in January 2010, Clinton drew analogies between the Iron Curtain {{and the free}} and unfree Internet. Chinese officials reacted negatively towards it and the speech garnered attention as {{the first time a}} senior American official had clearly defined the Internet as a key element <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> In July 2010, she visited Korea, Vietnam, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all the while preparing for the July 31 wedding of daughter Chelsea amid much media attention.|$|E
5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> A huge image of the President was hung {{in the middle of the}} capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and American flags while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform his job in Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E

25|$|According to {{international}} relations scholar Michael Foley, paleoconservatives press for restrictions on immigration, a rollback of multicultural programmes, the decentralization {{of the federal}} policy, the restoration of controls upon free trade, a greater emphasis upon economic nationalism and non-interventionism in the conduct <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> and a generally revanchist outlook upon a social order in need of recovering old lines of distinction {{and in particular the}} assignment of roles in accordance with traditional categories of gender, ethnicity, and race.

25|$|On {{other aspects}} <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> Lantos {{spoke out against}} waste, fraud and abuse in the multibillion-dollar U.S. {{reconstruction}} program in Iraq, and warned that the U.S. could lose Afghanistan to the Taliban if the Bush administration failed to take decisive action to halt the current decline in political stability there. Lantos was against U.S. military aid to Egypt as the Egyptian military had failed {{to stop the flow}} of money and weapons across the Egyptian border to Hamas in Gaza, and Egypt had not contributed troops to the peacekeeping efforts in Afghanistan and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of speeches in late 2001 and 2002, Bush {{expanded}} on his view <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and global intervention, declaring that the United States should actively support democratic governments around the world, especially in the Middle East, as a strategy for combating the threat of terrorism, and that the United States {{had the right to}} act unilaterally in its own security interests, without the approval of international bodies such as the United Nations. This represented a departure from the Cold War policies of deterrence and containment under the Truman Doctrine and post–Cold War philosophies such as the Powell Doctrine and the Clinton Doctrine.|$|E

25|$|The Union's {{main focus}} {{in foreign affairs}} was just the opposite: to prevent any British {{recognition}} of the Confederacy. Notwithstanding a relatively minor border incident in the Pacific Northwest, Anglo-American relations had steadily improved throughout the 1850s. The issues of the Oregon territory, British involvement in Texas, and the Canada–US border dispute had all been resolved in the 1840s. Secretary of State William H. Seward, the primary architect <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> during the war, intended to maintain the policy principles that had served the country well since the American Revolution: non-intervention by the United States {{in the affairs of}} other countries and resistance to foreign intervention in the affairs of the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|A staunch anti-communist, Woll {{eventually}} became a confidant of AFL president Samuel Gompers and other like-minded labor leaders such as William Green of the United Mine Workers of America. Green in particular relied heavily on Woll for advice and policy guidance during his term {{as president of the}} AFL. Woll also became a mentor to Jay Lovestone, the one-time Communist who was expelled from the party only to become a rabid Red-baiter and AFL-CIO foreign policy advisor. In 1944, the AFL-CIO established the Free Trade Union Committee (FTUC) to assist free trade unions abroad, particularly in Europe. Lovestone was named its secretary, reporting (in part) to Woll. Lovestone's mission was to eliminate pro-Communist unions and supplant them with unions which supported capitalism. The Central Intelligence Agency funneled millions of dollars through FTUC in support <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> goals.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani's {{campaign}} hit {{a difficult}} stretch during November and December 2007, {{during which time}} Bernard Kerik, whom Giuliani had recommended for the position of Secretary of Homeland Security, was indicted on 16 counts of tax fraud and other federal charges; the media reported that while Mayor of New York, Giuliani had billed to obscure city agencies several {{tens of thousands of}} dollars of mayoral security expenses incurred while visiting Judith Nathan, with whom he was having an extramarital affair (later analysis showed the billing to likely be unrelated to hiding Nathan); and several stories were published in the press regarding clients of Giuliani Partners and Bracewell & Giuliani being in opposition to goals <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> Giuliani's national poll numbers began steadily slipping and his unusual strategy of focusing more on later, multi-primary big states rather than the smaller, first-voting states was seen at risk.|$|E

40|$|The Bush administration's <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> {{following}} {{the launch of}} the 'war on terror' has so fundamentally altered the traditional foundations for the transatlantic relationship that the latter's continued existence as a 'security community' may be at risk. Security communities need nurturing through a continuous process of socialisation from the leading state to other members in order to safeguard the essential 'glue' of the community: shared identity, values and trust. Such a process of patient socialisation and explanation <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> has been part of 'normal politics' since the establishment of the post-war liberal institutional order. The 'Bush Revolution', however, constitutes a re-definition of <b>foreign</b> <b>policy,</b> that may be seen either as a return to or a departure from 'normal politics'...|$|R
25|$|For {{the most}} part, Zaire enjoyed warm {{relations}} with the United States. The United States was the third largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), and Mobutu befriended several US presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. Relations did cool significantly in 1974–1975 over Mobutu's increasingly radical rhetoric (which included his scathing denunciations <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy),</b> and plummeted to an all-time low {{in the summer of}} 1975, when Mobutu accused the Central Intelligence Agency of plotting his overthrow and arrested eleven senior Zairian generals and several civilians, and condemned (in absentia) a former head of the Central Bank (Albert N'dele). However, many people viewed these charges with skepticism; in fact, one of Mobutu's staunchest critics, Nzongola-Ntalaja, speculated that Mobutu invented the plot as an excuse to purge the military of talented officers who might otherwise pose a threat to his rule. In spite of these hindrances, the chilly relationship quickly thawed when both countries found each other supporting the same side during the Angolan Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{war started}} badly for the US and UN. North Korean forces struck massively {{in the summer}} of 1950 and nearly drove the outnumbered US and ROK {{defenders}} into the sea. However the United Nations intervened, naming Douglas MacArthur commander of its forces, and UN-US-ROK forces held a perimeter around Pusan, gaining time for reinforcement. MacArthur, in a bold but risky move, ordered an amphibious invasion well behind the front lines at Inchon, cutting off and routing the North Koreans and quickly crossing the 38th Parallel into North Korea. As UN forces continued to advance toward the Yalu River on the border with Communist China, the Chinese crossed the Yalu River in October and launched a series of surprise attacks that sent the UN forces reeling back across the 38th Parallel. Truman originally wanted a Rollback strategy to unify Korea; after the Chinese successes he settled for a Containment policy to split the country. MacArthur argued for rollback but was fired by President Harry Truman after disputes over the conduct of the war. Peace negotiations dragged on for two years until President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened China with nuclear weapons; an armistice was quickly reached with the two Koreas remaining divided at the 38th parallel. North and South Korea are still today in a state of war, having never signed a peace treaty, and American forces remain stationed in South Korea as part <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b>|$|E
