The loveliness of these women was seen by the males of their time as a result of their brown complexion, their [...] "plump" [...] but not [...] "fat" [...] body and face, and mostly, their difference from women <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> such as the [...] "society women" [...] or the [...] "coquettes", namely their lack of artifices to enhance their beauty.

40|$|Omnivorousness—a concept {{referring}} to the appreciation {{of a wide variety}} of cultural genres—has been associated with cultural tolerance or cosmopolitanism of the upper social strata. Building on a large-scale survey in Belgium, we find that social mobility is related to combining musical genres from different brow-levels. Interestingly, boundary-crossing behavior is not only characteristic for higher social positions, but also manifests itself in lower social strata, as both upwardly as well as downwardly socially mobile individuals include practices characteristic for the social position of origin and destination in their cultural profile. The omnipresence of this ‘cultural dissonance’ questions the idea that tolerance or cosmopolitanism are exclusive characteristics <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> and that boundary-crossing per se functions as a status-marker...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the middle}} Ages, {{financial}} savings institutions developed, largely in response to the increasingly usurious money-lending practices of the Jews and to the adaptation of church authorities to the by then well developed commercial and financial operations. It was the Franciscan Order that took the initiative to develop such institutions, first in Italy and later in other western European Mediterranean towns. These were the so-called Monte di Pieta, which lent money at low rates of interest taking objects in pawn as security. However, as they had to operate with circulating capital and on the principles of savings banks, they may be considered to be the predecessors of modern banks. Although charity was declared in the very names of these institutions, this was no longer {{in the sense of the}} medieval mercy towards the virtuous poor, but more a support for impoverished members <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata,</b> as loan applicants had to place valuable movable property in pawn, meaning that they first had to possess such property. In spite of this, the institutions had the character of the primeval accumulation of capital, although not so much for individuals as for a community or, in the latter's name, for a commune, i. e. the local authority, which at least in the cases of Koper and Piran was also the founder. However, the stagnation of trade with the hinterland and the decline in the economic power of the Venetian Republic, particularly in the late 17 th and early 18 th centuries, pushed pawnshops into a more miserable existence, with ups and downs linked with the irregularities of profit-making on behalf of the institution, particularly by its clerks...|$|E

5000|$|When William the Conqueror led the Norman {{conquest of}} England in 1066, he, his nobles, {{and many of}} his {{followers}} from Normandy, but also those from northern and western France, spoke a range of langues d'oïl (northern varieties of Gallo-Romance). One of these was Old Norman, also known as [...] "Old Northern French". Other followers spoke varieties of the Picard language or western French. This amalgam developed into the unique insular dialect now known as Anglo-Norman French, which was commonly used for literary and eventually administrative purposes from the 12th until the 15th century.

2500|$|... 1614–15 – Drian-Ramaka spent 2 {{years of}} study at the newly renamed Jesuit Saint Paul's College, Goa (originally named the College of Santa Fe), the largest school in the Portuguese empire, {{established}} for what were then over 2,000 boys and young men {{of a wide variety}} of races and classes, though many, like Drian-Ramaka were <b>of</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> from the India subcontinent, the Indian Ocean and even several from East Africa, where, while they were trained to assist European clergy, had also been chosen as the Jesuits were hoping they'd also be significant leaders when they returned to their countries of origin. While he most likely at least began to learn to speak Portuguese as well as basic Catholicism on his 5-month voyage to Goa (via Mozambique), in Goa he was taught to read and write Portuguese by priests so he could enroll in the college. He was very intelligent, in a little less than two years learning how to read, write and sing in Portuguese, as well as ride a horse (an animal he'd never seen in Anosy). He was also taught the Latin Catechism and could even respond to basic questions in Latin. Eventually Drian-Ramaka was also baptized.|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} work The Female Nude in Paintings at the Beginning of the Modern Age in Over - Alps {{deals with}} the artistic canon portrayal of women from antiquity to the Baroque. I focus on paintings of mannerist painter Hans von Aachen, who with his works brings significant innovation against the established acts iconography. My intention is to refute the traditional perception of female act models as prostitutes and point out {{to the fact that}} in this genre, there are also paints <b>of</b> women from <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata.</b> The main emphasis is placed on the identification of the persons portrayed, the artist's family members, primarily for the wife of H. von Aachen, Regina di Lasso. Pictures of the acts are divided by themes into two sections. The first category includes genre paintings of private character. Mythologies and allegories intended for the Emperor Rudolf II. Hasburg are listed in the second part. The aim of this work is to explain the display of acts of married women - wives of artists - in the Mannerist art who with their presence in the paintings and their undisguised identity openly contrast with the ideal of Christian exemplary wife, as it was formulated by the contemporary moral literature...|$|R
40|$|Background : The total {{fertility}} rate (TFR) in Uruguay fell from 2. 5 to 1. 9 children per woman between 1996 and 2011. However, no study {{to date has}} examined {{the decline of the}} TFR by observing changes in fertility patterns by birth order. Objective : The main aim {{of this study is to}} analyze recent changes in fertility level and timing of childbearing by birth order in Uruguay. Methods : We estimate unconditional and conditional age- and birth-order-specific {{fertility rate}}s for 1996 - 2011 using data from vital statistics, population census, and national population estimates. Additionally, three period summary measures of birth-order-specific fertility quantum are calculated: TFR, PATFR and TFRp*. Timing changes by birth order are examined with MAB and TMAB, focusing on MAB 1 and its standard deviation and comparing their evolutions in Uruguay with those of selected countries. Results : Fertility decline fits a parity-specific stopping model with a moderate increase in the mean ages of first, second, and third births. The distribution of conditional fertility rates for first and second births depicts an asymmetric bimodal shape linked to the increasing heterogeneity of the timing of childbearing. Compared to countries with similar fertility trends, heterogeneity in the age at first birth in Uruguay is remarkably high. Conclusions : Previous studies suggest that heterogeneity in first and second birth timing is related to structural social inequalities, as women from lower <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> have not significantly changed the age at which they bear a first child, whereas women <b>of</b> middle to <b>high</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> have started to postpone it. The new evidence reinforces the idea that postponement transition in Uruguay cannot be studied without considering this consolidation of social status polarization in fertility timing...|$|R

50|$|Chronic {{illnesses}} are {{the major}} illnesses in developed countries today, and their major risk factors are health habits and lifestyle. The <b>higher</b> <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> knows the most and the lower <b>social</b> <b>strata</b> knows the least, whether class is assessed by education, occupation or income and even when the information seems to be most useful for the poorest.

So, {{the problem is not}} in the lack of access to health-care, but the patient's failure to use it effectively when delivered. Low literacy has been associated with low use of preventive care, poor comprehension of one's illness - even when care is free. Health self-management is important because literacy provides the ability to acquire new information and complete complex tasks and that limited problem solving abilities make low-literacy patients less likely to change their behaviour on the basis of new information. Chronic lack of good judgement and effective reasoning leads to chronically poor self-management.|$|R

40|$|Using the 2003 China General Social Survey data, {{this study}} explores the {{changing}} stratification mechanisms in transitional China {{by examining the}} relative importance of three job-attainment channels, namely, state-led hiring, market-led hiring, and guanxi -led hiring. I argue that the labour market of post-socialist China is co-stratified by political power and the market. These two forces have achieved an equilibrium in which market strength is subject to political power. Firstly, the increasingly importance of education is not due to the emergence of the market, because state-led hiring has even stricter educational criteria. Guanxi is no longer a driving force of stratification, since guanxi -led hiring is more utilized by the disadvantaged. Second, an increasing tendency of market-led and guanxi-led hirings accompanied by a decline of state-led hiring is evident, over time and across space. Thus, new opportunity structures have indeed expanded, making it possible to move upwards outside of the state-controlled system. Third, Quantile Regression estimations show that the dominance of political power penetrates from the lowest to <b>highest</b> <b>social</b> <b>stratum,</b> so that being hired by the state-controlled channel is the most likely means of upward mobility.
