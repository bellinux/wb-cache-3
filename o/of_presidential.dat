It was flown on the president's official residence, and used as a car flag and instead of number plates on the president's vehicle. The banner was also used on special national occasions including the welcome ceremony for Ignacy Paderewski in Poznań in 1918 and Poland's wedding to the Baltic Sea in Puck in 1920. It also draped the coffins of Henryk Sienkiewicz in 1924, the Unknown Soldier in 1925, and Marshal Józef Piłsudski in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Fillmore {{was active}} in the discussions <b>of</b> <b>presidential</b> {{candidates}} that preceded the Whig National Convention for the 1840 race. He initially supported General Winfield Scott, but really wanted to defeat Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, a slaveholder he felt could not carry New York state. Fillmore did not attend the convention, but was gratified when it nominated General William Henry Harrison for president, with former Virginia senator John Tyler his running mate. Fillmore organized Western New York for the Harrison campaign, and the national ticket was elected, while Fillmore easily gained a fourth term in the House.|$|E

He graduated magna cum laude in 1988, after writing a senior thesis on press coverage <b>of</b> <b>presidential</b> campaigns. After graduating from Princeton, Lu attended Harvard Law School, where he was one of Barack Obama's classmates from 1988 to 1991.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} that arose after the incapacity of President Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived {{the national debate}} on the process <b>of</b> <b>presidential</b> succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 {{and the lack of}} action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process <b>of</b> <b>presidential</b> succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.|$|E

5|$|As {{a sitting}} president, Reagan {{did not have}} the highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times. In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42. While the debate about Reagan's legacy is ongoing, the 2009 Annual C-SPAN Survey <b>of</b> <b>Presidential</b> Leaders ranked Reagan the 10th greatest president. The survey of leading historians rated Reagan number 11 in 2000.|$|E
5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} {{had been passed}} to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms was a massive increase in the number <b>of</b> <b>presidential</b> primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.|$|E
5|$|During the {{administration}} of Ferdinand Marcos, the region of Metro Manila was created as an integrated unit with the enactment <b>of</b> <b>Presidential</b> Decree No. 824 on November 7, 1975. The area encompassed four cities and thirteen adjoining towns, as a separate regional unit of government. On the 405th anniversary of the city's foundation on June 24, 1976, Manila was reinstated by Marcos as {{the capital of the}} Philippines for its historical significance as the seat of government since the Spanish Period. Presidential Decree No. 940 states that Manila has always been to the Filipino people and {{in the eyes of the}} world, the premier city of the Philippines being the center of trade, commerce, education and culture.|$|E

5|$|In February 2002, the US Marine Corps {{commenced}} a {{study to}} identify potential replacement rotorcraft for the aging Sikorsky VH-3D presidential transport helicopters. On 18 December 2003, the United States Department of Defense issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the supply of 23 helicopters {{to be used as}} a replacement for the 11 VH-3Ds and 8 VH-60Ns of the Marine Corps' HMX-1 squadron, which performs the role <b>of</b> <b>Presidential</b> helicopter transportation; this requirement was given the designation of VXX, or the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program. Two companies, AgustaWestland and Sikorsky Aircraft responded to the VXX RFP; additionally, that had been interest in a potential Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey-based bid, however the rotorcraft was deemed to be non-transportable by military airlift and thus unsuitable to qualify.|$|E
5|$|It was {{customary}} in {{mid-19th century}} America {{for a candidate}} for high office not to appear to seek it. Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany, and made no speeches; the 1848 campaign was conducted in the newspapers and with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Michigan Senator Lewis Cass for president, with General William O. Butler his running mate, {{but it would be}} a three-way fight as the Free Soil Party, opposed to the spread of slavery, chose former president Van Buren. There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be an party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an uncommitted slate <b>of</b> <b>presidential</b> electors, but Fillmore interceded with the editor, assuring him that Taylor was loyal to the party.|$|E
5|$|One of Dekanozov′s primary goals was the {{organization}} of a puppet government that would legitimize the occupation. On June 16, the Lithuanian government, exceeding its authority, decided that Smetona's emigration was in effect a resignation and granted Merkys full presidential powers. On June 17, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis the new Prime Minister and confirmed the new government, known as the People's Government. Merkys and Urbšys then resigned; both would later be arrested and deported to Russia. Paleckis assumed the presidency and appointed writer Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius as Prime Minister. The People's Government included several well-known politicians and public figures to reassure the public that the new government was not a tool of Soviet occupation, but a simple replacement of the authoritarian Smetona regime. Since there had been strong opposition to Smetona's rule, it was interpreted by some Lithuanians as a destruction <b>of</b> <b>presidential</b> power {{rather than as a}} loss of independence.|$|E
