40|$|Nowadays, it {{is popular}} to {{outsource}} transportation {{and distribution of}} finished products to third-party logistics (3 PL) providers in many industries. In order to shorten the response time from <b>order</b> <b>receipt</b> to delivery, and also to improve on-time delivery accuracy, the decision of manufacturing scheduling and transportation scheduling should consider the constraints between manufacturing and transportation. In this paper, we study a coordinated scheduling problem of parallel machine assembly manufacturing and multi-destination transportation in the make-to-order (MTO) consumer electronics supply chain (CESC). By considering the constraints between parallel machine assembly and 3 PL transportation, the overall problem is decomposed into a parallel machine scheduling sub-problem and a 3 PL transportation sub-problem. The 3 PL transportation problem is proved to be NP-complete. Heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve the parallel machine assembly scheduling problem. 3 PL Transportation Assembly Supply chain Coordinated scheduling...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{meet the}} {{shipping}} deadlines of dynamic product demands efficiently, the operations and shipping systems in an enterprise must be nimble and responsive {{enough to satisfy}} customers. Organizations have implemented enterprise systems (ESs) to integrate their supply chain processes such as customer <b>order</b> <b>receipt,</b> logistics planning, manufacturing, and dispatch of products. This paper investigates how manufacturing organizations manage their distribution logistics function and implement strategies using an ES and its information. Three case studies are conducted in manufacturing companies that have implemented ESs to examine how these systems support the management practices and strategies in shipping out operations. Findings suggest that ES tools aid information flow for tracking shipment orders, optimization of product packaging, and achieving on-time deliveries. Though firms are sometimes constrained in materials and availability of physical products for dispatch, the underlying ES technology provides the analytical and knowledge-leveraging support to spur the distribution logistics processes efficiently...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Electronic data {{interchange}} (EDI) is {{an information}} technology that standardizes the exchange of information between transacting parties. Using data from a major U. S. office furniture manufacturer that adopted EDI primarily to improve the efficiency of accounting transactions, we evaluate whether EDI reduces order-processing time (the time from sales <b>order</b> <b>receipt</b> to sales order scheduling) and whether this improvement is greater for more complex orders. Our measure of complexity reflects both the mix of different products the dealer orders as well as features and options the dealer selects for each product in the order. We find that EDI is associated with faster order processing, independent of complexity, and that EDI mitigates most of {{the negative effects of}} complexity on processing time. We also find that dealers learn to submit error-free orders to the manufacturer, and that previous errors provide feedback that helps dealers submit more accurate orders. However, we find only mixed evidence that order complexity impedes learning...|$|E

As distributed computing becomes commonplace, and many more applications are faced with the current costs of high availability, there is a fresh need for recovery-based techniques that combine high performance during failurefree executions with fast recovery. As an initial step towards the development of these new techniques, we have implemented a sender-based pessimistic protocol [5], a receiver-based pessimistic protocol [2] and a causal protocol [1] and studied their performance during recovery [4] 1. All of these protocols log (1) the content and (2) the <b>order</b> of <b>receipt</b> of each message delivered by each process during its execution. Processes synchronously log on stable storage 2 the <b>order</b> of <b>receipt,</b> encoded in tuples called determinants. <...|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1981, D'Amico escaped from prison and joined the {{executive}} board of the NCO branch outside prison, which was called Cielo Coperto (open sky). He worked closely with Vincenzo Casillo, then second-in-command to Cutolo, and he accumulated {{a wealth of information}} on the different operations which were managed by the NCO. D'Amico was again arrested at the end of 1981. This time, during a raid on his apartment, police found very sensitive materials on him including a copy of the ritual of initiation, an agenda full of names, letters, money <b>orders</b> <b>receipts,</b> etc., which confirmed the Justice Department's suspicion of his role as a leader. Due to Cutolo's ability to command respect from the penitentiary direction, which until 1982 usually promptly consented to all his requests, D'Amico was sent to the prison on Ascoli Piceno where he joined the leadership of the NCO.|$|R
