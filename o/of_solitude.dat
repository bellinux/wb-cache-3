5|$|Due to {{his newfound}} fame and his outspoken views on U.S. imperialism Garcia Márquez was labeled as a subversive {{and for many}} years was denied visas by U.S. {{immigration}} authorities. After Bill Clinton was elected U.S. president, he lifted the travel ban and cited One Hundred Years <b>of</b> <b>Solitude</b> as his favorite novel.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{started as}} a journalist, and wrote many {{acclaimed}} non-fiction works and short stories, but {{is best known for}} his novels, such as One Hundred Years <b>of</b> <b>Solitude</b> (1967), The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975), and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in the fictional village of Macondo (mainly inspired by his birthplace, Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme <b>of</b> <b>solitude.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Metroid {{was influenced}} by two other major Nintendo franchises: Mario, from which it borrowed extensive areas of platform jumping, and The Legend of Zelda, from which it borrowed non-linear exploration. The game differed in its atmosphere <b>of</b> <b>solitude</b> and foreboding. Metroid {{was also one of}} the first video games to feature an exploration to the left as well as the right, and backtracking to already explored areas to search for secret items and paths.|$|E

After defeating her counterpart, Wonder Woman convinces the Amazons to help the Insurgency. An army led by the alternate Aquaman attacks Metropolis, where the insurgents and the Amazons fight them off. Prime Superman defeats powerful regime enforcers, including Doomsday (Khary Payton), and engages in a final confrontation against {{his counterpart}} at the Fortress <b>of</b> <b>Solitude,</b> where he emerges victorious, ending {{the reign of the}} High Councillor.|$|E

He then takes her to the Kawatche Caves, where they are transported to the Fortress <b>of</b> <b>Solitude.</b> Lana is in shock as she looks around at the Fortress. Clark expresses fear that Lana is {{drifting}} away because of his secret, so he decides to reveal his powers to her. Clark then uses the coal to make a diamond ring and proposes marriage. Afterward, Clark reveals {{what he did to}} his parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (John Schneider and Annette O'Toole), who tell him that he is old enough to make decisions on his own without the advice of his father. After some initial doubt, Lana returns to the Kent farm to accept Clark's proposal.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{continued}} {{to publish the}} poetic works of Aikin and Barbauld {{as well as those}} of George Dyer, Joseph Fawcett, James Hurdis, Joel Barlow, Ann Batten Cristall and Edward Williams. Most of the poets that Johnson promoted and published are not remembered today. However, in 1793, Johnson published William Wordsworth's An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches; he remained Wordsworth's publisher until a disagreement separated them in 1799. Johnson also put out Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Fears <b>of</b> <b>Solitude</b> (1798). They were apparently close enough friends for Coleridge to leave his books at Johnson's shop when he toured Europe.|$|E
5|$|Like the Patriarch in García Márquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch, Bolívar was an {{absolute}} dictator. The Patriarch is never identified by name; Bolívar, too, is identified chiefly by his title. Bolívar also invites comparison with Colonel Aureliano Buendía in One Hundred Years of Solitude: both characters believe the wars they have waged have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face numerous attempts on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes. In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles Buendía in One Hundred Years <b>of</b> <b>Solitude</b> and Santiago Nasar in Chronicle of a Death Foretold.|$|E

Still investigating the earlier power outage, Lois tracks the hypocenter to the mansion Luthor recently inherited and, along with her son, explores the yacht docked there. Discovering Luthor, she is held captive as the yacht heads out into the Atlantic. Luthor {{plans to use the}} Kryptonian crystal technology Superman used to create his Fortress <b>of</b> <b>Solitude</b> to create a massive new continent which would swallow some of the current land masses bordering the Atlantic. The world will then be forced to use his new land. Placing a crystal inside a shell of refined kryptonite, Luthor triggers the new land growth by launching it into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Portrayed by Tom Welling, Clark Kent is {{an alien}} being with superhuman abilities, which {{he uses to}} help others in danger. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent in the series pilot, when he crash lands to Earth as a three-year-old child. Twelve years later, he tries to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father. For most of the series, Clark spends his time running from his Kryptonian heritage, going as far as leaving Smallville, abandoning a quest his {{biological}} father Jor-El sends him on in search of three Kryptonian stones of knowledge, continuing his training at the Fortress <b>of</b> <b>Solitude,</b> and unwittingly unleashing a Kryptonian criminal from the Phantom Zone when he refuses to kill Lex.|$|E
5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before the digital age. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress <b>of</b> <b>Solitude</b> was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.|$|E

5|$|After overhearing a {{government}} radio broadcast with disguised references to nuclear weapons, Lois sneaks on board Air Force One. She manipulates {{her way into}} the room with the Secretary of State, where she tells him that the supposed meteor is really a planet, and that the heroes they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give the heroes a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid possessing Lionel's body. Jor-El taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading to this moment. Harnessing the ability to fly, Clark smashes through Lionel's body, destroying it, and makes his way to the Fortress <b>of</b> <b>Solitude.</b> There, the spirit of his father, Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), presents him with the suit Martha made for him, and Clark takes to the sky, saving a crashing Air Force One, and vanquishing Darkseid by pushing Apokolips back into space.|$|E
5|$|After writing One Hundred Years <b>of</b> <b>Solitude</b> García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 28, 1977 at Pinewood Studios for Krypton scenes, budgeted {{as the most}} expensive film ever made at that point. Since Superman was being shot simultaneously with Superman II, filming lasted 19 months, until October 1978. Filming was originally scheduled to last between seven and eight months, but problems arose during production. John Barry served as production designer, while Stuart Craig and Norman Reynolds worked as art directors. Derek Meddings and Les Bowie were credited as visual effects supervisors. Stuart Freeborn was the make-up artist, while Barry, David Tomblin, John Glen, David Lane, Robert Lynn and an uncredited Peter Duffell and André de Toth directed second unit scenes. Vic Armstrong was hired as the stunt coordinator and Reeve's stunt double; his wife Wendy Leech was Kidder's double. Superman was also the final complete film by cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, who died during post-production while working on Tess for director Roman Polanski. The Fortress <b>of</b> <b>Solitude</b> was constructed at Shepperton Studios and at Pinewood's 007 Stage. Upon viewing the footage of Krypton, Warner Bros. decided to distribute in not only North America, but also in foreign countries. Due to complications and problems during filming, Warner Bros. also supplied $20million and acquired television rights.|$|E
