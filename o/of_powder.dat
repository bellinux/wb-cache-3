5|$|The metal {{was used}} by pre-Columbian Americans near modern-day Esmeraldas, Ecuador to produce {{artifacts}} of a white gold-platinum alloy. They employed a relatively sophisticated system <b>of</b> <b>powder</b> metallurgy. The platinum used in such objects was not the pure element, but rather a naturally occurring mixture of the platinum group metals, with small amounts of palladium, rhodium, and iridium.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} of graphite was solved in 1916 by the related method <b>of</b> <b>powder</b> diffraction, which {{was developed by}} Peter Debye and Paul Scherrer and, independently, by Albert Hull in 1917.

Hull also used the powder method to determine the structures of various metals, such as iron and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation <b>of</b> <b>powder</b> and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had {{a conflict of interest}} in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion. After being briefed on the NIS's focus on Hartwig, Miceli directed his investigative team to determine how Hartwig had initiated the explosion using an electrical or chemical detonator.|$|E

5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun with a bag <b>of</b> <b>powder</b> and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the new findings, the U.S. Navy, with Sandia's assistance, reopened the investigation. In August 1991, Sandia and the GAO completed their reports, concluding that the explosion was likely caused by an accidental overram <b>of</b> <b>powder</b> bags into the breech of the 16-inch gun. The U.S. Navy, however, disagreed with Sandia's opinion {{and concluded that the}} cause of the explosion could not be determined. The U.S. Navy expressed regret (but not an apology) to Hartwig's family and closed its investigation.|$|E
5|$|London {{was also}} full of black powder, {{especially}} {{along the river}} front.

Five to six hundred tons <b>of</b> <b>powder</b> was stored in the Tower of London. The ship chandlers along the wharves also held large stocks, stored in wooden barrels.|$|E
40|$|Smokeless powders such as {{nitrocellulose}} containing nitroglycerine {{have been}} used for common propellants. Recently, these powders have also been used as the propellant of rivet steels. The efficiency of a rivet ejector is mainly influenced by the exploding properties <b>of</b> <b>powders.</b> In this respect, we especially measured the dynamic pressure caused by the explosion <b>of</b> <b>powders,</b> and discussed the relation between the dynamic pressure and the several properties <b>of</b> these <b>powders</b> such as particle size, particle from, and surface conditions of particles. We further discussed the initiating methods <b>of</b> these <b>powders.</b> From the results of these expariments, we recognized the following facts: (1) The wave form of the dynamic pressure caused by the explosion <b>of</b> <b>powders</b> is scarcely influenced by the components and particle form <b>of</b> these <b>powders,</b> if an explo-sion is caused in a closed chamber with the loading density <b>of</b> <b>powders</b> <b>of</b> 0. 3 g/cc or more. (2) Reacting period <b>of</b> <b>powders</b> in a closed chamber is not effected by the initiating methods. (3) Wave form of the dynamic pressure is influenced by the state of the closed chamber. The details of the measuring methnds for the dynamic pressure and the overall results of the experiments are shown in this paper. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Verification of up-to-now use <b>of</b> {{conventional}} <b>powders,</b> {{provided to}} spray by the APS method for layers type TBC and its possible adaptation to layers of new types, {{which are based}} on new ceramic compounds, sprayed on conventional high temperature creep resisting alloys. New types <b>of</b> used ceramic <b>powders</b> are so called pyrochlores of the RE 2 Zr 2 O 7 general formula. Design/methodology/approach: A scope of investigations comprised review of up-to-now used criteria of assessment and verification <b>of</b> them on <b>powders</b> <b>of</b> new types. Investigations of chemical composition were realized, in consideration of carbon and sulphur contents and gas oxygen and nitrogen contents. Investigations on sizes <b>of</b> <b>powders</b> by a sieve method and investigations on surface morphology were carried out. Assessment of microstructure, considering homogeneity in chemical composition and porosity, was carried out. Assessment of phase contents <b>of</b> exemplary <b>powders</b> was carried out. Findings: The carried out analysis enabled to compare criteria of assessment for two types <b>of</b> <b>powders,</b> provided to be sprayed by the APS method. It was stated that up-to-now used criteria <b>of</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>powders</b> were correct also for materials of new types. Research limitations/implications: The carried out investigations suggest a necessity to verify results also on an example of another type <b>of</b> new <b>powders.</b> Practical implications: The got results reveal a possibility to use up-to-now procedures in assessment <b>of</b> <b>powders</b> for materials <b>of</b> a new type, completed with characteristics of physical and mechanical properties.

5|$|Transferred to {{the command}} of the Marshal de Richelieu, he served {{for a while in}} the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. He fought at Lutzenburg in October 1758, where he took 400 prisoners, and moved on to take the {{strategic}} castle of Spangenberg. Although it was heavily fortified, he took the garrison by surprise on 9 November. Finding that the drawbridge was down, his troops took the garrison prisoner and seized their armoury, including 18 cannon, 307 guns and 44 barrels <b>of</b> <b>powder.</b> He returned to Flanders in May 1759 and was appointed to command French forces in Picardy in 1760.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, Leake {{received}} {{the news that}} a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements {{was on its way}} from Lisbon, escorted by four men-of-war. Adverse winds and currents meant that he was unable to sail to assist it against a French naval force that had left Cadiz, and he was forced to wait to see if the convoy would reach its destination. On 18 December, nine of the transports reached the bay, accompanied by two men-of-war, with another seven arriving on 20 December. Four were missing, having been intercepted by the French; three of them had been sunk or captured while the last one eventually made it to Gibraltar at the end of December. They brought with them 2,200 men from the Grenadier Guards, Donegal's Foot and Barrymore's Foot, plus some Dutch troops, guns and supplies <b>of</b> <b>powder,</b> tools and food. Further reinforcements arrived between 16–18 January. With Gibraltar safe for the moment, Leake left for Lisbon on 3 January with sick and wounded members of the garrison aboard his ships.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its role in protecting the Thames, the fort had various military uses during the 18th century. From 1716 onwards, the Board of Ordnance began {{to use it as}} a gunpowder depot; there were safety restrictions on moving gunpowder in and out of the London docks, so Tilbury was used instead. Two large magazines were built, able to hold 3,600 barrels <b>of</b> <b>powder</b> each, and the old blockhouse and other buildings were converted to act as further magazines. Eventually the fort could hold more than 19,000 barrels of gunpowder. It was also used as a transit depot for soldiers and, after the Jacobite rising of 1745, as a prison to hold 268 Highlander prisoners of war. The Jacobite prisoners were kept in the gunpowder magazines and 45 died from typhus before they were sent on to London for trial.|$|E
5|$|James Livingston had {{advanced}} to Montgomery {{the idea of}} taking Fort Chambly, near where his militia was encamped. One of Livingston's captains, Jeremy Duggan, had, on September 13, floated two nine-pound guns past St. Jean, and these guns were put to use to that end. Chambly, which was garrisoned by only 82 men, mostly from the 7th Foot, was surrendered on October 18 by its commander, Major Joseph Stopford, after two days of bombardment. Most seriously, Stopford failed to destroy supplies that were vitally useful to the Americans, primarily gunpowder, but also winter provisions. Six tons <b>of</b> <b>powder,</b> 6,500 musket cartridges, 125 muskets, 80 barrels of flour and 272 barrels of foodstuff were captured.|$|E

5|$|Although {{financial}} {{help from the}} English was not forthcoming, Ferdinand could not break the defenses. On 28 November, ten days after {{the beginning of the}} siege, artillery fire had wasted several thousand pounds <b>of</b> <b>powder</b> in the ineffectual bombardment. Ferdinand moved his cannons to an elevated position in a hillside vineyard {{to the west of the}} Godesburg. The height offered a more advantageous trajectory with which to fire on the walls of the Godesburg's outer ward. Within a few hours, his cannonade had breached them. Ferdinand sent three Italian experts to examine the breach and to advise him on the next step; the Italians, having come under fire during their examination, concluded that storming the castle would incur many casualties. The defenders still had the advantage of height and would be able to shoot at attackers from multiple towers and defensive positions inside the walls. Ferdinand decided not to pursue this tactic. Unable to storm the castle, Ferdinand considered two options: abandon the siege, which he could not do, or blow up the fortress. This option of last resort usually made a fortress unusable. Furthermore while he considered his options, the defenders repaired the breaches caused by the cannonade and reinforced the walls, making them even stronger than they had been. The defenders also removed the roof of the St. Michael's Chapel in the castle's outer ward, filled the chapel with dirt to reinforce its walls, and placed some of their artillery pieces within the walls.|$|E
5|$|De Launay {{had limited}} options: if he allowed the Revolutionaries to destroy his main gate, {{he would have}} to turn the cannon {{directly}} inside the Bastille's courtyard on the crowds, causing great loss of life and preventing any peaceful resolution of the episode.

In the midst of this attempt, the Bastille's drawbridge suddenly came down and the revolutionary crowd stormed in. De Launay was dragged outside into the streets and killed by the crowd, and three officers and three soldiers were killed {{during the course of the}} afternoon by the crowd. The soldiers of the Swiss Salis-Samade Regiment, however, were not wearing their uniform coats and were mistaken for Bastille prisoners; they were left unharmed by the crowds until they were escorted away by French Guards and other regular soldiers among the attackers. The valuable powder and guns were seized and a search begun for the other prisoners in the Bastille.|$|E
