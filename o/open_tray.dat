50|$|The LSMs {{were built}} for {{short-term}} use landing supplies in the Pacific during World War II. As such the facilities {{for the crew}} were extremely basic. All accommodation spaces were below deck with poor ventilation with several sections of three tiered bunks in cramped and crowded conditions giving no room to roll over. Above the bunks were pipes lagged with asbestos, which would rain down on the sleeper during heavy seas, covering him in white dust. Toilet facilities were an <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> with a row of seats and no privacy. The Forrard Mess was the eating, meeting and relaxing place in each LSM. The flat-bottomed ships did not travel well in rough seas. When committed to the Vietnam War, the LSMs were already old ships in need of constant maintenance.

50|$|In the Middle Ages {{people usually}} brought their own cutlery {{with them when}} eating away from home, and the more {{expensive}} types came with their own custom-made leather cases, stamped and embossed in various designs.

Occasionally flat-topped containers, they were most frequently either rod-shaped, or tall and narrow with a sloping top necessitated by a series of raised veins for exhibiting the handles of knives and the bowls of spoons. Mahogany and satinwoods were most common, occasionally inlaid with marquetry, or edged with boxwood which was resistant to chipping.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of 7 different implant impression techniques for full-arch prostheses. Materials and Methods: A master cast simulating an edentulous arch with 4 implants was used. Seven impression techniques were tested: <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> with polyether Impregum (OTI); <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> with splint-polyether Impregum (OTSI); closed tray with polyether Impregum; <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> with polyether Ramitec; <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> with splintpolyether Ramitec; closed tray with polyether Ramitec (CTR); <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> with impression plaster (OTP). Five impressions of the master cast were taken for each technique using an impression simulator device. Casts were realized based on those impressions (n = 35). Median values of deviation from the master cast were recorded for each cast through a 3 -dimensional laser scanner. Results: Only OTI (P = 0. 028) and OTSI (P < 0. 001) presented a statistically significant difference compared to the master cast. OTP (P = 0. 99) and CTR (P = 0. 10) showed median values of deviation close to zero (- 0. 001 and- 0. 003 mm, respectively). Conclusion: Stiff impression materials (such as plaster or rigid polyether) guarantee greater accuracy in cases of multiple implant impressions of patients with full-arch rehabilitations.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Various {{impression}} {{techniques have}} different {{effects on the}} accuracy of final cast dimensions. Meanwhile; there are some controversies about the best technique. Purpose: This study was performed to compare two kinds of implant impression methods (<b>open</b> <b>tray</b> and closed tray) on 15 degree angled implants. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, a steel model with 8 cm in diameter and 3 cm in height were produced with 3 holes devised inside to stabilize 3 implants. The central implant was straight {{and the other two}} implants were 15 ° angled. The two angled implants had 5 cm distance from each other and 3. 5 cm from the central implant. Dental stone, high strength (type IV) was used for the main casts. Impression trays were filled with poly ether, and then the two impression techniques (<b>open</b> <b>tray</b> and closed tray) were compared. To evaluate positions of the implants, each cast was analyzed by CMM device in 3 dimensions (x,y,z). Differences in the measurements obtained from final casts and laboratory model were analyzed using t-Test. Results: The obtained results indicated that closed tray impression technique was significantly different in dimensional accuracy when compared with <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> method. Dimensional changes were 129 ± 37 μ and 143. 5 ± 43. 67 μ in closed tray and <b>open</b> <b>tray,</b> while coefficient of variation in closed- tray and <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> were reported to be 27. 2 % and 30. 4 %, respectively.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and compare the accuracy of two procedures: <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> with splinting technique and closed tray impression techniques, in innovative in vitro experiments. Materials and Methods: One master cast was fabricated with 4 abutment replica implants with almost parallel position in an anterior region of an edentuloys mandibular plaster cast. The working cast was taken impessions with <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> splinting technique (group 1) and closed tray technique (group 2) using polyvinyl siloxane impression material. The Type III dental stone ws poured into around the impressions. The accuracy of impression procedured were measured 24 hours long after pouring dental stone to each impression. Four sited were marked to measured on every platform of implant analogs. The analyzing stylus was positioned to each site and the heights, horizontal inclination and saggital incliniation were measured using the Laser displacement transducer (LK G 115; Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Measurements of these 16 points of four implants per a model was repeated 7 times under the same condition. The gap between the abutment and superstructure at one screw test was evaluated with a digital microscope system (VH-Z 100 & VH- 5000; Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The mean and standard deviation estimated from the samples of each subgroup were statistically analyzed by ANOVA test (P< 0. 05 as the level of significance). Results: The relative differences of implant heights, horizontal inclination and saggital inclination of each implant on closed tray technique was statistically different to master cast and <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> with splinting (P< 0. 005). Conclusion: The <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> technique was more accurate comparing to the closed tray technique.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{accuracy}} of implant position transfer and surface detail reproduction using two impression techniques and materials. Materials and Methods: A metal model with two implants and three grooves of 0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75 mm in depth on the flat superior surface of a die was fabricated. Ten regular-body polyether (PE) and 10 regular-body polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impressions with square and conical transfer copings using <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> and closed tray techniques were made for each group. Impressions were poured with type IV stone, and linear and angular displacements of the replica heads were evaluated using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). Also, accurate reproduction of the grooves was evaluated by a video measuring machine (VMM). These measurements were compared with the measurements calculated on the reference model that served as control, and the data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and t-test at P= 0. 05. Results: There was less linear displacement for PVS and less angular displacement for PE in closed-tray technique, and less linear displacement for PE in <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> technique (P 0. 05 (. Conclusion: The <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> technique was more accurate using PE, and also both closed tray and <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> techniques had acceptable results with the use of PVS.

These limitations should be taken into account when choosing the appropriate inoculation method for specific purposes.

40|$|Introduction: An {{accurate}} and passive fit of implant framework prosthesis, {{as well as}} the successful surgical operation is suggested as one of the critical requirements for long-term implant success. Objective: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the accuracy of the master cast using <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> impression technique with conventional and novel splinting materials. Methodology: A mandibular reference model with four ADIN implants was done. Ten custom trays were fabricated using the light curable resin sheets. Medium body polyether impression material was used. These trays were randomly divided between the two groups, with five trays in each group. Impression techniques were divided into two groups namely: Group A: Direct impression technique with <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> impression copings splinted with autopolymerizing acrylic resin (GC pattern resin). Group B: Direct impression technique with <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> impression copings splinted with Pro-temp TM 4 (bis-GMA) syringable temporization material. Thus, final impressions were made. Total of 10 master casts were fabricated. Evaluation of casts using Dynascope-Vision Engineering, TESA microhite two- dimension and coordinate measuring machine were used. Results: Statistical comparisons were made using ANOVA test and post-hoc test. Same amount of deviation values obtained with resin splinted and bis-GMA splinted impression copings. Conclusion: The master cast obtained by both the splinting material exhibits no difference from the reference model. So bis-GMA can be used, which is easy to handle, less time consuming, less technique sensitive, rigid, and readily available material in clinics...|$|E
40|$|Background: Different {{factors such}} as {{impression}} techniques and materials can affect the passive fit between the superstructure and implant. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effect of different impression materials and techniques on the dimensional accuracy of implant definitive casts. Materials and Methods: Four internal hex implants (Biohorizons Ψ 4 mm) were placed on a metal maxillary model perpendicular to the horizontal plane in maxillary lateral incisors, right canine and left first premolar areas. Three impression techniques including <b>open</b> <b>tray,</b> closed tray using ball top screw abutments and closed tray using short impression copings and two impression materials (polyether and polyvinyl siloxane) were evaluated (n = 60). The changes in distances between implant analogues in mediolateral (x) and anteroposterior (y) directions and analogue angles in x/z and y/z directions in the horizontal plane on the definitive casts were measured by coordinate measuring machine. The data were analyzed by multivariate two-way analysis of variance and one sample t-test (α = 0. 05). Results: No statistical significant differences were observed between different impression techniques and materials. However, deviation and distortion of definitive casts had a significant difference with the master model when short impression copings and polyvinyl siloxane impression material were used (P < 0. 05). In <b>open</b> <b>tray</b> technique, there was a significant difference in the rotation of analogs compared with the master model with both impression materials (P < 0. 05).

50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that the tubes or chutes {{coming out of the}} fixed mounted aviation LMG 08/15 fixed guns were for expended cartridge cases. In actuality these attachments were for guiding the empty cartridge belts into a container inside the fuselage of the aircraft so that the belts would not interfere with the operation of the aircraft. As the entire MG 08 Spandau family of German machine guns ejected their empty cartridge cases forward through a round hole in the receiver under the barrel (as can be clearly seen on many videos), these cartridge cases were guided out of the aircraft (except on Martin Kreutzer-designed Fokker biplane fighter aircraft, and the Fokker fighters designed by Kreutzer's successor Reinhold Platz) through tubes from under the barrel {{to the bottom of the}} fuselage. With Fokker designed aircraft following the Eindecker, the cartridge cases were ejected without tubes from the receiver hole directly into <b>open</b> <b>trays</b> that guided the tumbling cartridge cases backward and sideways onto the sloped fuselage decking, which then streamed down past the cockpit on either side.
