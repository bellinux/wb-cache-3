40|$|Abstract — As new bandwidth-hungry IP {{services}} are demand-ing {{more and more}} capacity, transport networks are evolving to provide a reconfigurable optical layer {{in order to allow}} fast dynamic allocation of WDM channels. To achieve this goal, optical packet-switched systems seem to be strong candidates as they allow a high degree of statistical resource sharing, which leads to an efficient bandwidth utilization. In this work, we propose an architecture for optical packet-switched transport networks, together with an innovative switching node structure based on the concept of per-packet wavelength routing. The traffic performance of such node when loaded by a typical IP traffic is evaluated through computer simulation; packet loss probability and average delay performance are shown for various load conditions.

40|$|Many {{industry}} experts {{predict that the}} future of ber optic telecommunications depends on the development of all-optical components for switching of photonic signals from ber to ber throughout the networks. MEMS is a promising technology for providing all-optical switching at high speeds with signicant cost reductions. This paper reports on the the analysis of two designs for 2 -DOF electrostatically actuated MEMS micromirrors for precision controllable large <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> <b>arrays.</b> The behavior of the micromirror designs is predicted by coupled-eld electrostatic and modal analysis using a nite element analysis (FEA) multi-physics modeling software. The analysis indicates that the commonly used gimbal type mirror design experiences electrostatic interference and would therefore be diÆcult to precisely control for 2 -DOF motion. We propose a new design approach which preserves 2 -DOF actuation while minimizing electrostatic interference between the drive electrodes and the mirror. Instead of using two torsional axes, we use one actuator which combines torsional and exural DOFs. A comparative analysis of the conventional gimbal design and the one proposed in this paper is performed...|$|R

The electronics switches types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These switches are the base of digital <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> and in principal two types are defined: the switch S and switch T. The switch S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from incoming circuit with random outgoing circuit. The switch S is being used in multistage <b>switching</b> <b>arrays</b> in combination with the switches T because it can not be used separately. The switch T allows exchanging the time position of incoming circuit to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time switch can substitute the space switch under specific work conditions. In practice, the time switch with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal switching points of digital <b>switching</b> <b>array</b> which is the executive unit of switching systems.

40|$|Effective optical {{interconnect}} {{is a fundamental}} requisite to realize Internet-scale data centres due to the capabilities and benefits of optical devices. Optical interconnects are energy efficient and support massive bandwidths. The performance of {{optical interconnect}}s {{is directly related to}} the type of <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> techniques used. <b>Optical</b> <b>switches</b> may be categorized into slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> The <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> techniques are <b>Optical</b> Circuit <b>Switching</b> (OCS), <b>Optical</b> Packet <b>Switching</b> (OPS) and <b>Optical</b> Burst <b>Switching</b> (OBS). This thesis presents three novel optical interconnection schemes which are based on <b>optical</b> burst <b>switching.</b> These schemes are called Hybrid <b>Optical</b> <b>Switch</b> Architecture (HOSA), HOSA with Traffic Demand Scheduling (TDS) and Fast <b>Optical</b> <b>Switch</b> Architecture (FOSA). The first two schemes are based on a hybrid design that utilizes fast and slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> while the third scheme is based on using only fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> The proposed schemes consider OBS with a two-way reservation protocol that ensures zero burst loss. In the two-way reservation protocol, the connection is established for each burst before transmission. To evaluate the performance of these schemes, network-level simulation is used. The proposed architectures consider a single stage core topology that can be easily scaled up (in capacity) and scaled out (in the number of racks) without requiring major re-cabling and network reconfiguration. The proposed schemes feature separate data and control planes. The control plane comprises a centralized controller while the data plane contains an <b>array</b> of <b>optical</b> <b>switches.</b> A scalability analysis of the proposed topology is presented and shows that this topology is scalable to hundreds of thousands of servers. This thesis also presents a trade-off between cost and power consumption of the proposed designs by comparing them with conventional interconnects using analytical modelling. In HOSA, the key idea is to route high volume traffic through a fast <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> during the reconfiguration of a slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch.</b> The traffic is moved to the slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> once it is reconfigured. The aggregated traffic should be large enough so that it can bypass the slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> during its reconfiguration phase. This technique hides the reconfiguration time of slow <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> but the latency introduced due to burst aggregation is still high. In HOSA with TDS, small bursts are considered to reduce the latency of burst aggregation. The controller in HOSA with TDS technique maintains a traffic demand matrix which updates traffic demand on periodic intervals and assigns slow paths for the high traffic volume. A resource allocation algorithm is proposed that allocates paths of fast and slow <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> efficiently. In HOSA with TDS, the control plane can only support applications that have high traffic stability. So for dynamically changing communication patterns, this thesis presents a new design called FOSA. The FOSA is based on only fast <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> and it also uses OBS with the two-way reservation i. e. there is no additional burden on the control plane for maintaining traffic demands as was done in HOSA with TDS. The proposed technique shows considerable improvement in terms of throughput and packet loss ratio as compared to the traditional methods of OBS while performance comparable in terms of delay with the traditional methods of OBS is also achieved. The proposed technique also demonstrates performance comparable to that of electrical data centre networks. The performance of TCP over traditional OBS network is degraded by the bursts losses due to contention even at a low traffic load. In FOSA, the performance of the TCP is evaluated. Since in the proposed scheme, the burst loss is zero due to two way reservation, the results show significant improvement of TCP performance in terms of throughput, time and packets loss as compared to the traditional methods of OBS and the conventional electronic packet switching data centre networks for all types of workloads...|$|R
