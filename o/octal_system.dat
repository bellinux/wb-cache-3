For tho' all nations count universally by tens (originally occasioned {{by the number of}} digits on both hands) yet 8 is a far more complete and commodious number; since it is divisible into halves, quarters, and half quarters (or units) without a fraction, of which subdivision ten is uncapable...."

5000|$|Octal and hex are {{convenient}} ways {{to represent}} binary numbers, as used by computers. Computer engineers often {{need to write}} out binary quantities, but in practice writing out a binary number such as 1001001101010001 is tedious and prone to errors. Therefore, binary quantities are written in a base-8, or [...] "octal", or, much more commonly, a base-16, [...] "hexadecimal" [...] or [...] "hex", number format. In the decimal system, there are 10 digits, 0 through 9, which combine to form numbers. In an <b>octal</b> <b>system,</b> there are only 8 digits, 0 through 7.

In a hexadecimal system, there are 16 digits, 0 through 9 followed, by convention, with A through F.
