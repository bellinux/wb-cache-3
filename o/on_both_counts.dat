5|$|With {{the success}} of Operation Hurricane, Britain became the third nuclear power after the United States and the Soviet Union. {{although}} production bombs would not be delivered to the RAF until November 1953, and a further two years would pass before the RAF had bombers capable of carrying them. Four weeks after Operation Hurricane, the United States successfully demonstrated a hydrogen bomb. The technology mastered in Operation Hurricane was six years old, and with the hydrogen bomb in hand, the US Congress saw no benefit in renewing cooperation. All the while Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought interdependence in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. As successful as it was, Operation Hurricane fell short <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>counts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ray Parlour and Henry {{came off}} {{in the second half}} for Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord. United created an early chance, but Van Nistelrooy was unable {{to make the most of}} Giggs' delivery. The player went down in the penalty area under the {{challenge}} of Campbell, prompting United players to appeal for a penalty; however, referee Steve Bennett decided to let play continue. Arsenal countered twice thereafter, but their attacks broke down <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>counts.</b> Vieira, Scholes and Quinton Fortune were booked for tackles during a 10-minute spell. Both clubs made substitutions in the midway point of the second half: for Arsenal, Bergkamp, Gilberto and Ljungberg were replaced by Francis Jeffers, Edu and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, whereas for United, Butt and Fortune came off for Eric Djemba-Djemba and John O'Shea. In the 72nd minute, Jeffers was shown a red card for kicking out at Neville. Ferguson brought on striker Diego Forlán for Neville six minutes later. Djemba-Djemba avoided a yellow card for his challenge on Campbell in the 80th minute; Bennett deemed it unintentional.|$|E
5|$|Yet all {{the while}} Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought {{interdependence}} in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. This was desired more than ever, as other countries recovered from the war and once again began to challenge Britain's status. As successful as it was, High Explosive Research fell short <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>counts.</b> The technology demonstrated at Monte Bello in October 1952 was already seven years old. The following month the United States tested Ivy Mike, a thermonuclear device. The British government would now have to decide whether to initiate its own hydrogen bomb programme. Penney, for one, feared that this would likely prove to be beyond the financial resources of Britain's war-ravaged economy. The successful British hydrogen bomb programme, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the Sputnik crisis, led to amendment of the United States Atomic Energy Act in 1958, and a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E

25|$|During the pretrial {{discovery}} process, Chambers produced {{new evidence}} indicating {{that he and}} Hiss {{had been involved in}} espionage, which both men had previously denied under oath to HUAC. A federal grand jury indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury; Chambers admitted to the same offense but, as a cooperating government witness, was never charged. Although Hiss's indictment stemmed from the alleged espionage, he could not be tried for that crime because the statute of limitations had expired. After a mistrial due to a hung jury, Hiss was tried a second time. In January 1950, he was found guilty <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>counts</b> of perjury and received two concurrent five-year sentences, of which he eventually served three and a half years.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{integration}} of a biconvex micro optofluidic lens into a flow cytometer. The complex optofluidic and microfluidic channel networks are integrated on a single chip. Flow cytometers are widely applied to environmental monitoring, industrial testing and biochemical studies. Integrating a fow cytometer into microfluidic networks helps to miniaturize the system and make it portable for field use. The integration of optical components, such as lenses, further improves the compactness and thus has been intensively studied recently. However, the current designs suffer from severe light scattering due to the roughness of the solid-based lens interface. In this paper, we propose a micro optofluidic system using an optofuidic liquid lens to focus the light beam. Benefting from the smooth liquid-liquid lens interface and the refractive index matching liquid as cladding streams, a light beam can be well focused without scattering. The variations of the signal peak values are reduced owing to the small beam width at the beam waist. Compared to the macroscale systems and microscale systems with solid lenses, the device presents a more efficient and accurate performance <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>counting</b> and sizing of particles. The paper reports an analytical parametric study of the lens, followed by the experimental performance of the cytometer.

40|$|Error {{correction}} of sequenced reads remains a difficult task, especially in single-cell sequencing projects with extremely non-uniform coverage. While existing error correction tools designed for standard (multi-cell) sequencing data usually {{come up short}} in single-cell sequencing projects, algorithms actually used for single-cell error correction have been so far very simplistic. We introduce several novel algorithms based on Hamming graphs and Bayesian subclustering in our new error correction tool BayesHammer. While BayesHammer was designed for single-cell sequencing, we demonstrate that it also improves on existing error correction tools for multi-cell sequencing data while working much faster on real-life datasets. We benchmark BayesHammer <b>on</b> <b>both</b> $k$-mer <b>counts</b> and actual assembly results with the SPAdes genome assembler...|$|R
