50|$|In a bakery, angel food cakes {{could be}} baked in a rack oven, {{revolving}} oven, convention <b>oven,</b> or small <b>deck</b> <b>oven.</b> A commercial bakery may use a tunnel or traveling oven. When the cake has finished baking, {{it should have}} a golden brown color on the exposed area. The final volume will generally be {{two to three times}} larger than the batter volume.|$|R
50|$|In restaurants, pizza can be {{baked in}} an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an {{electric}} <b>deck</b> <b>oven,</b> {{a conveyor belt}} oven or, {{in the case of}} more expensive restaurants, a wood- or coal-fired brick <b>oven.</b> On <b>deck</b> <b>ovens,</b> pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it. When made at home, it can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.|$|R

5000|$|Baguettes are {{generally}} made as partially free-form loaves, with the loaf formed {{with a series}} of folding and rolling motions, raised in cloth-lined baskets or in rows on a flour-impregnated towel, called a couche, and baked either directly on the hearth of a <b>deck</b> <b>oven</b> or in special perforated pans designed to hold the shape of the baguette while allowing heat through the perforations. American-style [...] "French bread" [...] is generally much fatter and is not baked in <b>deck</b> <b>ovens,</b> but in convection ovens.|$|R

50|$|<b>Deck</b> <b>ovens</b> use steam injection, {{through various}} methods, {{to create the}} proper baguette. The oven is {{typically}} heated to well over 200 C. The steam allows the crust to expand before setting, thus creating a lighter, airier loaf. It also melts the dextrose on the bread's surface, giving a slightly glazed effect.|$|R
50|$|The bakery has two {{additional}} locations in Detroit: the Eat Well, Do Good Cafe at Henry Ford Hospital at 2799 W. Grand Boulevard in New Center, and Avalon City Ovens, a production facility {{in a former}} industrial warehouse at 4731 Bellevue on the city's East Side, near the Packard Automotive Plant. Established in 2013, Avalon City Ovens features a large Italian artisan <b>deck</b> <b>oven</b> and accounts {{for the majority of}} the bakery's output, primarily serving its retail and wholesale customers.|$|R
5000|$|A less {{direct link}} {{can be made}} however with <b>deck</b> <b>ovens,</b> or steam ovens. Deck/steam ovens are a {{combination}} of a gas-fired traditional oven and a brick oven, a thick [...] "deck" [...] of stone or firebrick heated by natural gas instead of wood. The first steam oven was brought (in the early nineteenth century) to Paris by the Austrian officer August Zang, who also introduced Vienna bread (pain viennois) and the croissant, and whom some French sources thus credit with originating the baguette.|$|R
