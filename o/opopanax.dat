The curtains were drawn, the firelight gleamed; on a table by his bed were a jug of barley-water and the Times. He made an attempt to read, failed, and fell again to thinking. His face with its square chin, looked like a block of pale leather bedded in the pillow. It was lonely! A woman in the room would have made all the difference! Why had he never married? He breathed hard, staring froglike at the ceiling; a memory had come into his mind. It {{was a long time}} ago--forty odd years--but it seemed like yesterday....|$|E

A consumable resin known as <b>opopanax</b> can be extracted from the <b>Opopanax</b> plant by cutting {{at the base of a}} stem and sun-drying the juice that flows out.

5000|$|Pornocrates is {{considered}} the best-known work by Rops. It was realized {{at a time when}} Rops was 45 years old and lived in Paris together with the sisters Léontine and Aurélie Duluc, who both were his mistresses and became mothers to his children. The title of the work can be translated as [...] "the ruler of fornication". According to his own correspondence, Rops produced this painting [...] "in an overheated apartment, full of different smells, where the <b>opopanax</b> and cyclamen gave me a slight fever conductive towards production or even towards reproduction". The work depicts a woman, holding a swine on a leash, viewed from the left side. The woman, said to be a courtesan, is almost naked, with the exception of long black silk gloves, a blindfold, a plumed hat, black shoes and stockings, and a band of gold and blue silk - accessories which only emphasize her nakedness. Above the pig with golden tail, three winged putti fly away in what looks like shock or horror. Rops refers to them as [...] "Three loves - ancient loves - vanish in tears".|$|E

40|$|Ethiopia {{has one of}} {{the largest}} dry forest and {{woodland}} resource bases in the Horn of Africa, predominated by diverse Acacia, Boswellia, Commiphora, and Sterculia species, with an estimated annual production potential of over 300, 000 tonnes of commercial gums and resins. However, until recently, less than 1 % of this potential has been tapped and traded while the resource bases are degrading fast. Shortage of locality-specific case studies typifying the state of gum and resin production and marketing systems and nationwide socio-economic significance of the resources has delayed development of value-added commercialization of the commodities and integrated management of the resource bases. A study aimed at exploring the value chain of traded gums and resins and their contribution to rural livelihood and national economy was conducted in 11 purposively selected localities in five National Regional States within the major gum-belts in Ethiopia. Two major cities, central for product processing and marketing, were also assessed. A questionnaire survey was administered to 135 randomly selected households, and key stakeholder interviews, group discussions, and field observations were carried out following the value chain (from producers to exporters). Results showed that {{one or more of the}} seven gums and resins (frankincense, myrrh, <b>opopanax,</b> hagar, gum arabic, gum talha, and gum gumero) were produced and traded at the studied districts. While frankincense marketing dominated the northern part, gum arabic, myrrh, and <b>opopanax</b> are most popular in the south and southeastern part of the country. About 93 % of the interviewed households engaged in collecting, marketing, or both activities. Gums and resins contributed up to 14 % of the average annual cash income of the households. However, a significant difference (P < 0. 001) was found in the amount collected and income generated per household and locality. Strong correlation was observed between cash income from gums and resins and off-farm activities (R = 0. 74) and other types of non-timber forest products like honey (R = 0. 72, α = 0. 01). However, weak correlation was observed between incomes from gums and resins and crop and livestock production. Despite the observed inefficient value chain, the gum and resin resources have considerable contributions to the national economy. For instance, the annual average revenue from three districts in Tigray National Regional State was USD 882, 000 in 2010. Between 2002 and 2010, about 2, 306 tonnes of different gums and resins were traded and average revenue of USD 3, 220, 542 was obtained in one district in the same region. At the national level, between 1997 and 2010 about 6, 174 tonnes of gum arabic and about 33, 865 tonnes of other gums and resins were exported, and more than USD 72 million were generated. Responding to what sort of institutional arrangement governs the value chain and use of gums and resins resources at the present situations, about 41 % of the respondents asserted customary and national legal arrangements, while 56 % mentioned alternative systems as means of conflict resolution. Key policy and development interventions that could enhance the socio-economic importance of the gum and resin value chain at the local and national levels, while also increasing responsibility and commitment towards long-term management of the resource bases, have been recommended...|$|E
