40|$|Based in The Hague, the European Police Office (Europol) {{is the law}} {{enforcement}} agency of the European Union (EU) that handles criminal intelligence. It supports the {{law enforcement}} agencies of EU Member States in their fight against international serious crime and terrorism. This publication {{is the result of}} a doctoral thesis, which offers a critical analysis and evaluation of the past, present and future development <b>of</b> <b>Europol.</b> The establishment <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> was in essence a political decision and to a large extent the agency has remained a political construct. Every political decision represents choices embodying the development <b>of</b> <b>Europol.</b> Choices also have to be made in the legal translation of policy decisions. In her doctoral thesis Alexandra De Moor traces these choices, as they are materialised in legal and policy documents, and makes them subject of analysis and evaluation. The research model she develops for this purpose consists of eras (the pre-Convention, Convention and post-Convention era), clusters (legal basis, objective, competence, tasks, governance and control) and criteria (necessity, consistency, balance and transparency). The three-dimensional model is perfectly suited for a doctoral thesis based on a compilation of peer-reviewed publications (seven in total). This booklet presents the main conclusions, as well as the policy epilogue. Europol, Quo Vadis? reads like a ‘Bildungsroman’, a coming of age story with lots of ups and downs, and a story with an open ending, as the identity <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> is still under debate today. The preparations <b>of</b> the new <b>Europol</b> Regulation (after 2013) have started under Danish Presidency (first half of 2012). De Moor wants to fuel the debate on the future <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> by signalling key concerns and providing useful recommendations. She doubts whether a European Police Office with operational-executive powers (modeled after the FBI) should by definition be the terminus of the development <b>of</b> <b>Europol...</b>|$|R

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Facultad de Derecho, Departamento de Ciencia Política y Relaciones Internacionales. Fecha de lectura: febrero de 2015 The increasing role {{of national}} parliaments at EU level {{points in the}} direction of greater possibilities for the development of interparliamentary practices, particularly for parliamentary control purposes. However, research has paid little attention to the way these interparliamentary practices develop and work in practice. This thesis studies the interparliamentary practices developed {{in the context of the}} parliamentary control <b>of</b> <b>Europol,</b> the European Police Agency. Europol has evolved from its original institutional design as an intergovernmental body established by an international convention into a supranational agency fully integrated into the EU. Against this background, this research looks at the evolution of the parliamentary control <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> in this process as a case of institutional development within EU representative-democratic institutions and discusses the relationship between integration (as institutional incorporation) and democratisation. Originally the European Parliament (EP) had almost no scrutiny role regarding Europol. However, in 2010 Europol became an EU agency and the EP acquired, among other things, some degree of control over the budget <b>of</b> <b>Europol.</b> On the other hand, the Lisbon Treaty provides for the political monitoring <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> to be done by national parliaments and the European Parliament together (TFEU Art. 88). Provisions of the Lisbon Treaty has not yet been implemented but changes in the parliamentary practices have already taken place in preparation for the new modality in which both national parliaments and the EP will be involved. Given this background, the key question is how is the involvement of national parliaments and the EU in the parliamentary control <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> best balanced? In this regards this thesis provides insights in the relative salience of interparliamentary coordination as compared to a strengthened role for the EP in the process of institutional incorporation <b>of</b> <b>Europol...</b>|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, the Commission {{proposed}} that the existing Europol Convention should {{be replaced by a}} Council Decision. This proposal, which is in line with Council conclusions adopted in December 2006, will not just alter the legal framework <b>of</b> <b>Europol,</b> but also significantly enhance the powers <b>of</b> <b>Europol,</b> [moving it further toward becoming a European police force]. Current legal framework Europol was established by an international Convention signed by the first fifteen Member States in 1995. This Convention entered into force in 1998, and Europol began operations in 1999, after ratification of the Protocol to the Europol Convention, concerning the privileges and immunities <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> staff. A further Protocol to the Convention, concerning the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to receive references from national courts concerning the Europol Convention, was signed in 1996 and entered into force in 1998. Amendments to the Europol Convention require the adoption of additional Protocols to the Convention, which must then be ratified by national parliaments. Three such Protocols have been agreed. The First Protocol, signed in 2000, gives Europol competence over money laundering, regardless <b>of</b> whether <b>Europol</b> is competent over the underlying crime.

40|$|The long-awaited Council Decision of 6 April 2009 {{establishing}} the European Police Office (Europol) replaces the Europol Convention and transforms Europol from an intergovernmental organisation into an EU agency. This {{article contains a}} critical exploration of the new provisions <b>of</b> the <b>Europol</b> Council Decision. The authors take stock of the novelties through a comparative analysis <b>of</b> the <b>Europol</b> Convention, its Protocols, the Commission Proposal and revised versions <b>of</b> the <b>Europol</b> Council Decision. Europol is thematically dissected into clusters: legal basis, competence, tasks, governance and control. The assessment {{is based on the}} following questions: What are the major changes? Do they contribute to a better functioning <b>of</b> <b>Europol?</b> What are the missed opportunities? In what direction is Europol heading? The importance <b>of</b> the <b>Europol</b> Council Decision is that it provides Europol with a new and more flexible legal basis. The shift in competence from “organised crime” to “serious crime” is another significant change. The Europol Council Decision continues to stress Europol’s core-business, which remain information-related tasks. A “European FBI” seems far off, even with the transformation <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> into a full-fledged EU agency. The Europol Council Decision falls somewhat short of expectations when it comes to Europol’s governance and control. Overall, the main conclusion of this article is that the Europol Council Decision is not as new as it would seem, yet new enough to herald a new era for Europo...|$|R

This will shift the scope <b>of</b> <b>Europol's</b> work from ‘organised crime' (attributing qualities to criminality) to ‘serious crime' (concern with impacts and harms falling on individual and collective victims); will transfer financing <b>of</b> <b>Europol</b> to the Community budget; and so will initiate parliamentary scrutiny.
