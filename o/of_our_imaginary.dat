40|$|This book {{argues that}} {{catastrophe}} {{is a particular}} way of governing future events – such as terrorism, climate change or pandemics – which we cannot predict but which may strike suddenly, without warning, and cause irreversible damage. At a time where catastrophe increasingly functions as a signifier <b>of</b> <b>our</b> future, <b>imaginaries</b> <b>of</b> pending doom have fostered new modes of anticipatory knowledge and redeployed existing ones. Although it shares many similarities with crises, disasters, risks and other disruptive incidents, this book claims that catastrophes also bring out the very limits of knowledge and management. The politics of catastrophe is turned towards an unknown future, which must be imagined and inhabited {{in order to be}} made palpable, knowable and actionable. Politics of Catastrophe critically assesses the effects of these new practices of knowing and governing catastrophes to come and challenges the reader to think about the possibility of an alternative politics of catastrophe. This book will be of interest to students of critical security studies, risk theory, political theory and International Relations in general. ...|$|R

Now, what is the result of all this? I have said that there are forty-nine struggling against every one; and it amounts to this, that the smallest possible start given to any one seed may give it an advantage which will enable it to get ahead of all the others; anything that will enable any one of these seeds to germinate six hours before any of the others will, other things being alike, enable it to choke them out altogether. I have shown you that there is no particular in which plants will not vary from each other; it is quite possible that one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>imaginary</b> plants may vary in such a character as the thickness of the integument of its seeds; it might happen that one of the plants might produce seeds having a thinner integument, and that would enable the seeds of that plant to germinate a little quicker than those of any of the others, and those seeds would most inevitably extinguish the forty-nine times as many that were struggling with them.|$|E
60|$|In the {{foregoing}} illustration, I {{have assumed that}} at the commencement <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>imaginary</b> Glacial period, the arctic productions were as uniform round the polar regions as {{they are at the}} present day. But it is also necessary to assume that many sub-arctic and some few temperate forms were the same round the world, for some of the species which now exist on the lower mountain slopes and on the plains of North America and Europe are the same; and it may be asked how I account for this degree of uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate forms round the world, at the commencement of the real Glacial period. At the present day, the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds are separated from each other by the whole Atlantic Ocean and by {{the northern part of the}} Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than they do at present, they must have been still more completely separated from each other by wider spaces of ocean; so that it may well be asked how the same species could then or previously have entered the two continents. The explanation, I believe, lies in the nature of the climate before the commencement of the Glacial period. At this, the newer Pliocene period, the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now, and we have good reason to believe that the climate was warmer than at the present day. Hence, we may suppose that the organisms which now live under latitude 60 degrees, lived during the Pliocene period further north, under the Polar Circle, in latitude 66-67 degrees; and that the present arctic productions then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. Now, if we look at a terrestrial globe, we see under the Polar Circle that there is almost continuous land from western Europe through Siberia, to eastern America. And this continuity of the circumpolar land, with the consequent freedom under a more favourable climate for intermigration, will account for the supposed uniformity of the sub-arctic and temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch.|$|E
6000|$|I {{made a note}} {{after my}} first stroll at Albano {{to the effect that}} I had been talking of the [...] "picturesque" [...] all my life, but that now for a change I beheld it. I had been looking all winter across the Campagna at the {{free-flowing}} outline of the Alban Mount, with its half-dozen towns shining on its purple side even as vague sun-spots {{in the shadow of a}} cloud, and thinking it simply an agreeable incident in the varied background of Rome. But now that during the last few days I have been treating it as a foreground, have been suffering St. Peter's to play the part of a small mountain on the horizon, with the Campagna swimming mistily through the ambiguous lights and shadows of the interval, I find the interest as great as in the best of the by-play of Rome. The walk I speak of was just out of the village, to the south, toward the neighbouring town of L'Ariccia, neighbouring these twenty years, since the Pope (the late Pope, I was on the point of calling him) threw his superb viaduct across the deep ravine which divides it from Albano. At the risk of seeming to fantasticate I confess that the Pope's having built the viaduct-- in this very recent antiquity--made me linger there in a pensive posture and marvel at the march of history and at Pius the Ninth's beginning already to profit by the sentimental allowances we make to vanished powers. An ardent nero then would have had his own way with me and obtained a frank admission that the Pope was indeed a father to his people. Far down into the charming valley which slopes out of the ancestral woods of the Chigis into the level Campagna winds the steep stone-paved road at the bottom of which, in the good old days, tourists in no great hurry saw the mules and oxen tackled to their carriage for the opposite ascent. And indeed even an impatient tourist might have been content to lounge back in his jolting chaise and look out at the mouldy foundations of the little city plunging into the verdurous flank of the gorge. Questioned, as a cherisher of quaintness, as to the best [...] "bit" [...] hereabouts, I should certainly name the way in which the crumbling black houses of these ponderous villages plant their weary feet on the flowery edges of all the steepest chasms. Before you enter one of them you invariably find yourself lingering outside its pretentious old gateway to see it clutched and stitched to the stony hillside by this rank embroidery of the wildest and bravest things that grow. Just at this moment nothing is prettier than the contrast between their dusky ruggedness and the tender, the yellow and pink and violet fringe of that mantle. All this you may observe from the viaduct at the Ariccia; but you must wander below to feel the full force of the eloquence <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>imaginary</b> papalino. The pillars and arches of pale grey peperino arise in huge tiers with a magnificent spring and solidity. The older Romans built no better; and the work has a deceptive air of being one of their sturdy bequests which help one to drop another sigh over the antecedents the Italians of to-day are so eager to repudiate.

40|$|Theories of {{the good}} and proper self (the {{governmental}} normative subject, be it a reflexive, enterprising, individualising, rational, prosthetic, possessed self) or even the self produced in conditions not of its own making, such as Bourdieu’s habitus, all rely on ideas about self-interest, investment and/or ‘playing the game’. As people are increasingly expected to publicly legitimate themselves as good and worthy subjects and as capital increasingly enters the spaces of intimacy and bio-politics, {{we need to consider}} the limits <b>of</b> <b>our</b> theoretical <b>imaginaries</b> for understanding the value production necessary to the performance of personhood.

5000|$|Two key {{components}} for intimacy are disclosure and partner responsiveness. It {{is extremely important}} that when a speaker discloses personal information their partner also discloses something personally relevant. It is also essential that the listener understand, validate and care about what the speaker is disclosing. If the speaker does not feel accepted by the listener then they may not disclose something {{to them in the}} future, which stops the development of intimacy. Emotional disclosures are also shown to foster intimacy more than factual disclosures. Factual disclosures reveal facts and information about the self (e.g., [...] "I am divorced from my husband.") while emotional disclosures reveal a person's feelings, thoughts and judgments (e.g., [...] "My divorce was so painful it has made it difficult for me to trust a romantic partner again"). Emotional disclosures can increase intimacy because they allow the listener to confirm and support the discloser's self-view. [...] The transition from sharing impersonal to personal facts is crucial to the building of an intimate relationship. One must feel accepted in order to feel comfortable enough to self-disclose. Without acceptance, one partner will withdraw and fail to reveal personal facts within the relationship. Sharing ourselves also brings us out <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>imaginary</b> worlds and allows us to see the realities of the world we live in. We are most comfortable sharing with those whom we like and feel like us. There is also evidence that someone who introduces himself with more intimacy is more likely to facilitate self-disclosure and intimacy with the recipient. Thus, self-disclosure breeds intimacy. [...] This is why we reveal ourselves most and discuss the widest range of topics with our spouses and loved ones.|$|E

This article illustrates {{some of the}} ways in which social networks might function as a major resource of information for social research. These possibilities are illustrated through the case study of groups of people who drive under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Method. This study is based on quantitative and qualitative tools: a short online survey questionnaire made accessible through Facebook, which allows the obtaining of quantitative primary data, and the qualitative analysis of the Facebook Likes (215, 232) of the survey participants (n= 1, 437). Results. The analysis shows that three risk groups (high, medium, low) can be differentiated among participants based on their driving patterns under the influence of alcohol and drugs and on the basis of the life styles, which they reflect through theirFacebookLikes, and of classical structural variables. In particular, the high-risk group exhibits preferences and tastes that are closer to social discontent and resistance, and it is the group with the lowest educational level and the highest rate of casual employment. Conclusions. This research study shows the usefulness of social networks in the socio-demographic and cultural characterisation of risk groups, which must be a preliminary step to the design and dissemination of prevention and awareness-raising campaigns...|$|R

This sounds straightforward, but exactly how we use this data to make quantitative statements about various hypotheses requires a bit more care.

To some extent these two approaches parallel the frequency interpretation and the subjective interpretation of probability. “Classical ” statistical analysis is most closely allied with the frequency interpretation, whereas “Bayesian” analysis is allied with the subjective interpretation. To quantify how the data from a particular experiment (or observation) informs us about the world under the classical approach, we first propose some hypothesis (usually {{referred to as the}} “null ” hypothesis). We then imagine repeating the process of data collection (e. g., repeating an experiment) over and over many times assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

My thesis offers a critical analysis of the technical safety systems that support air travel. It finds fissures in the rationality that underlines our belief in the safety and sustainability of air travel and leaves open the question <b>of</b> whether <b>our</b> confidence in this system can be sustained only by the claim that it is inherently rational. According to anthropologists Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh Star, one of the defining characteristics of technological systems that achieve the cultural status of ‘infrastructure’, is that they ‘become visible upon breakdown’. (Bowker and Star 2000, 335) Two real world events - a commercial airliner’s (Air New Zealand 901) collision with an Antarctic volcano, killing 257 people in 1979 and the closure of European airspace due to the presence of volcanic ash (eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland in 2010) expose the fragility of the infrastructural systems supporting air travel.

40|$|What {{will happen}} to Hong Kong in 1997 ? With time running indifferently short for Hong Kong nowadays, this is a {{question}} being asked increasingly by (because increasingly interesting for) visitors who are at most distantly related to the destiny of the territory. For the majority of us living in Hong Kong —— whose collective identity is not without its own crisis —— the only indisputable historical lesson we learn through the growing but largely predictable tides of the transitional period (1984 - 1997) is, arguably, the uninteresting fact that we, as a people, have been left with little options but to survive the political turmoil and cultural loss we have experienced in the past decade or so. And yet, despite constant invocation <b>of</b> crisis through <b>our</b> <b>imaginary</b> world <b>of</b> signification, everyone passing through Hong Kong in its final transitory stage, whether local or not, Chinese or not, would be amazed by the overall social order and growing cultural vitality one encounters in the non-political domains of its lifeworld during these last colonial days. This common celebration of the status quo has been continuously reinforced by the general political promise (we would all like to draw on) for the Hong Kong 2 ̆ 2 way of life 2 ̆ 2 to prevail in the next fifty years and beyond. Despite an unmistakable tendency of disillusionment and cynicism among the public, such a promise, along with its unholy celebration by many, has long since been assimilated into the symbolic networks of the dominant cultural hegemony.

40|$|Abstract In the {{contemporary}} world of information technology you find a multitude of applications and systems covering {{a broad spectrum of}} areas of need in different companies. One effect of this multitude of programs is the difficulty to make them exchange information with each other or to collaborate, since they are developed by different programming languages for different platforms, with different standards and different data formats. Our aim with this work is to describe how it is possible to tie these programs together to make them actually communicate with each other in order to exchange information, share their native methods and also {{to become a part of}} the overall business processes. In this integration task you will, among other things, find different levels of application integration such as data level, method level, application interface level and user interface level integration. Application integration also involves hardware components, called middleware, that facilitate the physical connection between applications. There is a range of different middleware products offered today on the market. The functionalities of those products varies greatly depending on which technology or technologies they are built around and which vendor they come from. In order to make a connection to a real life situation we have made up a company with a need of integration. By trying to choose a solution for this company we discuss what to integrate, data, methods etc, and the technical solution, middleware product, which might be useful to integrate the different kind <b>of</b> applications in <b>our</b> <b>imaginary</b> company.
