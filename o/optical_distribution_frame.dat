50|$|A passive <b>optical</b> <b>distribution</b> network (PON) uses {{single mode}} optical fibre {{in the outside}} plant, optical {{splitters}} and <b>optical</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frames,</b> duplexed so that both upstream and downstream signals share the same fibre on separate wavelengths. Faster PON standards generally support a higher split ratio of users per PON, but may also use reach extenders/amplifiers where extra coverage is needed. Optical splitters creating a point to multipoint topology are also the same technology regardless {{of the type of}} PON system, making any PON network upgradable by changing the ONT and OLT terminals at each end, with minimal change to the physical network.|$|R
50|$|PON <b>Optical</b> <b>Distribution</b> Networks use {{single mode}} optical fibre {{in the outside}} plant, optical {{splitters}} and <b>optical</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frames,</b> duplexed so that both upstream and downstream share the same fibre on separate wavelengths. 10G-PON is no exception with similar reach to previous standards but supporting a higher split ratio of 128 users per PON, or more using reach extenders/amplifiers. Optical splitters creating a point to multipoint topology are also the same technology as those used by other PON systems. This means any PON network should be upgradable by changing the ONT and OLT terminals at each end, with no change to the fibre itself unless different connectors are chosen.|$|R
50|$|Because each fiber is {{individually}} reinforced, {{the cable}} {{can be easily}} divided into individual fiber lines. Each simplex cable within the outer jacket may be broken out and then continue as a patch cable, for example in a fiber to the desk application in an office building. This enables connector termination without requiring special junctions, and can reduce or {{eliminate the need for}} fiberoptic patch panels or an <b>optical</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frame.</b> Breakout cable requires terminations to be done with simple connectors, which may be preferred for some situations. A more common solution today is the use of a fanout kit that adds a jacket to the very fine strands of other cable types.|$|E
40|$|A G. 652. D {{compliant}} {{single-mode fibre}} {{has been developed}} which has superior macrobending performance compared to legacy fibres in this category. The macrobending performance of this fibre is demonstrated at tighter bending diameters down to 20 mm and shown to exceed the performance of legacy G. 652. D fibre by several times. It is further demonstrated that the tighter fibre bending diameter enabled by the macrobending properties of this fibre is still sufficiently large as to ensure against premature mechanical failure. The fibre is shown to be compatible with legacy G. 652. D fibres in studies of fusion splicing performance. Several applications are suggested {{for the use of}} this fibre type to bring economic value, particularly to the access network. Allowing tighter bends in the optical fibre can enable smaller fibre management hardware such as <b>optical</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> and wall units. Tight buffered patch cords may be designed for installation in more restricted spaces. Improved portability of OTDR injection fibres is enabled...|$|R

50|$|A {{complete}} LMS has {{software and}} hardware components. The latter is usually a switch fabric connected both to all required lines and line equipment at {{either side of a}} line. The functionality is similar to one performed by a Main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> or any other <b>distribution</b> <b>frame,</b> so sometimes is referred to as Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frame.</b> A software component implies implementing management operations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Distribution</b> <b>frames</b> {{may grow}} to {{extremely}} large sizes. In major installations, audio <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> can {{have as many}} as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires (balanced audio signals require two wires plus earth ground for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban exchanges have about 250,000 wires on their MDF. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> or Automated Main <b>Distribution</b> <b>Frames.</b> The principal issues which {{stand in the way of}} their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (MDF or main frame) is {{a signal}} <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> for {{connecting}} equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate <b>distribution</b> <b>frames</b> (IDF) terminate at the MDF. Trunk cables may terminate {{on the same}} MDF or on a separate trunk main <b>distribution</b> <b>frame</b> (TMDF).|$|R

40|$|Cirrus cloud {{inhomogeneity}} {{occurs at}} scales {{greater than the}} cirrus radiative smoothing scale ({approx} 100 m), but less than typical global climate model (GCM) resolutions ({approx} 300 km). Therefore, calculating cirrus radiative impacts in GCMs requires an <b>optical</b> depth <b>distribution</b> parameterization. Radiative transfer calculations are sensitive to <b>optical</b> depth <b>distribution</b> assumptions (Fu et al. 2000; Carlin et al. 2002). Using raman lidar observations, we quantify cirrus timescales and <b>optical</b> depth <b>distributions</b> at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in Lamont, OK (USA). We demonstrate the sensitivity of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) calculations to assumed <b>optical</b> depth <b>distributions</b> and to the temporal resolution of optical depth measurements. Recent work has highlighted the importance of dynamics and nucleation for cirrus evolution (Haag and Karcher 2004; Karcher and Strom 2003).
