5|$|In 2003, {{while the}} Government of Pakistan {{was looking for}} ways to {{increase}} the country's strategic store <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> 90 days, the PMDC put forward a proposal to use the Khewra mines to store strategic oil reserves. Scientific reports confirmed the feasibility of this proposal, but it was turned down.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> stick to the skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands {{on top of the}} stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{initially}} expected {{to move into}} the Gulf of Mexico and affect people recovering from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the previous year, which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed. There were initial fears that Ernesto would make landfall days after Hurricane Katrina's one-year anniversary, and that the levees in New Orleans {{might not be able to}} withstand a strong storm surge. Officials in New Orleans prepared buses and trains in the event that people needed to evacuate but could not. A possible path over the Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as well as tension with Iran, caused the price <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> increase, although the prices receded when the threat of the storm receded.|$|E

In 2013 June, Foreign Minister of India, Mr. Salman Khurshid visited Iraq regarding security and business issues, the first to do so since 1990.|$|R
5|$|While the {{superstructure}} {{and two of}} {{the four}} main gun turrets were removed, the barbette of one of the turrets remains visible above the water. Since her sinking, oil still leaks from the hull, with more than 2.3 quarts (2.18l) escaping into the harbor per day. The Navy, in conjunction with the National Park Service, has recently overseen a comprehensive computerized mapping of the hull, being careful to honor its role as a war grave. The Navy is considering non-intrusive means of abating the continued leakage <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> avoid the further environmental degradation of the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Clandestine {{trade with}} other nations continued, {{initially}} at a reduced level; among other things, Portugal illicitly labelled unsold Rhodesian tobacco as Mozambican product, then sold it on Salisbury's behalf in Europe and Asia. Through this {{and a series of}} similar sanction-busting operations Rhodesia avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson, and, with the help of South Africa and Portugal, gradually became more self-sufficient. Aiming to directly cut off the main supply lines <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> Rhodesia, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, Wilson set up the Beira Patrol, a Royal Navy squadron based in the Mozambique Channel, in March 1966. This blockade was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. Too small to cover both Beira and Lourenço Marques, and unable to legally fire on tankers once they were in Portuguese waters, the patrol met with little success, but it endured regardless for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, Utah left Norfolk for {{sea trials}} to train her engine room crew and {{to test the}} {{radio-control}} equipment. The ship could be controlled at varying rates of speed and changes of course: maneuvers that a ship would conduct in battle. Her electric motors, operated by signals from the controlling ship, opened and closed throttle valves, moved her steering gear, and regulated the supply <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> her boilers. In addition, a Sperry gyro pilot kept the ship on course. She passed her radio control trials on 6 May, and on 1 June, the ship was operated for 3 hours under radio control. On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet. Starting in late July, the ship began her first round of target duty, first for the cruisers of the Pacific Fleet, and then for the battleship Nevada. She continued in this role for the next nine years; she participated in Fleet Problem XVI in May 1935, during which she served as a transport for a contingent of Marines. In June, the ship was modified to train anti-aircraft gunners {{in addition to her}} target ship duties. To perform this task, she was equipped with a new /75 caliber anti-aircraft gun in a quadruple mount for experimental testing and development of the new type of weapon.|$|E

30|$|The C 6 –C 12 LMWHs {{are widely}} used to {{identify}} the source <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> samples, <b>to</b> assess the thermal maturity <b>of</b> <b>oils</b> and condensates, <b>to</b> determine the source allocation <b>of</b> mixed <b>oils,</b> <b>to</b> identify various secondary alterations <b>of</b> crude <b>oils,</b> and <b>to</b> trace the source of petroleum-related contaminants. This study shows that there is significant isotope fractionation during the natural vaporization of the lighter fraction of these hydrocarbons, which means that isotope monitoring using the C 6 –C 9 LMWHs should be used carefully. However, as natural vaporization has little influence on the isotopic compositions of the heavier hydrocarbons {{in a short time}} (i.e. within 72  h), these molecules can provide reliable carbon isotope data better than C 6 –C 9 LMWHs for use in petroleum and environmental science.|$|R

5|$|While {{working on}} an oil rig, Lenny and Homer accidentally set fire to an ant, who in turn sets fire to all her ant companions, who jump in a puddle <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> {{extinguish}} the flames. Their brief sighs of relief are replaced with screams as the whole rig catches fire. Marge goes with Artie along with Carl to West Springfield to save Homer and Lenny. At first, they are reluctant, as Homer still thinks that Marge and Artie are having an affair, and Lenny feels {{that there is nothing}} for him in Artie's helicopter. However, Artie finally admits defeat to Homer, saying that winning Marge's love was something that he could never accomplish, even with his billions, and Homer jumps on the ladder to the helicopter. Carl reveals that he is in the helicopter, and Lenny also jumps on to be saved, just before the rig collapses. Homer and Marge's marriage is also apparently saved when Artie offers a solution to Homer's snoring problem, a device which converts snoring to music. However, Artie's voice is soon heard through the device's speaker, giving Marge anti-Homer subliminal messages and eventually saying that he is watching her through a camera.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1950s, however, Middle Eastern {{countries}} had started contributing significant amounts <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> the international petroleum market, and the United States had implemented oil import quotas.

25|$|On 28 December 2009, the Slovakian {{government}} announced that Russia warned {{it would stop}} oil supplies to Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic over a transit price dispute with Ukraine. However, the next day, Ukraine's Naftohaz issued a statement confirming that Russia agreed to a 30% increase in the transit fees through Ukraine. The alleged rise in the tariff would be from $7.8 to $9.50 (or €6.6) per tonne of oil going through Ukraine in 2010. Additionally, unlike previous payments, new payments would be made in Euros as {{this was one of}} Ukraine's demands. Russia and Ukraine also agreed on the volume <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> be transported through Ukraine. The overall amount <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> be transported to Slovakia, Czech Republic, and Hungary through Ukraine in 2010 will be 15million tonnes—a decrease from 17.1million tonnes in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Orinoco oil sands contain {{extra-heavy}} oil which is easier to produce than Canada's similarly-sized reserves of bitumen, Venezuela's oil production has been declining in recent years because of the country's political and economic problems, while Canada's has been increasing. As a result, Canadian heavy oil and bitumen exports have been backing Venezuelan heavy and extra-heavy oil out of the US market, and Canada's total exports <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>to</b> the US have become several times as great as Venezuela's.|$|E
