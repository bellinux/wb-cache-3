[...] "We're aware that a lot of you are turned off by the political process and that many of you put {{at least some of the}} blame on us," [...] Jennings told viewers <b>on</b> <b>World</b> <b>News</b> <b>Tonight.</b> [...] "We'll only devote time to a candidate's daily routine if it is more than routine.

We also introduce a constraint model to compute the conditional prior of a tree in the multi-branch setting.
