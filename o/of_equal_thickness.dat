25|$|Unlike {{voussoir}} arches, {{which require}} support for each element until the keystone is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made {{a complete and}} self-supporting ring. The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit {{and a range of}} deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable. Because voussoir domes have lateral support, they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an equilateral arch can be thinner still. The optimal shape for a masonry dome <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>thickness</b> is a revolved catenary curve, similar to the curve of a parabola. This shape provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces that masonry is weak against. The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate this optimal shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered the most perfect of forms. Adding a weight {{to the top of the}} pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of Florence Cathedral, changes the optimal shape to perfectly match the actual pointed shape of the dome.|$|E

40|$|Equations {{are derived}} which governed the {{behavior}} of an elastic unsymmetrical doubly-curved sandwich shell. The face sheets may be of unequal thicknesses and of different materials. The equations include the non-linear effects; however, the restriction is made that the radii of curvature of the element are large {{when compared with the}} overall thickness of the sandwich. The variational procedure is used to obtain three equations which govern {{the behavior of}} the shell and to determine the required boundary conditions. These resulting equations can be expressed in terms of a stress function, the radial deflection and a function which includes the contribution of the core. For the symmetrical case where the face sheets are <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and the same materials these equations are shown to reduce to those given by Grigolyuk in 1957.

60|$|We {{have seen}} in the last chapter that the species of a group {{sometimes}} falsely appear to have come in abruptly; and I have attempted to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would have been fatal to my views. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being a gradual increase in number, till the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or later, it gradually decreases. If the number of the species of a genus, or the number of the genera of a family, be represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, crossing the successive geological formations in which the species are found, the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, sometimes keeping for a space <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>thickness,</b> and ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species. This gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly conformable with my theory; as the species of the same genus, and the genera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively; for the process of modification and the production of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradual,--one species giving rise first to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes large.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the stress distribution in the open, cone-shaped, sandwich shell panel. The shell under consideration consists of two load-carrying facings and a core layer of the soft type. The facings are made of an isotropic, compressible, work-hardening material and they are geometrically and physically symmetrical, so they are <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and the same material properties. The core layer resists transverse shear only. The shell under consideration is under combined external load in the form of lateral pressure and a longitudinal force. Different ratios of the longitudinal force to the lateral pressure are taken into account. In each case, the components of the effective stress as well as the effective stress values corresponding to the shell deformation were determined. To determine the stress state which occurs during the shell deformation, the stability equations have to be derived. The effective stress corresponding to the deformations in the shell under consideration can occur within the elastic, elastic-plastic or plastic range. In order to determine the stress distribution in the shell under consideration which corresponds to the on- and post-critical state, the constitutive relations of the Nadai-Hencky deformation theory, alongside the Huber-Mises-Hencky yield condition, are accepted. Analyses show that, in certain cases, there are very large differences between the values of the components of the stress state. In such cases, it seems to be possible to omit the components with small values...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} two {{mechanisms}} of preparation of composite nanoparticles in liquid dispersions {{and their effects}} on size distributions of nanoparticles.

In the second case, analogous to bulking, secondary nanoparticles also settle over the dominant surfaces of internal micro-pores inside the primary particles, and sizes of the resulting composite particles then increase by the same factor. As each of these mechanisms affects the size distribution of nanoparticles in a different way, even a simple comparison of the initial and the final distribution functions can indicate the nature of the modification process.

60|$|I will briefly {{describe}} two of {{the first}} cases observed by me. Six crossed and six self-fertilised seeds of Ipomoea purpurea, from plants treated in the manner above described, were planted {{as soon as they}} had germinated, in pairs on opposite sides of two pots, and rods <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>thickness</b> were given them to twine up. Five of the crossed plants grew from the first more quickly than the opposed self-fertilised plants; the sixth, however, was weakly and was for a time beaten, but at last its sounder constitution prevailed and it shot ahead of its antagonist. As soon as each crossed plant reached the top of its seven- foot rod its fellow was measured, and the result was that, when the crossed plants were seven feet high the self-fertilised had attained the average height of only five feet four and a half inches. The crossed plants flowered a little before, and more profusely than the self-fertilised plants. On opposite sides of another SMALL pot a large number of crossed and self-fertilised seeds were sown, so that they had to struggle for bare existence; a single rod was given to each lot: here again the crossed plants showed from the first their advantage; they never quite reached the summit of the seven-foot rod, but relatively to the self-fertilised plants their average height was as seven feet to five feet two inches. The experiment was repeated during several succeeding generations, treated in exactly the same manner, and with nearly the same result. In the second generation, the crossed plants, which were again crossed, produced 121 seed-capsules, whilst the self-fertilised, again self-fertilised, produced only 84 capsules.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the valley}} of Tia-auru, the commonest rocks are basalts with much olivine, {{and in some cases}} almost {{composed}} of large crystals of augite. I picked up some specimens, with much glassy feldspar, approaching in character to trachyte. There were also many large blocks of vesicular basalt, with the cavities beautifully lined with chabasie (?), and radiating bundles of mesotype. Some of these specimens presented a curious appearance, owing to a number of the vesicles being half filled up with a white, soft, earthy mesotypic mineral, which intumesced under the blowpipe in a remarkable manner. As the upper surfaces in all the half-filled cells are exactly parallel, it is evident that this substance has sunk to the bottom of each cell from its weight. Sometimes, however, it entirely fills the cells. Other cells are either quite filled, or lined, with small crystals, apparently of chabasie; these crystals, also, frequently line the upper half of the cells partly filled with the earthy mineral, as well as the upper surface of this substance itself, in which case the two minerals appear to blend into each other. I have never seen any other amygdaloid with the cells half filled in the manner here described; {{and it is difficult to}} imagine the causes which determined the earthy mineral to sink from its gravity to the bottom of the cells, and the crystalline mineral to adhere in a coating <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> <b>thickness</b> round the sides of the cells.

6000|$|A tendril {{which has}} not become {{attached}} to any body, does not contract spirally; and in course of {{a week or two}} shrinks into the finest thread, withers and drops off. An attached tendril, on the other hand, contracts spirally, and thus becomes highly elastic, so that when the main foot-stalk is pulled the strain is distributed equally between all the attached discs. For {{a few days after the}} attachment of the discs, the tendril remains weak and brittle, but it rapidly increases in thickness and acquires great strength. During the following winter it ceases to live, but adheres firmly in a dead state both to its own stem and to the surface of attachment. In the accompanying diagram (fig. 11.) we see the difference between a tendril (B) some weeks after its attachment to a wall, with one (A) from the same plant fully grown but unattached. That the change in the nature of the tissues, as well as the spiral contraction, are consequent on the formation of the discs, is well shown by any lateral branches which have not become attached; for these in a week or two wither and drop off, in the same manner as does the whole tendril if unattached. The gain in strength and durability in a tendril after its attachment is something wonderful. There are tendrils now adhering to my house which are still strong, and have been exposed to the weather in a dead state for fourteen or fifteen years. One single lateral branchlet of a tendril, estimated to be at least ten years old, was still elastic and supported a weight of exactly two pounds.

40|$|The dynamic {{delamination}} in {{woven glass}} {{fiber reinforced plastic}} (GRP) composite is studied with a 3 D finite deformation an-isotropic viscoplastic model in conjunction with contact/cohesive laws. The large deformation of the material during impact loading is described through an anisotropic plasticity model in total Lagrangian co-ordinates whose coecients are determined experimentally. The interaction between lamina is analyzed through a contact/interface model. The tensile and shear tractions in zero thickness in-terface elements, embedded between lamina, are calculated from interface cohesive law. The interface cohesive law describes the evolution of these tractions in terms of normal and tangential displacement jumps and other interface parameters. The compressive traction at the interface is calculated through the impenetrability condition employed in the contact module. Once the eective dis-placement jump exceeds a specified critical value, the interface elements are assumed to have failed, i. e., delamination {{is said to have}} taken place. Three interface cohesive laws are proposed to describe the delamination process. It is assumed that loading of interface takes place reversibly up to a specified value of the displacement jump followed by irreversible loading beyond this value. This feature represents a partial damage of the interface in the event of unloading. Dynamic delamination in the woven GRP composite is studied through analyses of plate-on-plate impact experiments. The heterogeneity of composite materials leading to wave dispersion and scattering is modeled by considering a layered composition of the GRP plate.
