But besides this, which is only a well-sheltered roadstead, a large saltwater lake adjoins the city. This lagoon, called the Stagno di Cagliari, communicates with the bay by a narrow channel, and appears according to Claudian to have been used in ancient times as an inner harbor or basin. The promontory adjoining the city is evidently that noticed by Ptolemy (...) , but the Caralitanum Promontorium of Pliny can be no other than the headland, now called Capo Carbonara, which forms the eastern boundary of the Gulf of Cagliari and the southeast point of the whole island. Immediately off it lay the little island of Ficaria, now called the Isola dei Cavoli. A Christian community is attested in Cagliari at least as early as the 3rd century, {{and by the end of}} that century the city had a Christian bishop. In the middle decades of the 4th century bishop Lucifer of Cagliari was exiled because of his opposition to the Arian belief. He was banished to the desert of Thebais by the emperor Constantius.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} an <b>opposing</b> <b>wind</b> on the {{stratification}} and flow {{produced by a}} buoyant plume rising from a heat source {{on the floor of}} a ventilated enclosure is investigated. Ventilation openings located at high level on the windward side of the enclosure and at low level on the leeward side allow a wind-driven flow from high to low level, oppo-site to the buoyancy-driven flow. One of two stable steady flow regimes is established depending on a dimensionless parameter F that characterizes the relative magnitudes of the wind-driven and buoyancy-driven velocities within the enclosure, and on the time history of the flow. A third, unstable steady flow solution is identified. For small opposing winds (small F) a steady, two-layer stratification and displacement ventilation is established. Exterior fluid enters through the lower leeward openings and buoyant interior fluid leaves through the upper windward openings. As the wind speed in-creases, the <b>opposing</b> <b>wind</b> may cause a reversal in the flow direction. In this case, cool exterior fluid enters through the high windward openings and mixes the interior fluid, which exits through the leeward openings. There are now two possibilities.

40|$|AbstractA {{flexible}} {{open source}} based CFD method is developed {{in order to}} directly {{study the effects of}} the wave movement on the wind field in a neutral stratified atmosphere. Sea surface waves modify the wind field in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) in different ways. Long periodic waves (swell) resemble a sinusoidal wave. The flow responses over this sinusoidal wave are studied in detail by the use of a moving grid approach. Waves aligned with the <b>wind</b> and <b>opposed</b> the <b>wind</b> are studied. Simulations show that a fast moving swell aligned with the wind will speed up the wind in the lowest meters of the MABL, whereas a fast moving swell <b>opposed</b> to the <b>wind</b> field will reduce and even revert the wind speed in the lowest meters. Swell <b>opposing</b> the <b>wind</b> field will also generate more turbulence in the lowest meters of the MABL than when waves and wind are aligned with each other.

40|$|The {{results of}} a {{laboratory}} study of the response of waves to an <b>opposing</b> <b>wind</b> are presented. The {{study was conducted in}} a special purpose wind-wave flume which allowed mechanically generated waves to propagate in opposition to wind. The mechanically generated waves were created by a wedge wave maker for which an extensive set of measurements were performed to determine its transfer function. A wave follower which could hold pressure and velocity probes a fixed distance above the moving water surface was designed and constructed. Extensive evaluation experiments indicated that the wave follower tracked the water surface with little error in the frequency range of interest. The transfer functions of all intermediate devices in the pressure and velocity recording systems were determined and subsequently used to correct all pressure and velocity records. Measurements of the wave induced pressure at various heights above the waves-indicated that the pressure and water surface were 180 º out of phase, consistent with the predictions of potential flow theory. Such a result indicates that there is no air-water energy flux due to normal stresses. Measurements of the velocity field above the waves indicated that the Reynolds stress term -p ǖǖ can cause waves to decay in an <b>opposing</b> <b>wind.</b> The magnitude of the decay is proportional to the wave slope squared and the term (1 - U ∞/C) squared. Hence, high frequency waves will decay far more rapidly than low frequency waves. Typical results indicate that low frequency ocean swell is almost uneffected by opposing winds whereas high frequency wind waves will be attenuated very rapidly...|$|E

40|$|A scaling {{analysis}} is conducted {{to explore the}} dependence of sea-breeze speed and inland occurrence {{in the presence of}} opposing winds on a set of dynamical parameters. The overall aim of the {{analysis is}} to develop an index for sea-breeze occurrence in the face of opposing winds, similar to the Biggs and Graves lake-breeze index. Most studies separate sea-breeze speed and sea-breeze inland occurrence or, at best, link the two in linear analyses. This work analyzes the output of a nonlinear numerical mesoscale model (in idealized simulations) using scaling methods commonly applied in observational studies. It is found that the scaled sea-breeze speed, in response to increasing magnitude of <b>opposing</b> <b>wind,</b> shows two distinct phases: a phase of increasing speed while the sea breeze progresses inland and a phase of sharply decreasing speed when the sea breeze is no longer detected inland. The analysis also allows the development of an index for sea-breeze inland occurrence. This index is an improvement over existing analyses through the use of nonlinear scaling and the use of surface heat flux as opposed to simpler land-sea temperature contrasts...|$|E

A two-way simulation approach is used in the simulation to consider the effect of different initial conditions. The simulation results are compared with previous macroscopic analysis in Gong and Li (2008), and they fit well with macroscopic analysis. A hysteresis phenomenon is found during the process of simulation, streamlines and isotherm contours for both the buoyancy-dominated flow and the wind-dominated flow under the same wind speed and fire power are then given to validate the existence of multiple solutions of smoke flow. The effect of multiple solutions of smoke flow on the smoke control is finally discussed in realistic situations.

During a field campaign in early 2005, three ADCPs were deployed near the coast to measure the wave field, in addition, an air-sea interaction spar (ASIS) buoy was in operation for about two months to measure the momentum flux between the ocean and the atmosphere and also the wave field. Several images of ENVISAT ASAR (SLC type) were acquired during the in-situ measurement period and a comparison of directional spectra evolution is performed. Typical shape of swell spectra obtained from both, in-situ and remote measurements show very good agreement. Through further analysis, directional spreading variations of swell are studied, in particular under very characteristic conditions with <b>opposing</b> <b>wind.</b> Swell is practically azimuth traveling most of the time, nevertheless azimuth smearing and non-linear imaging effects are minimal since it is rather long wavelength.
