40|$|DNA {{damage and}} {{cellular}} repair capacity were studied in 18 male fuel tanker drivers and 13 male filling-station attendants exposed {{to low and}} very low concentrations of benzene, respectively, and compared to 20 males with no <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> (<b>controls).</b> Exposure to airborne benzene was measured using passive personal samplers, and internal doses were assayed through the biomarkers t,t-muconic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid and urinary benzene. DNA damage was evaluated using tail intensity (TI) determined by the comet assay in peripheral lymphocytes. Urinary 7 -hydro- 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 -oxodG) was measured as a biomarker of oxidative damage. DNA repair kinetics were assessed using the comet assay in lymphocytes sampled 20 and 60 min post H 2 O 2 exposure. Benzene exposure differed significantly between the drivers (median 246. 3 µg/m(3)), attendants (median 13. 8 µg/m(3)), and controls (median 4. 1 µg/m(3)). There were no differences in TI and 8 -oxodG among the three groups, or between smokers and non-smokers. DNA repair kinetics were similar among the drivers, attendants and controls, although the comet assay on H 2 O 2 -damaged lymphocytes after 60 min revealed significantly lower levels of TI only in drivers. The DNA repair process in smokers {{was similar to that}} observed in drivers. In conclusion, this study found no relationship between low levels of benzene exposure and DNA damage, although there was evidence that exposure interferes with DNA repair kinetics. The biological impact of this finding on the onset of genotoxic effects in exposed workers has still to be ascertained. Environ. Mol. Mutagen., 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Solvents {{represent}} an important group of environmental pollutants {{to which people}} are exposed daily in the workplace. The physico chemical properties of solvents may result in disturbances to cellular structures, including damage to DNA. However, the effects of mixtures of solvents are not well known. Mutations caused by environmental agents are related to cancer development and other degenerative diseases. The work in a research laboratory that uses several types of solvents is equally predisposed to these hazards. In this study, we evaluated the mutagenicity of urine from 29 subjects exposed occupationally to solvents in a chemistry research laboratory and 29 subjects without <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> (<b>controls).</b> Urine samples were collected in polyethylene containers {{at the end of}} the work shift. For the concentration and extraction of urine samples the XAD- 2 resin was used with acetone as an eluting agent. Several strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 100, TA 98, TA 97 a, TA 1535, YG 1024) should be used to assess mutagenic susceptibilities among workers exposed to organic solvents. Different doses of extract (1. 5; 3. 0; 6. 0 and 12. 0 m/ equivalents of urine per plate) were tested on S. typhimurium strains TA 100 and YG 1024, with and without metabolic activation. The mutagenic activity, measured in Salmonella typhimurium YGI 1024 with S 9 mix, was significantly greater in urine from workers than from controls (p <= 0. 05).

The development of science-based hazard and risk categories for nanomaterials is needed for decision-making about <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> practices in the workplace.

This study aimed to investigate the occupational hearing loss among Chinese MSWL workers. A cross-sectional study of 247 workers from 4 Chinese MSWLs was conducted. Noise and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) levels at worksites were determined. We conducted hearing examinations to determine hearing thresholds. A worker was identified as having hearing loss if the mean threshold at 2000, 3000 and 4000 Hz in either ear was equal to or greater than 25 dB. Prevalence of occupational hearing loss was then evaluated. Using unconditional Logistic regression models, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of MSWL work associated with hearing loss. According to the job title for each worker, the study subjects were divided into 3 groups, including group 1 of 63 workers without MSWL <b>occupational</b> hazards <b>exposure</b> (<b>control</b> group), group 2 of 84 workers with a few or short-period MSWL <b>occupational</b> hazards <b>exposure,</b> and group 3 of 100 workers with continuous MSWL <b>occupational</b> hazards <b>exposure.</b> Both noise and TVOCs levels were significantly higher at worksites for group 3.

This {{project was}} {{developed}} in the Strategic Business Unit of Aggregates of Constructora MECO, specifically in the crushing plants in Guápiles. The research was carried out in the maintenance workshop and in the primary and secondary stone crushing areas, where daytime workers are exposed to thermal stress. There is a maximum of fifteen workers in these areas. The discomfort expressed by the workers regarding the thermo-hygrometric conditions present in their work areas have remained constant for several years, and have resulted in employees’ failure to comply with the company's safety regulations due to the feelings of suffocation experienced. Similarly, the work performance is affected when the environmental temperature increases and workers start showing symptoms of fatigue. The main risk factors of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to heat in these work areas are the climatic conditions of the Atlantic Zone (tropical rainy climate), the postural load, and the metabolic rate of the worker when performing his tasks. The methodology used in this paper includes data collection instruments such as surveys and interviews, in addition to direct-reading measurement tools such as weighing scales, stopwatches, oximeters, TGBH meter and anemometers. The data obtained was analyzed and interpreted using methods, international standards and programs to evaluate <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to heat. The staff exhibited symptoms of exposure to thermal stress, such as fatigue and muscle pain, which may be influenced by dehydration and increased internal body temperature.

The adjusted OR of bladder cancer was 5. 75 (95 %CI 2. 09 - 15. 83) comparing the highest tertile of the cumulative probability of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to aromatic amines with no <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure.</b> A possible interaction between <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to aromatic amines and smoking was found. The increased ORs of GSTM 1, GSTT 1, NAT 2 and SULT 1 A 1 among those ever occupational exposed was explored by estimating the false-positive report probability. We confirm that <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to aromatic amines is associated {{with an increase in}} bladder cancer risk. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The {{proposed}} NIOSH <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding process guides a user {{through the}} evaluation and selection of critical health hazard information to select an OEB from among five categories of severity. For OEBs, the process uses only hazard-based data (e.g., studies {{on human health}} effects or toxicology studies) to identify an overall level of hazard potential and associated airborne concentration range for chemicals with similar hazard profiles. While the output of this process {{can be used by}} informed occupational safety and health professionals to make risk management and <b>exposure</b> <b>control</b> decisions, the process does not supply such recommendations directly.|$|R

40|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to {{carcinogens}} contributes {{greatly to}} the etiology of sinonasal cancer (SNC), but the role of different risk factors in determining different histological subtypes is disputed. All consecutive surgical epithelial SNC cases (case-series study) underwent a systematic occupational medicine examination to determine previous exposure {{to a wide range}} of work-related chemical hazards. We investigated 65 SNC cases including intestinal-type adenocarcinoma [ITAC] squamous-cell carcinoma [SCC], and others. <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> was recognized for 39 cases. <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> were sensibly more frequent among ITAC than among SCC or other histotypes. <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> in ITAC cases was to leather or wood dust only, while among non-ITAC cases, we recognised exposure to formaldehyde, solvents and metal fumes. A high proportion of SNC with <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> originated in the ethmoidal epithelium. In our case-series of SNC, a very high frequency of previous <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to carcinogens was detected, suggesting that occupational hazards may be associated to the aetiopathogenesis, primarily for ITAC, but also for other histotypes. Besides leather or wood, other chemical agents must be recognized as occupational risk factors...|$|R
