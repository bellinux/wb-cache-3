5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most <b>often</b> <b>that</b> of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
5|$|Chaitanya Krishna {{confirmed}} his {{inclusion in the}} cast {{by the end of}} March 2014. In late April 2014, Naresh was chosen {{to play an important role}} in the film, which he later described as one of the best roles of his career. Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not feel that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding that it is not <b>often</b> <b>that</b> a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Boone {{spent his}} early years on {{what was then the}} edge of the frontier. Several Lenape Indian villages were nearby. The pacifist Pennsylvania Quakers had good {{relations}} with the Native Americans, but the steady growth of the white population compelled many Indians to move further west. Boone was given his first rifle at the age of 12. He learned to hunt from both local settlers and the Lenape. Folk tales have often emphasized Boone's skills as a hunter. In one story, the young Boone was hunting in the woods with some other boys, when the howl of a panther scattered all but Boone. He calmly cocked his rifle and shot the predator through the heart just as it leaped at him. The validity of this claim is contested, but the story was told so <b>often</b> <b>that</b> it became part of his popular image.|$|E

40|$|Much {{has been}} written about the need to modify psychotherapeutic {{techniques}} to suit the cultural context of the Indian patient. Even the most ardent advocates of the need to make psychotherapy culturally relevant, <b>often</b> forget <b>that</b> similar modifications may also be necessary in the pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders. We <b>often</b> assume <b>that</b> a drug which is effective in one group of patients should be effective in the same way in patients elsewhere also. But clinical experience <b>often</b> shows <b>that</b> cultural factors influence compliance with response to drugs. It is <b>often</b> suggested <b>that</b> the main reason lor patients not following the drug prescriptions of doctors in developing countries like India, i...|$|R

5|$|The {{following}} year, the Box Office Attractions {{name was}} replaced with the newly incorporated Fox Film Corporation. Edwards remained one of the studio's most important directors and one of William Fox's closest advisers. He became known for his epic filmmaking and for a permissive approach to directing his starring cast, an attitude that led Bara's biographer to compare him to Alfred Hitchcock. <b>Often,</b> <b>that</b> cast included Bara, whose films with him include Under Two Flags (1916), the epic historical drama Cleopatra (1917), and A Woman There Was (1919).|$|E

25|$|Hack further {{reported}} that, {{during the}} 1940s and 1950s, Hoover attended social events with Lela Rogers, the divorced mother of dancer and actress Ginger Rogers, so <b>often</b> <b>that</b> {{many of their}} mutual friends assumed the pair would eventually marry.|$|E

50|$|Sabra readily {{admits that}} {{cultural}} bias and transgressions can make transition to Islam difficult. She has <b>often</b> remarked <b>that</b> {{culture is a}} transgressive philosophy <b>that</b> <b>often</b> breaks the rules of traditional Islam and Islamic values.|$|R
50|$|Russian media <b>often</b> claims <b>that</b> {{western media}} is biased.|$|R
25|$|Nonviolence advocates {{see some}} truth in this argument: Gandhi himself said <b>often</b> <b>that</b> he could teach nonviolence to a violent person {{but not to}} a coward and that true nonviolence came from renouncing violence, not by not having any to renounce.|$|E
25|$|The plot of many dance dramas are <b>often</b> <b>that</b> {{of a male}} {{character}} who rescues a damsel in distress or of destined love presented with obstacles. The traditional repertoire portrays mythology, traditional tales and may sometimes include religious concepts such as karma.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualification}} of Einsatzleiter Rettungsdienst and Organisatorischer Leiter (EMS/incident commander) {{is closely}} related to mass casualties and will be responsible for organizing staging, triage, treatment and transport as well as communication. <b>Often</b> <b>that</b> is a part-time position for paramedics beside their usual shifts.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Freddie Mercury, George assumed the name of Barry Bulsara (Mercury's real surname) and {{claimed to be the}} singer's cousin. He would visit Mercury's home and {{approach}} female fans; this happened so <b>often</b> <b>that</b> the Queen International Fan Club called the police to report George.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} North Carolina owns the North Carolina Railroad Company, {{which owns the}} land and the bridge. (North Carolina Railroad owns no rolling stock, but leases tracks to Amtrak and Norfolk Southern Railway.) A heavy steel crash beam protects the bridge from over-height trucks, but does nothing to prevent crashes or protect the trucks. The crash beam has been hit so <b>often</b> <b>that</b> it has had to be {{replaced}} at least once.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason that}} churches were so {{segregated}} within the United States {{was that there}} was little push from African American church leaders to have integrated churches. It was <b>often</b> <b>that</b> White religious leaders pushed for integrated churches, while African American leaders preferred separate congregations. This may be in part due to several factors, including the lack of opportunity to pursue leadership roles in predominantly White or segregated churches, the fact that African American churches allowed a place to build community, and for interests in practicing Christianity differently.|$|E

25|$|Cutting a leg-break {{is always}} dangerous, and cutting Wright {{is a form}} of suicide. Why a bowler of his skill failed to get more test-match wickets always mystified me; there was of course the marked {{tendency}} to bowl no-balls, but he sent down so many good ones, and worried and beat the batsmen so <b>often,</b> <b>that</b> he should have had better results...he seemed always likely to get wickets. It is one of the toughest problems of captaincy to know when to remove a man like that from the firing -line.|$|E
25|$|Where births are {{required}} to be officially registered, the name entered onto a births register or birth certificate may by that fact alone become a legal name. The assumption in the Western world is <b>often</b> <b>that</b> the name from birth, or perhaps from baptism or bris, persists to adulthood in {{the normal course of}} affairs. Some possible changes concern middle names, uses of diminutive forms, adoption, choice of surname as parents divorce or were not married. Matters are very different in some cultures, where a name at birth is only a childhood name rather than the default choice for later life.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the Saudi {{government}} began to slowly step up a public education campaign about AIDS-HIV. It started to recognize World AIDS Day, and the Arabic and English daily newspapers {{were permitted to}} run articles and opinions that expressed {{the need for more}} education about the disease and more compassion for those people infected. The number of people living in the kingdom who were infected was a closely guarded secret, as the official policy was <b>often</b> <b>that</b> the disease was not a serious problem in a kingdom because Saudis followed the principles of traditional Islamic morality.|$|E

25|$|Tocqueville {{explicitly}} cites inequality {{as being}} incentive for poor to become rich, and notes {{that it is}} not <b>often</b> <b>that</b> two generations within a family maintain success, and that it is inheritance laws that split and eventually break apart someone's estate that cause a constant cycle of churn between the poor and rich, thereby over generations making the poor rich and rich poor. He cites protective laws in France at the time that protected an estate from being split apart among heirs, thereby preserving wealth and preventing a churn of wealth such as was perceived by him in 1835 within the United States of America.|$|E
25|$|Wilmot Hudson Fysh {{was born}} in the city of Launceston in Tasmania, Australia, on 7 January 1895. His father, Frederick Wilmot Fysh, was a merchant, while his mother, Mary (née Reed), was the {{daughter}} of a famous landowner, Henry Reed. Fysh was the oldest of five siblings; Hudson, Henry, Margaret, Mary and Graham. He was also the great-nephew of Sir Philip Fysh. His childhood was marred by the failure of his parents' marriage and his father's business. Originally staying with his father, he ran away so <b>often</b> <b>that</b> eventually he was able to stay with his mother. Living in St Leonardsa suburb of Launcestonuntil 1914, he enlisted in the Light Horse upon the start of World War I.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} of Lear in the 19th century was <b>often</b> <b>that</b> of a frail old {{man from the}} opening scene, but Lears of the 20th century often began the play as strong men displaying regal authority, including John Gielgud, Donald Wolfit and Donald Sinden. Cordelia, also, evolved in the 20th century: earlier Cordelias had often been praised for being sweet, innocent and modest, but 20th-century Cordelias were often portrayed as war leaders. For example, Peggy Ashcroft, at the RST in 1950, played the role in a breastplate and carrying a sword. Similarly, the Fool evolved {{through the course of}} the century, with portrayals often deriving from the music hall or circus tradition.|$|E
