5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} a major {{contributor}} to female mortality in India. Indians account for 60% of the world's heart disease burden, despite accounting for less than 20% of the world's population. Indian women have a particular high mortality from cardiac disease and NGOs such as the Indian Heart Association have been raising awareness about this issue. Women have higher mortality rates relating to cardiovascular disease than men in India because of differential access to health care between the sexes. One reason for the differing rates of access stems from social and cultural norms that prevent women from accessing appropriate care. For example, it was found that among patients with congenital heart disease, women {{were less likely to be}} operated <b>on</b> <b>than</b> men because families felt that the scarring from surgery would make the women less marriageable.|$|E
25|$|To {{automate}} these logical deductions, the bombe {{took the}} form of an electrical circuit. Current flowed around the circuit near-instantaneously, and represented all the possible logical deductions which could be made at that position. To form this circuit, the bombe used several sets of Enigma rotor stacks wired up together according to the instructions given on a menu, derived from a crib. Because each Enigma machine had 26 inputs and outputs, the replica Enigma stacks are connected to each other using 26-way cables. In addition, each Enigma stack rotor setting is offset a number of places as determined by its position in the crib; for example, an Enigma stack corresponding to the fifth letter in the crib would be four places further <b>on</b> <b>than</b> that corresponding to the first letter.|$|E

40|$|My {{hypothesis}} is that the key position of most of Elias’ works is: sublimating resentment. In order to sustain this hypothesis, I develop five key intellectual positions which both define his intellectual style and account for such a sublimation of resentment: the stress <b>on</b> interdependence rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> domination; <b>on</b> relations rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> substance; <b>on</b> contexts rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> general entities; and on analytical description rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> value judgment.

25|$|A subtle twist {{at the end}} of {{the novel}} can reveal that a lot more was going <b>on</b> <b>than</b> the reader {{initially}} suspected. For example, Cat Shannon, the central figure of The Dogs of War, turns out to have had his own agenda all the time. Adam Munro of The Devil's Alternative finds out that he was not a player but a pawn to people in high places. In The Odessa File, the reporter's true motivation is revealed at the end. A number of events in Icon turn out to have been committed by people other than those who the reader had been led to suppose. In Avenger, one of the events that allows the Avenger to escape is unexplained until the last few paragraphs of the book.|$|E
25|$|Once in Harlem, a news {{broadcast}} about {{the bombing of}} the convent causes the group to realize there is more going <b>on</b> <b>than</b> they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin.|$|E
25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in the special education classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher <b>on</b> <b>than</b> their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
