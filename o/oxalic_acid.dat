5|$|The kidney {{toxicity}} of ethylene glycol occurs 24 to 72 hours post ingestion and {{is caused by}} a direct cytotoxic effect of glycolic acid. The glycolic acid is then metabolized to glyoxylic acid and finally to <b>oxalic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Oxalic</b> <b>acid</b> binds with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals which may deposit and cause damage to many areas of the body including the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs. The most significant effect is accumulation of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys which causes kidney damage leading to oliguric or anuric acute kidney failure. The rate-limiting step in this cascade is the conversion of glycolic to glyoxylic acid. Accumulation of glycolic acid in the body is mainly responsible for toxicity.|$|E

5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, amylase, etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, <b>oxalic</b> <b>acid,</b> and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Relatively strong {{reducing}} acids {{can have}} antinutrient effects by binding to dietary minerals such as iron and zinc in the gastrointestinal tract and {{preventing them from}} being absorbed. Notable examples are <b>oxalic</b> <b>acid,</b> tannins and phytic acid, which are high in plant-based diets. Calcium and iron deficiencies are not uncommon in diets in developing countries where less meat is eaten and there is high consumption of phytic acid from beans and unleavened whole grain bread.|$|E

The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the ability to perform this test.|$|E
50|$|According to W. A. Shenstone, {{two classes}} of aloins are recognized: (1) nataloins, which yield picric and <b>oxalic</b> <b>acids</b> with nitric acid, and do not give a red {{coloration}} with nitric acid; and (2) barbaloins, which yield aloetic acid (C7H2N3O5), chrysammic acid (C7H2N2O6), picric and <b>oxalic</b> <b>acids</b> with nitric acid, being reddened by the acid. This second group may be divided into a-barbaloins, obtained from Barbados Aloe, and reddened in the cold, and b-barbaloins, obtained from Aloe Socotrina and Zanzibar Aloe, reddened by ordinary nitric acid only when warmed or by fuming acid in the cold. Nataloin (2C17H13O7·H2O) forms bright-yellow scales, barbaloin (C17H18O7) prismatic crystals. Aloe species also contain a trace of volatile oil, to which their odour is due.|$|R

In contrast, other studies have shown that fruit bodies collected from pine plantations are relatively free of larvae.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored in pink by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as <b>oxalic</b> <b>acid,</b> citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E

The process of acidolysis is associated with the chemolithotrophic bacteria like nitric and sulfuric acid producing bacteria. Apart from this, the release of carbon dioxide produced during cellular respiration by lichens and mosses is also a potent corrosive agent[24, 78].

Seven carboxylic acids in the rainwater of Guiyang and Shangzhong were simultaneously determined by ion chromatography from April 2006 to April 2007.

In Shangzhong it is witnessed that the concentrations of these acids were higher in the summer than in the winter and direct emissions from vegetations or soils may account for the main provenance of the acids.

5|$|Fomepizole is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of alcohol dehydrogenase; similar to ethanol, it acts to block {{the formation of the}} toxic metabolites. Fomepizole {{has been shown to be}} highly effective as an antidote for ethylene glycol poisoning. It is the only antidote approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Both antidotes have advantages and disadvantages. Ethanol is readily available in most hospitals, is inexpensive, and can be administered orally as well as intravenously. Its adverse effects include intoxication, hypoglycemia in children, and possible liver toxicity. Patients receiving ethanol therapy also require frequent blood ethanol concentration measurements and dosage adjustments to maintain a therapeutic ethanol concentration. Patients therefore must be monitored in an intensive care unit. Alternatively, the adverse side effects of fomepizole are minimal and the approved dosing regimen maintains therapeutic concentrations without the need to monitor blood concentrations of the drug. The disadvantage of fomepizole is that it is expensive. Costing US$1,000 per gram, an average course used in an adult poisoning would cost approximately $3,500 to $4,000. Despite the cost, fomepizole is gradually replacing ethanol as the antidote of choice in ethylene glycol poisoning. Adjunct agents including thiamine and pyridoxine are often given, because they may help prevent the formation of <b>oxalic</b> <b>acid.</b> The use of these agents is based on theoretical observations and there is limited evidence to support their use in treatment; they may be of particular benefit in people who could be deficient in these vitamins such as malnourished or alcoholic patients.|$|E

40|$|Titratable acidity and pH are {{important}} chemical traits for the organoleptic quality of banana since theyare related to the perception of sourness and sweetness. Banana fruit has the particularity of havingseparate growth and ripening stages, during which pulp acidity changes. A modeling approach was used tounderstand the mechanisms involved in changes in acidity during pulp growth and post harvest ripening. Changes in pH and titratable acidity were modeled by solving a set of equations representing acid/basereactions. The models were built using data from growth and post harvest ripening of three dessertbanana cultivars with contrasting acidity. For each model, calculated values were compared to observedvalues. These models allowed the prediction of pH (R 2 = 0. 34; RMSE = 0. 75, biais = 0. 05) and of titratableacidity (R 2 = 0. 81, RMSE = 2. 05, biais = ? 1. 44) during fruit growth and post harvest ripening.
