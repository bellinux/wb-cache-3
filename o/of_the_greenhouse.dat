50|$|After the {{pumping station}} at the shore was {{finished}} in 1838 Persius designed and built up-to-date greenhouses and an orangery in 1839. The buildings were erected to <b>the</b> west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coach house at <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pleasure ground where three little <b>greenhouses</b> stood previously. <b>The</b> arcade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orangery referred to the adjacent coach house. <b>The</b> <b>greenhouses,</b> flanked by little water towers, were aligned to the south at the southern gable end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orangery. Figs, peaches, pineapple, prunes and strawberries were grown in <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses.</b> <b>The</b> area in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> was used for extensive seedbeds. Orangery and one part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> were demolished in 1940 and reconstructed in 1981.|$|R
25|$|In {{a future}} full {{hydrogen}} economy, primary energy sources and feedstock {{would be used}} to produce hydrogen gas as stored energy for use in various sectors of the economy. Producing hydrogen from primary energy sources other than coal, oil, and natural gas, would result in lower production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gases characteristic of the combustion of these fossil energy resources.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{industry}} {{is responsible for}} about 11 percent of greenhouse gases emitted by the U.S. transportation sector. Aviation's share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gas emissions is poised to grow, as air travel increases and ground vehicles use more alternative fuels like ethanol and biodiesel. Boeing estimates that biofuels could reduce flight-related greenhouse-gas emissions by 60 to 80 percent. The solution blends algae fuels with existing jet fuel.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strongest}} {{predictions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect is that the stratosphere will cool. Although this cooling has been observed, it is not trivial to separate the effects {{of changes in the}} concentration of greenhouse gases and ozone depletion since both will lead to cooling. However, this can be done by numerical stratospheric modeling. Results from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory show that above , the greenhouse gases dominate the cooling.|$|E

25|$|In May 2001, an Ipsos {{poll found}} that nearly 70% of the {{population}} had a 'good opinion' of nuclear power, however 56% also preferred not to live near a nuclear plant and the same proportion thought that a 'Chernobyl-like accident' could occur in France. The same Ipsos poll revealed that 50% thought that nuclear power {{was the best way}} of solving the problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect, while 88% thought this was a major reason for continuing to use nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|Burning all {{fossil fuels}} would {{adversely}} affect {{the ability of}} humans {{to live on the}} planet. If non-CO2 greenhouse gases such as N2O and methane (CH4) were to increase with global warming {{at the same rate as}} in the palaeoclimate record and atmospheric chemistry simulations they would provide approximately 25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> forcing. The remaining forcing requires approximately 4.8 times current CO2 levels, corresponding to fossil fuel emissions as much as approximately 10,000 Gt C for a conservative assumption of a CO2 airborne fraction averaging one-third over the 1000 years following a peak emission.|$|E
25|$|The Arctic {{region is}} one of the many natural sources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gas methane. Global warming accelerates its release, due to both release of methane from {{existing}} stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass. Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as undersea clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming. Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden required <b>the</b> destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old {{botanical gardens}} which had formal layouts and several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses.</b> Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plants {{were incorporated into}} the new gardens, while others were sent to other Royal gardens and the new Botanical Gardens in Paris.|$|R

25|$|It is not {{possible}} to state that a certain gas causes an exact percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> effect. This is because some of the gases absorb and emit radiation at the same frequencies as others, so that the total greenhouse effect is not simply the sum of the influence of each gas. The higher ends of the ranges quoted are for each gas alone; the lower ends account for overlaps with the other gases. In addition, some gases such as methane are known to have large indirect effects that are still being quantified.|$|E
25|$|A related {{issue is}} the methane {{clathrate}} reservoirs found under sediments on the ocean floors. These trap large amounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gas methane, which ocean warming {{has the potential to}} release. In 2004 the global inventory of ocean methane clathrates was estimated to occupy between one and five million cubic kilometres. If all these clathrates were to be spread uniformly across the ocean floor, this would translate to a thickness between three and fourteen metres. This estimate corresponds to 500–2500 gigatonnes carbon (GtC), and can be compared with the 5000 GtC estimated for all other fossil fuel reserves.|$|E
25|$|A study {{confirmed}} that bats, {{when they are}} able to see, prefer to use their vision over echolocation. In the experiment, these bats were put in a mesh greenhouse and observed at dawn, day, dusk, and at night. The bats consistently ran into the ceiling and walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> at dawn, day, and dusk while trying to fly out, but at night when they were forced to rely solely on the echolocation, they avoided the ceiling and walls without a problem. The pulses emitted by the bat are all audible to humans, and the bat only emits pulses through the mouth.|$|E

25|$|Kew's {{third major}} conservatory, the Princess of Wales Conservatory, {{designed}} by architect Gordon Wilson, was opened in 1987 by Diana, Princess of Wales in commemoration of her predecessor Augusta's associations with Kew. In 1989 the conservatory received the Europa Nostra award for conservation. The conservatory houses ten computer-controlled micro-climatic zones, with the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> volume composed of Dry Tropics and Wet Tropics plants. Significant numbers of orchids, water lilies, cacti, lithops, carnivorous plants and bromeliads {{are housed in}} the various zones. The cactus collection also extends outside the conservatory where some hardier species can be found.|$|E
25|$|Necessity. Corporate tree-planting {{is not a}} new idea; farming {{operations}} have been used by companies making paper from trees for a long time. If farmed trees are replanted, and the products made from them are placed into landfills rather than recycled, a very safe, efficient, economical and time-proven method of geological sequestration of greenhouse carbon {{is the result of the}} paper product use cycle. This only holds if the paper in the land fill is not decomposted. In most landfills, this is the case and leads to the fact that more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gas emissions from the life cycle of paper products occur from landfill methane emissions.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{hydroelectricity}} {{is relatively}} low, {{making it a}} competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour. Hydro is also a flexible source of electricity since plants can be ramped up and down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. However, damming interrupts the flow of rivers and can harm local ecosystems, and building large dams and reservoirs often involves displacing people and wildlife. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouse</b> gas carbon dioxide than fossil fuel powered energy plants.|$|E

50|$|Gouda was a {{separate}} refugee camp. In Gouda, refugees were first housed in private homes, but at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> October 1914 they were concentrated in vacant <b>greenhouses</b> at <b>the</b> Steensma nursery. As <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> offered insufficient comfort {{for so many}} people, a temporary village was built on <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses,</b> including a church, a school and a hospital. Behind <b>the</b> <b>greenhouses</b> was a village of 64 wooden houses in which approximately 350 people were accommodated.
