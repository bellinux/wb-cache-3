Writing {{with regard to the}} charge by Jeffrey Goldberg that Atzmon is anti-semitic, and by {{implication}} so is his own positive review of Atzmon's work, Mearsheimer responded: [...] "Atzmon's basic point is that Jews often talk in universalistic terms, but many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> and act in particularistic terms. One might say they talk like liberals but act like nationalists... It is in this context that he discusses what he calls the [...] "Holocaust religion," [...] Zionism, and Israel's treatment of the Palestinians. Again, to be perfectly clear, he has no animus toward Judaism as a religion or with individuals who are Jewish by birth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commentator Michelle Malkin {{posted on}} her web site, [...] "IRS {{employment}} application packets notify potential workers that the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration vets all candidates and current employees 'who have violated or are violating laws, rules, or regulations {{related to the}} performance of their duties.' President-elect Obama is standing by a nominee who would oversee the IRS, but might not even qualify for a lesser job at the agency." [...] Former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, who also opposes his nomination said, [...] "The IRS did not fine him. Ask small businesses how many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> they could avoid paying self-employment Social Security and Medicare taxes for seven years and not be fined." [...] "Had he not been nominated for Treasury Secretary it's doubtful that he would have ever paid these taxes," [...] Republican Senator Lindsey Graham supported Geithner's nomination, calling him [...] "very, very competent" [...] and [...] "the right guy" [...] for Secretary of the Treasury.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Duncan Smith {{studied a}} state-sponsored {{relationship}} education programme in Norway, under which couples {{were forced to}} [...] "think again" [...] and confront the reality of divorce before formally separating. The policy has been credited with reversing Norway’s trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to £100billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to [...] "work through {{what is going to}} happen with their children", which has [...] "a very big effect on their thinking". [...] "Many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> again about what they are going to embark on once they really understand the consequences of their actions subsequently," [...] he said.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, the rogues {{are even}} more {{unreasonable}} still," [...] said Sedley; [...] "for every knave <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>thinks</b> himself entitled to your Majesty's protection in a good cause, whether he has cried God save the King or no." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should say}} it was," [...] {{answered}} Giant, readily. [...] "I'd {{like to bring}} down a game-bag full <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Think</b> of the rabbit pot-pie we could make!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all {{you know}} about it!" [...] said Jock. [...] "She is not that sort. The poverty is nothing, but there's a fitness in things. Women, the best <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>think</b> much of what I suppose you call the row. It fits in with all their chivalry and romance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seems to}} me it's a case for some public body, some {{practically}} undying guardian. If he really is going on living--as the doctors, some <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>think.</b> As a matter of fact, I have gone {{to one or two}} public men about it. But, so far, nothing has been done." ...|$|E

We did try to, Andrew and I, but the masonry gave way. These lumps on the floor are the remains of our work. Keep your torch down. You'll fall over them." ...|$|E
6000|$|O {{literary}} parasites! who thrive [...] Upon {{the fame}} of better men, derive [...] Your sustenance by suction, like a leech, [...] And, for you preach <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>think</b> masters preach,-- [...] Who find it half is profit, half delight, [...] To write {{about what you}} could never write,-- [...] Consider, pray, how sharp had been the throes [...] Of famine and discomfiture in those [...] You write of {{if they had been}} critics, too, [...] And doomed to write of nothing but of you! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1.

[...] "Why, theer's {{that new}} school-marm over at Logport, you know, Jim, {{the one that}} wanted to take your picter in your boat for a young {{smuggler}} or fancy pirate or Eyetalian fisherman, and allowed that you'r handsomed some, and offered to pay you for sittin'--do you reckon SHE'D believe you owned the land her schoolhouse was built on.

"Please go on, Mr. Gaylord," [...] she said; [...] "I am {{very much}} {{interested}} in my neighbours here, and I know that a great many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> that the railroad meddles in politics. I've {{tried to find out}} what they think, but it is so difficult for a woman to understand. If matters are wrong, I'm sure my father will right them when he knows the situation. He has so much to attend to." [...] She paused. Tom was still mopping his forehead. [...] "You may say anything you like to me, and I shall not take offence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Besides all these, we {{encountered}} Killers and Thrashers, {{by far the}} most spirited and [...] "spunky" [...] of the finny tribes. Though little larger than a porpoise, a band <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> nothing of assailing leviathan himself. They bait the monster, as dogs a bull. The Killers seizing the Right whale by his immense, sulky lower lip, and the Thrashers fastening on to his back, and beating him with their sinewy tails. Often they come off conquerors, worrying the enemy to death. Though, sooth to say, if leviathan gets but one sweep al them with his terrible tail, they go flying into the air, as if tossed from Taurus' horn.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's the heat,' he declared, finally. 'That and {{the worry}} of rehearsals. I expect a doctor {{could give the}} {{technical}} name for it. It's a what-do-you-call-it--an obsession. You often hear of cases. Fellows who are absolutely sane really, but cracked on one particular subject. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> they're teapots and things. You've got a craving for being rescued from drowning. What happens, old man? Do you suddenly get the delusion that you can't swim? No, it can't be that, because you were doing all the swimming {{for the two of}} us just now. I don't know, though. Maybe you didn't realize that you were swimming?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{the people}} of this city are clever enough for me. I know some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> that <b>think</b> they are too clever for me; but they ain't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! that's a fair {{slap in the}} face," [...] said Tim, with a laugh, [...] "but {{there may}} be reasons for that, you see. Gals ain't always as willin' as they should be; {{sometimes}} they don't know a good man when they see him. Besides, I ain't too old yet, though p'raps some <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>thinks</b> me raither short for a husband. Come now, don't keep yer old comrade in the dark. Haven't ye got a notion o' some young woman in partikler?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well; I'll {{tell you}} what I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> I <b>think</b> they stink of money, as the people say; but I'm not sure that they've got any all the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very {{few of them}} possess guns," [...] Jean Martin remarked, [...] "and {{that they}} should carry them shows how {{disturbed}} {{a state of mind}} all these people are in. They know that their priests may be arrested and carried off, at any moment; and no doubt the report that an order has been issued to raise thirty thousand men throughout France, and that every town and village has to furnish its quota, has stirred them up even more effectually. I don't suppose that many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> that the authorities will really try to drag men off, against their will; but the possibility is quite enough to inflame their minds." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{no wonder}} they don't know about the five o'clock train for Mariposa. Very few people know about it. Hundreds of them {{know that there is}} a train that goes out at five o'clock, but they mistake it. Ever so many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> it's just a {{suburban}} train. Lots of people that take it every day think it's only the train to the golf grounds, but the joke is that after it passes out of the city and the suburbs and the golf grounds, it turns itself little by little into the Mariposa train, thundering and pounding towards the north with hemlock sparks pouring out into the darkness from the funnel of it.|$|E
6000|$|It was in {{relation}} to his fellow-stowaway that Alick showed the best, or perhaps I should say the only good, points of his nature. [...] "Mind you," [...] he said suddenly, changing his tone, [...] "mind you, that's a good boy. He wouldn't tell you a lie. A lot <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> he is a scamp because his clothes are ragged, but he isn't; he's as good as gold." [...] To hear him, you become aware that Alick himself had a taste for virtue. He thought his own idleness and the other's industry equally becoming. He was no more anxious to insure his own reputation as a liar than to uphold the truthfulness of his companion; and he seemed unaware of what was incongruous in his attitude, and was plainly sincere in both characters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, an' a {{good deal}} before," [...] he returned. [...] "There's always somethin' to objec' to every minister; we ain't any of us perfect, and Mr. Peck's got his failin's; he hain't built up the church quite so much as some on 'em {{expected}} but what he would; and there's some that don't like his prayers; and some <b>of</b> <b>'em</b> <b>thinks</b> he ain't doctrinal enough. But I guess, take it all round, he suits pretty well. It'll come out all right, Pauliny. You'll see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I do {{not know}} yet, Macumazahn. Whose spirits do you desire to see? If that of a woman called Mameena is one <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> I <b>think</b> that perhaps I whom she loved----"[*] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he remarked, [...] "that's over, {{and it will}} be {{some time}} before they need come back. I hope none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> will <b>think</b> they have to ask us out in return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{more than}} in any other city," [...] replied Oz; [...] "but when you wear green spectacles, why of course {{everything}} you see looks green to you. The Emerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my people have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, I'm {{not quite}} so idle as that"--and she also began her {{preparations}} for the expected festivities. Little did either <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> that she, Fanny Wyndham, was the sole cause of all the trouble which the household and neighbourhood were to undergo:--the fatigue of the countess; Griffiths's journey; {{the arrival of the}} dread man cook; Richards's indignation at being made subordinate to such authority; the bishop's desertion of the Education Board; the colonel's dangerous and precipitate consumption of colchicum; the quarrel between Lord and Lady George as to staying or not staying; the new dresses of the Miss O'Joscelyns, which their worthy father could so ill afford; and, above all, the confusion, misery, rage, and astonishment which attended Lord Kilcullen's unexpected retreat from London, {{in the middle of the}} summer. And all in vain! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on, Blesbok," [...] he said, [...] "or {{we shall}} {{never get to}} old Croft's place to-night. By Jove! I believe that must be the turn," [...] and he pointed with his whip to a little rutty track that {{branched}} from the Wakkerstroom main road and stretched away towards a curious isolated hill with a large flat top, which rose out of the rolling plain some four miles to the right. [...] "The old Boer said the second turn," [...] he went on still talking to himself, [...] "but perhaps he lied. I am told that some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>think</b> {{it is a good}} joke to send an Englishman a few miles wrong. Let's see, they told me the place was under the lee of a table-topped hill, about half an hour's ride from the main road, and that is a table-topped hill, so I think I will try it. Come on, Blesbok," [...] and he put the tired nag into a sort of [...] "tripple," [...] or ambling canter much affected by South African horses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I hope, at any rate," [...] he said, [...] "that {{you like}} your {{precious}} religion now. I hope you like the society of this poor devil whom your damned tracts and hymns and priests have driven out of his wits. Five men in this place, they tell me, five men in this place {{who might have been}} fathers of families, and every one <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>thinks</b> he is God the Father. Oh! you may talk about the ugliness of science, but there is no one here who thinks he is Protoplasm." ...|$|R
6000|$|Imogene winced, but [...] "I should despise {{him if he}} {{were merely}} a society man," [...] she said. [...] "I have seen enough <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> I <b>think</b> it's better to be {{intellectual}} and good." ...|$|R
6000|$|She became at this, on the spot, all intensity. [...] "Ah do {{describe}} that more--it's so interesting. There are no such suggestive questions. I'm so fond <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> He <b>thinks</b> he's a failure--fancy!" [...] she beautifully wailed.|$|R
