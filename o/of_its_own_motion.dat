[...] "Very well, then; that being the case, no part of the body is responsible for the result when it carries out an order delivered to it by the head; ergo, the head is alone responsible for crimes done by a man's hands or feet or stomachdo you get the idea? am I right thus far?" [...] Everybody said yes, and said it with enthusiasm, and some said, one to another, that the maire was in great form to-night and at his very bestwhich pleased the maire exceedingly and made his eyes sparkle with pleasure, for he overheard these things; so he went on in the same fertile and brilliant way.

[...] After a little pause to give the interest opportunity to gather and grow, he went on: [...] "Very good. Let us suppose the case of a pair of tongs that falls upon a man's foot, causing a cruel hurt. Will you claim that the tongs are punishable for that? The question is answered; I see by your faces that you would call such a claim absurd. Now, why is it absurd? It is absurd because, there being no reasoning facultythat is to say, no faculty of personal commandin a pair of tongs, personal responsibility for the acts of the tongs is wholly absent from the tongs; and, therefore, responsibility being absent, punishment cannot ensue. Am I right?" [...] A hearty burst of applause was his answer. [...] "Now, then, we arrive at a man's stomach.

The matter is narrowed down by that much; we will narrow it further. Can a stomach, <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>motion,</b> assist at a crime? The answer is no, because command is absent, the reasoning faculty is absent, volition is absentas {{in the case of the}} tongs. We perceive now, do we not, that the stomach is totally irresponsible for crimes committed, either in whole or in part, by it?" [...] He got a rousing cheer for response. [...] "Then what do we arrive at as our verdict? Clearly this: that there is no such thing in this world as a guilty stomach; that in the body of the veriest rascal resides a pure and innocent stomach; that, whatever it's owner may do, it at least should be sacred in our eyes; and that while God gives us minds to think just and charitable and honorable thoughts, it should be, and is, our privilege, as well as our duty, not only to feed the hungry stomach that resides in a rascal, having pity for its sorrow and its need, but to do it gladly, gratefully, in recognition of its sturdy and loyal maintenance of its purity and innocence in the midst of temptation and in company so repugnant to its better feelings.

40|$|Digital camera {{equipped}} {{cell phones}} {{were introduced in}} Japan in 2001, they quickly became popular and by 2003 outsold the entire stand-alone digital camera market. In 2010 sales passed one billion units and the market is still growing. Another trend is the rising popularity of smartphones {{which has led to}} a rapid development of the processing power on a phone, and many units sold today bear close resemblance to a personal computer. The combination of a powerful processor and a camera which is easily carried in your pocket, opens up a large eld of interesting computer vision applications. The core contribution of this thesis is the development of methods that allow an imaging device such as the cell phone camera to estimates <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> and to capture the observed scene structure. One of the main focuses of this thesis is real-time performance, where a real-time constraint does not only result in shorter processing times, but also allows for user interaction. In computer vision, structure from motion refers to the process of estimating camera motion and 3 D structure by exploring the motion in the image plane caused by the moving camera. This thesis presents several methods for estimating camera motion. Given the assumption that a set of images has known camera poses associated to them, we train a system to solve the camera pose very fast for a new image. For the cases where no a priory information is available a fast minimal case solver is developed. The solver uses ve points in two camera views to estimate the cameras relative position and orientation. This type of minimal case solver is usually used within a RANSAC framework. In order to increase accuracy and performance a renement to the random sampling strategy of RANSAC is proposed. It is shown that the new scheme doubles the performance for the ve point solver used on video data. For larger systems of cameras a new Bundle Adjustment method is developed which are able to handle video from cell phones. Demands for reduction in size, power consumption and price has led to a redesign of the image sensor. As a consequence the sensors have changed from a global shutter to a rolling shutter, where a rolling shutter image is acquired row by row. Classical structure from motion methods are modeled on the assumption of a global shutter and a rolling shutter can severely degrade their performance. One of the main contributions of this thesis is a new Bundle Adjustment method for cameras with a rolling shutter. The method accurately models the camera motion during image exposure with an interpolation scheme for both position and orientation. The developed methods are not restricted to cellphones only, but is rather applicable to any type of mobile platform that is equipped with cameras, such as a autonomous car or a robot. The domestic robot comes in many  avors, everything from vacuum cleaners to service and pet robots. A robot equipped with a camera that is capable <b>of</b> estimating <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>motion</b> while sensing <b>its</b> environment, like the human eye, can provide an eective means of navigation for the robot. Many of the presented methods are well suited of robots, where low latency and real-time constraints are crucial in order to allow them to interact with their environment.

6000|$|Wordsworth's {{absolute}} want of humor, {{while it}} no doubt confirmed his self-confidence by making him insensible both to the comical incongruity into which he was often led by his earlier theory concerning the language of poetry and to the not unnatural ridicule called forth by it, {{seems to have been}} indicative of a certain dulness of perception in other directions.[352] We cannot help feeling that the material of his nature was essentially prose, which, in his inspired moments, he had the power of transmuting, but which, whenever the inspiration failed or was factitious, remained obstinately leaden. The normal condition of many poets would seem to approach that temperature to which Wordsworth's mind could be raised only by the white heat of profoundly inward passion. And in proportion to the intensity needful to make his nature thoroughly aglow is the very high quality of his best verses. They seem rather the productions of nature than of man, and have the lastingness of such, delighting our age with the same startle of newness and beauty that pleased our youth. Is it his thought? It has the shifting inward lustre of diamond. Is it his feeling? It is as delicate as the impressions of fossil ferns. He seems to have caught and fixed forever in immutable grace the most evanescent and intangible of our intuitions, the very ripple-marks on the remotest shores of being. But this intensity of mood which insures high quality is by its very nature incapable of prolongation, and Wordsworth, in endeavoring it, falls more below himself, and is, more even than many poets his inferiors in imaginative quality, a poet of passages. Indeed, one cannot help having the feeling sometimes that the poem is there for the sake of these passages, rather than that these are the natural jets and elations of a mind energized by the rapidity <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>motion.</b> In other words, the happy couplet or gracious image seems not to spring from the inspiration of the poem conceived as a whole, but rather to have dropped of itself into the mind of the poet in one of his rambles, who then, in a less rapt mood, has patiently built up around it a setting of verse too often ungraceful in form and of a material whose cheapness may cast a doubt on the priceless quality of the gem it encumbers.[353] During the most happily productive period of his life, Wordsworth was impatient of what may be called the mechanical portion of his art. His wife and sister seem from the first to have been his scribes. In later years, he had learned and often insisted on the truth that poetry was an art no less than a gift, and corrected his poems in cold blood, sometimes to their detriment. But he certainly had more of the vision than of the faculty divine, and was always a little numb on the side of form and proportion. Perhaps his best poem in these respects is the [...] "Laodamia," [...] and it is not uninstructive to learn from his own lips that [...] "it cost him more trouble than almost anything of equal length he had ever written." [...] His longer poems (miscalled epical) have no more intimate bond of union than their more or less immediate relation to his own personality. Of character other than his own he had but a faint conception, and all the personages of [...] "The Excursion" [...] that are not Wordsworth are the merest shadows of himself upon mist, for his self-concentrated nature was incapable of projecting itself into the consciousness of other men and seeing the springs of action at their source in the recesses of individual character. The best parts of these longer poems are bursts of impassioned soliloquy, and his fingers were always clumsy at the callida junctura. The stream of narration is sluggish, if varied by times with pleasing reflections (viridesque placido aequore sylvas); we are forced to do our own rowing, and only when the current is hemmed in by some narrow gorge of the poet's personal consciousness do we feel ourselves snatched along on the smooth but impetuous rush of unmistakable inspiration. The fact that what is precious in Wordsworth's poetry was (more truly even than with some greater poets than he) a gift rather than an achievement should always be borne in mind in taking the measure of his power. I know not whether to call it height or depth, this peculiarity of his, but it certainly endows those parts of his work which we should distinguish as Wordsworthian with an unexpectedness and impressiveness of originality such as we feel in the presence of Nature herself. He seems to have been half conscious of this, and recited his own poems to all comers with an enthusiasm of wondering admiration that would have been profoundly comic[354] but for its simple sincerity and for the fact that William Wordsworth, Esquire, of Rydal Mount, was one person, and the William Wordsworth whom he so heartily reverenced quite another. We recognize two voices in him, as Stephano did in Caliban. There are Jeremiah and his scribe Baruch. If the prophet cease from dictating, the amanuensis, rather than be idle, employs his pen in jotting down some anecdotes of his master, how he one day went out and saw an old woman, and the next day did not, and so came home and dictated some verses on this ominous phenomenon, and how another day he saw a cow. These marginal annotations have been carelessly taken up into the text, have been religiously held by the pious to be orthodox scripture, and by dexterous exegesis have been made to yield deeply oracular meanings. Presently the real prophet takes up the word again and speaks as one divinely inspired, the Voice of a higher and invisible power. Wordsworth's better utterances have the bare sincerity, the absolute abstraction from time and place, the immunity from decay, that belong to the grand simplicities of the Bible. They seem not more his own than ours and every man's, the word of the inalterable Mind. This gift of his was naturally very much a matter of temperament, and accordingly by far the greater part of his finer product belongs to the period of his prime, ere Time had set his lumpish foot on the pedal that deadens the nerves of animal sensibility.[355] He did not grow as those poets do in whom the artistic sense is predominant. One of the most delightful fancies of the Genevese humorist, Toepffer, is the poet Albert, who, having had his portrait drawn by a highly idealizing hand, does his best afterwards to look like it. Many of Wordsworth's later poems seem like rather unsuccessful efforts to resemble his former self. They would never, as Sir John Harrington says of poetry, [...] "keep a child from play and an old man from the chimney-corner."[356] ...|$|E
