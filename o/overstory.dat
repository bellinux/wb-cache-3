40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} decade, wild fire events in {{riparian}} bosque (forested) areas along the Middle Rio Grande between Elephant Butte and Albuquerque have increased dramatically owing to flood suppression and accumulation of dead wood and exotic Tamarisk and Russian olive. This problem {{culminated in a}} large wild fire in July 1993 {{that resulted in the}} evacuation of hundreds of City of Albuquerque residents and captured the national media’s attention. Prior to this event, the Rocky Mountain Research Station, in collaboration with the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, City of Albuquerque Open Space, and Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, designed a study in 1999 to compare effectiveness of three methods of fuel removal for reducing fire risk, preventing re-occurrence of exotics, and restoring native habitats, plants and animals. A goal of managers is to preserve cottonwoods while reducing or eliminating Tamarisk and Russian olive stems, so study sites were selected that had cottonwood <b>overstories</b> and Tamarisk and olive understories. As part of this study, the population and nesting responses of breeding bird species have been evaluated prior to and following fuel removal treatments. Our talk reports on 1) the numbers and kinds of bird species inhabiting bosque habitats with cottonwood <b>overstories</b> and varying amounts of Tamarisk and Russian olive, 2) nest substrate use and nesting success of selected bird species prior to treatment, and 3) preliminary results after the first year of mechanical treatments.

40|$|Extreme climatic events, such as windstorms and drought, and {{competition}} {{are some of}} the main factors underlying tree mortality in Atlantic and Central European forest stands. However, current empirical tree mortality models are not adapted to separately consider the different causes of mortality. In addition, these approaches do not distinguish between intra- and inter-specific competition. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical single-tree mortality model that incorporates all of the aforementioned features. On the one hand, extreme events can enter the model via fixed effects and random effects. The latter allows taking the stochasticity of the process into consideration. The distribution of these random effects can be seen as an extreme event severity distribution, which is of great interest for carrying out stochastic simulations on tree mortality. On the other hand, intra- and inter-specific competition is taken into account through linear interactions of species-specific competition indexes and species factors. In order to test this approach, we selected the beech-oak mixture in France as a case study. Beech-oak mixed forests are a common type in France which provides owners with significant economic benefits. Our findings confirm that drought and, especially, windstorm occurrence are major causes of tree mortality in these forests. The model was able to capture the stochasticity of windstorm events by means of random effects. In terms of competition, the probability of mortality in beech understories was expected to decrease in the presence of oak <b>overstories</b> with respect to pure beech stands.

Considerably less work has examined this relationship along smaller channels in mountainous terrain. We utilized multivariate statistical techniques {{to examine the relationship between}} landform types and riparian plant floristics along small streams at the Cedar River Municipal Watershed in western Washington, USA. Riparian geomorphic surfaces were assigned to one of four landform classes based on topographic characteristics and position relative to the stream channel: low floodplain, high floodplain, terrace and hillslope. Landform exerted a strong influence on the distribution of tree, shrub and understory plant species. Certain taxa were found only on one or two of the landforms. Other species displayed a gradient in abundance across landforms. No single species occupied all landforms at the same level of abundance. The distribution patterns of species among the landforms suggested that primary drivers in the organization of the plant communities were moisture and susceptibility to disturbance. Plants preferring high moisture levels and resistant to the effects of fluvial disturbance typically were found on the floodplain landforms. Communities with hardwood-dominated <b>overstories</b> and dense shrub understories were prevalent on these sites. Slopes and terraces supported species able to cope with drier conditions and those unable to persist with frequent disturbance. Conifers were prevalent only on these drier, infrequently-disturbed landforms.

40|$|Abstract—Snowshoe hares {{occur in}} many of the montane and sub-boreal forests of the {{continental}} United States, as well as throughout the boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. Population dynamics in their southern range were previously thought to be noncyclic, in contrast to the strong 10 -year fluctuation that typifies boreal populations of snowshoe hares. Time series data and studies of hare demography indicate that northern and southern populations of hares may instead have similar population dynamics. Hares in southern areas appear to experience two- to 25 -fold fluctuations in numbers with peaks eight to 11 years apart. Peak and low densities may be lower in southern areas than in northern ones; in the south, peak densities are commonly one to two hares/ha, whereas northern hare populations commonly have peak densities up to four to six hares/ha. Demographically, survival estimates (30 -day) range from approximately 0. 65 - 0. 95 in Wisconsin, with lowest survival occurring as populations decline; these values parallel those of cyclic hares in Yukon. Annual reproductive output may vary regionally, but interpretation of this pattern is hindered by noncomparable methodologies. 163 Chapter 7 —Hodges The southern range of snowshoe hares is roughly delineated by the range of suitable forested habitats. Along the eastern seaboard, hares use spruce/fir and deciduous forests as far south as Tennessee and the Virginias. Around the Great Lakes, hares occur throughout the sub-boreal coniferous forests. In the Rockies and westward, hares mainly use the coniferous forests that extend along the mountains down into New Mexico and California. Throughout their range, hares are predominantly associated with forests that have a well-developed understory that provides protection from predation and supplies them with food. Such habitat structure is common in early seral stages but may also occur in coniferous forests with mature but relatively open <b>overstories</b> or in eastern deciduous forests...|$|R
40|$|General Description: Perennial {{herbaceous}} plant {{with a single}} erect stem 2 - 8 inches tall and {{a single pair of}} broad, parallelveined, pleated leaves at or above the middle of the stem, which is covered with woolly hairs. Flowers droop in a tight cluster of 2 - 4 {{at the tip of the}} stem and consist of greenish-brown or greenish-purple petals and sepals, usually purple-lined or mottled, and a greenish-yellow pouch with brownish-purple margins, often with a purplish tinge. The stem above the leaves becomes erect and elongates as the capsules develop. Identification Tips: Cypripedium fasciculatum is quite distinctive and is not likely to be confused with any other taxon. Even without flowers, the single pair of broad, parallel-veined leaves and the densely hairy stem are quite diagnostic. Phenology: Flowers from early May through mid-June. Range: Occurs in coniferous forests along the Cascade-Sierran axis from Washington to central California and at widely scattered locations in the Rocky Mountains in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. In WA, the species is known from the eastern slopes of the Cascades in the Eastern Cascades physiographic province in Chelan, Kittitas, Klickitat, and Yakima counties, in the Columbia Basin physiographic province in Whitman County, in the Blue Mountains physiographic province in Columbia and Garfield counties, and one occurrence in Pierce County in the Western Cascades physiographic province.
