5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power {{at the end of}} the turbulent Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted the legitimacy of the regime, the illegitimacy <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>sort</b> of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>sort</b> {{was largely}} absent during the industrial {{development of the}} late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly {{for longer periods of}} time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{appointed}} Army General Maxwell D. Taylor as his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Taylor, {{like most}} Army brass, {{was a major}} supporter of the Zeus program. Kennedy and Taylor initially agreed to build a huge Zeus deployment with seventy batteries and 7,000 missiles. McNamara was also initially {{in favor of the}} system, but suggested a much smaller deployment of twelve batteries with 1,200 missiles. A contrary note was put forth by Jerome Wiesner, recently appointed as Kennedy's scientific advisor, and chair of the 1959 PSAC report. He began to educate Kennedy on the technical problems inherent to the system. He also had lengthy discussions with David Bell, the budget director, who came to realize the enormous cost <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>sort</b> of reasonable Zeus system.|$|E

He is an ambitious man, {{with the potential to}} be treacherous and is 'alarmingly attractive'.

5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a visual display <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>sort.</b> The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Maryland won {{its first}} four games and entered the AP Poll {{for the first time}} since September 1995. Maryland beat 15th-ranked Georgia Tech in {{overtime}} when placekicker Nick Novak, the ACC's future all-time scoring leader, equalized and then won the game with 46- and 26-yard field goals, thereby ensuring a winning season and bowl appearance. In Tallahassee, 18th-ranked Florida State broke a stalemate in the fourth quarter to hand Maryland its only defeat of the regular season, 52–31. Maryland closed the year with a win over NC State, which secured the ACC championship and made the Terrapins the first team other than Florida State to take the title outright since the Seminoles joined the conference in 1991. Sixth-ranked Maryland then faced fifth-ranked Florida in the Orange Bowl—their first-ever BCS appearance, and their first major bowl <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>sort</b> since the 1977 Cotton Bowl. The Terrapins lost, 56–23, and finished with a 10–2 record and ranked 10th in the nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{that led to}} the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>sort.</b> The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E

50|$|Finding a {{specific}} tab in a 3 or 4 level tabular interface {{can be difficult}} for some people. Part of the issue with this difficulty lies in the lack <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>sorting</b> scheme. Without such tabs can be strewn about without <b>any</b> sense <b>of</b> order, thus looking for a tab provides no meaningful understanding of a position to a tab relative to other tabs. Additionally, the clutter created by multiple tabs can create a dialog that is unusually small, with the tabs above it dominating the window.|$|R

According to these historians, one of the stones near Charminar was painted with the saffron color in 1965, and an old woman became the person in-charge of this shrine. After an APSRTC bus collided with the stone and damaged it, a pucca structure was created at the site. The stone was replaced with an idol of the goddess Lakshmi.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} about a sorting algorithm {{which uses}} {{the concept of}} buckets where each bucket represents {{a certain number of}} digits. A two dimensional data structure is used where one dimension represents buckets i. e; number of digits and each bucket's corresponding dimensions represents the input numbers that belong to that bucket. Each bucket is then individually sorted. Since every preceding bucket elements will always be smaller than the succeeding buckets no comparison between them is required. By doing this we can significantly reduced the time complexity <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>sorting</b> algorithm used to sort the given set of inputs...|$|R
