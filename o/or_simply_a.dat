It is unclear, however, whether these plants evolved the ability to trap and kill insects as an adaptation to low environmental nutrient availability <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> defensive mechanism against insects damaging flower parts.|$|E
5|$|When Sélestat {{started to}} appear in written {{documents}} in the 8th century, {{it may have been}} a market town <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> village populated by fishermen and farmers. The area was part of the estate of Eberhard, a member of the Alsatian ducal family, who donated it to Murbach Abbey at the end of his life. In 775, Charlemagne spent Christmas in Sélestat, which indicates that the town must have had enough appropriate buildings and population to accommodate his court and troops.|$|E
5|$|A nonempty subset W of a {{vector space}} V that is closed under {{addition}} and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the 0-vector of V) {{is called a}} linear subspace of V, <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> subspace of V, when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space. Subspaces of V are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set S of vectors is called its span, {{and it is the}} smallest subspace of V containing the set S. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the linear combinations of elements of S.|$|E

5|$|Edward's {{relationship}} with Gaveston inspired Christopher Marlowe's 1592 play Edward II, {{along with other}} plays, films, novels and media. Many of these {{have focused on the}} possible sexual relationship between the two men. Edward's contemporaries criticised his performance as a king, noting his failures in Scotland and the oppressive regime of his later years, although 19th-century academics later argued that the growth of parliamentary institutions during his reign was a positive development for England over the longer term. Debate has continued into the 21st century as to whether Edward was a lazy and incompetent king, <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> reluctant and ultimately unsuccessful ruler.|$|E
5|$|Film noir {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} plots: the central figure may be a private investigator (The Big Sleep), a plainclothes policeman (The Big Heat), an aging boxer (The Set-Up), a hapless grifter (Night and the City), a law-abiding citizen lured into {{a life of crime}} (Gun Crazy), <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> victim of circumstance (D.O.A.). Although film noir was originally associated with American productions, films now so described have been made around the world. Many pictures released from the 1960s onward share attributes with film noir of the classical period, and often treat its conventions self-referentially. Some refer to such latter-day works as neo-noir. The clichés of film noir have inspired parody since the mid-1940s.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Miralles {{and others}} {{reviewed}} the taxon maculata {{and concluded that}} the animal now known as Trachylepis maculata also belongs in the African clade, but they were unable {{to determine whether or not}} it is indigenous to Guyana. They also reviewed Trachylepis (Xystrolepis) punctata and replaced it with Trachylepis tschudii because the older name was preoccupied by Linnaeus's and Gray's punctata. Although they were unable to resolve the identity of T.tschudii, which is still known from a single specimen, they believed that it is most likely the same species as the Noronha skink; it may be either a representative of an undiscovered Amazonian population of the latter <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> mislabeled animal from Fernando de Noronha.|$|E

5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Macedonian painted artwork {{includes}} frescoes and murals, {{but also}} decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colors still {{exist on the}} bas-reliefs of the late 4th-century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the ancient Macedonians. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage); these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} galaxies that lie near it. M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf spheroidal galaxy <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E

5|$|The script {{calls for}} five actors to portray ten {{characters}}. The two main characters are Jason, a young Canadian lawyer; and Number 18, a young female prostitute {{who claims to}} be fifteen years old {{and has been a}} prostitute for six years. The drama centers on Jason's infiltration of a brothel ring that is trafficking girls into Bangkok. Jason comes to believe that Number 18 could be a key witness to a human trafficking incident and tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect how traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> number, which in some cases is branded onto the victim's body. Waldschmidt said he hoped that She Has a Name will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists.|$|E
5|$|Tumiki Fighters is a side-scrolling shooter {{in which}} the protagonist is a toy {{aeroplane}} flying through a cartoon setting. The game employs a device inspired by Katamari Damacy, allowing the player to attach debris from destroyed enemies to the aircraft, which in turn act as armour and power-ups. Praised for its addictive gameplay, Tumiki Fighters formed the base of , a game published by Majesco Entertainment in 2008 for the Wii. Developer Budcat Creations remade ABA Games' creation for the console and further added an editor function allowing extensive user-created content. Critics acclaimed Blast Works for its innovative and entertaining gameplay and {{has been described by}} critics variously as an upgraded version or remake— <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> port or re-release— of Tumiki Fighters. Blast Works featured Tumiki Fighters, as well as three other ABA Games titles, as bonus content. UGO felt that these games' minimalist graphics, while not outstanding, did retain some charm. According to Cho, he did not receive money for the port, allowing his game to be used for free.|$|E
5|$|Clashes {{over the}} {{interpretation}} and {{legality of the}} Petition began almost immediately, with the Lords and Commons arguing with the King as early as 20 June 1628, leading to the prorogation of Parliament on the 26th. The Petition of Right was not a formal statute, and despite it being reaffirmed as a bill by the Long Parliament in 1641, {{the legal status of}} the initial Petition has been debated. It has been considered a declaratory act, a private bill, <b>or</b> <b>simply</b> <b>a</b> petition, which permitted an individual harmed by the government to take action against the crown. A petition is the oldest form of Parliamentary proceeding, and the one through which most early statutes were originally passed; the King would be petitioned to take action by Members of Parliament, and would assent to their request; laws passed in this way include Magna Carta and the Statute of Westminster. Whether or not this made it legally binding was debated. Modern historians have either taken two positions on the matter. Either the recognition of the Petition was a judicial matter and at best a private bill, and as such it was not binding on the King or on Parliament, or it had the strength of a public bill; it was a legislative act, and as such legally binding.|$|E
