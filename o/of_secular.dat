5|$|In Byzantine literature, four {{different}} cultural elements are recognised: the Greek, the Christian, the Roman, and the Oriental. Byzantine literature is often classified in five groups: historians and annalists, encyclopaedists (Patriarch Photios, Michael Psellus, and Michael Choniates {{are regarded as}} the greatest encyclopaedists of Byzantium) and essayists, and writers <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> poetry. The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the Digenis Acritas. The remaining two groups include the new literary species: ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{approximately}} {{two to three}} thousand volumes of Byzantine literature that survive, only 330 consist <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> poetry, history, science and pseudo-science. While the most flourishing period of the secular literature of Byzantium runs from the 9th to the 12th century, its religious literature (sermons, liturgical books and poetry, theology, devotional treatises, etc.) developed much earlier with Romanos the Melodist being its most prominent representative.|$|E

5|$|The cathedrals {{fall into}} three {{distinct}} groups, {{depending on their}} earlier organisational structure. Firstly, there are those that, during the Medieval period as now, were governed by a body <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> clergy or chapter, presided over by a dean. These cathedrals are Chichester, Exeter, Hereford, Lichfield, Lincoln, London, Salisbury, Wells, and York, all of which built specifically to serve as cathedral churches.|$|E
5|$|According to Mummer Kaylan, {{author of}} The Kemalists: Islamic Revival and the Fate <b>of</b> <b>Secular</b> Turkey, Bazna {{said that he}} began spying for the Germans because he needed the money and, {{although}} {{he was not a}} Nazi, he liked Germans and disliked the British. He also alluded to involvement with the Milli Emniyet Hizmeti, which became the Turkish National Security Service in 1965. The British historian Richard Wires wrote Bazna was motivated entirely by greed as he had dreams of becoming rich by selling secrets to the Germans. Wires described Bazna as a typical petty criminal from the Balkans, a man of low intelligence with no values except greed who was apolitical and opportunistic, taking advantages of whatever chances he found to try to get rich, but who was easily duped by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{attempts}} of the Kirk {{to limit the}} tradition <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> popular music, it continued. This period saw {{the adoption of the}} highland bagpipes and the fiddle. Ballads, some of which probably date from the Medieval period, existed as part of an distinctive oral tradition. Allan Ramsey advocated the creation of a national musical tradition and collaborated with Italian composer and cellist Lorenzo Bocchi on the first Scottish opera the Gentle Shepherd. A musical culture developed around Edinburgh and a number of composers began to produce collections of Lowland and Highland tunes grafted on to Italian musical forms. By the middle of the eighteenth century a number of Italian musicians and composers were resident in Scotland and Scottish composers of national significance had begun to emerge.|$|E

5|$|Ealdred had {{returned}} to England by 1055, and brought with him {{a copy of the}} Pontificale Romano-Germanicum, a set of liturgies, with him. An extant copy of this work, currently manuscript Cotton Vitellus E xii, has been identified as a copy owned by Ealdred. It appears likely that the Rule of Chrodegang, a continental set of ordinances for the communal life <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> canons, was introduced into England by Ealdred sometime before 1059. Probably he brought it back from Germany, possibly in concert with Harold.|$|E
5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|In {{the domain}} <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> music, Josquin left {{numerous}} French chansons, for {{from three to}} six voices, {{as well as a}} handful of Italian secular songs known as frottole, as well as some pieces which were probably intended for instrumental performance. Problems of attribution are even more acute with the chansons than they are with other portions of his output: while about 70 three and four-voice chansons were published under his name during his lifetime, only six of the more than thirty five- and six-voice chansons attributed to him were circulated under his name during the same time. Many of the attributions added after his death are considered to be unreliable, and much work has been done in the last decades of the 20th century to correct attributions on stylistic grounds.|$|E

5|$|Jacques Arcadelt (also Jacob Arcadelt; 14 October 1568) was a Franco-Flemish {{composer}} of the Renaissance, {{active in}} both Italy and France, and principally {{known as a}} composer <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> vocal music. Although he also wrote sacred vocal music, {{he was one of}} the most famous of the early composers of madrigals; his first book of madrigals, published within a decade of the appearance of the earliest examples of the form, was the most widely printed collection of madrigals of the entire era. In addition to his work as a madrigalist, and distinguishing him from the other prominent early composers of madrigals – Philippe Verdelot and Costanzo Festa – he was equally prolific and adept at composing chansons, particularly late in his career when he lived in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Leicester Abbey {{was founded}} in 1143 by Robert le Bossu, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and was {{dedicated}} to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. It {{was not the first}} abbey Robert had established, having founded Garendon Abbey, also in Leicestershire, in 1133. Robert's father, Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, had previously founded a college <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> canons in Leicester, known as The College of St Mary de Castro. The new abbey assumed control of the college and its possessions, which included all of the churches in Leicester. Robert added to this with the gift of numerous churches in Leicestershire, Berkshire and Northamptonshire. The abbey also gained the manor of Asfordby from its merger with the college, and the manor of Knighton from its founder.|$|E
5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples <b>of</b> <b>secular</b> portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This is apparent in its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E
