A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} work {{was to determine the}} role <b>of</b> non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> in the process of hydrogen stepwise cracking (SWC). Additionally, the influence <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> upon the notch ductility of hydrogen charged (HC) and uncharged (UN) tensile specimens was examined. To obtain a basis for experiment a series of low carbon-manganese steels were prepared by induction melting. In order to produce variations in the composition, morphology, volume fraction, size and distribution <b>of</b> the <b>inclusions</b> the steel chemistry was adjusted prior to casting by additions of deoxidiser and Ca-Si injection. Sections of each ingot were hot rolled. Metallography, image analysis, mechanical tests and hydrogen SWC tests were then carried out. The volume fraction, morphology, and shape <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> influenced the tensile ductility of the steels. Marked anisotropy was found in the steels containing type II MnS inclusions at all rolling temperatures, whereas the fully Ca treated steel was isotropic. It was found that several inclusion parameters (projected length PL, mean free distance MFD, nearest-neighbour distance NND) correlated with fracture strain. An increase in inclusion volume fraction and/or the dimension <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> on a plane parallel to the plane of fracture led to a decrease in fracture strain. The inclusion parameters did not correlate with the fracture strains for the HC tensile specimens. However, large or clusters <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> acted as the principal sites for crack initiation. `Fisheyes' or areas of `flat' fracture were often found on these fracture surfaces. The criteria for SWC initiation was found to be either large <b>inclusions</b> or clusters <b>of</b> <b>inclusions.</b> As the PL <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> increased the probability of large SWCs occurring increased. SWC initiation at inclusions was believed to occur at a critical concentration of hydrogen. Factors which assisted the concentration <b>of</b> hydrogen at <b>inclusions</b> were discussed. None of the proposed mechanisms of hydrogen embrittlement could be identified as the single cause of SWC...|$|R

This study {{is focused on the}} link between the characteristics <b>of</b> non-metallic <b>inclusions</b> in the steel and the machinability of the given steel grades. For this purpose, inclusion characteristics (such as composition, number, size, morphology etc.) in steel samples were determined by common two-dimensional (2 D) observations <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> on polished metal surface of samples as well as by three-dimensional (3 D) investigations <b>of</b> <b>inclusions</b> after electrolytic extraction from steel samples.

In Venn diagrams, a shaded zone may represent an empty zone, whereas in an Euler diagram the corresponding zone is missing from the diagram.

Assuming that in the context cheese means some type of dairy product, the Euler diagram has the cheese zone entirely contained within the dairy-product zone—there is no zone for (non-existent) non-dairy cheese. This means that as the number of contours increases, Euler diagrams are typically less visually complex than the equivalent Venn diagram, particularly if the number of non-empty intersections is small.|$|E
