25|$|St Paul's {{charges for}} the {{admission}} {{of those people who}} are sightseers, rather than worshippers; the charge is £18 (£16 when purchased online). <b>Outside</b> <b>service</b> times, people seeking a quiet place to pray or worship are admitted to St Dunstan's Chapel free of charge.

60|$|The {{leader of}} the indignant church members was Susan Henry, a mulatto woman of a very {{independent}} turn of mind. She prided herself that she never worked in anybody's house but her own, and this immunity from <b>outside</b> <b>service</b> gave her a certain pre-eminence among her sisters. Not only did Susan share the general resentment with which the startling statement of old Peter had been received, but she felt that its promulgation had affected her position in the community. If every woman was possessed by seven devils, then, in this respect, she was no better nor worse {{than any of the}} others; and at this her proud heart rebelled. If the preacher had said some women had eight devils and others six, it would have been better. She might then have made a mental arrangement in regard to her relative position which would have somewhat consoled her. But now there was no chance for that. The words of the preacher had equally debased all women.|$|E
