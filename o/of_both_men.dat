5|$|The Best Man Wins is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film features Thanhouser's leading players Anna Rosemond, Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline in a drama about morality. Two suitors are vying for the hand of Julia Seaton and propose {{to her on the}} same day, but she asks for a month to decide between them. In the time the caliber <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> are tested when asked by a young girl, named May, to help her dying mother. The doctor refuses to help and the lawyer offers his assistance, but her mother soon dies. The orphan is taken in by the Seaton family and personally attests to the character <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> when Julia Seaton has to choose between her suitors. The writer, director and cameraman are unknown. Released on May 14, 1910, the film was met with mostly positive reviews by critics. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Although Douglas {{had been}} {{the cause of his}} misfortunes, he and Wilde were reunited in August 1897 at Rouen. This meeting was disapproved of by the friends and {{families}} <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men.</b> Constance Wilde was already refusing to meet Wilde or allow him to see their sons, though she sent him money – a meagre three pounds a week. During the latter part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples for a few months until they were separated by their families under the threat of cutting off all funds.|$|E
5|$|Pain gave {{lands to}} Llanthony Priory, helping to {{establish}} the endowment of that monastic house, although {{it is difficult to}} distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy, as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> together in their records. In addition Pain granted lands to Gloucester Abbey, which had benefited from the generosity of his father and brother, as did his wife Sybil, together with other grants to her uncle the abbot. She also gave to two churches in Hereford: St Peter and St Guthlac.|$|E
5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming depended on the labor of women, while the production of income depended on the labor <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and women in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense}} of subsistence production.|$|E

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from imported works, in 1926 N.V. Java Film, a production house based in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) which had previously produced a single documentary, Inlanders op de Krokodillenjacht (Native Crocodile Hunters), chose {{to make a}} feature film based on the Sundanese folktale Lutung Kasarung. The company's owner, L. Heuveldorp served as director and producer, while its laboratory head G. Krugers handled cinematography and processing.

5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in each event when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men.</b> Brundage's refusal led to charges that he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E

5|$|By mid-July, Gilligan {{had been}} named as captain of the MCC team to tour Australia {{at the end of}} the English cricket season, and was {{expected}} to be one of the leading bowlers. He had, however, faced some criticism of his captaincy. Two players in the England team during the South Africa series spoke out against his tactics: Cec Parkin published a highly critical article in the press and never played for England again; George Macaulay clashed with Gilligan on the field during one Test. The consequent absence <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> from the tour substantially weakened the bowling strength of the team. Although Gilligan was generally popular for his cheerful and friendly approach, the press believed Fender to be the better captain. However, the cricket authorities at Lord's disapproved of Fender's unconventional tactics and approach. Journalists later revealed that, at some point in the season, the selectors had first asked Frank Mann to captain, but he was unable to accept the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Despite their advances, the Bone Wars {{also had}} a {{negative}} impact {{not only on the}} two scientists but also on their peers and the entire field. The public animosity between Cope and Marsh harmed the reputation of American paleontology in Europe for decades. Furthermore, the reported use of dynamite and sabotage by employees <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> may have destroyed or buried hundreds of potentially critical fossil remains. Joseph Leidy abandoned his more methodical excavations in the West, finding he could not keep up with Cope's and Marsh's reckless searching for bones. Leidy also grew tired of the constant squabbling between the two men, with the result that his withdrawal from the field marginalized his own legacy; after his death, Osborn found not a single mention of the man in either of the rivals' works. In their haste to outdo each other, Cope and Marsh haphazardly assembled the bones of their own discoveries. Their descriptions of new species, based on their reconstructions, led to confusion and misconceptions that lasted for decades after their deaths.|$|E
5|$|Hayes attempted, unsuccessfully, {{to fill a}} third vacancy in 1881. Justice Noah Haynes Swayne {{resigned}} {{with the}} expectation that Hayes would fill his seat by appointing Stanley Matthews, who was a friend <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men.</b> Many Senators objected to the appointment, believing that Matthews was too close to corporate and railroad interests, especially those of Jay Gould, and the Senate adjourned without voting on the nomination. The following year, when James A. Garfield entered the White House, he re-submitted Matthews's nomination to the Senate, which this time confirmed Matthews by one vote, 24 to 23. Matthews served for eight years until his death in 1889. His opinion in Yick Wo v. Hopkins in 1886 advanced his and Hayes' views on the protection of ethnic minorities' rights.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Roran is sent {{on various}} {{missions}} {{as part of}} the military force of the Varden. One of the targets is a convoy of supply wagons guarded by enchanted soldiers that can't feel pain. The unit suffers extreme casualties, and the commander Martland Redbeard is replaced after losing his hand. During a mission to attack a large enemy force raiding a village, plans made by the new commander, Captain Edric almost cause the operation to fail, but Roran gives new orders and kills one hundred and ninety-three enemy soldiers by himself, leading the Varden to victory. Despite saving the mission, Roran is charged with insubordination and is flogged as a punishment. After the public whipping, Nasuada promotes Roran to commander and sends his unit on a mission. He leaves in command of a group <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>men</b> and Urgals to enforce the idea of men and Urgals working together. When an Urgal, Yarbog, challenges Roran for leadership of the unit, he wrestles the Urgal and forces him to submit. After returning to the Varden, his squad joins the siege of Feinster, a city in the Empire. As the siege begins, Eragon rescues the elf Arya and departs to find the leader of the city, but discovers that three magicians are attempting to create a Shade. While racing to kill the magicians, Eragon has a vision through Glaedr's Eldunarí showing Oromis and Murtagh fighting. Murtagh is using power of several Eldunari, and Glaedr and Thorn fight in the sky. Soon Glaedr is badly wounded. In the midst of the fighting, Galbatorix possesses Murtagh and tries to lure Oromis to his side: when he fails, and after Oromis suffers a seizure, Galbatorix uses Murtagh to kill him and Glaedr is killed shortly after. After the vision, the magicians have managed to create the Shade Varaug. Eragon and Arya fight desperately to slay Varaug. Eragon then distracts Varaug by battling him through the mind. Arya then stabs Varaug in the heart. After the successful siege, Nasuada tells Eragon the Varden's plans for invading the Empire.|$|E
