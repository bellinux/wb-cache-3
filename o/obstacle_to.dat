Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.|$|E
5|$|Because the Home Army was {{loyal to}} the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> a Soviet {{takeover}} of Poland. Consequently, {{over the course of}} the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass.

5000|$|In the Buddhist tradition, {{the five}} hindrances (Sanskrit: पञ्च निवारण pañca nivāraṇa; Pali: [...] ) are {{identified}} as mental factors that hinder progress in meditation and in our daily lives. In the Theravada tradition, these factors are identified specifically as <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> the jhānas (stages of concentration) within meditation practice. Within the Mahayana tradition, the five hindrances {{are identified as}} <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> samatha (tranquility) meditation. Contemporary Insight Meditation teachers identify the five hindrances as <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> mindfulness meditation.|$|R

Drawing on data from the firm-level Italian CIS 3, we first explore to what extent innovative behaviours are both firm- (i. e. foreign- versus nationally-owned multinationals, MNEs versus single domestic firms) and region-specific. We then examine whether the perception of <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> innovation varies among types of firms and regions. <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> innovation, multinational firms, innovation processes, regional location...|$|R

However the fortress, though not by then invulnerable to the latest armour-plated warships, was a serious <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> the Allies’ plans to proceed upriver to the Paraguayan capital Asunción and to recapture the Brazilian territory of Mato Grosso: it delayed them {{for two and a}} half years. It was taken in the Siege of Humaitá (1868), then razed pursuant to the Treaty.|$|E

5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> surgery.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the newly}} {{restored}} Byzantine Empire, {{under the leadership}} of Michael VIII Palaiologos, sought to recover Euboea, which was the major Latin insular possession in the Aegean Sea and a base for piratical activity directed against his lands. Furthermore, along with the Principality of Achaea it presented the major <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> his complete recovery of Greece. Already in 1269/1270, a Byzantine fleet under Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos had attacked and captured many Latin nobles, the town of Oreos.|$|E

Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy.

5|$|One reason {{senators}} {{were reluctant}} to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president pro tempore of the Senate.

Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an <b>obstacle</b> <b>to</b> Grant's ambitions.|$|E
