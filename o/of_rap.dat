5|$|Inspired by indie {{rock bands}} and house music, Graduation marked a {{departure}} {{away from the}} ornate, soul-based sound of West's previous releases toward a more anthemic style <b>of</b> <b>rap</b> music that would function well while he was performing in large arenas. Toward this end, West incorporated synthesizer sounds into his production and dabbled with electronic music, while sampling from a wider spectrum of music genres. Lyrically, the album is more introspective in comparison to its predecessors, as West dedicated much of Graduation towards analyzing himself and conveying his ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame. It continues the education theme of West's previous two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{argue that}} hip hop {{can have an}} {{empowering}} effect on youth. While there is misogyny, violence, and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. These messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. A lot <b>of</b> <b>rap</b> songs contain references to strengthening the African American community promoting social causes. Social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child. Hip hop {{has the potential to}} be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. The lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.|$|E
25|$|In {{pancreatic}} β-cells, cAMP signaling, {{which can}} be activated by various extracellular stimuli including hormonal and neural inputs primarily through Gs-coupled receptors, is of importance for normal regulation of insulin secretion to maintain glucose homeostasis. Activation of cAMP signaling amplifies insulin secretion by Epac2-dependent as well as PKA-dependent pathways. Epac2-Rap1 signaling is critical to promote exocytosis of insulin-containing vesicles from the readily releasable pool. In Epac2-mediated exocytosis of insulin granules, Epac2 interacts with Rim2, which is a scaffold protein localized in both plasma membrane and insulin granules, and determines the docking and priming states of exocytosis. In addition, piccolo, a possible Ca2+ sensor protein, interacts with the Epac2-Rim2 complex to regulate cAMP-induced insulin secretion. It is suggested that phospholipase C-ε (PLC-ε), one of the effector proteins <b>of</b> <b>Rap,</b> regulates intracellular Ca2+ dynamics by altering the activities of ion channels such as ATP-sensitive potassium channel, ryanodine receptor, and IP3 receptor.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{also have}} {{many ways of}} {{indicating}} class distinctions. English is seen as more direct, one far more suited to the tough quality presented in hip-hop. Eventually, artists began translating music from English to Japanese and performing those direct translations, often leaving {{the bridge of the}} song in English to keep the catchiness of the rhymes and flow. Slowly, with the increase in popularity <b>of</b> <b>rap</b> in Japan, more rappers began using Japanese. Rappers added stressed syllables to their music, altering the natural flow of the language to fit into traditional hip-hop. American injections were also used in raps to help the flow of the music and often homonyms were placed in raps, which appealed both to the global English-speaking audience and to Japanese speakers, who often would understand the double meanings intended. Japanese was found to allow subtle put downs in raps, which appealed to many audiences.|$|E

40|$|The rapping {{process is}} not yet well {{understood}} for two main reasons: {{on the one hand}} the objectives of the research have been focused for many years on a empirical optimisation <b>of</b> <b>rapping,</b> the knowledge <b>of</b> generation and evolution of the layer was considering as less significant, on the other hand the evolution of the dust layer is difficult to reproduce in a laboratory physical model. The experimental study of the mass balance in an industrial esp pilot provided precious data and made the development of the model possible. It has been compared with good agreement with an industrial esp test in a 500 MW power plant. The model <b>of</b> <b>rapping</b> plates has been developed and integrated in the new version of the EDF-IRS software ORCHIDEE to help the plant staff to optimise their rapping sequences. ORCHIDEE is a user friendly software and we succeed to integrate the rapping model with only geometrical and operational data like the different times <b>of</b> <b>rapping</b> operation, the variation of these times influences the layer thickness on the plate and finally the collecting efficiency. ...|$|R
2500|$|Popular music {{includes}} {{a range of}} vocal styles. Hip-hop uses rapping, the rhythmic delivery of rhymes in a rhythmic speech over a beat or without accompaniment.
