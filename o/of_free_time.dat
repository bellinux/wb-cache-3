5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{appointment}} at the Mint while not a sinecure as such afforded Atkinson {{a considerable amount}} <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> to pursue more academic pursuits. He published a ‘free’ translation of the poem Soohrab an extract from the Sha Nameh by the Persian poet Firdausi in 1814; Hatim Ta’ee, an old romance in the Persian language in 1818 {{for the use of}} the students at Fort William College where he held the Deputy Chair of Persian for that year; in 1819 The Aubid an eastern tale and in 1824 The City of Palaces, a collection of poems, the title of which became the epithet for Calcutta during the period of British rule.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14 Bakunin {{left for}} Saint Petersburg and became a Junker at the Artillery School (known as Mikhailovskaya Military Artillery Academy today). In 1833 he {{received}} a rank of Praporshchik and was seconded {{to serve in the}} Minsk and Grodno Governorates in one of the artillery brigades. There was a legend that he was sent there as a punishment after offending General Ivan Sukhozanet, a school principal and brother of Nikolai Sukhozanet, but none of the serious sources ever confirmed it, including Bakunin himself. He didn't enjoy army and, having a lot <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> on his hands, spent it on self-education. In 1835 he was seconded to Tver, and from there went straight to his village. Though his father wished him to continue in either the military or the civil service, Bakunin decided to abandon both and made his way to Moscow, hoping to study philosophy.|$|E

500|$|Some restaveks do receive proper {{nutrition}} and education, {{but they are}} in the minority. [...] Restaveks' labor includes hauling water and wood, grocery shopping, laundry, house cleaning, and childcare. [...] Restaveks work long hours (commonly 10 to 14 a day) under harsh conditions, are frequently denied schooling, and are at severe risk of mal{{nutrition and}} verbal, physical, and sexual abuse. [...] Beatings are a daily occurrence for most restaveks, and most of the girls are sexually abused, [...] which puts them at an elevated risk for HIV infection. Those who are thrown out or run away from their host homes become street children, vulnerable to exploitation including forced prostitution. [...] Those who return to their families may be unwelcome as an added economic burden or shamed and stigmatized for having been a restavek. [...] The trauma of abuse and the deprivation <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> and normal childhood experiences can stunt a child's development and have long-lasting effects.|$|E
500|$|Having {{given up}} on the study of law, Holmes {{switched}} to medicine. After leaving his childhood home in Cambridge during the autumn of 1830, he moved into a boardinghouse in Boston to attend the city's medical college. At that time, students studied only five subjects: medicine, anatomy and surgery, obstetrics, chemistry and materia medica. Holmes became a student of James Jackson, a physician and the father of a friend, and worked part-time as a chemist in the hospital dispensary. Dismayed by the [...] "painful and repulsive aspects" [...] of primitive medical treatment of the time—which included practices such as bloodletting and blistering—Holmes responded favorably to his mentor's teachings, which emphasized close observation of the patient and humane approaches. Despite his lack <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time,</b> he was able to continue writing. He wrote two essays during this time which detailed life as seen from his boardinghouse's breakfast table. These essays, which would evolve into one of Holmes's most popular works, were published in November 1831 and February 1832 in the New England Magazine under the title [...] "The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table".|$|E
500|$|... "I Remember Larry" [...] is a style {{parody of}} Hilly Michaels, and {{it tells the}} tale of a {{neighborhood}} bully who, after myriad pranks, is brutally murdered by the narrator. At the 3:10 mark, the song contains a backmasked message, which when reversed reads, [...] "Wow, you must have an awful lot <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> on your hands". [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy" [...] tells the story of Santa snapping, embarking on a killing spree, and eventually being arrested. Originally, the song had a different third verse, differing in the fact that, {{at the end of the}} song, Santa is killed by the SWAT team. The [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version was eventually released on the single for [...] "Amish Paradise". Another version was written for the Touring with Scissors tour in 1999, combining elements of the album version and the [...] "Extra Gory" [...] version. [...] "Since You've Been Gone" [...] is a generic doo-wop a cappella track that details a lover's torment after the object of his affections breaks up with him. Yankovic performed most of the vocals himself, and to make sure that he stayed on key, a scratch guitar track was recorded; when the song was mixed, the guitar track was removed. Bassist Steve Jay provides the low voices in the song. Finally, [...] "I'm So Sick of You," [...] a style parody of Elvis Costello in which the singer tells his girlfriend all the things he hates about her.|$|E

500|$|Iowa State Teachers College, Cedar Falls, Iowa, {{became the}} new basic {{training}} center for enlisted WAVES. (The school's original assignment was {{the training of}} yeomen). Captain Randall Davis was named commanding officer. He arrived on 1 December, {{two weeks before the}} first class of 1,050 enlisted recruits were to start their five-weeks of basic training. [...] The recruit training routine began each weekday with Reveille at 5:30 or 6:00 A.M.; breakfast at 6:30 A.M.; classes and drill for four hours before lunch, and classes and drill for another four hours in the afternoon. [...] Followed by an hour <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time,</b> dinner, and two hours of study or instruction, lights out at 10:00 P.M. Captain's Inspection on Saturday morning, then free time until taps. [...] On Sunday, reveille was at 7:00 A.M., with breakfast at 7:30 A.M. Then church services and free time until 7:30 P.M., when study hours began. Recruits received immunization shots [...] and were given a series of job aptitude tests. The first class was to graduate in early January 1943, but on 30 December 1942 the Navy announced that future WAVE recruits would be trained at Hunter College in the Bronx, a borough of the City of New York. The change came because of the Navy's reassessment of how many more women would be needed, and the kinds of work they would be effective in doing. Iowa State Teachers College would return to training yeomen.|$|E

The book cites statistical data indicating that Americans are better off in terms of material goods and amount <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> but are not happier than before. Easterbrook argues that this has occurred due to choice anxiety (too many decisions to make) and abundance denial (not realizing how well we are doing).

Mikel Tidwell of RPGamer enjoyed the narrative, character portrayals and anime sequences. Other aspects of the game were found lacking, including the [...] "slow" [...] combat system, lack <b>of</b> <b>free</b> <b>time</b> during adventure segments, and a lack of save points.
