In McElveen's experimental results [34], blocking the aditus decreased transmission in two bones and increased transmission in one bone. The effects were small between results. Because of the small numbers of bone studies and the individual variations between bones, any conclusion about the clinical significance of the temporal bone results might be cautiously. The real results could be affected by confounding variables including middle ear injury, stiffness of TM, and the mobility status of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chains.</b> Therefore, more large numbers of temporal bone studies should be needed. Some small peaks in umbo displacement were noted in McElveen's results. According to umbo and stapes displacement measurements in temporal bones and living humans, in some 30 % of ears, the tympanic membrane (TM) does not produce a smooth frequency response over the important hearing frequencies [37]. Goode [38] reported that measurements of umbo displacement for a constant sound pressure level (SPL) at the TM in 22 frequencies between 200 and 6000 [*]Hz showed peaks and valleys of more than 10 [*]dB. This is possibly the result of previous injuries, both major and minor, to the TM, and perhaps to the ossicles [38]. Our FE model curve is lower than the experimental curve; however, the trend was similar to the experimental curve. The difference between the FE model and the experimental data may also result from the variations of individual temporal bone.|$|R
5000|$|This {{uncommon}} tumor {{accounts for}} less than 2% of all ear tumors. While patients present with symptoms related to the middle ear cavity location of the tumor, the tumor may expand into the adjacent structures (external auditory canal, mastoid bone, and eustachian tube). [...] Patients come to clinical attention with unilateral (one sided) hearing loss, usually associated with decreased auditory acuity, and particularly conductive hearing loss if the <b>ossicular</b> bone <b>chain</b> (middle ear bones) is involved. Tinnitus (ringing), otitis media, pressure or occasionally ear discharge are seen. At the time of otoscopic exam, the tympanic membrane is usually intact, with a fluid level or mass noted behind the ear drum. Even though this is a [...] "neuroendocrine" [...] type tumor, there is almost never evidence of neuroendocrine function clinically or by laboratory examination.|$|R

50|$|When {{presented}} with a high-intensity sound stimulus, the stapedius and tensor tympani muscles of the ossicles contract. The stapedius stiffens the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> by pulling the stapes (stirrup) {{of the middle ear}} away from the oval window of the cochlea and the tensor tympani muscle stiffens the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> by loading the tympanic membrane when it pulls the malleus (hammer) in toward the middle ear. The reflex decreases the transmission of vibrational energy to the cochlea, where it is converted into electrical impulses to be processed by the brain.|$|E
50|$|Fixation of the stapes {{within the}} oval window causes a {{conductive}} hearing loss. In pure-tone audiometry, this manifests as air-bone gaps on the audiogram (i.e. {{a difference of}} more than 10 dB between the air-conduction and bone-conduction thresholds at a given test frequency). However, medial fixation of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> impairs both the inertial and osseotympanic modes of bone conduction, increasing the bone-conduction thresholds between 500 Hz and 4 kHz, and reducing the size of air-bone gaps. As 2 kHz is the resonant frequency of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain,</b> the largest increase in bone-conduction threshold (around 15 dB) occurs at this frequency - the resultant notch is called Carhart's notch and is a useful clinical marker for medial ossicular-chain fixation.|$|E

50|$|Dysfunction of {{the three}} small bones {{of the middle ear}} - malleus, incus, and stapes - may cause {{conductive}} hearing loss. The mobility of the ossicles may be impaired for different reasons and disruption of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> due to trauma, infection or ankylosis may also cause hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|Hearing loss in Treacher Collins {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} deformed structures in the outer and middle ear. The hearing loss is generally bilateral with a conductive loss of about 50-70 dB. Even in cases with normal auricles and open external auditory canals, the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> is often malformed.|$|E
50|$|The tumor must {{be removed}} with as {{complete}} a surgical excision as possible. In nearly all cases, the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> must be included if recurrences are to be avoided. Due to the anatomic site of involvement, facial nerve paralysis and/or paresthesias may be seen or develop; this is probably due to mass effect rather than nerve invasion. In a few cases, reconstructive surgery may be required. Since this is a benign tumor, no radiation is required. Patients experience an excellent long term outcome, although recurrences can be seen (up to 15%), especially if the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> is not removed. Although controversial, metastases are not seen in this tumor. There are reports of disease in the neck lymph nodes, but these patients have also had other diseases or multiple surgeries, such that it may represent iatrogenic disease.|$|E
50|$|The pathway {{involved}} in the acoustic reflex is complex and can involve the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> (malleus, incus and stapes), the cochlea (organ of hearing), the auditory nerve, brain stem, facial nerve and other components. Consequently, {{the absence of an}} acoustic reflex, by itself, may not be conclusive in identifying the source of the problem.|$|E
50|$|Stapedotomy, like stapedectomy, can be {{successful}} in the presence of sclerotic adhesions (tissue growths abnormally linking the bones to the tympanic cavity), provided the adhesions are removed during surgery. However, the adhesions may recur over time. The stapedotomy method is not applicable in those relatively rare cases that involve scleroris of the entire <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hearing {{aids are}} a common {{treatment}} for hearing loss disorders. A more specific treatment is surgical, involving excision of the sclerotic areas and then further repair of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain.</b> There are several techniques, sometimes involving two surgeries; success rates are, however, variable. Damage to the inner ear {{as a result of}} surgical procedures is a possible and serious concern, as it can result in forms of sensorineural deafness.|$|E
50|$|This is an {{inherited}} disease. The primary form of hearing loss in otosclerosis is {{conductive hearing loss}} (CHL) whereby sounds reach the ear drum but are incompletely transferred via the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> in the middle ear, and thus partly fail to reach the inner ear (cochlea). This usually will begin in one ear but will eventually affect both ears with a variable course. On audiometry, the hearing loss is characteristically low-frequency, with higher frequencies being affected later.|$|E
5000|$|In medicine, an ossicular {{replacement}} prosthesis is {{a device}} {{intended to be}} implanted for the functional reconstruction of segments of the ossicles and facilitates the conduction of sound waves from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. There are two common types of ossicular replacement prostheses, the total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) and partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP). A TORP replaces the entire <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> while a PORP replaces only the incus and malleus but not the stapes. Indications for use of an ossicular replacement prosthesis include: ...|$|E

50|$|Tympanometry {{measures}} the peak pressure (TPP) and peak-compensated static admittance (Ytm) {{of the middle}} ear at the eardrum. As the stapes is ankylosed in otosclerosis, the lateral end of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> may still be quite mobile. Therefore, otosclerosis may only slightly reduce the admittance, resulting in either a shallow tympanogram (type AS), or a normal tympanogram (type A). Otosclerosis increases in the stiffness of the middle-ear system, raising its resonant frequency. This can be quantified using multi-frequency tympanometry. Thus, a high resonant-frequency pathology such as otosclerosis can be differentiated from low resonant-frequency pathologies such as ossicular discontinuity.|$|E

5000|$|The {{middle ear}} couples sound from {{air to the}} fluid via the oval window, using the {{principle}} of [...] "mechanical advantage" [...] {{in the form of}} the [...] "hydraulic principle" [...] and the [...] "lever principle". [...] The vibratory portion of the tympanic membrane (eardrum) is many times the surface area of the footplate of the stapes (the third ossicular bone which attaches to the oval window); furthermore, the shape of the articulated <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> is like a lever, the long arm being the long process of the malleus, the fulcrum being the body of the incus, and the short arm being the lenticular process of the incus. The collected pressure of sound vibration that strikes the tympanic membrane is therefore concentrated down to this much smaller area of the footplate, increasing the force but reducing the velocity and displacement, and thereby coupling the acoustic energy.|$|E
50|$|NIHL {{occurs when}} too much sound {{intensity}} is transmitted into {{and through the}} auditory system. An acoustic signal from a sound source, such as a radio, enters into the external auditory canal, and is funneled through to the tympanic membrane (eardrum). The tympanic membrane acts as an elastic diaphragm driving the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> {{of the middle ear}} system into motion. The middle ear ossicles transfer mechanical energy to the cochlea by way of the stapes footplate hammering against the oval window of the cochlea. This hammering causes the fluid within the cochlea (perilymph and endolymph) to push against the stereocilia of the hair cells, which then transmit a signal to the central auditory system within the brain. Different groups of hair cells are responsive to and conductive of different frequencies. There are two known biological mechanisms of NIHL from excessive sound intensity: damage to the hair cells and damage to the myelination or synaptic regions of auditory nerves.|$|E
50|$|Air {{pressure}} {{changes in}} the ear canal cause the vibrations of the tympanic membrane and middle ear ossicles. At {{the end of the}} <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain,</b> movement of the stapes footplate within the oval window of the cochlea, in turn, generates a pressure field within the cochlear fluids, imparting a pressure differential across the basilar membrane. A sinusoidal pressure wave results in localized vibrations of the organ of Corti: near the base for high frequencies, near the apex for low frequencies. The cochlea thus acts as an 'acoustic prism', distributing the energy of each Fourier component of a complex sound at different locations along its longitudinal axis. Hair cells in the cochlea are stimulated when the basilar membrane is driven up and down by differences in the fluid pressure between the scala vestibuli and scala tympani. Because this motion is accompanied by a shearing motion between the tectorial membrane and the reticular lamina of the organ of Corti, the hair bundles that link the two are deflected, which initiates mechano-electrical transduction. When the basilar membrane is driven upward, shear between the hair cells and the tectorial membrane deflects hair bundles in the excitatory direction, toward their tall edge. At the midpoint of an oscillation the hair bundles resume their resting position. When the basilar membrane moves downward, the hair bundles are driven in the inhibitory direction.|$|E

Methods: Here, 17 cases of otosclerosis and 22 cases of <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> deformity were selected. All patients had normal external ear canals, intact tympanic membranes, conductive hearing loss, type A tympanograms, and negative Gelle's tests.

The quantitative assessments of the representation of different segments of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> were based on a 3 -point scoring system.

Three-dimensional reconstruction was completed using a virtual endoscopy software. Audiological tests were conducted in all patients and evaluation of facial nerve injury in patients with facial paralysis. Patients with mild conductive deafness, <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> subluxation on VE, and no facial paralysis were treated conservatively for 4 - 12 weeks with repeated hearing evaluation; those with facial paralysis underwent surgery if no recovery after 4 - 8 weeks of conservative treatment. Patients with moderate to severe conductive hearing loss or mixed hearing loss, incus long process fracture or dislocation on VE and facial paralysis, underwent <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> reconstruction and facial nerve decompression after conservative treatment for 4 - 8 weeks, or exploratory tympanotomy only if no facial paralysis. VE, audiological tests and facial nerve function tests were repeated in 3 - 6 months after surgery. ResultsOf the 6 cases with mild conductive hearing loss, <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> subluxation and no facial paralysis, 3 recovered to normal hearing spontaneously and 3 showed no significant improvement, after 4 - 12 weeks of conservative treatment. After conservative treatment for 4 - 8 weeks, 3 of the 12 cases with mild conductive deafness, <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> dislocation on VE and facial paralysis recovered to normal hearing and House-Brackmann (HB) grade I facial function from HB grade II, 4 showed facial function recovery to HB grade I (n= 2) or II (n= 2) from HB grade III but no hearing recovery, and 5 gained no recovery {{and went on to}} receive exploratory tympanotomy and facial nerve decompression. The 11 cases with moderate to severe conductive deafness, incus long process fracture or dislocation on VE and facial paralysis all received <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> reconstruction and facial nerve decompression after 4 - 8 weeks of conservative treatment. The 7 cases with moderate to severe conductive deafness, dislocated or fallen incus on VE but no facial paralysis received <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> reconstruction after conservative treatment. The 4 cases with mixed hearing loss, dislocated or fallen incus on VE and no facial paralysis received <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> repair via the intact canal wall epitympanum approach after conservative treatment. Pharmacological therapies continued postoperatively in these patients to treat sensorineural deafness.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{document}} and analyze the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> preservation rate in patients affected by acquired primary cholesteatoma with epitympanic involvement and with preoperative intact <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain.</b> Study Design: A retrospective case series in a tertiary university referral center. Methods: From January 2006 to February 2010, at the Otolaryngology Department of the University Hospital of Modena, 68 patients affected by acquired primary cholesteatoma with attic involvement underwent exclusive endoscopic transcanal tympanoplasty. In April 2010, we performed a retrospective chart and video review of these patients. Patients in whom the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> was found to be intact and not involved by the pathology {{at the beginning of the}} operation were included in the study. A cholesteatoma staging was introduced based on tympanic subsite involvement by pathology. Results: Out of 68 patients affected by acquired primary cholesteatoma and who underwent exclusive endoscopic transcanal tympanoplasty, 23 had intraoperative integrity of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> (17 male and 6 female subjects; mean age, 40 yr) and were included in the study. An inverse correlation was found between number of subsites involved and chain preservation (Spearman rank correlation coefficient, r = - 1; p = 0. 017). Medial attic involvement was the factor that most negatively influenced the likelihood of chain preservation. Conclusion: Middle ear endoscopic techniques may increase the likelihood of <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> preservation during cholesteatoma surgery. Medial attic involvement and a high number of subsites involved represent the most significant negative factors for chain preservation. The rate of residual disease requires more thorough evaluation in the future to validate the results...|$|E

However, the natural vibration characteristics of human ossicleshave never been studied. Herein, we investigated the dynamic characteristicsof the coupling of in-vivo ossicles using finite element analysis. Methods: The geometry of the <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> was obtained by high-resolution computedtomography of the temporal bone, and a 3 D model of the ossicularchain was reconstructed by the medical imaging software, Amira®. The filewas then imported into the finite element analysis software, ANSYS®. Thenatural vibration characteristics of human ossicles were measured by finiteelement analysis. Results: The characteristic dimensions of the model were measured and comparedwith previously published data. The malleus resonated to sound stimuli at 3 kHz and 4 kHz; the incus and stapes did not resonate to sound stimuli at anyfrequency. A coupling of the incus and malleus easily resonated to soundstimuli at 5 kHz. A coupling of the incus and stapes easily resonated tosound stimuli at 3 kHz.

Aimto correlate the degree of <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> changes seen during surgery with the inflammatory histological degree and the thickness of the cholesteatoma perimatrix. Study designCross-sectional study. MethodsSeventy-one descriptions of surgeries done in patients submitted to tympanomastoydectomy were reviewed. Cholesteatoma were collected and fixed in 10 % formaldehyde. Two slides were made for each cholesteatoma, one stained with HE and another with picrossirius. Images were obtained from light microscopy and digitally processed and “blindly” analyzed using Image Pro-Plus Software. For statistical analysis we used Spearman's coefficient. Differences were considered statistically significant if P&# 8804; 0. 05. Resultsthe <b>ossicular</b> <b>chain</b> was involved in 65 cases.
