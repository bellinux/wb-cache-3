Performance indexes of <b>bus</b> <b>system,</b> which embraces worstcase response time of messages and bus load, were separately gained by theoretical calculation, experiments in Matlab and CANoe. The calculation and experiment results were compared sufficiently, and it concludes that <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> established in Matlab/Simulink can efficiently represent the message transfer sequences on the bus, and achieve an exact result of the performance analysis of the <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> With <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> established in Matlab/Simulink, test modules for ECU (Electric Control Unit) testing can conveniently be created, {{and it is an}} efficient testing tool for <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> design...|$|R

40|$|Microgrid {{planning}} {{is very important}} for generation and transmission expansion planning in electrical power system. This is an option for co-streamlining of era and transmission extension arranging. In distribution system, all connected microgrids transfer energy from its central to local sources for the network reliability satisfaction and also it satisfies the power quality required by local loads. The main objective is to minimize the power losses in the transmission planning by using distributed generators in 30 <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> and 52 <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> Newton Raphson method is applied for load flow analysis to get the voltage and load angle for each bus in 30 <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> and 52 <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> An optimization technique is used for getting optimal values in this transmission planning. Differential evolution algorithm technique is used as optimization technique in this planning. This optimization technique is applied to 30 <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> and 52 <b>bus</b> <b>system.</b> Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of distributed generators in microgrid planning...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>system</b> {{performance}} {{varies from}} city to city, and experience clearly indicates that simply increasing the size of bus fleet cannot always improve <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> performance. It is therefore necessary to identify the major variables of <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> performance in different cities and implement a diversity improvement strategy based on actual problems that cities are facing. Two new indicators, annual average bus trips per capita and average daily ridership per bus, are proposed to respectively describe two aspects of <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> performance: willingness to travel and operational efficiency. According to these two indicators, 645 cities in China are classified into four types: cities with good performance in both aspects; in only one aspect; and in neither aspect. Then, based on panel data attained during 2002 – 2008, the impacts of the variables on willingness to travel and operational efficiency in different city types are analyzed by the variable coefficient model. The {{results show that the}} impacts of urban geography, economic conditions, and <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> facility vary among the four city types. Bus ownership ratio has a significant positive impact on improving willingness to travel for the cities with insufficient <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> facility. However, the impact decreases in the cities with well-developed facilities, whereas the operational efficiency suffers from negative impact due to the excess in <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> facility. In addition, the development characteristics of the cities that are improved both in willingness to travel and operational efficiency in each city type during 2002 – 2008 are discussed. The findings can help local governments make more specific, reasonable and efficient strategies to promote <b>bus</b> <b>system</b> performance...|$|R
