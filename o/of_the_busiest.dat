40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithmic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period for <b>the</b> M/M/c queueing system. By setting <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period {{equal to the}} time interval during which at least one server is busy, we develop a first step analysis which gives <b>the</b> Laplace-Stieltjes transform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period as <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> a finite system of linear equations. This approach is useful in obtaining a suitable recursive procedure for computing <b>the</b> moments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> a <b>busy</b> period and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> customers served during it. The maximum entropy formalism is then used to analyse what is <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> a given set <b>of</b> moments on <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period and to estimate <b>the</b> true <b>busy</b> period distribution. Our study supplements a recent work of Daley and Servi (1998) and other studies where <b>the</b> <b>busy</b> period <b>of</b> a multiserver queue follows a different definition, i. e., a <b>busy</b> period is <b>the</b> time interval during which all servers are engaged. ...|$|R
