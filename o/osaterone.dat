50|$|<b>Osaterone</b> (developmental {{code name}} TZP-5258), {{also known as}} 17α-hydroxy-6-chloro-2-oxa-6-dehydroprogesterone, as well as 2-oxachloromadinone, is a steroidal {{antiandrogen}} and progestin that was never marketed. The C17α acetate ester of <b>osaterone,</b> <b>osaterone</b> acetate, in contrast, has been marketed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Osaterone</b> acetate (brand name Ypozane; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} TZP-4238), {{also known as}} 17α-acetoxy-6-chloro-2-oxa-6-dehydroprogesterone, as well as 2-oxachloromadinone acetate, is a steroidal antiandrogen and progestogen used in veterinary medicine in Europe {{in the treatment of}} benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in dogs. It was also investigated in Japan in the treatment of prostate cancer and BPH in humans but was never marketed for these indications. <b>Osaterone</b> acetate produces remission of clinical symptoms of BPH in ~83% of dogs for six months after a single one-week course of treatment, and can be used long-term. It is a 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative and a derivative of the less potent chlormadinone acetate. The drug is the C17α acetate ester of <b>osaterone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Osaterone</b> acetate has {{virtually}} no estrogenic or androgenic activity. However, it can decrease cortisol levels, interfere with adrenocorticotropic hormone response, induce or exacerbate adrenal insufficiency, and exacerbate diabetes mellitus, side effects indicative that it possesses clinically relevant glucocorticoid properties. Other {{side effects of}} <b>osaterone</b> acetate include diminished sperm quality (for up to 6 weeks post-treatment), transient elevation of liver enzymes (caution should be observed with known liver disease), vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria/polydipsia, lethargy, and hyperplasia of the mammary glands. The drug has a long half-life of 197 ± 109 hours in dogs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Osaterone</b> acetate (Ypozane): A {{combined}} AR antagonist and progestogen/antigonadotropin. Used in {{veterinary medicine}} only. Marketed in Europe {{specifically for the}} treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia in dogs. Has been associated with transiently elevated liver enzymes.|$|E
50|$|DMA is a {{progestogen}} with antigonadotropic {{and hence}} antiandrogenic and antiestrogenic effects. In addition, DMA binds to the androgen receptor, and likely {{acts as an}} antagonist of this receptor similarly to related drugs like chlormadinone acetate and <b>osaterone</b> acetate.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to their progestogenic activity, some progestins are antagonists of the androgen receptor {{and can be used}} therapeutically as antiandrogens. These progestins, with varying degrees of potency as antiandrogens, include chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, megestrol acetate, nomegestrol acetate, <b>osaterone</b> acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone.|$|E
5000|$|Antigonadotropins: {{drugs that}} {{suppress}} the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced release of gonadotropins and consequent activation of gonadal androgen production. Examples include GnRH analogues like leuprorelin and cetrorelix, progestogens like chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, <b>osaterone</b> acetate (veterinary), and oxendolone, and estrogens like estradiol, estradiol esters, ethinylestradiol, conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin), diethylstilbestrol, and bifluranol.|$|E
50|$|CMA, {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxy-6-chloro-6-dehydroprogesterone or as 17α-acetoxy-6-chloropregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a chlorine atom at the C6 position, a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. Analogues of CMA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as cyproterone acetate, delmadinone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and <b>osaterone</b> acetate.|$|E
5000|$|Androgen {{receptor}} antagonists: {{drugs that}} bind directly to and block the AR. These drugs include the steroidal antiandrogens cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, chlormadinone acetate, spironolactone, oxendolone, and <b>osaterone</b> acetate (veterinary) and the nonsteroidal antiandrogens flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, topilutamide, and enzalutamide. Aside from cyproterone acetate and chlormadinone acetate, {{a few other}} progestins used in oral contraceptives and/or in menopausal HRT including dienogest, drospirenone, medrogestone, and nomegestrol acetate also have varying degrees of AR antagonistic activity.|$|E
50|$|DMA, {{also known}} as 1-dehydrochlormadinone acetate, as well as 1,6-didehydro-6-chloro-17α-acetoxyprogesterone or 6-chloro-17α-hydroxypregna-1,4,6-triene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a chlorine atom at the C6 position, a double bond between the C1 and C2 positions, another double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. Analogues of DMA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and <b>osaterone</b> acetate.|$|E
50|$|MGA, {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxy-16-methylene-6-dehydro-6-methylprogesterone or as 17α-acetoxy-16-methylene-6-methylpregna-4,6-diene-3,20-dione, is a {{synthetic}} pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically a derivative of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone with a methyl group at the C6 position, a methylene group at the C16 position, a double bond between the C6 and C7 positions, and an acetate ester at the C17α position. Analogues of MGA include other 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, delmadinone acetate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, and <b>osaterone</b> acetate. The only structural difference between MGA and megestrol acetate {{is the presence of}} the C16 methylene group in the former.|$|E
