25|$|In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, {{a series}} of {{variations}} of the bow fibula appeared in the southern Balkans, known variously as Greek, Macedonian, or Thracian bow fibulae. The high arched bow of these fibulae had large fins or knobs. The bow usually ended in a very large triangular or square <b>catch</b> <b>plate.</b> Some of the large square <b>catch</b> <b>plates</b> were decorated with complex incised geometric or figural designs. Some of the fibula had a flat back indicating that they were likely cast in simple, open moulds.|$|R

Reasonable agreement with experiment has been noted for the quasi-steady flow rate from an upright rectangular object that is heated on one face. The two-dimensional spread rate of the thermoplastic melt that has dripped onto a surface beneath the object has been measured experimentally for both horizontal and slightly tilted <b>catch</b> <b>plates.</b> The model agrees within 10 % to experimental results when further degradation of the melt along the <b>catch</b> <b>plate</b> is taken into account...|$|R

In many of these Leech Bow, or Sanguisaga, fibulae the <b>catch</b> <b>plate</b> became large and triangular.

50|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>catch</b> tank (can) is {{fitted in}} {{line of the}} crank case {{breather}} system. It is placed in between the breather outlet and the intake system. As the crank vapors pass through the catch tank (can) the oil droplets, un-burnt fuel, and water vapor condense and settle in the tank. This stops them from reaching the intake and causing the issues mentioned above.|$|R
50|$|Cars under 10 {{years old}} may emit {{not more than}} 1% carbon monoxide, and not more than 300ppm {{unburned}} hydrocarbons. Cars older than 10 years may emit up to 4.5% carbon monoxide and up to 1200ppm unburned hydrocarbons. This emission standard is {{laid out in the}} Japanese Emission Standard legislation. High flow catalytic converters are allowed. All oxygen sensors must be in working order along with any <b>oil</b> <b>catch</b> tanks. Exhaust noise is tested at a 45-degree angle, 50 cm from the tailpipe outlet. Vehicles up to 10 years old may emit not more than 96 decibels; older vehicles are allowed 103 dB.|$|R
50|$|Another {{issue that}} has been raised as a {{possible}} problem with allowing oil vapor into the intake is the chance of pre-detonation (Knock) caused by the oil vapor exploding during the compression cycle of the engine. This has become more of an issue {{as more and more}} cars have started to run high boost levels and high compression ratios. The higher the compression and boost the more likely the oil is to start to burn (Pre-Detonate)Fitting an <b>oil</b> <b>catch</b> tank (can) in the breather pipe will stop the oil vapors from reaching the combustion chamber. This will reduce the knock effect.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, the 8th and 7th centuries BC saw the {{introduction}} of the so-called Phrygian bow fibulae in Asia Minor. These fibulae had a near-perfect semi-circular arch sometimes decorated with knobs or round flanges. In the same period, the Hand or Arm fibula spread from Cyprus, where it appears to have originated, to Syria, Assyria and Persia. In this design the bow was bent 90 degrees at the apex giving the fibula a triangular shape when viewed from the side. The bow was usually decorated with a series of rings and dots. The <b>catch</b> <b>plate</b> usually had the form of a hand, making the entire fibula resemble an arm.|$|R

25|$|The Iron Age saw an {{expansion}} {{in the use of}} fibulae. The rounded bow fibula underwent several variations and were usually highly decorated with incised or moulded geometric designs. In one variation, the foot of the fibula that had previously terminated {{at the end of the}} arch with a simple <b>catch</b> <b>plate,</b> lengthened significantly. These extended foot fibulae, such as the Kahn type and the Pauken type, were found in the 7th to 5th centuries BC. The first long, bilateral springs appeared on some of these variants in the Hallstatt D2 era (5th century BC). These fibulae, such as the Doublezier type, looked similar to the Roman-era crossbow fibulae but were not the latter’s direct precursor.|$|R

50|$|The third-generation engine {{uses the}} (enthusiast-dubbed) Toyota CT20b turbo, which {{was of the}} same design as the second-generation but with a {{slightly}} improved turbine housing and larger compressor wheel. A factory BPV is installed on all applications. The intake charge is cooled by a water-to-air top-mounted intercooler similar in shape to the ST185RC WTA. One {{can tell the difference}} as the ST205 WTA is black while the ST185 WTA is silver with a black centre. This generation does away with T-VIS and uses a normal 4 runner intake with the same port shape and size as the NA engine (but with larger injector holes for side feed). The Air Flow Meter is also removed in favor of a MAP sensing system (prior generations used a MAP sensor only for the purpose of the factory boost gauge and determining overboost fuel cut). Various increases included injector size (540cc), boost (13psi), overboost fuel cut limit (18psi), intake cam lift (8.7mm), throttle body size (60mm), and a 10mm increase in exhaust ports. Exhaust valve lift is retained at 8.2mm. In late 1997, the block casting was revised with added support around the head to prevent block cracking problems. The CT20b turbo found in this generation is backwards compatible with the second generation motors, however not the first generation. Further improvements include a factory <b>oil</b> <b>catch</b> can. Compression is reduced down to 8.5:1 however power is improved to 245-255PS(242-251HP) and 304 N·m (224 lb-ft).|$|R

40|$|The Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) {{system in}} a car engine is {{designed}} to lower the pressure in the crankcase, which otherwise could lead to oil leaks and seal damage. The rotation of crankshaft in the crankcase causes the churn up of oil which conducts to occurrence of oil droplets which in turn may end in the PCV exhaust air intended to be re-injected in the engine admission. The <b>oil</b> <b>catch</b> can (OCC) is a device designed to trap these oil droplets, allowing the air {{to escape from the}} crankcase with the lowest content of oil as possible and thus, reducing the generation and emission of extra pollutants during the combustion of the air-fuel mixture. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to optimize the design of a typical OCC used in many commercial cars by varying the length of its inner tube and the relative position of the outlet from radial to tangential fitting to the can body. For this purpose, CFD parametric analysis is performed to compute a one-way coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian two-phase flow simulation of the engine oil droplets driven by the air flow stream running through the device. The study was performed using the finite volume method with second-order spatial discretization scheme on governing equations in the Solid Works-EFD CFD platform. The turbulence was modelled using the k-ɛ model with wall functions. Numerical results have proved that maximum efficiency is obtained for the longest inner tube and the tangential position of the outlet; however, it is recommended further investigation to assess the potential erosion on the bottom of the can under such a design configuratio...|$|R
