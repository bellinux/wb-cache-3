5|$|The Athenian {{commanders in}} Corinth, Iphicrates, who {{commanded}} the peltasts, and Callias, who commanded the hoplites, saw that an entire Spartan mora, or regiment, of 600 men was marching past the city unprotected by either peltasts or cavalry, {{and decided to}} take advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact.</b> Accordingly, the Athenian hoplites drew up a little outside Corinth, while the peltasts went after the Spartan force in pursuit, flinging javelins at the Spartan hoplites.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} {{prior to the}} Sugar Bowl, media {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's sudden rise to national prominence and Florida State's perennial appearance in the national championship game. The Seminoles had the most top-5 finishes and the most national championship game appearances of any team in the 1990s, including a national championship victory in 1993. Many media stories focused on the apparent David and Goliath showdown between the two teams, with the Seminoles {{in the role of}} the overdog and the Hokies {{in the role of the}} underdog. Because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact,</b> spread bettors favored Florida State to win the game by 5.5points.|$|E

5|$|John {{returns to}} the Resistance {{headquarters}} located aboard a nuclear submarine and is briefed by General Ashdown (Ironside) that the Resistance has discovered a hidden signal containing a code protocol which they believe can initiate a permanent shutdown of Skynet's machines. Working on this intelligence, the human militia plans to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco. It is decided among the Resistance that the offensive will commence in four days, due to an intercepted kill-list created by Skynet, which plans to terminate the Resistance's command staff within the same time frame. John learns he is second on this list, following Kyle Reese (Yelchin). The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance, but John knows Kyle will eventually travel {{back in time and}} become his father, and realizes that Skynet has learned <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> {{appears in}} the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 any number of times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E
5|$|Partially because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact,</b> {{ticket sales}} were slow. By December 23, Tech had sold just 6,500 of its 17,500-seat allotment, while Stanford fans had {{purchased}} 9,000 tickets from their allotment. These figures increased slightly {{as the game}} day approached, but the schools were hampered by several factors. The tickets assigned to the schools were in less-desirable seats, and many seats were available far more cheaply in the secondary market. In one example, an upper-deck ticket sold by Virginia Tech cost $65, while a similar ticket was available for $12 through an online ticket seller. The two schools were forced to purchase the remaining unsold tickets, costing each several hundred thousand dollars.|$|E

In the other direction, if the update rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function that is also bijective. This inverse function must be a cellular automaton rule. The proof <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous with respect to the Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E
5|$|The war {{was fought}} on two fronts, on land near Corinth (hence the name) and Thebes and at sea in the Aegean. On land, the Spartans {{achieved}} several early successes in major battles, but {{were unable to}} capitalize on their advantage, and the fighting soon became stalemated. At sea, the Spartan fleet was decisively defeated by a Persian fleet early in the war, an event that effectively ended Sparta's attempts to become a naval power. Taking advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact,</b> Athens launched several naval campaigns in the later years of the war, recapturing a number of islands that {{had been part of}} the original Athenian Empire during the 5th century BC.|$|E
5|$|What is now NY15 was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY4 when {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924. The route was renumbered to NY2 in 1927 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US4 in eastern New York. Modern NY15A, meanwhile, was only partially state-maintained by the mid-1920s. In 1926, only two sections of the route were state-owned: from Monroe Street west of Honeoye Falls north to Rochester, and the segment of highway in Livonia that modern NY15A shares with US20A. In spite <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact,</b> all of what is now NY15A was designated as NY2A, an alternate route of NY2 between Springwater and Rochester, in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York.|$|E

5|$|Navarin, {{named after}} the Battle of Navarino, was ordered on 24 April 1889 from the Franco-Russian Works and {{construction}} began on 13 July 1889 at their Saint Petersburg shipyard. The ship was laid down on 31 May 1890 and launched on 20 October 1891. She was transferred to Kronstadt in 1893 for fitting out, but did not enter service until June 1896 {{at a cost of}} over nine million rubles. Construction was seriously delayed by problems with the boilers and late deliveries of armor plates, the gun mountings, and other components, compounded by inefficiencies in building. One example of such was that the Russian armor plate company lacked the capacity to make gun port armor for the gun turrets of the required thickness, but the builder somehow lost track <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> and had to place a rush order with the French company of St. Chamond.|$|E
5|$|Zosimus {{provides}} the lengthiest {{account of the}} games (at Historia Nova 2.1–7), but does not mention Philip. The games had a starring role in Zosimus' scheme of Roman history. To him, the fortune of the empire was intimately related {{to the practice of}} the traditional civic rites. Any emperor who revived or supported those rites—Augustus, Claudius, Domitian, Septimius Severus—earns Zosimus' credit, while the emperor who ended them, Constantine I, earns his condemnation. All the misfortune of the 4th century can be directly attributed to Constantine's discontinuation of the old rites. In this context, Shahîd argues, Zosimus' silence on Philip's Christianity and Philip's involvement in the games makes sense. First, it would have given lie to his thesis on that the practice of the traditional rites guaranteed the fortunes of empire, since the period following the games was hardly a happy one (and this argument remains valid even if both Philip's Christianity and Zosimus' awareness of the tradition is denied). And second, it would have dulled his attack on Constantine by disentangling the potent alignment between imperial disaster, Christianity, and the traditional cult. The last emperor to celebrate the games was also the first emperor to embrace Christianity. The incongruity <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>fact</b> proved too much for the historian to handle, so he ignored it.|$|E
