In particular, the Manhattan Project could benefit enough from {{assistance}} from James Chadwick, the discoverer of the neutron, and one or two other British scientists to warrant the risk of revealing weapon design secrets. Bush, Conant and Groves wanted Chadwick and Peierls to discuss bomb design with Robert Oppenheimer, and Kellogg still wanted British comments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of the gaseous diffusion plant.|$|E

5|$|In late 1937, the D-1 series entered production. However, the DB 600Ga engine with 781kW (1,047hp) {{planned for}} this variant was instead {{allocated}} to Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 production lines. Heinkel then opted to use Junkers Jumo engines, and the He 111 V6 was tested with Jumo 210 G engines, but was judged underpowered.
