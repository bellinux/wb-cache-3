The article cites a study, conducted by Informa Telecoms and published by Radio Times magazine, that had collected television viewing data in 20 countries.

Adam Thomas, the media research manager responsible for the study explained that [...] "The objective <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>research</b> was {{to find the most}} consistently successful programme worldwide in terms of attracting viewers.

The first of these came on the last day <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>research,</b> when suddenly we dropped from the clouded surfaces of the earth to depths where the tube-line trains carry their passengers from one brilliantly lighted station to another. We took three of the different lines, experimentally, rather than necessarily, in going from St. Mary Woolnoth, in Lombard Street, hard by the Bank of England, to the far neighborhood of Stoke Newington; and at each descent by the company's lift, we left the dark above ground, and found the light fifty feet below. While this sort of transit is novel, it is delightful; the air is good, or seems so, and there is a faint earthy smell, somewhat like that of stale incense in Italian churches, which I found agreeable from association at least; besides, I liked to think of passing so far beneath all the superincumbent death and all the superambulant life of the immense immemorial town.|$|E
