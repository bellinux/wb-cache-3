500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced the decision to form a Second Australian Imperial Force. He further directed that all commands in the new 6thDivision would go to militiamen. Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey—who was appointed commander of the 6thDivision on 28September—selected Savige to command its 17thInfantry Brigade, the brigade from Victoria. Savige was given the AIF serial number VX13. He and Blamey had worked together when Blamey had commanded the 3rdDivision from 1931 to 1937, and Savige was [...] "almost fanatically loyal to Blamey through bad as well as good times". For regular officers, their exclusion from command positions was [...] "the final straw". Savige suspected—accurately in part—that Staff Corps officers were <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him.</b> A [...] "general atmosphere of criticism and derogation" [...] infected the force that would eventually sour relations between Blamey and some Staff Corps officers.|$|E
500|$|The character's {{narrative}} {{also included}} various feuds, most notably with the soap's lothario Den Watts, a family-friend who gets Pauline's daughter Michelle pregnant {{at the age}} of 16. EastEnders pulled in the biggest television audience of the 1980s when over 30million people watched the 1986 Christmas Day episode in which Pauline discovers that Den is the father of her granddaughter, Vicki. Wendy Richard has commented on the hostility between the characters [...] "once Pauline realised that Dennis was Vicki's father, she was <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> one way or another" [...] and actor Leslie Grantham, who played Den, added [...] "from then on it was out and out war, which was great!" [...] An array of confrontations between Den and Pauline occur, as she tries to force him to leave Walford and keep him away from her family. The feud appears to end in 1989 when the character Den is shot and presumed dead, but it is ignited once again in 2003 when Den is re-introduced, 14 years after he supposedly died. 2005 saw Den killed off for the final time, and although Pauline is not directly responsible for killing him, the item used to bludgeon him to death turns out to be her dog-shaped iron doorstop, which has been described as [...] "a nice touch of pathos".|$|E
2500|$|Aguiar pleaded {{no contest}} to drug charges in 2009 after police found {{marijuana}} in his car during a traffic stop in Florida. Aguiar publicly stated {{that the police were}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> and that [...] "When I got to the prison [...] took my kippah off and then tried to convert me to Christianity." [...] Aguiar hired Alan Dershowitz to represent him.|$|E

60|$|At {{last one}} day he had the {{happiness}} of possession again. He had exactly the sensation one gets when some hitherto intractable {{piece of a machine}} one is putting together, clicks neatly and beyond all hoping, into its place. He found himself working in the old style, with the hours slipping by disregarded. He sent <b>out</b> Durgan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> tobacco and tea and smoked-salmon sandwiches, and he stayed in the laboratory all night. He went home about half-past five, and found a white-faced, red-eyed Marjorie still dressed, wrapped in a travelling-rug, and crumpled and asleep in his study arm-chair beside the grey ashes of an extinct fire.|$|R
2500|$|Ed Frid (Jerry Schaefer) is Possum Lake's second {{animal control}} officer (the first being Garth Harble). [...] Ironically, he is deathly afraid {{of almost all}} animals and {{believes}} they are <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him.</b> [...] He is featured on The Red Green Show in the [...] "Talking Animals" [...] segment, in which Red tries {{to get him to}} show the audience a small animal, such as a weasel or a leech. Invariably, something goes wrong and causes Ed to panic, usually bringing an abrupt and comedic end to the segment.|$|E
2500|$|Corrupt county {{commissioner}} Jefferson Davis (J.D.) [...] "Boss" [...] Hogg, who either runs or has fingers in virtually everything in Hazzard County, is forever {{angry with the}} Dukes, especially Bo and Luke, for always foiling his crooked schemes. He is always {{looking for ways to}} get them out of the picture so that his plots have a chance of succeeding. Many episodes revolve around Hogg trying to engage in an illegal scheme, sometimes with aid of hired criminal help. Some of these are get-rich-quick schemes, though many others affect the financial security of the Duke farm, which Hogg has long wanted to acquire for various reasons. Other times, Hogg hires criminals from out of town to do his dirty work for him, and often tries to frame Bo and Luke for various crimes as part of these plots. Bo and Luke always seem to stumble over Hogg's latest scheme, sometimes by curiosity, and often by sheer luck, and put it out of business. Despite the Dukes often coming to his rescue (see below), Hogg forever seems to have an irrational dislike of the clan, particularly Bo and Luke, often accusing them of spying on him, robbing or planning to rob him, and other supposedly nefarious actions, as he believes they are generally <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
2500|$|His most {{prominent}} appearance came in [...] "Auto-Berserk" [...] alongside Inferno. After {{a battle with}} the Decepticons ended with Red Alert being damaged by one of Rumble's missiles, the Autobot became paranoid that Inferno {{and the others were}} <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him.</b> Red Alert deserted and teamed up with Starscream (who had been abandoned by the Decepticons on the battlefield and decided to take revenge on Megatron) to steal an Autobot device called the Negavator. The conspirators succeeded in sneaking in the secret bunker where the Negavator was placed. But then the alarm system had snapped into action, and the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, appeared in the bunker just in the moment when the two chums tried to move the weapon away. But the Decepticons, headed by Megatron, arrived there, too. Megatron demanded Starscream to hand over the Negavator to him, and the latter agreed hastily, with the purpose of avoiding his leader's wrath. But Red Alert refused to give up the weapon, and the recent allies began to fight. After a blast in the abdomen by Starscream's Null Ray cured his paranoia glitch, Red Alert realized what he had done and destroyed the Negavator, setting fire to the cavern they were in - and a guilty Inferno rushed into the fire to save Red Alert's life. After this, Red Alert realized who his true friends were.|$|E

Mowgli's old foe, the fierce tiger Shere Khan, is <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> revenge on <b>him,</b> being more determined to kill him than ever.|$|R

Lisa and Shannon focused on Phil as the best target to have a chance of saving Jarna, while Rick & Joe voted with their allegiances against Jarna. David considered voting Phil <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of <b>him</b> as a threat, but ultimately felt that he couldn't go against his friend and former couples partner.|$|R
500|$|The {{office workers}} {{are forced to}} use the stairs while the {{elevator}} is being serviced, a situation everyone deems [...] "Stairmageddon". A badly out-of-shape Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) undergoes a painful struggle in climbing the stairs, only to be greeted at the top by Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) ordering him {{to take part in}} an important sales call. Unwilling to climb the stairs a second time, Stanley refuses. Since the client is a friend of Stanley, Dwight (who is operating without concern for niceties now that the documentary has driven home the point that he will never be the branch manager at Dunder Mifflin) cannot take no for an answer, so he shoots Stanley with bull tranquilizers. With help from Clark Green (Clark Duke), Dwight <b>gets</b> Stanley <b>to</b> the car. The tranquilizers inexplicably make Stanley intoxicated, and his unusually jolly mood helps them close the sale. When Stanley regains full awareness, he is pleased to learn that he made a sale with no effort whatsoever, but still refuses to take the stairs again. He instead knocks himself out with one of Dwight's darts, leaving Dwight and Clark <b>to</b> figure <b>out</b> how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> back upstairs.|$|R

5000|$|Season 2 of Celebrity Rehab premiered on October 23, 2008. Pinsky saw {{musician}} Steven Adler as this season's [...] "problem child", {{describing his}} behavior as [...] "suicidal", and related that Adler {{had to be}} put into a psychiatric hospital for two weeks prior to going into rehab. Jeff Conaway was also a grave concern, according to Pinsky. Actor and recovering cocaine addict Gary Busey entered the program, claiming to do so not as a patient, but as a mentor to assist others in their recoveries. This was stated in his contract, and confirmed by VH1's official press release about Season 2. Pinsky disputes this, however, stating, [...] "I was confused too. But that's not my problem. My problem is that I've got a guy who needs help and I've got <b>to</b> figure <b>out</b> a way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> into treatment. Gary up having a really inspirational experience.

2500|$|Bosco [...] "B.A." [...] (Bad Attitude) Baracus is {{the muscle}} for the A-Team, {{able to perform}} amazing feats of strength. He is also the team's mechanic. B.A. affects a dislike for Murdock, calling him a [...] "crazy fool", but his true {{feelings}} of friendship are revealed when he prevents Murdock from drowning in his desire to live like a fish. B.A. also has a deep fear of flying, and the others usually have to trick and/or knock <b>him</b> <b>out</b> in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> on a plane. It is very rare that B.A. is awake while flying, and even rarer for him actually to consent to it. When he does, however, he then goes into a catatonic state. B.A. generally wears overalls and leopard or tiger print shirts in the early seasons, then later wears a green jumpsuit in the later seasons. He is almost always seen with about 50 pounds of gold necklaces and rings on every finger, and also wears a weightlifting belt. Baracus's hair is always styled in a mohawk-like cut. He drives a customized black GMC van, which is the team's usual mode of transport.|$|R
5000|$|A {{very common}} class of tales in Melanesia deals with cannibals and monsters, and our {{discussion}} of the general or more miscellaneous group of myths may well begin with examples of this type. As told by the Sulka, a Papuan tribe of New Britain, one of these stories runs as follows. Once there was a cannibal and his wife who had killed and eaten a great many persons, so that, fearing lest they should all be destroyed, the people resolved to abandon their village and seek safety in flight. Accordingly, they prepared their canoes, loaded all their property on board, and made ready to leave; but Tamus, {{one of the women}} of the village, was with child, whence the others refused to take her with them, saying that she would only be a burden upon the journey. She swam after them, however, and clung to the stem of one of the canoes, but they beat her off, compelling her to return to the deserted village and to live there alone. In due time she bore a son, and when he grew up a little, she would leave him in her hut while she went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> food, warning <b>him</b> not to talk or laugh, lest the cannibals should hear and come and eat him. One day his mother left him a dracaena-plant as a plaything, and when she was gone he said to himself, [...] "What shall I make out of this, my brother or my cousin?" [...] Then he held the dracaena behind him, and presently it turned into a boy, with whom he played and talked. Resolving to conceal the presence of his new friend. Pupal, from his mother, he said to her on her return, [...] "Mother, I want to make a partition in our house; then you can live on one side, and I will live on the other" [...] and this he did, concealing Pupal in his portion of the house. From time to time his mother thought that she heard her son talking to someone and was surprised at the quantity of food and drink he required; but though she often asked him if he was alone, he always declared that he was. At last one day she discovered Pupal and then learned how he had come from the dracaena. She was glad that her son now had a companion, and all three lived happily together.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} with {{us all the}} first day {{until late in the}} afternoon, when his mother took him <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> a boarding-house. Then he departed in the van of her and Naomi, pausing at the gate to collect his spirits, and, after he had sufficiently animated himself by clapping his palms together, starting off down the street at a hand-gallop, to the manifest terror of the cows in the pastures, and the confusion of the less demonstrative people of our household. Other characteristic traits appeared in Hippolyto Thucydides within no very long period of time, and he ran away from his lodgings so often during the summer that he might be said to board round among the outlying corn-fields and turnip-patches of Charlesbridge. As a check upon this habit, Mrs. Johnson seemed to have invited him to spend his whole time in our basement; for whenever we went below we found him there, balanced--perhaps in homage to us, and perhaps as a token of extreme sensibility in himself--upon the low window-sill, the bottoms of his boots touching the floor inside, and his face buried in the grass without.|$|E
