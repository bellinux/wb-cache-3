5|$|Mikan {{became so}} {{dominant}} that the NBA {{had to change}} its rules of play {{in order to reduce}} his influence, such as widening the lane from six to twelve feet ("The Mikan Rule"). He also {{played a role in the}} introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> clock; and in the NCAA, his dominating play around the basket led to the outlawing of defensive goaltending. Mikan was a harbinger of the NBA's future, which would be dominated by tall, powerful players.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins on}} the Ark, the {{spacecraft}} the Autobots use to flee their dying homeworld of Cybertron. On their journey, the Decepticons attack. Optimus Prime engages Megatron {{directly on the}} outer surface of the Ark. Ratchet sends Bumblebee to his aid and finds Optimus just as Megatron is about to deliver a finishing blow. He dives in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot,</b> taking the fatal hit for Optimus. The game then flashes back to six days earlier.|$|E
5|$|At 0:35, {{the camera}} {{cuts to the}} {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Shot.</b> A young man jumps {{in the air and}} pumps his fist as another young man in an opposing jersey sinks to the floor. The moment is from the 1989 NBA Playoffs, when Jordan hit a game-winning jump shot over Cleveland Cavaliers guard Craig Ehlo. At 0:38 is Jordan's last shot with the Chicago Bulls, after a crossover dribble past Utah Jazz guard Bryon Russell at the end of Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. These scenes are musically punctuated with a bass drum roll and a cymbal crash. Finally, at 0:44 a young man shrugs after hitting a shot, as Jordan shrugged after scoring six three-point field goals {{in the first half of}} Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E

40|$|With <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 94 Fifty {{technology}} we {{were able}} to analyze <b>the</b> three-point <b>shot.</b> We were curious to know whether <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> are recommended by <b>the</b> manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measuring system and carried out in preplanned intervals <b>of</b> entry angles, <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball, and <b>the</b> release time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball, and we wished to find out <b>the</b> consistency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned parameters between the guards and other players. The hypotheses were tested on a sample of 52 great male basketball players, aged 18 and 19. We deducted that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> from <b>the</b> distance <b>of</b> 6. 75 m occur under a entry angle greater than 42 °, but not in the estimated interval (between 42 ° and 48 °); that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> do not occur in <b>the</b> estimated interval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball (from 130 to 150 revolutions/minute); and that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> do not occur in <b>the</b> estimated interval <b>of</b> <b>the</b> release time (< 0. 7 seconds). When it comes to <b>the</b> consistency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> before mentioned parameters we did not find any discrepancies between the guards and other players. Based on the results a question arises: did <b>the</b> manufacturer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measuring system adequately form <b>the</b> intervals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned parameters or does the problem lie in <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> by <b>the</b> chosen players?...|$|R
5|$|Due to its nature, {{the episode}} {{featured}} many dangerous stunts utilizing fire. In {{the scene where}} Mulder and L'Ively confront each other {{at either end of}} a corridor in the Marsden family home, and L'Ively sets fire to the entire hallway, Mark Sheppard, who played L'Ively, ducked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> in order to protect himself from the intense heat. The only injury involved in the production was when David Duchovny burned his hand, leaving a small permanent scar. The character of Phoebe Green was considered as a recurring role, but this episode ended up being her only appearance.|$|E
5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the direction of the shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E
5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot,</b> but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E
5000|$|The company Effects Associated {{were hired}} by Cohen to supply some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special effects <b>shots.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> were delivered, Cohen was not {{satisfied}} with shots of exploding factory buildings and paid only half (c. $8,000) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreed price for those shots. Effects Associated brought an action against Cohen in court to claim full compensation, {{but also because the}} parties had no written copyright agreement regarding <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots.</b> <b>The</b> trial court decided in favor of Cohen, ruling that there was an [...] "implied agreement" [...] for <b>the</b> non-exclusive use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> in <b>the</b> film. <b>The</b> Court <b>of</b> Appeals for <b>the</b> Ninth Circuit confirmed the ruling, and confirmed that Effects Associated still retained the copyright for use outside <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Stuff.|$|R

5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} key for an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E
5|$|Owens did {{not have}} time to {{complete}} the shot before the Cannes screenings, but afterwards he used cineSync to conduct most of the work from home. The shot includes two blocks of computer-generated buildings that recede into the distance of a downtown set extension. As Collins disappears into the crowd about a minute into the shot, the live footage is gradually joined with more digital work. The streetcars, tracks and power lines were all computer generated. Live-action extras appear for the first minute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> before being replaced by digital ones. The shot was made more complicated by the need to add Massive extras. Owens constructed the scene by first building the digital foreground around the live action footage. He then added the background before filling the scene with vehicles and people.|$|E
5|$|Teams only {{averaged}} around 80 {{points per}} game {{in the years following}} the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1946. Before the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> clock, teams often ran out the clock by passing the ball more frequently after they established a lead in a game. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to regain possession. This resulted in very low-scoring games with many fouls, affecting attendance by making fans irritable. Starting in the 1954–55 season, the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock. If the offensive team fails to hit the rim with the ball within the allotted time, they would lose possession. This innovation resulted in much higher scoring games. All of the highest-scoring games in the NBA have happened during the shot-clock era.|$|E

5|$|With {{its form}} and {{structure}} in consideration, Rescued by Rover shows a growing understanding among directors of how stories {{can be told}} on film; that is, {{the belief that the}} audience does not need to see the family return to their home, but will instead assume this occurred while the beggar woman was returning to her hovel. While the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> does not correspond with the time necessary for the father and the family dog to travel back, it also does not affect the sense of realistic on-screen representation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the film}} opens a black Ferrari circles on a race {{track in the}} desert, its engine roaring in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> When it {{eventually}} stops, Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) steps out. Marco is a Hollywood actor who, despite his recent rise to fame, does not feel much meaning in his daily life. He resides at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles from where he completes various publicity obligations for his new film: he is photographed with his co-star (Michelle Monaghan), gives interviews to the press, and attends an award ceremony in Italy. Despite drinking and socializing occasionally with Sammy (Chris Pontius), a fellow actor and childhood friend, Marco spends much time alone, driving his Ferrari motorcar, drinking beer, taking pills, and having casual sex with various women. Twice he has pole-dancing twins (Kristina and Karissa Shannon) set up their equipment and perform in his room, {{the first time he}} falls asleep and the second routine is more calisthenic than erotic.|$|E
5|$|Digital Dimension {{worked on}} 200 visual effects {{shots in the}} film, {{including}} the sequence that shows characters John McClane and Matt Farrell crouching between two cars as another car lands {{on top of the}} other cars. To achieve this effect, a crane yanked the car and threw it in the air onto the two cars that were also being pulled by cables. The shot was completed when the two characters were integrated into the footage of the car stunt after the lighting was adjusted and CGI glass and debris were added. In the same sequence, John McClane destroys a helicopter that several of Gabriel's henchman are riding in by ramming it with a car. This was accomplished by first filming one take where one of Gabriel's henchman, Rand, jumps from the helicopter, and in the next take the car is propelled into the stationary helicopter as it is hoisted by wires. The final view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> overlays the two takes, with added CGI for the debris and moving rotor blades. The company also assisted in adding cars for traffic collisions and masses of people for evacuations from several government buildings.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950–51 NBA season, Mikan was {{dominant}} again, {{scoring a}} career-best 28.4 {{points per game}} in the regular season, again taking the scoring crown, and had 3.1 assists per game. In that year, the NBA introduced a new statistic: rebounds. In this category, Mikan also stood out; his 14.1 rebounds per game (rpg) was only second to the 16.4 rpg of Dolph Schayes of Syracuse. In that year, Mikan participated {{in one of the}} most notorious NBA games ever played. When the Fort Wayne Pistons played against his Lakers, the Pistons took a 19–18 lead. Afraid that Mikan would mount a comeback if he got the ball, the Pistons passed the ball around without any attempt to score a basket. With no shot clock invented yet to force them into offense, the score stayed 19–18 to make it the lowest-scoring NBA game of all time. This game was an important factor in the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> clock, which was introduced four years later. Mikan had scored 15 of the Lakers' 18 points, thus scoring 83.3% of his team's points, setting an NBA all-time record. In the post season, Mikan fractured his leg before the 1951 Western Division Finals against the Rochester Royals. With Mikan hardly able to move all series long, the Royals won 3–1. Decades later, in 1990, Mikan recalled that his leg was taped with a plate; however, despite effectively hopping around the court on one foot, he said he still averaged 20-odd points per game.|$|E
5|$|With {{six minutes}} remaining, the Knicks began {{intentionally}} fouling any Warrior except Chamberlain, keeping {{the ball out}} of the center's hands. New York also began moving the ball slowly and using as much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot</b> clock as possible to leave fewer opportunities for Chamberlain to score. Effectively, they played the opposite of what a normal club would do if they faced a deficit, willingly giving up many easy points instead of making attempts to rally back. Meschery said the Warriors lobbed the ball in from the sideline across the floor directly to Chamberlain, who would use his size and strength to get the ball. Chamberlain was the only Warrior to make a field goal in almost four minutes before Meschery made a jump shot at 4:15. Philadelphia began quickly fouling New York with around four minutes left, reciprocating the intentional foul strategy. Warriors coach Frank McGuire at one point pulled out his entire starting five, save Chamberlain, and replaced them with bench players. The intention was to foul the Knicks, get the ball back after free throws and give Chamberlain the ball. Thus each team spent the last minutes fouling each other. The Warriors ended with 25 personal fouls, and the Knicks with 32, and lost Imhoff and Willie Naulls with six fouls.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the first Test, West Indies were bowled out 296 as Grimmett took seven wickets, including Headley first ball. In the second innings, with West Indies 80 behind, Grimmett again attacked Headley's leg stump. After having his scoring restricted, Headley lost patience and after scoring 11 was stumped, trying to hit Grimmett. Bowled out for 249, West Indies lost by ten wickets. After scoring only three in the following tour match against Tasmania, Headley contributed 14 and two in an innings defeat in the second Test. After two heavy Test defeats for the tourists, some critics believed that the series was too one-sided and that some of the five Tests should be cancelled. Headley's poor run of form continued in the West Indian victory over Queensland and, having put on weight, he was also struggling with his fitness. In an effort to overcome Australia's leg stump attack Headley had altered his batting stance; instead of standing at right angles to the bowler, he turned his body more front-on, to enable him to improve his placement of the ball on the leg side. His quick footwork enabled him to alter his position if necessary to play the ball on the off side. He also eliminated from his strokes a risky cover drive he had developed on Caribbean pitches. During the third Test at Brisbane, Headley made his first substantial contribution to the series, after Australia scored 558 batting first. Facing Grimmett's leg side tactics, Headley managed to score freely, and forced Grimmett to alter to an off stump attack. With ten fours in total, Headley became the first West Indian to score a century against Australia, and was left 102 not out when West Indies were bowled out for 193. Forced to follow-on, West Indies were dismissed for 148 of which Headley made 28, the highest score of the innings. Ironmonger tricked him into playing the leg glance and he was caught by the wicket-keeper who had moved across in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

25|$|There is {{no single}} universally {{accepted}} stance, with a wide variation between players who compete at professional cuesports. However, {{there are a number}} of common characteristics: generally the back leg is braced while the front leg is slightly bent with the player leaning into the shot; the player's weight is evenly distributed, and the body remains still for the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot.</b> Many of the modern players face the line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shot,</b> while a more traditional stance would see the player twist their body so their back foot is at a right-angle to the shot.|$|E
