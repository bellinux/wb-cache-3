40|$|The {{spectral}} {{index of}} scalar perturbations {{is an important}} observable {{that allows us to}} learn about inflationary physics. In particular, a detection of a significant deviation from a constant spectral index could enable us to rule out the simplest class of inflation models. We investigate whether future observations could rule out canonical single-field slow- roll inflation given the parameters allowed by current observational constraints. We find that future measurements <b>of</b> a constant <b>running</b> (or <b>running</b> <b>of</b> the <b>running)</b> <b>of</b> the spectral index over currently available scales are unlikely to achieve this. However, there remains a large region of parameter space (especially when considering the <b>running</b> <b>of</b> the <b>running)</b> for falsifying the assumed class of slow-roll models if future observations accurately constrain a much wider range of scales...|$|R
