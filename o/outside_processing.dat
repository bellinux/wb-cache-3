40|$|The {{minerals}} {{industry is}} being driven to access multiple water sources and increase water reuse to minimize freshwater withdrawal. Bacteria-laden water, such as treated effluent, has been increasingly {{used as an}} alternative to freshwater for mineral processing, in particular flotation, where conditions are favorable for bacterial growth. However, the risk posed by bacteria to flotation efficiency is poorly understood. This could be a barrier to the ongoing use of this water source. This study tested the potential of a previously published risk-based approach as a management tool to both assist mine sites in quantifying the risk from bacteria, and finding system-wide cost-effective solutions for risk mitigation. The result shows that the solution of adjusting the flotation chemical regime could only partly control the risk. The second solution of using tailings as an absorbent was shown to be effective in the laboratory in reducing bacterial concentration and thus removing the threat to flotation recovery. The best solution is likely to combine internal and external approaches, that is, inside and <b>outside</b> <b>processing</b> plants. Findings in this study contribute possible methods applicable to managing the risk from water-borne bacteria to plant operations that choose to use bacteria-containing water, when attempting to minimize freshwater use, and avoiding the undesirable consequences of increasing its use...|$|E

Primarily, this is owing to the substantial bearing of immunities in the atmosphere which take up and scatter the light traveling to the observer from the scene point. Proposed scheme presents a new single image strategy {{for the betterment of}} the visibleness of degraded images through dehazing the affected images. The method is based on a fusion-based approach. Through the use of a white-balance along with a contrast enhancing procedure it derives two images from original hazy input image that is blurred. To blend expeditiously the knowledge of the inputs that are produced, their significant features are filtered by calculating three weight maps: luminance, chromaticity, and saliency, to maintain the areas with great visibility. The strategy is designed in a multiscale manner. In order to denigrate the artifacts acquainted by the weight maps, it utilizes a pyramidal representation. The strategic scheme performs a per-pixel manipulation. The experimental results show that the approach gives outcomes comparative to and even a lot better than more complex state of the art techniques, getting the reward of being beneficial for real-time applications where the data processing is fast adequate so as to sustain with an <b>outside</b> <b>processing.</b> As an extension to this strategy unsharp masking method for image dehazing is being used.

40|$|The interocular {{suppression}} technique termed continuous flash suppression (CFS) {{has become}} an immensely popular tool for investigating visual <b>processing</b> <b>outside</b> of awareness. The emerging picture from studies using CFS is that extensive processing of a visual stimulus, including its semantic and affective content, occurs despite suppression from awareness of that stimulus by CFS. However, the current implementation of CFS in many studies examining <b>processing</b> <b>outside</b> of awareness has several drawbacks {{that may be improved}} upon for future studies using CFS. In this paper, we address some of those shortcomings, particularly ones that affect the assessment of unawareness during CFS, and ones to do with the use of "visible" conditions that are often included as a comparison to a CFS condition. We also discuss potential biases in stimulus processing as a result of spatial attention and feature-selective suppression.

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} {{the influence of the}} familiarity of an environmental sound on sound <b>processing</b> <b>outside</b> the focus of attention. Methods: By comparing ERPs elicited by a familiar, animal sound and an acoustically matched, but unfamiliar, complex sound, three issues were addressed: (a) general differences in the processing of the familiar and the unfamiliar sound, (b) influences of sound familiarity on the processing of deviants unrelated to familiarity and (c) familiarity-specific processing depending on the Sound context. Participants watched a silent, subtitled movie. Results: The familiar sound elicited a centro-parietal enhancement of the N 1, a frontocentrally enhanced P 2 and an additional P 250. Auditory deviance processing elicited by deviants in Sound location was not influenced by the familiarity of the sounds. However, after an involuntary switch of attention to the deviant, an N 400 -like deflection indicated enhanced semantic analysis of the familiar deviant. Familiarity-specific ERP effects {{as a consequence of the}} sound context Occurred between 300 and 500 ms after stimulus onset. Conclusion: Whereas familiarity of an environmental sound elicited enhanced stimulus processing before 300 ms, influences of the sound context were observed subsequent to 300 ms.

In the current review, we discuss the How (i. e., mechanisms) and Where (i. e., locus of these mechanisms) of language control in language switching. As regards the mechanisms of language control, we describe several empirical markers of language switching and their relation to inhibition, as a potentially important mechanism of language control. From this overview it becomes apparent that some, but not all, markers indicate the occurrence of inhibition during language switching and, thus, language control. In a second part, we turn to the potential locus of language control and the role of different processing stages (concept level, lemma level, phonology, orthography, and <b>outside</b> language <b>processing).</b> Previous studies provide evidence for the employment of several of these processing stages during language control so that either a complex control mechanism involving different processing stages and/or multiple loci of language control have to be assumed.

40|$|Abstract. Recently a {{new class}} of {{generalised}} diffusion filters called osmosis fil-ters has been proposed. Osmosis models are useful for a variety of tasks in visual computing. In this paper, we show that these filters are also beneficial <b>outside</b> image <b>processing</b> and computer graphics: We exploit their use for the construc-tion of better numerical schemes for hyperbolic partial differential equations that model physical transport phenomena. Our novel osmosis-based algorithm is constructed as a two-step, predictor-corrector method. The predictor scheme is given by a Markov chain model of osmosis that captures the hyperbolic transport in its advection term. By design, it also incorpo-rates a discrete diffusion process. The corresponding terms can easily be identi-fied within the osmosis model. In the corrector step, we subtract a stabilised ver-sion of this discrete diffusion. We show that the resulting osmosis-based method gives correct, highly accurate resolutions of shock wave fronts in both linear and nonlinear test cases. Our work is an example for the usefulness of visual comput-ing ideas in numerical analysis.

Implementing packet processors in pipelined architectures is a well-known, established technique, albeit different approaches have been proposed. The design of packet processing pipelines is a delicate trade-off between the desire for abstract specifications, short development time, and design maintainability {{on one hand and}} very aggressive performance requirements on the other. This thesis proposes a coherent design flow for packet processing pipelines. Like the design process itself, I start by introducing a novel domain-specific language that provides a high-level specification of the pipeline.

I claim, based on experimental results, that my proposed technique can dramatically improve the design process of these pipelines, while the resulting performance matches the expectations of hand-crafted design. The considered pipelines exhibit a pseudo-linear topology, which can be too restrictive in the general case.
