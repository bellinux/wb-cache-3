5|$|Some {{majors and}} minors offer special {{academic}} programs. Completion {{of these programs}} does not result in any minor or other recognition. If a student wishes to enter a professional school after graduation, {{he or she may}} undertake one of the pre-professional programs offered. Internships are required for some majors, where students can experience life outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> however any student can enroll in an internship for elective credit.

For prospective engineers, the college has agreements with other schools through the cooperative engineering program.|$|E
5|$|After high school, Mitsuda {{decided to}} leave town and become independent. With {{encouragement}} from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school's low prestige, Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a first-hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training {{both in and out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team, studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba, whom Mitsuda would work with together on game projects decades later.|$|E

These were added for the scene where Bart tries {{to think of a}} name for his fictional letter writer, and sees a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their second choice, was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing up. At the end of the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided to try something different in filling a slight time under-run.|$|E

30|$|In the {{combined}} sample (all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms),</b> <b>the</b> Rasch measures explained 22.23 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variance in responses; this value {{is evidence of}} acceptable adherence to <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> unidimensionality for Rasch analyses, because it {{is higher than the}} generally accepted critical value of 20 % for analyzing potentially multidimensional instruments (Reckase 1979). Furthermore, we examined <b>the</b> inter-item correlations <b>of</b> model residuals within {{the combined}} sample; these values were less than 0.30.

40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was}} to examine the {{relationships}} between child temperament, teacher-child relationships, and teacher-child interactions in four preschool <b>classrooms.</b> <b>The</b> preliminary analyses revealed classroom differences for all variables. In all <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> except one, <b>the</b> temperament factor Reactivity had positive and high correlations with Conflict in the relationship. Task Orientation was positively correlated to the Closeness subscale in three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> In two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms,</b> Task Orientation was negatively correlated with the Conflict subscale. Behavior Management was the only teacher interaction behavior that was somewhat related to temperament in all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Although <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> temperament on each teacher was different, the results suggest that teachers’ relationships and interactions with children are affected by child temperament; however, there might be other factors affecting the relationships, such as teacher temperament.   The results and suggestions are discussed further in the article. </span...|$|R
25|$|Ira Shor, a {{professor}} at the City University of New York, provides for an example of how critical pedagogy is used in the classroom. He develops these themes in looking at the use of Freirean teaching methods {{in the context of the}} everyday life of classrooms, in particular, institutional settings. He suggests that the whole curriculum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> must be re-examined and reconstructed. He favors a change of role of the student from object to active, critical subject. In doing so, he suggests that students undergo a struggle for ownership of themselves. He states that students have previously been lulled into a sense of complacency by the circumstances of everyday life and that through the processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> they can begin to envision and strive for something different for themselves.|$|E
