50|$|Reaction of 2-Benzimidazolinone with {{isopropenyl}} acetate {{leads to}} the singly protected imidazolone derivative (2). Alkylation of this with 3-chloro-1-bromopropane affords the functionalized derivative (3). Alkylation of the monobenzhydryl derivative of piperazine (4) with 3 gives <b>oxatomide</b> (5), after hydrolytic removal of the protecting group.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of <b>oxatomide</b> β-cyclodextrin inclusion complex on the physicochemical properties and bioavailability of the drug. <b>Oxatomide</b> β-cyclodextrin solid complex was prepared with equimolar ratio of both <b>oxatomide</b> and β-cyclodextrin in presence or absence of water soluble polymers using different techniques. The coevaporated complex prepared in presence of PVP-K 15 showed a prompt drug release and significantly increased % dissolution efficiency compared to the pure <b>oxatomide.</b> Moreover, the results of bioavailability evaluation of this complex in rabbits compared to commercial drug product indicated a 73. 15 % increase in the oral bioavailability of <b>oxatomide.</b> In conclusion, inclusion complex of <b>oxatomide</b> with β-cyclodextrin prepared by coevaporation in presence of PVP-K 15 not only results in an enhancement of the <b>oxatomide</b> dissolution rate but also improves the bioavailability of <b>oxatomide...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Oxatomide</b> at {{therapeutic}} doses generates occasionally drowsiness in children. When administered at toxic doses, however <b>oxatomide</b> {{may induce}} long lasting impaired consciousness. We now report {{a case of}} severe long lasting impaired consciousness induced by therapeutic doses of <b>oxatomide</b> occurring in a child affected by acute gastroenteritis. The clinical symptoms, the pharmacogenetic tests of polymorphisms in cytochrome P 450 metabolizing enzymes (CYPs) and the clinical and laboratory analyses indicate that the enhanced drug sedative effect is likely due to an acute, yet mild, inflammatory state of the patient. These findings highlight the importance of assessing common, not serious inflammatory states when <b>oxatomide</b> is prescribed in paediatric patients...|$|E
40|$|Human {{cutaneous}} {{mast cells}} and their experimental model rat peritoneal mast cells, can be stimulated by an IgE-dependent process or by peptides through the direct activation of G proteins. Both activation pathways {{lead to the}} increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + level. This increase in dependent of the mobilisation of intracellular calcium stores of the endoplasmic reticulum involving the stimulation of IP 3 -sensitive calcium channels. Mast cells are characterized {{by the absence of}} calcium channels in the plasma membrane. <b>Oxatomide</b> has been synthetized as an analog of cinnarizine. However <b>oxatomide</b> is inactive on current calcium channels. In mast cells, <b>oxatomide</b> inhibits the increase of cytosolic calcium elicited during mast cell activation. Consequently mast cell exocytosis is inhibited altogether with the release of newly synthetized mediators. The authors propose several putative targets for <b>oxatomide</b> in mast cells. The therapeutic effect of <b>oxatomide</b> is also related to its property to antagonize the effects of anaphylactic mediators on their selective receptors...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{antiallergic}} drug, <b>oxatomide</b> (60 mg daily), was compared with the antihistaminic, mequitazine (10 mg daily), in a 5 -week double-blind randomized study involving 26 patients with chronic urticaria. In the 13 oxatomide-treated patients, papules, erythema and pruritus were significantly suppressed after 2 weeks, which was markedly more rapid than with mequitazine. Slight somnolence was reported by 3 patients on <b>oxatomide</b> and 1 on mequitazine; in the latter case, severe urine retention was also reported. Another patient on mequitazine had to discontinue treatment because of severe drowsiness. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oxatomide</b> is an {{antiallergic}} drug with {{a double}} mechanism of action: it possesses antagonistic activity on the H 1 histaminergic receptor and it inhibits the production and release of flogistic and allergic mediators by effector cells, presumably acting as a selective calcium channel blocker on these cellular types. The efficacy and safety of <b>oxatomide</b> have been evaluated in many studies conducted on patients affected by different clinical conditions, demonstrating remarkable flexibility. It proved {{to be safe and}} effective also in extreme ages, i. e. children under 3 months of age and elderly over 80 years. Approved indications include rhinitis, asthma, conjunctivitis, urticaria, atopic and allergic dermatitis and food allergy and intolerance. In direct comparisons, <b>oxatomide</b> consistently proved superior than placebo and equally or more effective than other consolidated antiallergics. The drug tolerability is good, its main side effects are drowsiness and weight gain, usually transient. Cardiac and hepatic safety data are very reassuring, as is the case for drug interaction potential. Form an economical point of view, the drug acquisition cost is acceptable, being among the lowest in its class, at equally effective doses. Overall, the efficacy in several clinical conditions, the good tolerability in most patients and the reasonable purchase cost suggest that <b>oxatomide</b> is characterized by excellent risk-to-benefit and cost-to-benefit ratios in the treatment of allergic pathologies...|$|E

40|$|The {{antiallergic}} drug <b>oxatomide</b> and analogs inhibit mediator {{release from}} a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL- 2 H 3) cell line, which is frequently {{used as a}} mast cell model. By investigating a series of derivatives of <b>oxatomide</b> with different inhibiting activities on exocytosis, we aimed to evaluate the role of their effects on the early steps of the signal transduction cascade in the inhibition of exocytosis. The active compounds induced hyperphosphorylation of tyrosine residues both in stimulated {{as well as in}} resting cells. Furthermore, some elevation of the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) formation upon antigen activation was observed for the active derivatives. Ca 2 + fluxes were also studied. The inhibition of the antigen-induced Ca- 45 (2 +) influx correlated with the effects of the drugs on exocytosis. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity on antigen- and thapsigargin-mediated exocytosis correlated well. Adherence of the cells to fibronectin, stimulating cellular integrin receptors, was synergistic to antigen activation of the RBL cells. However, <b>oxatomide</b> did lack any effect on integrin-mediated processes, as the IC 50 value for exocytosis was identical for fibronectin-adhered cells and standard cultured cells. We conclude that <b>oxatomide</b> and its analogs inhibit exocytosis, mainly by inhibiting Ca 2 + influx over score operated Ca 2 + (SOC) channels. The drugs have a direct effect on the store operated Ca 2 + channels or affect the direct regulation of these channels. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{evaluated}} the efficacy and tolerability of <b>oxatomide</b> {{in patients with}} atopic dermatitis, caused by alimentary allergy established by prick test and/or Rast and/or challenge test. METHODS: In the study, carried out in a paediatric clinic, 40 children (24 males, 16 females), aged between 6 months and 12 years, were randomized in two groups. Twenty children were treated with <b>oxatomide</b> (1 mg/kg/day) in one evening dose and the other 20 were treated at the same dosage, divided into two administrations. In the case of poor therapeutic response, 15 days {{after the start of}} treatment, it was possible to double the dosage. The skin symptoms were monitored for the efficacy. RESULTS: For all symptoms there was a significant reduction of severity within the fifteenth day (p < 0. 01). Twenty eight children showed significant improvement with the disappearance of both cutaneous lesions and itching; to achieve these results in four cases (3 BID, 1 UID) it was necessary to double the dose (2 mg/kg/day). Eight children achieved a fair control of itching, with a slight improvement of eczema, while five children, despite the increase in dosage of the drug, did not get any substantial benefit. Three children were lost in follow-up, while in another case treatment was suspended because of the onset of an urticarious rash. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the efficacy of <b>oxatomide</b> in the control of itching connected with alimentary allergy independently of the posological scheme. Tolerability was excellent in both groups and no important side-effects were recorded...|$|E

40|$|Shigemi Yoshihara Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan Abstract: Pranlukast hydrate is a potent, selective, orally active, cysteinyl {{leukotriene}} antagonist that binds at the type 1 receptor. It {{is used as}} a 10 % dry syrup to treat asthma and allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients. In a 4 -week, dose-finding study, a dose-dependent improvement in lung function was observed in pediatric patients with asthma at an optimal dose of 5. 1 – 10 mg/kg/day. In a comparative, randomized, double-blind, 4 -week multicenter trial, pranlukast dry syrup 7 mg/kg/day achieved significantly better final overall improvement (71. 4 %) versus <b>oxatomide</b> 1 mg/kg/day (37. 2 %) in pediatric patients older than one year with asthma. In two 12 -week, open-label trials and in a long-term open-label trial of treatment for up to 24 months, pranlukast dry syrup improved asthma control over baseline values. In a prospective post-marketing surveillance study and a long-term follow-up study, the safety and efficacy of pranlukast dry syrup was confirmed in infants younger than one year with bronchial asthma. In a 4 -week, open-label trial, pranlukast dry syrup improved overall health-related quality of life and physical and emotional domain scores over baseline in pediatric patients with asthma. In a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover trial, pranlukast dry syrup significantly inhibited exercise-induced bronchospasm in children with asthma compared with placebo. In a modified Childhood Asthma Control Test, pranlukast dry syrup was significantly more effective in controlling asthma in patients younger than 4 years with the common cold. These findings show that pranlukast is useful and beneficial for treating pediatric patients with bronchial asthma. Keywords: pranlukast, leukotriene receptor antagonist, pediatric asthm...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Spontaneous {{reporting}} systems (SRSs) are pivotal for signal detection, especially for rare events {{with a high}} drug-attributable component, such as torsade de pointes (TdP). Use of different national SRSs is rarely attempted because of inherent difficulties, but should be considered {{on the assumption that}} rare events are diluted in international databases. Objective: The aim was to describe TdP-related events associated with antipsychotics, H 1 -antihistamines and anti-infectives in three national SRSs (in Italy, Germany and France) and highlight potential signals of torsadogenicity through a combined literature evaluation. Methods: A common search strategy was applied to extract TdP-related events: (1) TdP, (2) QT interval abnormalities, (3) ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia, and (4) sudden cardiac death. Signals of disproportionate reporting (SDRs) were calculated for TdP + QT interval abnormalities and defined by a lower limit of the 95  % confidence interval of the reporting odds ratio (ROR) > 1. Among SDRs with at least three cases without concomitant pro-arrhythmic drugs, we defined potential new signal of torsadogenicity as drugs with no published evidence from (a) the crediblemeds® website ([URL] as of November 1 st, 2014); (b) studies on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS); and (c) safety trials or pharmaco-epidemiological studies (as of December 16 th, 2014). Results: Overall, 3505 cases were retrieved (1372, 1468, and 801 for France, Germany and Italy, respectively). Antipsychotics were mainly recorded in Germany (792 cases), whereas antibiotics peaked at 515 and 491 (France and Italy, respectively). Forty-one drugs met criteria for SDRs in at least one single source, of which 31 were detected only from one single SRS: 18, ten and three (French, German and Italian SRS, respectively). By contrast, only five SDRs were detected in all national data sources (amisulpride, aripiprazole, haloperidol, olanzapine, risperidone). Overall, five potential new signals of torsadogenicity were identified: flupentixol, ganciclovir, levocetirizine, <b>oxatomide</b> and tiapride. Conclusions: We found differences across and within national SRSs in the reporting of drug-induced TdP, which finally resulted in five potential new signals of torsadogenicity. These findings warrant targeted pharmacovigilance studies to formally assess the existence of actual drug–event associations...|$|E
30|$|Induction and {{completion}} of acute of acute inflammatory responses always require participation of lysosomes and proper recycling of proteins and lipids of phagocytised materials, expression of lysosomal hydrolases and proteases during autophagy. Among numerous biological alterations that occur under oxidative stress and aging, the body’s ‘self-eating’ processes of lysosomes and associated impaired activities in mitochondria or Golgi play crucial roles in homeostasis of immunity or immunosenescence, chronic diseases or cancer [5, 39, 88, 89, 126, 184, 220]. For example, the early events in stimuli-induced activation of MCs via receptor (FcεR) aggregation and degranulation (pharmacological effects) require membrane fusion for exocytosis of granules. The processes involve secretory lysosomal activities and expression of several protein receptor molecules, {{at different stages}} of membrane fusion and require ATP hydrolysis and mobilization of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores. Lysosomal exocytic activities are triggered following an increase in free Ca 2 + (cation) concentration, acidified by H+/ATPase hydrolysis for fusion and flux at the plasma membrane level [5, 39, 88, 89, 184, 220]. The complex pathways during degradation, clearance and recycling of proteins require energy-dependent biosynthesis of a number of acidic hydrolases or proteases and surface molecule, signaling within lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and mitochondria [5, 38, 39, 88, 89, 92, 143, 144, 150, 152, 169, 171, 180 – 184, 192]. These interdependent catabolic and anabolic activities are universal in living cells and influenced by aging and disease processes. Data using inhibitors of MCs degranulation, antihistamine agents, oxidative phosphorylation or glycolytic pathways (e.g., glucose or pyruvate oxidation), under a wide range of immune dysfunction or carcinogenesis suggest that MCs activation and release of histamine and other preformed or newly synthesized mediators, require activation of lysosomal exocytosis and Ca 2 + flux from the stored-operated Ca 2 + channels as part of effector function of MCs. Use of antihistamine or anti-allergic agents (e.g., <b>oxatomide,</b> astemizole, olopatadine) in the in vitro models of allergies or basophilic leukemia cells (RBL- 2 H 3) seem to suppress one or a combination of interdependent MCs responses such as inhibition of AA pathways, cytokines (e.g., IL- 4) or Ca 2 + influx through receptor-operated channels (ROC), phosphorylation of P 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase, pathways that are involved in IL- 4 gene expression and tumorigenesis (anabolic pathways?).|$|E
