5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique <b>of</b> <b>Political</b> Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique <b>of</b> <b>Political</b> Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique <b>of</b> <b>Political</b> Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique <b>of</b> <b>Political</b> Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E

Such definition <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> we can find in C. Schmitt’s political philosophy and H. Plessner’s philosophical anthropology. Although this definition mostly pays attention to the antagonistic dimension <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> world, we need to understand an essence <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> friendship. Thus author analyzes different conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> friendship that have been presented in the works of Aristotle, J. Derrida, H. Arendt.

40|$|Carl Schmitt's Concept <b>of</b> the <b>Political</b> {{advances}} {{an understanding}} <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> {{in which the}} political is assessed {{in terms of the}} autonomy of the friend-and-enemy distinction. This article questions the autonomous foundations of Schmitt's concept <b>of</b> the <b>political.</b> Ultimately, Schmitt's desire to establish the autonomous nature <b>of</b> the <b>political,</b> allowing the specifically political antithesis to achieve mastery over all other forms of discourse, is replete with paradox. Whilst Schmitt endeavours to establish the autonomy of the politicalwhere the political is free from interference from other domainsit is argued that his account <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> is highly dependent on the state. More critically, Schmitt's depiction <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> as autonomous is a strategic manoeuvre to establish the autonomy of the domain <b>of</b> the <b>political</b> vis-a-vis other conceptual domains...|$|R
