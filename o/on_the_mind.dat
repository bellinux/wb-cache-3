The Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova (Imagining the Balkans, 1997) presented the ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms (Ethnologia Balkanica, 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} with Chart House <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of the company's board in 1978, Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements. New owners {{were barred from}} living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company {{to take over the}} operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line {{was one of the first}} attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend more on a higher quality product. The new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15%.|$|E

This study aims at finding out what kind of imagery and images are employed in the book and how far they succeed in bringing about pictographic impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of <b>the</b> students. Content analysis of the poems in qualitative paradigm was adopted for this study. Direct and indirect interviews of the students were also conducted. It was found out that the poems of the book contained all pervasive versatile imagery. Moreover, the images and imagery had verbal as well as visual impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> of <b>the</b> students that helped them improve their memory, increase their vocabulary, enhance comprehension, and develop interest in reading...|$|R

25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E
25|$|Swiss {{psychiatrist}} Carl Jung, {{influenced by}} Freud, elaborated {{a theory of}} the collective unconscious—a primordial force present in all humans, featuring archetypes which exerted a profound influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind.</b> Jung's competing vision {{formed the basis for}} analytical psychology, which later led to the archetypal and process-oriented schools. Other well-known psychoanalytic scholars of the mid-20th century include Erik Erikson, Melanie Klein, D. W. Winnicott, Karen Horney, Erich Fromm, John Bowlby, and Sigmund Freud's daughter, Anna Freud. Throughout the 20th century, psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools of thought which could be called Neo-Freudian. Among these schools are ego psychology, object relations, and interpersonal, Lacanian, and relational psychoanalysis.|$|E
25|$|His {{experiences}} during World War I undeniably left a deep {{impression on}} his psyche. The reality of war <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> is especially explored {{in his novel}} Doberdob. Voranc wished to convey to his reader the realism {{of the situation in}} which his characters lived and there is little that is sentimental about his depictions. Voranc preferred to write about the impoverished peasant and industrial working class against the impressionistic backdrop of a land that sometimes colludes against the peasant. His socialist leanings are key to understanding his later work. During the 1930s, while living away from his homeland, he became more aware of international socialism, although he adapted realism in his work to suit Slovene sensibilities.|$|E

25|$|One of Simmel's {{most notable}} essays is The Metropolis and Mental Life (Die Großstadt und das Geistesleben) from 1903, which was {{originally}} given {{as one of}} a series of lectures on all aspects of city life by experts in various fields, ranging from science and religion to art. The series was conducted alongside the Dresden cities exhibition of 1903. Simmel was originally asked to lecture on the role of intellectual (or scholarly) life in the big city, but he effectively reversed the topic in order to analyze the effects of the big city <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of the individual. As a result, when the lectures were published as essays in a book, to fill the gap, the series editor himself had to supply an essay on the original topic.|$|E
25|$|The {{journals}} of the reigns of George IV and William IV, extending from 1817 to 1837, {{were published in}} obedience to his directions almost ten years after his death. Few publications have been received with greater interest by the public; five large editions were sold {{in little more than}} a year, and the demand in America was as great as in England. These journals were regarded as a faithful record of the impressions made <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of a competent observer, at the time, by the events he witnessed and the persons with whom he associated. Greville did not stoop to collect or record private scandal. His object appears to have been to leave behind him some of the materials of history, by which the men and actions of his own time would be judged. He records not so much public events as the private causes which led to them; and perhaps no English memoir-writer has left behind him a more valuable contribution to the history of the 19th century. Greville published anonymously, in 1845, a volume on the Past and Present Policy of England in Ireland, in which he advocated the payment of the Roman Catholic clergy; and he was also the author of several pamphlets on the events of his day.|$|E
500|$|The best-known {{songs from}} the opera include [...] "I'm called Little Buttercup", a waltz tune {{introducing}} the character, which Sullivan repeats in the entr'acte and in the Act II finale to imprint the melody <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of the audience; and [...] "A British tar" [...] (a glee for three men describing the ideal sailor), composed by Sir Joseph [...] "to encourage independent thought and action in the lower branches of the service, and to teach the principle that a British sailor is any man's equal, excepting mine". Sullivan's voicing advances the satiric lyric, which mocks the [...] "equality" [...] plays while underlining the hypocrisy of Sir Joseph. Another popular number is Sir Joseph's song [...] "When I was a Lad", recounting the meteoric rise of his career, which bears similarities to that of W. H. Smith, the civilian news entrepreneur who had risen {{to the position of}} First Lord of the Admiralty in 1877.|$|E

The movie makes a case for itself through sheer oddness and perversity. I'm not sure Confessions is a good movie, but I am sure I like it." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing in Entertainment Weekly, observed that [...] "Sam Rockwell is handsome in a rumpled, slightly goofy rabbit-toothed way, but he doesn't really have the look, or aura, of a movie star," [...] Glieberman stated. [...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8. All of which makes him an inspired choice to play Chuck Barris." ...|$|E
500|$|But Hazlitt goes further, {{to develop}} an idea that only much later was seen to have radical {{implications}} for literary theory: he claims {{that it is of}} the very nature of poetry to glorify the aristocrat, the solitary hero, and the monarch, while being much less suited to represent, in ways that capture the imagination, the social problems of the common people. Poetic [...] "imagination naturally falls in with the language of power. The imagination is an exaggerating and exclusive faculty: it takes from one thing to add to another: it accumulates circumstances together to give the greatest possible effect to a favourite object." [...] On the other hand, the language that would be used to argue the cause of the people relies more on [...] "the understanding", which [...] "is a dividing and measuring faculty: it judges of things not according to their immediate impression <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> but according to their relations to one another. [...] Poetry [...] is right-royal. It puts the individual for the species, the one above the infinite many, might before right." ...|$|E
500|$|Going beyond {{specific}} characters, or even specific {{interactions among}} them, Hazlitt delineates {{what he calls}} the [...] "logic of passion", the rhythm of emotions in the drama, and its effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of the reader or viewer. [...] "We see {{the ebb and flow of}} the feeling, its pauses and feverish starts, its impatience of opposition, its accumulating force when it has had time to recollect itself, the manner in which it avails itself of every passing word or gesture, its haste to repel insinuation, the alternate contraction and dilatation of the soul, and all 'the dazzling fence of controversy' in this mortal combat with poisoned weapons, aimed at the heart, where each wound is fatal." [...] He observes, too, in explaining an instance of what later came to be called comic relief, how when the reader's feelings are strained to the utmost, [...] "just as [...] the fibres of the heart [...] are growing rigid from over-strained excitement [...] he imagination is glad to take refuge in the half-comic, half-serious comments of the Fool, just as the mind under the extreme anguish of a surgical operation vents itself in sallies of wit." ...|$|E

500|$|Gray, {{considered}} by Darwin {{to be his}} friend and [...] "best advocate", also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and {{to return to his}} faith. Gray saw nature as filled with [...] "unmistakable and irresistible indications of design" [...] and argued that [...] "God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change." [...] Darwin agreed that his theories were [...] "not at all necessarily atheistical" [...] but was unable to share Gray's belief. [...] "I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> of Newton," [...] he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, {{at a time when many}} on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it [...] "most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies". The result of all this is that Gray distanced himself from Social Darwinism. Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin's ideas.|$|E
