500|$|Philosophers who {{consider}} subjective experience {{the essence of}} consciousness also generally believe, as a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas Nagel spelled out {{this point of view}} in an influential essay titled What Is it Like to Be a Bat?. [...] He said that an organism is conscious [...] "if and only if there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism — something it is like for the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put <b>ourselves</b> <b>into</b> the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself. [...] Other thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent. [...] Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive — Donald Griffin's 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.|$|E

The Simpsons creator Matt Groening told TV Guide in 2000 that [...] "we [...] painted <b>ourselves</b> <b>into</b> a corner with our Christmas episode. Once we wrote the dog into the show, we were stuck with him." [...] The name [...] "Santa's Little Helper" [...] was chosen because, according to writer Al Jean in the same TV Guide article, [...] "we needed a name that would inspire Homer to bet on him, an omen, a Christmas name since he was betting on Christmas Eve. But, at that point, nobody was thinking long-term. We weren't considering what might happen in ten years, when we've got to use this name." [...] Although [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire" [...] was the first episode of the series to air on TV, it was the eighth episode produced by the staff. It was chosen to air first because there were animation problems with the others. Jean told the Houston Chronicle in 2001 that after the first episode was broadcast and [...] "the next seven didn't have the dog, people wondered why." [...] He also said in 2003 that the staff enjoyed the first episodes that centered on him, particularly [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which is the reason that more episodes about him were written.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the songwriting process, Rabin recalled the group used Abbey Road (1969) by The Beatles as a model and influence for the music on Big Generator.

If you can't come up with a chorus, don't throw it out because it's not a complete song and don't put a bad chorus around it". Such an approach led to the album having tracks longer than common pop songs of the time, peaking at seven minutes in length. Rabin described Kaye's role as a greater one than he had on 90125, but continual clashes between Kaye and Horn resulted in his keyboard parts recorded in another studio away from Horn.|$|E

We started off with no better equipment than the State, and with handicaps Imposed on us by the State., But throughout we had the advantages of business administration and of cleanliness.
