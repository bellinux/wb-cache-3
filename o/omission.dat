5|$|Fingleton {{was dropped}} after this Test, and was {{controversially}} overlooked for the 1934 tour of England despite strong performances for New South Wales. His <b>omission</b> {{was thought to}} be influenced by the belief that he was responsible for leaking Woodfull's comments as well as Bradman's criticism of his performance. Other factors speculated to have contributed to his <b>omission</b> included a dispute that Fingleton had with Woodfull during a Sheffield Shield match, and interstate rivalries between New South Wales and Victoria causing Fingleton's <b>omission</b> at the expense of an additional Victorian.|$|E

40|$|OBJETIVOS: (1) verificar se as omissões ortográficas ocorriam preferencialmente na sílaba completa ou em partes da sílaba; (2) caracterizar a distribuição das omissões de acordo com a posição silábica do elemento omitido; (3) em ambas as possibilidades, verificar se as omissões ocorriam preferencialmente em posições acentuadas ou não-acentuadas de palavras. MÉTODOS: dados extraídos de textos produzidos por pré-escolares de 5 - 6 anos. RESULTADOS: quanto ao primeiro objetivo, omissões de partes de sílabas foram significativamente mais freqüentes (p PURPOSE: (1) verify if orthographic <b>omissions</b> {{occurred}} {{mainly in}} the whole syllable or in syllable parts; (2) characterize the distribution of these <b>omissions</b> according to syllabic parts of the omitted graphemes; (3) in both possibilities, verify if such <b>omissions</b> mainly occurred in stressed or unstressed word positions. METHODS: data collected from texts produced by 5 to 6 -year-old Brazilian pre-school children. RESULTS: as for (1), <b>omissions</b> in syllable parts occurred significantly more often (p < 0, 0001). In (2), <b>omissions</b> in syllabic coda were statistically more significant (p < 0. 0000). While in (3), the stressed positions were relevant only to <b>omissions</b> concerning syllable parts (p < 0. 0000). CONCLUSION: the <b>omissions</b> in children writing are highly complex.

40|$|<b>Omissions</b> and {{additions}} are countered {{among the}} most invasive translation techniques. In this contribution we explore just how invasive {{they are and how}} often they occur in poetic translation. In search for answers an empiric study has been carried out on a small Russian-Dutch corpus comprising translated poetry of the Russian dissident poet Alexander Galich. The study also yields a typology for <b>omissions</b> and additions based on the cases found in the corpus. Trends concerning <b>omissions</b> and additions of repetitions have been discussed separately. The research shows that both translation techniques are actually less invasive than one would think. <b>Omissions</b> occur less often than additions and many <b>omissions</b> appear to be relatively neutral. In case of invasive <b>omissions</b> the translators are more prepared to sacrifice information rather than make the text more implicit. Additions with explicitation occur just as often as those with additional information. The use of both translation techniques may be motivated by poetic form, the translator’s personal preference but the main goal is to optimize the accessibility of the target text. A separate typology has been proposed for the <b>omissions</b> and additions of repetitions that mostly serve to preserve the source-text style or to boost lexical variation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- System {{development}} for software is {{in accordance with}} requirements specification. <b>Omissions</b> or errors in requirements specification cause <b>omissions</b> or errors in subsequent deliverables. Therefore, requirements elicitation work in order to prepare requirements specification {{is a very important}} process. However, {{it is very difficult to}} extract customer requirements for software development without <b>omissions</b> or errors, mainly because customers and software engineers (SE) do not share common knowledge resulting in <b>omissions</b> or errors in the requirements elicitation work due to poor mutual communication. Therefore, in this paper we are proposing a structure to navigate requirements elicitation work through interviews in order for SEs to elicit customer requirements without <b>omissions</b> or errors by using the interview technique. We are also conducting a comparative experiment in regards to the cases that requirements elicitation work is conducted by both utilizing and not utilizing this structure. As a result, we were better able to elicit customer requirements without <b>omissions</b> or errors in the case of the former rather than the latter; therefore we successfully verified that the structure proposed in this paper by utilizing this structure is effective...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{findings of}} a study conducted on Australian Sign Language (Auslan) /English interpreters in a university lecture, with consideration given to factors that influenced the interpreters’ <b>omissions.</b> The {{hypothesis of the study}} was that interpreters would make recourse to <b>omissions</b> both consciously and unconsciously, depending on their familiarity with the discourse environment and the subject matter. Through exploration of theoretical perspectives of interpreting and discourse studies, it is argued that interpreters use <b>omissions</b> as linguistic strategies for coping with the discourse environment. The findings of the study present interpreters with a new perspective on <b>omissions</b> in interpreting, which can be applied to both signed- and spoken-language interpreting. 26 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} if social distance, i. e. in- vs. out-group membership, {{had an effect}} on moral judgments of acts vs. <b>omissions.</b> 164 participants judged the morality of acts vs. <b>omissions</b> of lethal harm, that affected an in- vs. out-group member of the participant, in order to save five other people. The results showed that acts of lethal, but utilitarian, harm were judged more immoral than <b>omissions</b> of equivalent harm. It was also shown that if the victim was an in- group member of the participant the behavior was judged more immoral than if the victim was an out-group member of the participant. However, the acts and <b>omissions</b> of harm were not judged differently when the victim was an in. - vs. out-group member of the participant, indicating that this kind of social distance might not influence the moral judgment of acts and <b>omissions.</b> ...|$|R
5|$|There are no {{specific}} rules {{that apply to}} acts or omissions in homicide: an <b>omission</b> is criminal if the defendant fails to prevent the avoidable death of the victim {{where he or she}} has the duty to do so and that the defendant had the capacity to do so. As noted below, unlawful omissions have been excluded from unlawful act manslaughter. Like in other areas, a duty of care may now be owed, following R. v Evans, even where the dangerous situation which results in the victim's death was not caused by the defendant. Medical professionals may be relieved of their responsibility to sustain a patient's life, where terminating life support is dubiously legally classified as an <b>omission.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background Omitted doses {{are among}} the most common errors of {{medication}} errors in hospital. It is a need to identify the frequency of omitted doses and reasons for these to try to prevent them in the future. It is important to ensure all medication is available on the ward when needed and this can be evaluated by looking at different medicines management systems. Aim and objectives To identify recorded reasons for dosing <b>omissions</b> and evaluate the clinical significance of the <b>omissions</b> at individual patient level using an expert group of four clinical pharmacists. Describe the different medicines management systems by using process maps and compare the findings. Methods Reasons for dose <b>omissions</b> were recorded for several weeks in three different wards. Patients that had <b>omissions</b> recorded as Unavailable medicine were asked {{to take part in the}} study, and the clinical significance of these <b>omissions</b> was evaluated by an expert group. A suggestion for a guideline for nurses on what medicines that not should be omitted was developed by using results from this expert group meeting. Results A comparison of the three wards showed no significant differences in numbers of unavailable medicines, but other reasons turned out to be different. Of 74 cases of <b>omissions</b> presented to an expert group 21 was evaluated to category 2; Medicines that could cause major disturbance in symptom control and one in category 3; Major treat to stability of patients condition. Conclusion <b>Omissions</b> occur in different settings and can cause potential harm for patients. It is important to ensure that all medication is on ward when needed to avoid these types of <b>omissions.</b> The study identified that it is room for improvement in all three wards, but more and longer studies need to be carried out to be more conclusive in which changes that must me done...|$|R
