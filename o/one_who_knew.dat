500|$|The {{editorial}} ad– a Neiman-Marcus tradition {{introduced by}} his father in the store's early days– both defended the city against outside critiques and offered more intimate criticisms from <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> the town and its people well. The message said that Dallas needed to address four areas for community improvement: one, its slum problem; two, its political extremism (called [...] "absolutism" [...] in the text); three, {{too much attention to}} physical growth at the expense of [...] "quality" [...] in civic endeavors such as [...] "schools, colleges, symphonies, operas, and museums"; and four, a need to focus less on [...] "civic image" [...] and more on [...] "doing good things and not doing bad things", which he described as [...] "the best public relations." [...] In a 2003 article on the 40th anniversary of the assassination, Ralph Blumenthal of The New York Times praised the message as [...] "strik a perfect balance", though he notes the author met not only with support from some, but from canceled accounts and [...] "anti-Semitic attacks" [...] that only increased after an article in Life referenced Marcus's Jewish heritage.|$|E
500|$|Clarence {{did well}} in school, and upon his {{graduation}} from Waltham High School in 1903, he took the entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He passed, and after taking basic courses at the school, did advanced work in engineering. During the summers, he worked for J.B. Worcester & Co., a firm which had constructed much of the Boston subway system. While at school, he became a favourite pupil of Professor George Swain; after Howe graduated in 1907, Swain offered Howe a job as his teaching assistant. Howe accepted, although the young engineer felt that he should leave the Boston area to begin his career. Soon afterwards, Howe was offered an opportunity to become an engineering professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A popular story about Howe was that Swain had Howe and fellow engineer James Barker toss a coin to see who would get the job. Barker denied the tale later in life, stating he {{had no interest in}} the position and no <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Howe would be foolish enough to gamble with him, as Howe had shown himself to be uncommonly lucky. [...] In any event, Howe had no better prospects in sight; unemployment among his classmates was high due to the Panic of 1907.|$|E
500|$|Byrne Fone, a {{historian}} of homosexuality-related issues, emphasizes how the poem and the fictional discussion of Giraud and Byron's relationship reveal insights into 19th-century British views on homosexuality. To Fone, the poem {{was written by}} <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> Byron and reveals Byron's homosexuality. Fone also argues that the 1833 publication of the poem was prompted by the arrest of William Bankes, a homosexual friend of Byron, and the execution of Henry Nicholls for homosexual activity. [...] The opening lines of the poem mention [...] "crippled Talleyrand", William Beckford and William Courtenay. Fone argues that the references to Beckford and Courtenay are used both {{to talk about the}} unfair treatment of homosexual men who had committed no real crime, and to emphasise England's hypocrisy when it comes to sex. The poem then claims that England's treatment of homosexuals forces Don Leon to travel to Greece in order to fulfill his desires and be free of intellectual control, which is fulfilled when Don Leon is able to be with Giraud. The fictional Giraud, according to Fone, allows Don Leon to break free of the homophobia of England. The poem, as he points out, tries to convince Moore to mention Byron's homosexual desires. Fone concludes, [...] "It is not only the poem that is an effective attack on homophobic prejudice, but the example of the poet himself." ...|$|E

500|$|Groves's {{biggest concern}} was about people. Soldiers and {{scientists}} {{wanted to return}} to their peacetime pursuits, and there was a danger that wartime knowledge would be lost, leaving no <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> how to handle and maintain nuclear weapons, much less how to improve the weapons and processes. The military side of the Manhattan Project had relied heavily on reservists, as the policy of the Corps of Engineers was to assign regular officers to field commands. The reservists were now eligible for separation. To replace them, Groves asked for fifty West Point graduates from the top ten percent of their classes to man bomb assembly teams at Sandia Base, where the assembly staff and facilities had been moved from Los Alamos and Wendover Field in September and October 1945. He felt that only such high quality personnel would be able to work with the scientists who were currently doing the job. They were also urgently required for many other jobs in the postwar Army. When General Thomas T. Handy turned down his request, Groves raised the matter with the Chief of Staff of the Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, who similarly did not approve it. Groves then went over his head too, and took it to the Secretary of War, Robert P. Patterson, who agreed with Groves. [...] The personnel manned the 2761st Engineer Battalion (Special), which became a field unit under the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP).|$|E
