40|$|A new planar leaky-wave antenna (LWA) {{design that}} {{utilizes}} surface waves (SWs) for leaky wave excitation is presented. Specifically, a directive surface-wave launcher source is employed as the antenna feed generating cylindrical SW field distributions on a grounded dielectric slab. By {{the addition of}} a radial configuration of width-modulated printed strips along the azimuth, SW power can be gradually transformed into radiative power. Measured gain values are greater than 10 dBi with the first beam maximum observed at 18. 7 GHz in the backward direction 38 ° from broadside. Frequency beam scanning is also realized over a 4. 5 GHz radiating bandwidth from 17. 7 to 22. 2 GHz. Simulations and measurements are in agreement and results suggest that this LWA structure can offer continuous one-sided beam scanning through broadside from backfire to forward-fire.

40|$|Accurate {{intrinsic}} camera calibration {{is essential}} to any computer vision task that involves image based measurements. Given its crucial role with respect to precision, {{a large number of}} approaches have been proposed over the last decades. Despite this rich literature, steady advancements in imaging hardware regularly push forward the need for even more accurate techniques. Some authors suggest generalizations of the camera model itself, <b>others</b> propose <b>novel</b> <b>designs</b> for calibration targets or different optimization schemas. In this paper we take a completely different route by directly addressing one of the most overlooked problems in practical calibration scenarios. Specifically, we drop the assumption that the target is known with enough precision and we adjust it in an iterative way as part of the whole process. This is in fact the case with the typical target used in most of the calibration literature, which is usually printed on paper and stitched on a flat surface. In the experimental section we show that even with such a cheaply crafted target it is possible to obtain a very accurate camera calibration that outperforms those obtained with well-known standard techniques. ...|$|R

One of the six genetically evolved lens systems infringed a previously issued patent; three contained many of the essential features of the patents, without infringing; and the <b>others</b> were non-infringing <b>novel</b> <b>designs</b> that duplicated (or improved upon) the performance specifications contained in the patents.

40|$|On-chip {{electrostatic}} discharge (ESD) protection circuits {{had been built}} in IC chips to protect the devices and circuits against ESD damage. But, ESD protection circuits constructed with the scaled-down CMOS devices are very weak to ESD stress. Therefore, novel ESD protection solutions must be developed to overcome this reliability challenge for integrated circuits fabricated in the nano-scale CMOS technology. In this paper, the whole-chip ESD protection strategy for CMOS integrated circuits in nanotechnology has been proposed with two main methods. One is the substrate- triggered circuit technique used to effectively improve ESD robustness of devices in the nano-scale CMOS technology. The <b>other</b> is the <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> concept of “ESD Buses ” used to solve the internal ESD damage issue of CMOS IC with multiple and separated power lines.

40|$|Biodegradable {{materials}} are potentially an advantageous {{alternative to the}} traditional metallic fracture fixation devices used in the reconstruction of bone tissue defects. This {{is due to the}} occurrence of stress shielding in the surrounding bone tissue that arises from the absence of mechanical stimulus to the regenerating bone due to the mismatch between the elastic modulus of bone and the metal implant. However although degradable polymers may alleviate such issues, these inert materials possess insufficient mechanical properties to be considered as a suitable alternative to current metallic devices at sites of sufficient mechanical loading. Phosphate based glasses are an advantageous group of materials for tissue regenerative applications due to their ability to completely degrade in vivo at highly controllable rates based on the specific glass composition. Furthermore the release of the glass's constituent ions can evoke a therapeutic stimulus in vivo (i. e. osteoinduction) whilst also generating a bioactive response. The processing of these materials into fibres subsequently allows them to act as reinforcing agents in degradable polymers to simultaneously increase its mechanical properties and enhance its in vivo response. However despite the various review articles relating to the compositional influences of different phosphate glass systems, there has been limited work summarising the mechanical properties of different phosphate based glass fibres and their subsequent incorporation as a reinforcing agent in degradable composite materials. As a result, this review article examines the compositional influences behind the development of different phosphate based glass fibre compositions intended as composite reinforcing agents along with an analysis of different potential composite configurations. This includes variations in the fibre content, matrix material and fibre architecture as well as <b>other</b> <b>novel</b> composites <b>designs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Micropumps have rapidly {{expanded}} microhydraulic systems into a {{wider range}} of applications, such as drug delivery, chemical analysis and biological sensing. Empirical research has shown that micropumps suffer most from their extremely low efficiency. To improve the efficiency of micropumps, we propose to employ electrorheological (ER) and magnetorheological (MR) fluids as the hydraulic fluids. This thesis presents two methods: one is a dynamic sealing method to be applied on current micro-scale gear pumps using MR fluids, and the <b>other</b> is a <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> method of micropumps using ER fluids. Using MR fluid with applied magnetic field as a substitute for industrial hydraulic fluids, magnetic chains are aligned within the channel. The parameters, such as magnetic field, viscosity and volume fraction of MR fluid can be balanced to provide optimal sealing performance. Darcy flow through porous media and Bingham flow in a curved channel with a rectangular cross section have been used to model the MR fluid flow exposed to certain magnetic field intensity. Static and dynamic magnetic sealing performance is investigated theoretically and experimentally, which is evaluated by Mason numbers and friction factor. To achieve a higher efficiency and faster dynamic response, a <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> for micropumps driven by ER fluid is demonstrated. Moving mechanical parts are eliminated by applying a periodic voltage gradient. The approach involves exerting electric forces on particles distributed within the fluid and exploiting drag or entrainment forces to drive flow. Variables are explored, such as the dimension and layout of the channel and electrodes. Experiments are also designed to observe the performance of the solid state pump. In addition, a method of characterizing the efficiency of chamber pump is introduced and applied on screw-chamber pump and solenoid-chamber pump with check valve and ER valve. by Youzhi Liang.

Cultivation in closed photobioreactors (PBR) to achieve high culture concentrations is a potential solution. However, existing PBR designs do not have the desired efficiencies, and lead to high material and energy costs. Therefore, <b>novel</b> PBR <b>designs</b> need to be developed and benchmarked against existing designs. This work has proposed a <b>novel</b> PBR <b>design</b> by combining two existing designs, namely, the airlift and flat plate PBRs. The <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> uses the concept of riser and downcomer from the airlift PBR. However, the downcomer has flat surfaces resembling a flat plate PBR The hydrodynamic performance of the novel PBR was studied using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and the performance was compared with that of the conventional airlift PBR. The dimensions of the <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> were then optimized using CFD simulations. The results showed that the <b>novel</b> <b>design</b> had superior liquid circulation properties that resulted in a regular and alternative exposure to light and dark regions of the PBR.
