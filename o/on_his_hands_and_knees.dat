5|$|On June 2, 1900, {{during the}} British march on Pretoria, Burnham was wounded, almost fatally. He {{was on a}} mission to cut off the flow of Boer gold and {{supplies}} to and from the sea and to halt the transportation of British prisoners of war out of the Pretoria. He scouted alone far to the east behind enemy lines trying to identify the best choke point along the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway line. He came upon an underpass of a railway bridge, an ideal location to disrupt the trains, but was immediately surrounded by a party of Boers. Burnham instantly fled and he had almost escaped when his horse was shot and fell, knocking him senseless and pinning him under its dead body. It was night and he was already far away when his horse was shot, so the Boer troopers apparently did not check to see if Burnham had been injured or killed. When he awoke hours later, Burnham was alone and in a dazed state having sustained serious injuries. In spite of his acute agony, Burnham proceeded to creep back to the railway, placed his charges, and blew up the line in two places. He then crept <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> to an empty animal enclosure to avoid capture and stayed there for two days and nights insensible. The next day, Burnham heard fighting in the distance so he crawled in that direction. By this time he was indifferent as to the source of the gunshots and by chance it was a British patrol that found him. Once in Pretoria the surgeons discovered that Burnham had torn apart his stomach muscles and burst a blood-vessel. His very survival was due only {{to the fact that he}} had been without food or water for three days.|$|E
25|$|At {{the opening}} of the tale, Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking {{directly}} to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart, and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri has not met Mozart in person, but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart's compositions, and is thrilled at the chance to meet Mozart in person, during a salon at which some of Mozart's compositions will be played. When he finally does catch sight of Mozart, however, he is deeply disappointed to find that Mozart himself lacks the grace and charm of his compositions: When Salieri first meets him, Mozart is crawling around <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.|$|E

500|$|Henderson was {{so proud}} of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest. In 2002, {{following}} an argument with pitcher Orlando Hernández, Henderson stated, [...] "He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain't a kid.

2500|$|The {{sculpture}} is a life-size, cast bronze {{figure of}} a man <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> [...] The man’s head is bent toward the ground, and his posture is tensed {{as if he is}} trying not to collapse further. [...] Both hands and both feet are in contact with the horizontal bronze base, which is approximately two inches thick; his proper left knee is also connected to this base. [...] His proper right leg is in a position of moving slightly forward. [...] The surface of the bronze is highly textured and carries a brown patina, with the texture allowing some areas of brighter bronze to show through.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{subsequent}} enquiry and manslaughter/assault trial against Kitching and Ellerker, it was stated they regularly beat-up Oluwale, often kicking {{him in the}} groin and, on one occasion, urinating on him. Often they made him bow before them <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> during which they would kick away his arms so his head hit the pavement. They referred to this as [...] "penance". They also verbally abused him, referring {{to him as a}} [...] "lame darkie". On several occasions they drove him out of Leeds in police vehicles, abandoning him on the outskirts in the early morning. Their intention was to force Oluwale to leave Leeds and not return. However, he viewed Leeds as his home and made his way back each time.|$|E
2500|$|Marcia Wallace {{spoke of}} Newhart's amiable nature on set: [...] "He's very low key, and he didn't want to cause trouble. I {{had a dog}} {{by the name of}} Maggie that I used to bring to the set. And {{whenever}} there was a line that Bob didn't like—he didn't want to complain too much—so, he'd go over, get down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees,</b> and repeat the line to the dog, which invariably yawned; and he'd say, 'See, I told you it's not funny!'" [...] Wallace has also commented on the show's lack of Emmy recognition: [...] "People think we were nominated for many an Emmy, people presume we won Emmys, all of us, and certainly Bob, and certainly the show. Nope, never!" ...|$|E

He had to crawl home <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> that night, but he played the next day." [...] Westfall was the first Ann Arbor High School graduate {{to play for the}} Wolverines since Hall of Famer John Maulbetsch in 1916. [...] He was the starting fullback in every Michigan football game from 1939–1941. [...] In his sophomore and junior years, he played in a backfield that also included Tom Harmon and Forest Evashevski. Westfall rushed for 1,864 yards on 428 carries (4.36 yards per carry) in 24 games (Michigan only played 8 games per season then and freshmen were not eligible for varsity play). [...] This stood as a Michigan fullback career rushing record for 30 years.|$|E
2500|$|Helmsley {{was known}} for [...] "tyrannizing her employees". According to Alan Dershowitz, while breakfasting with her {{at one of the}} Helmsley hotels, the waiter brought him a cup of tea with a tiny bit of water spilled on the saucer. She grabbed the cup from him and smashed it on the floor, then demanded that the waiter get down <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> and beg for his job." [...] In another account of Helmsley's behavior, she had a {{barbecue}} pit constructed for her home. The work was performed by Eugene Brennan, a personal friend of Jeremiah McCarthy, the chief engineer of Helmsley-Spear. When the final bill came to $13,000, she refused to pay, citing shoddy workmanship. When McCarthy pleaded with her to honor the bill, citing the favor done on his behalf and informing her that Brennan had six children to support, Helmsley replied, [...] "Why didn't he keep his pants on? Then he wouldn't need the money".|$|E
2500|$|The allusion is to Proverbs 23:31: [...] "Look not thou {{upon the}} wine {{when it is}} red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.". On 12 May 1901, {{he was part of}} a {{reconnaissance}} squad patrolling in the location of the Toorberg Mountain above the Doornbosch Farm when they came across and engaged a group of Boers. In the ensuing battle, Moore's horse was shot out from underneath him, and he took cover behind the body of the fallen horse. He was then seriously wounded when a Boer bullet hit him in the waist, having passed through the body of the dead horse. Moore eventually killed his Boer opponent after eight shots, and had struggled back to a ridge and was crawling along it <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> when his mates found him. They took the gravely wounded Moore to the nearby Kwaggashoek Farmhouse. He died of his wounds that night; a contemporary South Melbourne newspaper claimed that Moore [...] "was the first man of the Imperial Contingent to die of gunshot wounds".|$|E

2500|$|On 11 April, Miss Marcella Sherwood, an English missionary, fearing for {{the safety}} of her pupils, {{was on her way to}} shut the schools and send the roughly 600 Indian {{children}} home. While cycling through a narrow street called the Kucha Kurrichhan, she was caught by a mob, pulled to the ground by her hair, stripped naked, beaten, kicked, and left for dead. [...] She was rescued by some local Indians, including the father of one of her pupils, who hid her from the mob and then smuggled her to the safety of Gobindgarh fort. After visiting Sherwood on 19 April, the Raj's local commander, Colonel Dyer, issued an order requiring every Indian man using that street to crawl its length <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees.</b> Colonel Dyer later explained to a British inspector: [...] "Some Indians crawl face downwards in front of their gods. I wanted them to know that a British woman is as sacred as a Hindu god and therefore they have to crawl in front of her, too." [...] He also authorised the indiscriminate, public whipping of locals who came within lathi length of British policemen. Miss Marcella Sherwood later defended Colonel Dyer, describing him [...] "as the 'saviour' of the Punjab".|$|E
2500|$|The outcry was instantaneous. The word [...] "grovel" [...] had {{sinister}} connotations for West Indian people, many of {{whom have}} slave ancestry. Moreover, apartheid and the Gleneagles Agreement were prominent issues of the day, so a white South African using the word [...] "grovel" [...] heavily accentuated the faux pas. The West Indian fast bowlers took great delight in adding yards to their run-up when Greig came to the wicket and their supporters took equal delight when his wicket was captured. At times during the series, the West Indies were roundly criticised for their use of short-pitched bowling. To compensate for his unusual height and attempt to combat such bowling, Greig held the bat at shoulder height (rather than leave it on the ground) as the bowler ran in, thus not using a back swing of the bat. While it helped him to combat the short ball, it left him vulnerable to the yorker (full pitch) and he was bowled quite regularly for a top order batsman. The West Indian bowlers managed to hit Greig's stumps often. Apart from a formidable performance in the fourth Test at Leeds, where he fought back with 116 and 76 not out and shared a big partnership with keeper Alan Knott, Greig scored just 51 runs in seven innings. Worse, his bowling lost penetration and he took only five wickets as England slumped to a 0–3 loss. However, Greig did not lose his sense of humour: playing on his [...] "grovel" [...] comment, he pretended to crawl <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>knees</b> in front of the open stands on the Harleyford Road side of The Oval in the last Test match, delighting the crowds that had previously jeered him.|$|E
