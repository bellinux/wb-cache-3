5|$|I am the Way– Jesus {{walks on}} tempestuous seas {{surrounded}} by storm clouds. <b>Opalescent</b> glass {{is used to}} create a glow of light around the figure of Jesus.|$|E
5|$|John, the Visionary– Wearing a red {{cloak and}} having an intense expression, St. John is portrayed by Tiffany {{in the style}} of the 17th-century Flemish painter Reubens. The window is made of drapery, <b>opalescent,</b> and mottled glass.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{percent or}} more of {{smallpox}} cases among unvaccinated persons were of the ordinary type. In this form of the disease, by {{the second day of the}} rash the macules became raised papules. By the third or fourth day the papules filled with an <b>opalescent</b> fluid to become vesicles. This fluid became opaque and turbid within 24–48 hours, giving them the appearance of pustules; however, the so-called pustules were filled with tissue debris, not pus.|$|E
25|$|There is a diffuse, gray-white, milky <b>opalescent</b> {{appearance}} of the mucosa which usually occurs bilaterally on the buccal mucosa. Less often, the labial mucosa, the palate or the floor of mouth may be affected. The surface of the area is folded, creating a wrinkled, white streaked lesion. Apart from the appearance, the lesion is entirely asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|Pink and red {{are caused}} by plastic {{deformation}} of the crystal lattice from temperature and pressure. Black diamonds {{are caused by}} microscopic black or gray inclusions of other materials such as graphite or sulfides and/or microscopic fractures. Opaque or <b>opalescent</b> white diamonds are also caused by microscopic inclusions. Purple diamonds are caused {{by a combination of}} crystal lattice distortion and high hydrogen content.|$|E
25|$|For {{cephalopods}} in general, the hues of {{the pigment}} granules are relatively constant within a species but can vary slightly between species. For example, the common cuttlefish and the <b>opalescent</b> inshore squid (Loligo opalescens) have yellow, red and brown, the European common squid (Alloteuthis subulata) has {{yellow and red}} and the common octopus has yellow, orange, red, brown and black.|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan is the {{dextrorotatory}} enantiomer of levomethorphan, {{which is}} the methyl ether of levorphanol, both opioid analgesics. It is named according to IUPAC rules as (+)-3-methoxy-17-methyl-9α,13α,14α-morphinan. As its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as an odorless, <b>opalescent</b> white powder. It is freely soluble in chloroform and insoluble in water; the hydrobromide salt is water-soluble up to 1.5g/100 mL at 25°C. Dextromethorphan is commonly available as the monohydrated hydrobromide salt, however some newer extended-release formulations contain dextromethorphan bound to an ion-exchange resin based on polystyrene sulfonic acid. Dextromethorphan's specific rotation in water is +27.6° (20°C, Sodium D-line).|$|E
25|$|In 1881 Tiffany did the {{interior}} {{design of the}} Mark Twain House in Hartford, Connecticut, which still remains, but the new firm's most notable work came in 1882 when President Chester Alan Arthur refused {{to move into the}} White House until it had been redecorated. He commissioned Tiffany, who had begun {{to make a name for}} himself in New York society for the firm's interior design work, to redo the state rooms, which Arthur found charmless. Tiffany worked on the East Room, the Blue Room, the Red Room, the State Dining Room, and the Entrance Hall, refurnishing, repainting in decorative patterns, installing newly designed mantelpieces, changing to wallpaper with dense patterns, and, of course, adding Tiffany glass to gaslight fixtures and windows and adding an <b>opalescent</b> floor-to-ceiling glass screen in the Entrance Hall. The Tiffany screen and other Victorian additions were all removed in the Roosevelt renovations of 1902, which restored the White House interiors to Federal style in keeping with its architecture.|$|E
25|$|South of the {{confluence}} of Indian Pass Brook and Calamity Brook, the Hudson River flows south into Sanford Lake. South of the outlet of the lake, the <b>Opalescent</b> River flows into the Hudson. The Hudson then flows south, taking in Beaver Brook and the outlet of Lake Harris. After its confluence with the Indian River, the Hudson forms the boundary between Essex and Hamilton counties. In the hamlet of North River, the Hudson flows entirely in Warren County and takes in the Schroon River. Further south, the river forms the boundary between Warren and Saratoga Counties. The river then takes in the Sacandaga River from the Great Sacandaga Lake. Shortly thereafter, the river leaves the Adirondack Park, flows under Interstate 87, and through Glens Falls, just south of Lake George although receiving no streamflow from the lake. It next goes through Hudson Falls. At this point the river forms the boundary between Washington and Saratoga Counties. Here the river has an altitude of 200 feet. Just south in Fort Edward, the river reaches its confluence with the Champlain Canal, which historically provided boat traffic between New York City and Montreal {{and the rest of}} Eastern Canada via the Hudson, Lake Champlain and the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Further south the Hudson takes in water from the Batten Kill River and Fish Creek near Schuylerville. The river then forms the boundary between Saratoga and Rensselaer counties. The river then enters the heart of the Capital District. It takes in water from the Hoosic River, which extends into Massachusetts. Shortly thereafter the river has its confluence with the Mohawk River, the largest tributary of the Hudson River, in Waterford. The river then reaches the Federal Dam in Troy, marking an impoundment of the river. At an elevation of , the bottom of the dam marks the beginning of the tidal influence in the Hudson as well as the beginning of the lower Hudson River.|$|E
500|$|Four of the chapel's {{windows were}} {{designed}} and crafted in {{the studios of}} Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848–1933). Tiffany and Hardenbergh were acquainted through their work with the Architectural League of New York. [...] According to the New Jersey Historic Trust, the windows are [...] "some of the first <b>opalescent</b> and multicolored sheet glass manufactured in America." [...] <b>Opalescent</b> glass, used often in Tiffany glass windows, is glass {{in which more than}} one colour is present and caused in the manufacture by fusing through two colors being laminated, or through a superficial application of metallic oxide solutions.|$|E
500|$|It {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as one of the most exquisite portraits of the Northern Renaissance. Art historian Joel Upton described the sitter as resembling [...] "a polished pearl, almost <b>opalescent,</b> lying on a cushion of black velvet." [...] The panel builds on the work of Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden, and was highly influential in the decades after its completion. Its appeal lies in part in her intriguing stare, accentuated by the slight misalignment of her eyes, while the eyebrows are faintly skewed.|$|E
500|$|The chapel was {{designed}} in the High Victorian Gothic Revival style that was popular at {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century in the United States. Hardenbergh's design incorporated features common to fourteenth-century German and English Gothic churches. According to the New Jersey Historic Trust, the chapel’s stained glass windows feature [...] "some of the first <b>opalescent</b> and multicolored sheet glass manufactured in America." [...] Four of the chapel's windows were created by the studios of Louis Comfort Tiffany. Kirkpatrick Chapel was included on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on January 29, 1973, and on the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 1973.|$|E
500|$|They {{applied a}} lurid style, {{choosing}} {{to make people}} [...] "sort of shiny". The appearance of the Narrator's scenes without Tyler Durden were bland and realistic. The scenes with Tyler were described by Fincher as [...] "more hyper-real in a torn-down, deconstructed sense—a visual metaphor of what [...] heading into". The filmmakers used heavily desaturated colors in the costuming, makeup, and art direction. Bonham Carter wore <b>opalescent</b> makeup to portray her romantic nihilistic character with a [...] "smack-fiend patina". Fincher and Cronenweth drew influences from the 1973 film American Graffiti, which applied a mundane look to nighttime exteriors while simultaneously including a variety of colors.|$|E
500|$|The {{mirror is}} a {{perfectly}} defined unbroken pale rectangle within a broad black rectangle. A clear geometric shape, like a lit face, draws {{the attention of the}} viewer more than a broken geometric shape such as the door, or a shadowed or oblique face such as that of the dwarf in the foreground or that of the man in the background. The viewer cannot distinguish the features of the king and queen, but in the <b>opalescent</b> sheen of the mirror's surface, the glowing ovals are plainly turned directly to the viewer. Jonathan Miller points out that apart from [...] "adding suggestive gleams at the bevelled edges, the most important way the mirror betrays its identity is by disclosing imagery whose brightness is so inconsistent with the dimness of the surrounding wall that it can only have been borrowed, by reflection, from the strongly illuminated figures of the King and Queen".|$|E
500|$|The {{philosophical}} album closer [...] "Africa" [...] celebrates D'Angelo's heritage, while reaffirming his contemporary {{mission in}} life. It {{has been cited}} by Questlove as his favorite song on the album. The theme of [...] "Africa" [...] concerns the finding of a spiritual home amid geographical displacement, and of passing that sense of belonging on to one's children. [...] "Africa" [...] was originally written in honor of D'Angelo's son, Michael Archer, Jr., and ended up as a dedication to history, Africa, and God. Opening with a shimmery rustle of chimes, the song contains a drum interpretation of Prince's [...] "I Wonder U" [...] from his Parade (1986), which was also utilized for the Ursula Rucker and The Roots track [...] "The Return to Innocence Lost" [...] from Things Fall Apart. Questlove discussed producing the opening chime sounds for [...] "Africa", stating [...] "we took the cover off the rhodes and mic'd 'em". One critic described C. Edward Alford's guitar work for [...] "Africa" [...] as [...] "backward guitar solos (at least they sound backward)". Another critic described the song as a [...] "lullaby" [...] and [...] "a gorgeous, <b>opalescent</b> closer ... a prayer of sorts". Voodoos coda, which consists of chopped-up track snippets run backwards, plays at the song's conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Hopkins {{signed with}} {{boutique}} London label Just Music {{as a solo}} artist, and began recording his debut album <b>Opalescent.</b> At {{the time he was}} also working part-time as a studio session musician. <b>Opalescent</b> attracted positive press attention upon its release, and several tracks were licensed to Sex and the City. The Guardian reviewed it as [...] "a beautifully realized debut. Using synth oozes, phased and echoed guitars and pianos and chilled beats, his wonderful tunes drift from calm to eerie power like a restless sea. It will delight any lovers of beautiful music." [...] DJ Magazine gave it 4/5 stars, and stated [...] "Piano, guitar strings and slow beats blend like the clouds at sunset (or an opiate smoothy) filtering in and out like elegantly wasted beauty. Darker drums add a further depth." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "like a {{field of}} large glace sweets, it is her most spectacular, and benign {{installation}} to date [...] Monuments to domesticity, they are like solidified jellies, <b>opalescent</b> ice-cubes, or bars of soap – lavender, rose, spearmint, lilac. They look like a regulated graveyard or a series of futuristic standing stones with a passing resemblance to television sets." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of unstable proteins that {{can create a}} visual problem (protein breakdown) in the wine also requires stabilization. Treatment with bentonite allows the precipitation of unstable proteins which can then be removed by filtration and extraction. The proteins can also react with Metatartaric acid added to wine to prevent tartaric precipitation: the wine then loses its shine and becomes <b>opalescent</b> like whey. Some varieties are naturally high in protein (muscat[...].) but levels also {{vary depending on the}} vintage and maturity levels.|$|E
2500|$|The {{solution}} was [...] "cloudy, <b>opalescent</b> upon being stirred, and of low viscosity" [...] and usually was thrown away. However, Kwolek persuaded the technician, Charles Smullen, {{who ran the}} spinneret, to test her solution, and was amazed {{to find that the}} fiber did not break, unlike nylon. Her supervisor and her laboratory director understood the significance of her accidental discovery and a new field of polymer chemistry quickly arose. By 1971, modern Kevlar was introduced. However, Kwolek was not very involved in developing the applications of Kevlar.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to being prepared with sugar and water, absinthe emerged as a popular cocktail ingredient in both the United Kingdom and the United States. [...] By 1930, dozens of fancy cocktails that called for absinthe had been published in numerous credible bartender guides. One {{of the most famous}} of these libations is Ernest Hemingway's [...] "Death in the Afternoon" [...] cocktail, a tongue-in-cheek concoction contributed to a 1935 collection of celebrity recipes. The directions are as follows: [...] "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper <b>opalescent</b> milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{exterior}} of Kirkpatrick Chapel was built from New Jersey brownstone, {{and has been}} described as [...] "similar to an English country church." [...] One author described the interior of the chapel as [...] "exceedingly beautiful, having a roof of open timber, finished in black walnut and stained pine, resting for its center support on slender iron columns painted to correspond with the delicately tinted walls." [...] According to the New Jersey Historic Trust, the chapel's stained glass windows feature [...] "some of the first <b>opalescent</b> and multicolored sheet glass manufactured in America." [...] Four of the chapels windows were created by the studios of Louis Comfort Tiffany.|$|E
2500|$|Angel gilding {{was widely}} used by Chicago's stained glass studios in the 1920s and 30s {{to make a}} {{distinctive}} style of stained glass for Chicago's historic bungalows. These Prairie Style windows have a clear glass background with the designs picked out in <b>opalescent</b> glass and double-sided gold mirror. To make the double-sided [...] the studios angel gilded large sheets of thin (1.6mm, or 0.06inch) glass. A worker would cut two copies of the desired shape from the glass and place the pieces back to back in a single came. Because the pieces are gold on both sides, they catch and reflect the light whether the window is viewed {{from inside the house}} or from the street. Frank Lloyd Wright used double-sided angel gilded glass in many of his windows, including the now demolished Imperial Hotel in Tokyo.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of his career, Tiffany used cheap jelly jars and bottles because they had the mineral impurities that finer glass lacked. When he was unable to convince fine glassmakers to leave the impurities in, he began making his own glass. Tiffany used <b>opalescent</b> glass in a variety of colors and textures to create a unique style of stained glass. He developed the [...] "copper foil" [...] technique, which, by edging each piece of cut glass in copper foil and soldering the whole together to create his windows and lamps, made possible a level of detail previously unknown. This can be contrasted with the method of painting in enamels or glass paint on colorless glass, and then setting the glass pieces in lead channels, that had been the dominant method of creating stained glass for hundreds of years in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Connick {{preferred}} to use clear [...] "antique" [...] glass, {{similar to that}} of the Middle Ages and praised this type of glass as [...] "colored radiance, with the lustre, intensity, and baffling vibrant quality of dancing lights." [...] He employed a technique of [...] "staggered" [...] solder-joints in his leading and bars, which English stained-glass historian Peter Cormack says gives the windows their [...] "syncopated or 'swinging' character." [...] His style incorporated a strong interest in symbolism as well. Connick expressed the opinion that the first job of stained glass was to serve the architectural effect, and he believed that his greatest contribution to glasswork was [...] "rescuing it from the abysmal depth of <b>opalescent</b> picture windows" [...] of the sort popularized by Louis Comfort Tiffany and John La Farge. Although firmly committed to a regenerated handicraft tradition, Connick welcomed innovation and experimentation in design and technique among his co-workers at his studio.|$|E
2500|$|The Main Concourse is {{the center}} of Grand Central. At [...] long by [...] wide by [...] high, the {{cavernous}} Main Concourse is usually filled with bustling crowds. and is often used as a meeting place. The ticket booths are here, although many now stand unused or have been repurposed since the introduction of ticket vending machines. The large American flag was hung in Grand Central Terminal {{a few days after the}} September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The main information booth is in the center of the concourse. The four-faced brass clock on top of the information booth, perhaps the most recognizable icon of Grand Central, was designed by Henry Edward Bedford and cast in Waterbury, Connecticut. Each of the four clock faces is made from <b>opalescent</b> glass (now often called opal glass or milk glass), though urban legend has it that the faces are made of opal and that Sotheby's and Christie's have estimated their value to be between $10 million and $20 million. A 1954 New York Times article on the restoration of the clock notes that [...] "Each of the glass faces was twenty-four inches in diameter...." [...] Within the marble and brass pagoda lies a [...] "secret" [...] door that conceals a spiral staircase leading to the lower-level information booth.|$|E
