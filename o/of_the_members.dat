50|$|In {{mechanics}} <b>of</b> material, <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> {{a material}} {{is its ability}} to withstand an applied load without failure or plastic deformation.The field of strength of materials deals with forces and deformations that result from their acting on a material.A load applied to a mechanical member will induce internal forces within <b>the</b> <b>member</b> called stresses when those forces are expressed on a unit basis. The stresses acting on the material cause deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material in various manners. Deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material is called strain when those deformations too are placed on a unit basis. The applied loads may be axial (tensile or compressive), or rotational (strength shear). The stresses and strains that develop within a mechanical member must be calculated in order to assess <b>the</b> load capacity <b>of</b> that member. This requires a complete description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>member,</b> its constraints, <b>the</b> loads applied to <b>the</b> <b>member</b> and <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> <b>member</b> is composed. With a complete description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loading and <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>member,</b> <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> stress and of state of strain at any point within <b>the</b> <b>member</b> can be calculated. Once <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> stress and strain within <b>the</b> <b>member</b> is known, <b>the</b> strength (load carrying capacity) of that member, its deformations (stiffness qualities), and its stability (ability to maintain its original configuration) can be calculated. The calculated stresses may then be compared to some measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>member</b> such as its material yield or ultimate strength. <b>The</b> calculated deflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>member</b> may be compared to a deflection criteria that is based on <b>the</b> <b>member's</b> use. <b>The</b> calculated buckling load <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>member</b> may be compared to the applied load. The calculated stiffness and mass distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>member</b> may be used to calculate <b>the</b> <b>member's</b> dynamic response and then compared to the acoustic environment in which it will be used.|$|R
