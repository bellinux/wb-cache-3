5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> <b>with</b> the astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Comparison is {{made between}} three {{different}} indices that characterise the individual rings {{of a wide}} range of condensed benzenoid hydrocarbons. Two of these ("π-electron partitions " and the six-centre delocalisation-indices that have been called "Δ 6 -values") have been introduced only recently as potential indicators of what might be called "local aromaticity", whilst the third ("topological π-electron ring-currents") was suggested as a possible discriminator in this regard nearly fifty years ago. Whilst linear correlations between ring currents and π-electron partitions within certain restricted classes of ring types are good (with correlation coefficients of up to 0. 998), agreement between the two indices over all classes of ring types is poor. Predictions arising from a consideration of π-electron partitions and Δ 6 -values seem, on the other hand, to be in somewhat better accord. It is therefore concluded that, despite its superficially intuitive appeal, the ring-current index is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> both <b>with</b> π-electron partitions and Δ 6 -values as a general indicator of so-called "local aromaticity".
