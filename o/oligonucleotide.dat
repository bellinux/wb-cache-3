5|$|Although the {{nucleic base}} of {{guanosine}} and 2'-deoxyguanosine {{does have an}} exocyclic amino group, its basicity is low to an extent {{that it does not}} react with phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. However, a phosphoramidite derived from the N2-unprotected 5'-O-DMT-2'-deoxyguanosine is poorly soluble in acetonitrile, the solvent commonly used in <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis. In contrast, the N2-protected versions of the same compound dissolve in acetonitrile well and hence are widely used. Nucleic bases adenine and cytosine bear the exocyclic amino groups reactive with the activated phosphoramidites under the conditions of the coupling reaction. By the use of additional steps in the synthetic cycle or alternative coupling agents and solvent systems, the <b>oligonucleotide</b> chain assembly may be carried out using dA and dC phosphoramidites with unprotected amino groups. However, these approaches currently remain in the research stage. In routine <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis, exocyclic amino groups in nucleosides are kept permanently protected over {{the entire length of the}} <b>oligonucleotide</b> chain assembly.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{solid-phase}} <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis {{is carried}} out automatically using computer-controlled instruments (<b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesizers) and is technically implemented in column, multi-well plate, and array formats. The column format is best suited for research and large scale applications where a high-throughput is not required. Multi-well plate format is designed specifically for high-throughput synthesis on small scale to satisfy the growing demand of industry and academia for synthetic oligonucleotides. A number of <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesizers for small scale synthesis and medium to large scale synthesis are available commercially.|$|E

40|$|The {{cellular}} uptake and intracellular {{distribution of}} methylphosphonate <b>oligonucleotides</b> (15 mers) has been examined using both 32 P labeled and fluorescent labeled <b>oligonucleotides.</b> The cellular uptake process for methylphosphonate <b>oligonucleotides</b> is highly temperature dependent, {{with a major}} increase in uptake occurring between 15 and 20 degrees C. Most of the label which becomes cell associated at 37 degrees C cannot be removed by acid washing or trypsinization and thus seems to be within the cell. Visualization of rhodamine labeled methylphosphonate <b>oligonucleotides</b> using digital imaging fluorescence microscopy reveals a vesicular subcellular distribution suggestive of an endosomal localization. There was extensive co-localization of rhodamine labeled methylphosphonate <b>oligonucleotides</b> with fluorescein-dextran, an endosomal/lysosomal marker substance. The apparent endocytotic uptake of labeled methylphosphonate <b>oligonucleotides</b> could not be blocked by competition with unlabeled methylphosphonate or phosphodiester <b>oligonucleotides,</b> nor by ATP. This contrasts with the situation for radiolabeled phosphodiester <b>oligonucleotides</b> whose uptake can be completely blocked with unlabeled competitor. Uptake of phosphodiester <b>oligonucleotides,</b> but not of methylphosphonate <b>oligonucleotides,</b> could be blocked by acidification of the cytosol. These observations suggest that the pathway of cellular uptake of methylphosphonate <b>oligonucleotides</b> involves fluid phase or adsorbtive endocytosis, and is distinct from the uptake pathway for phosphodiester <b>oligonucleotides...</b>|$|R
40|$|Encapsulation of <b>oligonucleotides</b> in antibody-targeted liposomes (immunoliposomes) which bind {{to target}} cells permits {{intracellular}} {{delivery of the}} <b>oligonucleotides.</b> This approach circumvents problems of extracellular degradation by nucleases and poor membrane permeability which free phosphodiester <b>oligonucleotides</b> are subject to, but leaves unresolved the inefficiency of encapsulation of <b>oligonucleotides</b> in liposomes. We have coupled <b>oligonucleotides</b> to cholesterol via a reversible disulfide bond. This modification of <b>oligonucleotides</b> improved their association with immunoliposomes {{by a factor of}} about 10 in comparison to unmodified <b>oligonucleotides.</b> The presence of cholesteryl-modified <b>oligonucleotides</b> incorporated in the bilayer of liposomes did not interfere with the coupling of the targeting protein to the liposome surface. Free or cholesterol coupled <b>oligonucleotides</b> associated with liposomes and directed against the tat gene of HIV- 1 were tested for inhibition of HIV- 1 proliferation in acutely infected cells. We demonstrate that the cholesteryl-modified as well as unmodified <b>oligonucleotides</b> acquire the target specificity of the antibody on the liposome. Their antiviral activity when delivered into cells is sequence-specific. The activity of these modified or unmodified <b>oligonucleotides</b> to inhibit the replication of HIV was the same on an equimolar basis (EC 50 around 0. 1 μM). Cholesterol coupled <b>oligonucleotides</b> thus offer increased liposome association without loss of antiviral activity. ...|$|R

One aspect provides an antisense <b>oligonucleotides</b> that inhibits the {{expression of}} human replication-initiation protein and has a sequence complementary to at least {{a portion of a}} target sequence encoding a human replication initiation gene. By administering a therapeutically effective amount of antisense <b>oligonucleotides</b> or by contacting the hyperproliferating cells with an effective amount of antisense <b>oligonucleotides,</b> expression of replication-initiation protein is inhibited.

5|$|In ES MS spectrum, a given <b>oligonucleotide</b> {{generates a}} set of ions that {{correspond}} to different ionization states of the compound. Thus, the <b>oligonucleotide</b> with molecular mass M generates ions with masses (M– nH)/n where M is the molecular mass of the <b>oligonucleotide</b> {{in the form of}} a free acid (all negative charges of internucleosidic phosphodiester groups are neutralized with H+), n is the ionization state, and H is the atomic mass of hydrogen (1 Da). Most useful for characterization are the ions with n ranging from 2 to 5. Software supplied with the more recently manufactured instruments is capable of performing a deconvolution procedure that is, it finds peaks of ions that belong to the same set and derives the molecular mass of the <b>oligonucleotide.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{newly formed}} tricoordinated {{phosphite}} triester linkage is not natural and is of limited stability under {{the conditions of}} <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis. The treatment of the support-bound material with iodine and water {{in the presence of}} a weak base (pyridine, lutidine, or collidine) oxidizes the phosphite triester into a tetracoordinated phosphate triester, a protected precursor of the naturally occurring phosphate diester internucleosidic linkage. Oxidation may be carried out under anhydrous conditions using tert-Butyl hydroperoxide or, more efficiently, (1S)-(+)-(10-camphorsulfonyl)-oxaziridine (CSO). The step of oxidation is substituted with a sulfurization step to obtain <b>oligonucleotide</b> phosphorothioates (see <b>Oligonucleotide</b> phosphorothioates and their synthesis below). In the latter case, the sulfurization step is best carried out prior to capping.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} desired <b>oligonucleotide,</b> the {{building}} blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing <b>oligonucleotide</b> chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been fully automated since the late 1970s. Upon {{the completion of the}} chain assembly, the product is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the <b>oligonucleotide</b> being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules around 15–25 bases in length.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of antisense biotechnology is dependent, in part, on creating improved methods for delivering <b>oligonucleotides</b> to cells. In this study, we investigated a colloidal system (nanoparticles (NP) of poly (D,L) lactic acid) {{that affects the}} intracellular delivery of <b>oligonucleotides.</b> We have examined the intracellular compartmentalization in DU 145 cells of fluorescein labeled phosphorothioate <b>oligonucleotides,</b> both {{in the free state}} and when loaded into NP. Fluorescent <b>oligonucleotides</b> were incubated for 18 h with DU 145 cells and the mean intracellular fluorescence was determined by flow cytometry. After the addition of monensin, an increase in signal intensity was observed, indicating that free <b>oligonucleotides</b> were resident in an acidic intracellular environment, whereas <b>oligonucleotides</b> from the NP did not reside in an acidic compartment. Free and NP loaded with <b>oligonucleotides</b> effluxed from DU 145 cells from two intracellular compartments. This preliminary report indicates that colloidal carriers such as NP could prove to be useful in affecting intracellular trafficking of <b>oligonucleotides</b> in DU 145 and in other cells...|$|R

5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In <b>oligonucleotide</b> chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers suitable for <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis (see below).|$|E
5|$|In {{solid-phase}} synthesis, an <b>oligonucleotide</b> being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} synthesis and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the <b>oligonucleotide</b> is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
5|$|It {{is worth}} remembering that {{conducting}} detritylation {{for an extended}} time or with stronger than recommended solutions of acids leads to depurination of solid support-bound <b>oligonucleotide</b> and thus reduces the yield of the desired full-length product.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oligonucleotides</b> {{containing}} the sequence upstream immediately {{followed by the}} sequence downstream of the region to be knocked out are designed.

50|$|This method {{begins with}} {{alignment}} of homologous genes, followed by identification of regions of polymorphism. Next the top strand {{of the gene}} is divided into small degenerate <b>oligonucleotides.</b> The bottom strand is also digested into <b>oligonucleotides</b> to serve as scaffolds.

5|$|MPPS {{suitable}} for <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis is a low-swellable, highly cross-linked polystyrene obtained by polymerization of divinylbenzene (min 60%), styrene, and 4-chloromethylstyrene {{in the presence}} of a porogeneous agent.

5|$|<b>Oligonucleotide</b> {{synthesis}} is {{the chemical}} synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence). The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice {{because it provides}} a rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides of the desired sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA only in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis does not have this limitation, although it is, most often, {{carried out in the}} opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides (dA, dC, dG, and T), ribonucleosides (A, C, G, and U), or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA or BNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} {{physical}} dividers between the sites occupied by individual oligonucleotides, {{a very limited}} space {{on the surface of}} the microarray (one <b>oligonucleotide</b> sequence occupies a square 25×25μm) and the requirement of high fidelity of <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis dictate the use of site-selective 5'-deprotection techniques. In one approach, the removal of the 5'-O-DMT group is effected by electrochemical generation of the acid at the required site(s). Another approach uses 5'-O-(α-methyl-6-nitropiperonyloxycarbonyl) (MeNPOC) protecting group, which can be removed by irradiation with UV light of 365nm wavelength.|$|E

5|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis saw four major {{methods of the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages and has been reviewed in the literature in great detail.|$|E
5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of <b>oligonucleotide</b> chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound <b>oligonucleotide</b> is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage of this approach is that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the <b>oligonucleotide</b> to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled <b>oligonucleotide,</b> the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the phosphite triester methodology. The group led by M. Caruthers took the advantage of less aggressive and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on solid phase. Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites as building blocks. The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group in place of a less user-friendly methyl group led to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesis (see Phosphoramidite building blocks below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of building blocks, <b>oligonucleotide</b> synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} trifluorothymidine (TFT) -induced DNA damage, we developed an enzymatic method for the synthesis of single-strand <b>oligonucleotides</b> containing TFTmonophosphate residues. Sixteen-mer <b>oligonucleotides</b> and 14 -mer 5 ′-phosphorylated <b>oligonucleotides</b> were annealed to the template of 25 -mer, so as to empty one nucleotide site. TFT-triphosphate was incorporated into the site by DNA polymerase and then ligated to 5 ′-phosphorylated <b>oligonucleotides</b> by DNA ligase. The synthesized 31 -mer <b>oligonucleotides</b> containing TFT residues were isolated from the 25 -mer complementary template by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Using these single-strand <b>oligonucleotides</b> containing TFT residues, the cleavage of TFT residues from DNA, using mismatch uracil-DNA glycosylase (MUG) of E. coli origin, was {{compared with that of}} 5 -fluorouracil (5 FU) and 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). The TFT/A pair was not cleaved by MUG, while the other pairs, namely, 5 FU/A, 5 FU/G, BrdU/A, BrdU/G, and TFT/G, were easily cleaved from each synthesized DNA. Thus, this method is useful for obtaining some site-specifically modified <b>oligonucleotides...</b>|$|R
