25|$|In general, {{the time}} lags {{inherent}} in the dynamic response of groundwater to development have been ignored by water management agencies, decades after scientific understanding of the issue was consolidated. In brief, the effects of groundwater overdraft (although undeniably real) may take decades or centuries to manifest themselves. In a classic study in 1982, Bredehoeft and colleagues modeled a situation where groundwater extraction in an intermontane basin withdrew the entire annual recharge, leaving ‘nothing’ for the natural groundwater-dependent vegetation community. Even when the borefield was situated close to the vegetation, 30% of the original vegetation demand could still be met by the lag {{inherent in the}} system after 100 years. By year 500, this had reduced to 0%, signalling complete death of the groundwater-dependent vegetation. The science has been available to make these calculations for decades; however, in general water management agencies have ignored effects that will appear <b>outside</b> the <b>rough</b> timeframe of political elections (3 to 5 years). Marios Sophocleous argued strongly that management agencies must define and use appropriate timeframes in groundwater planning. This will mean calculating groundwater withdrawal permits based on predicted effects decades, sometimes centuries in the future.|$|R

Moreover, if the stronger “star-shaped” condition SS of Morawetz is added, the rate of decay can be bounded by 1 t 2. We also remark that the result of Ralston remains valid in the “rough surface” case: the existence of trapped rays implies an arbitrarily slow decay of the energy. If we restrict the analysis to a compact perturbation of a plane, we show that the local energy decays. Moreover, if a geometric condition is added (“star-shaped” condition SS, or “nontrapping” condition NT), we find that the decay is exponential...|$|R

Still, it is strange that this hard quartz has in all cases a good- natured way with it, of {{yielding}} to everything else. All sorts of soft things make nests for themselves in it; and it never makes a nest for itself in anything. It has all the <b>rough</b> <b>outside</b> work; and every sort of cowardly and weak mineral can shelter itself within it. Look; these are hexagonal plates of mica; if they were outside of this crystal they would break, like burnt paper; but they are inside of it,--nothing can hurt them,--the crystal has taken them into its very heart, keeping all their delicate edges as sharp as if they were under water, instead of bathed in rock.

As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the scene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, like my memory over my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects that had been around me in my sleep. At first they were faintly discernible in the mist, and above them the later stars still glimmered. That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough to look at for an hour. Imperceptibly my candles became the only incongruous part of the morning, the dark places in my room all melted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape, prominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its massive tower, threw a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible with its rugged character.

The viceroy agreed not to molest them, on condition that they withheld aid and shelter from Muzaffar, and himself marched against him. When he reached Upleta, about fifteen miles north-west of the fortress of Junágaḍh, the viceroy heard that Muzaffar had sought shelter in the Barda hills in the south-west corner of the peninsula. Advancing to the hills, he halted his main force <b>outside</b> of the <b>rough</b> country and sent skirmishing parties to examine the hills. Muzaffar had already passed through Navánagar and across Gujarát to Danta in the Mahi Kántha. Here he was once more defeated by the Prantij garrison, and a third time took refuge in Rájpípla. The viceroy now marched on Navánagar to punish the Jám. The Jám sent in his submission, and the viceroy taking from him, by way of fine, an elephant and some valuable horses, returned to Áhmedábád. He next sent a detachment against Ghazni Khán of Jhalore who had favoured Muzaffar. Ghazni Khán submitted, and no further steps were taken against him.|$|R

His whole family, if I may so express it, were cleared for action. I found Mrs. Micawber in the closest and most uncompromising of bonnets, made fast under the chin; and in a shawl which tied her up (as I had been tied up, when my aunt first received me) like a bundle, and was secured behind at the waist, in a strong knot. Miss Micawber I found made snug for stormy weather, in the same manner; with nothing superfluous about her. Master Micawber was hardly visible in a Guernsey shirt, and the shaggiest suit of slops I ever saw; {{and the children were}} done up, like preserved meats, in impervious cases. Both Mr. Micawber and his eldest son wore their sleeves loosely turned back at the wrists, as being ready to lend a hand in any direction, and to 'tumble up', or sing out, 'Yeo--Heave--Yeo!' on the shortest notice.|$|R

By its architectural and decorative elements, the exterior of this church entirely foreshadows the artistic virtues of monuments {{from the time of}} Petru I Muşat.

Values are plan and decoration items speaking about relations with the Byzantine-Balkan world. The <b>outside</b> consisting of <b>rough</b> gray-green stone of the monument is refreshed by a bright and harmonious scenery of ceramic ornaments made out of bricks, leg discs in the form of mushrooms and cruciform colored flowers. At the top of the monument, about two thirds of the height of the walls (from the pedestal upwards), there can be seen a frieze consisting of two rows of discs alternating with cruciform flowers. They range from the apses (the south side as well) {{all the way up to}} the window of the narthex. The semicircular arches of brick niches are also sharpened by a row of discs alternating with cruciform flowers. The windows with the exception of the one of the northern apse are decorated at the top with one rectangular frame consisting of two rows of glazed discs and three cruciform flowers, all framed by glazed bricks (either plain or coloured). The same decoration can also be seen at the niche above the entrance door destined for the church icon. Above this frame, there can be seen a cornice made out of bricks arranged in a zig zag pattern.

Tehnološka dovršenost v slovenski lesnopredelovalni industriji ni nekaj povsem samoumevnega, obstaja pa zavedanje, da je za konkurenčnost panoge nujno potreben napredek. Naše delo in prispevek se dotikata vpeljave strojnega vida v proces avtomatizacija pri proizvodnji opažnih plošč. Ozko grlo v procesu izdelave je namreč ročno krpanje prisotnih grč, ena izmed ključnih komponent avtomatizacije takšnega sistema pa je dobra lokalizacija grč. V delu smo širše orisali problem segmentacije. Predlagali in ovrednotili smo metodo segmentacije na podlagi iskanja najmanjšega prereza oziroma največjega pretoka v grafu. Metoda na podlagi grobo lokalizirane grče določi modela verjetnostne porazdelitve mešanice Gaussov za grčo in ozadje. Na podlagi pridobljenih modelov določimo območne in mejne uteži ter izgradimo graf, pri tem pa področje izven grobe regije grče upoštevamo kot seme in ga pripišemo ozadju. Izračun minimalnega prereza grafa je hkrati rešitev segmentacije. Rezultat sta dve ločeni regiji, kjer ena pripada grči, druga pa lesu. Vrednotenje predlagane metode smo predstavili na zbirki grč, pridobljeni pri enem izmed slovenskih proizvajalcev opažnih plošč med procesom izdelave. Za potrebo validacije metode smo zbirko 119 grč primerno anotirali in jo ponujamo kot javno dobro. Predlagana metoda je dosegla na celotni zbirki 99, 00 % točnost pri preciznosti 0, 94 in priklicu 0, 98.
