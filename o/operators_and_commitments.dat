40|$|Replanning {{involves}} {{generating a}} new plan to fix execution failures. Past work has often characterized replanning procedurally as a special case of Plan Reuse: reuse the current plan to solve a new problem with altered initial and goal states. Just as in normal reuse, these replanning systems focus on minimally perturbing the plan while accounting for the alterations in the problem. There are two important limitations to this view of replanning. First, many failures cannot be represented as alterations to initial and goal states. Second, plan reuse is motivated by efficiency considerations during plan generation, while replanning attempts to minimize the residual execution costs of the partial execution. In this paper, we argue that replanning should rightly be seen as solving {{a new plan}}ning problem that not only captures general execution failures, but also the commitments incurred during the partial execution. Failures are modeled as finegrained modifications to <b>operator</b> descriptions, <b>and</b> <b>commitments</b> are modeled as soft constraints. From this general perspective, minimal perturbation planning {{can be understood as}} a crude heuristic for respecting commitments: if we keep the plan the same, then we are likely to respect the commitments as well...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss an Energy Audit {{conducted}} in 1976 on Union Carbide's Texas City No. 3 Olefins Ethylene Unit. Staffing, planning, and conduct of an Audit are reviewed. Project endorsement by the multifunctional Energy Audit Team {{is used to}} prioritize capital programs. The paper will describe several projects having possible application in other Olefin plants. Preparation and use of an Energy Curve reviewed. An Energy Index graph projects improvements to be achieved by implementation of a four-year $ 44 million capital program which resulted from the Audit. Reorganization of the Olefin unit technical staff to complete the energy conservation program is covered. Several techniques being used to insure <b>operator</b> <b>and</b> maintenance <b>commitment</b> to energy conservation are reviewed. The Texas City No. 3 Olefins Unit is an LPG based ethylene plant rated in excess of one billion pounds per year. Since start-up in 1968, energy costs have escalated {{by a factor of}} ten. The unit's current energy bill exceeds $ 45 million per year. Between 1972 and 1977 the Olefin plant conversion energy index increased by 40 %. Concerned with rising fuel price and decreasing energy efficiency, management decided to conduct an Energy Audit on the Olefins Unit. This paper discusses the audit and implementation of the resulting conservation program. The paper is divided into four sections: I. The Energy Audit II. Energy Curve III.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{identify}} and analyze factors that affect business to business relationships between telecommunication <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> vendors in Sri Lanka. This study is based on two models developed in telecommunication <b>operator</b> <b>and</b> vendor perspectives, and through in-depth questionnaire surveys conducted on employees working in telecommunication <b>operator</b> <b>and</b> vendor organizations in Sri Lanka. Analysis shows that relationship strength between telecommunication <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> vendors is determined by trust, <b>commitment,</b> adaptation, communication <b>and</b> satisfaction in the perspective of operators. Satisfaction of operators is determined by product quality, service support, delivery performance, supplier know how and value for money. In the perspective of vendors, relationship strength is determined by trust, <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> satisfaction. Satisfaction of vendors is determined by economic factors and referencing from personnel networks. The higher management of telecommunication <b>operator</b> <b>and</b> vendor organizations can apply various strategies to improve these identified factors to further strength the business relationships between these parties...|$|R

Through a survey of customers of legal services providers in Malaysia, data were collected. Results from a standard analysis of data show that the four dimensions of ethical marketing norms contribute significantly and explain a significant amount of variance in RQ <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> The results further show that three dimensions of ethical norms namely price and distribution norm, information and contract norm, and general honesty and integrity norm are significantly associated with relationship quality <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> Product <b>and</b> promotion norm has no significant relationship with relationship quality <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> RQ plays a mediating role in the relationship between marketing norms <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> The study reveals that the same three dimensions of marketing norms predict both RQ <b>and</b> <b>commitment,</b> <b>and</b> are useful for effective legal services marketing.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Past research has indicated that lack of supervisory leadership reduces teachers' job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment.</b> This quantitative study examined and compared therelationships between principals' supervisory leadership styles and high school teachers job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> in both China and the United States. The mail-in survey questionnaire included three measures, the Supervisory Behavior Description, the Teacher Job Satisfaction, <b>and</b> the Organizational <b>Commitment,</b> with a demographic form. This study found that the U. S. teachers had much higher levels of job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> than the Chinese teachers. U. S. teachers perceived their principals as using more consideration leadership style while Chinese teachers perceived their principals as using more initiating structure leadership style. Positive relationships between the consideration leadership style and both job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> negative relationships between the initiating structure leadership style and both job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> were found in both countries. Further, these relationships were found to be stronger among the Chinese teachers than the U. S. teachers. Findings may help administrators transform school supervisory leadership in order to improve teachers' job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> <b>and</b> develop cross-cultural understanding of the influences of supervision on teachers' job satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>commitment...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{different}} forms of relationships that are culturally bond have emerged such as; ‘Guanxi’ in China (Yau, Lee, Chow, Sing, and Tse, 2000; Lou, 2007; Liu, Li, Tao and Wang, 2008), ‘Blat’ in Russia (Michailova and Worm, 2003) and ‘Boon Koon’ in Thailand (Pimpa, 2008). While these special forms of relationships are culturally bond, studies have also suggested {{that the development of}} a business relationship is directly linked to the development of trust <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> (Wilson, 1995). Considering that these forms are culturally bond, studies from the Middle East on the formation of trust <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> within relationship development are largely absent. We argue that understanding the dynamic formation of trust <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> will help to better understand Et-Moone business relationships within the specific cultural context of the Middle East. Thus, this study combines the insights from the theory of life-cycle (Ford, 1980; Dwyer et al., 1987) and the theory of trust <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> by Morgan <b>and</b> Hunt (1994) to understand business relationships in the Middle East. Based on qualitative research using a longitudinal approach and 33 semi-structured in-depth interviews conducted in 2003, this study finds the relationship between trust <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> to be far more dynamic and changeable as the relationship evolves. Also, it finds that trust <b>and</b> <b>commitment</b> are major factors in establishing Et-Moone relationships...|$|R
