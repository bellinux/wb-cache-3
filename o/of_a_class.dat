5|$|La Galissonnière was lead ship <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> of wooden-hulled, armored corvettes {{built for}} the French Navy during the 1870s.

Likewise, more Light Pacifics were built than were needed, frequently undertaking tasks that would usually befit a much smaller locomotive. A curious but common sight west of Exeter during the winter months was a Light Pacific hauling a local stopping service with a single carriage to destinations as diverse as Padstow and Wadebridge. Finally, too much money was spent on the expensive rebuilding programme when dieselisation and modernisation meant the locomotives would have very limited lives in their new guise.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{her mother}} and sister, Murray decided to enroll at the newly opened {{department}} of Egyptology at University College London (UCL) in Bloomsbury, Central London. Having been founded by an endowment from Amelia Blanford Edwards, one of the co-founders of the Egypt Exploration Fund (EEF), the department was run by the pioneering early archaeologist Sir William Flinders Petrie, and based in the Edwards Library of UCL's South Cloisters. Murray began her studies at UCL at age 30 in January 1894, as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> composed largely of other women and older men. There, she took courses in the Ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages which were taught by Francis Llewellyn Griffith and Walter Ewing Crum respectively.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the targeting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation. These proteins are ubiquitinated by SCFTIR1, or SCF in complex with the auxin receptor TIR1. Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E

5|$|Located about 1.8° west of Epsilon (ε) Tauri is T Tauri, the {{prototype}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> of variable stars called T Tauri stars. This star undergoes erratic changes in luminosity, varying between magnitude 9 to 13 {{over a period}} of weeks or months. This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a main sequence star. The surrounding reflection nebula NGC 1555 is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity. To the north lies Kappa Tauri, a visual double star consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.|$|E
5|$|The book is {{structured}} into two sections. The first {{portion of the}} book is critical of the aviation industry and the U.S. government agencies tasked with inspecting it. The second portion of the book addresses consumers and potential airline passengers. The book became successful shortly after publication. It reached number 10 on the New York Times Best Seller list and number 9 on a Chicago Tribune list of bestsellers in early April 1997. Most reviews of the book in media publications were positive. Some individuals within the airline industry claimed the book contained factual inaccuracies, and this was investigated as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> project at George Washington University.|$|E
5|$|The players {{ultimately}} prevailed after a {{jury trial}} on their claims. That verdict, the pendency of other antitrust cases and the threat <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>class</b> action lawsuit filed by Reggie White, then with the Philadelphia Eagles, {{on behalf of all}} NFL players caused the parties to settle the antitrust cases and to agree on a formula that permitted free agency. In return, the owners received a salary cap, albeit one tied to a formula based on the players' share of total league revenues. The agreement also established a salary floorminimum payrolls all teams were obliged to pay. The settlement was presented to and approved by Judge Doty, who had also heard the McNeil antitrust case in 1993. Once the agreement was approved, the NFLPA reconstituted itself as a labor union and entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the league. The NFLPA and the league extended the 1993 agreement five times. The final extension came in March 2006 when it was extended through the 2010 season after the NFL owners voted 302 to accept the NFLPA's final proposal.|$|E

50|$|Represents <b>a</b> {{framework}} <b>of</b> {{objects as}} classes that are partitioned into {{three kinds of}} classes: simple classes, link classes, and path <b>classes.</b> Objects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple <b>class</b> are {{on the one hand}} just like objects in other models. They have an object type and an object identity and can have attributes whose values are either <b>of</b> <b>a</b> data type (e.g. integer, string) or <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object type (that is, an attribute may contain a reference to another object). So the structure <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object is basically that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tuple or record.

Objects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> link <b>class</b> are like objects <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple <b>class</b> but additionally contain two distinguished references to source and target objects (belonging to simple classes), which makes them edges of the database graph. Finally, <b>an</b> object <b>of</b> <b>a</b> path <b>class</b> is like <b>an</b> object <b>of</b> <b>a</b> simple <b>class,</b> but contains additionally <b>a</b> list <b>of</b> references to node and edge objects which form a path over the database graph.|$|R

Like SFDBA, DBAHU uses a common available byte counter and a common down counter for multiple queues <b>of</b> <b>a</b> service <b>class.</b> However, to utilize the unused bandwidth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> service <b>class,</b> <b>an</b> available byte counter can be negative unlike SFDBA. Also, the unused remainder <b>of</b> <b>an</b> available byte counter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> service <b>class</b> is added to available byte counters of other service classes who require more bandwidth. Using simulations, we show that DBAHU is superior to SFDBA in mean delay and frame delay variance...|$|R
