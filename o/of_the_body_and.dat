5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} to small areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most of the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods {{also have}} colorless blood, {{circulated}} by a muscular heart {{lying in the}} dorsal {{part of the body}} above the stomach. The blood passes through vessels that extend to the front and back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> branch to organs including the lophophore at the front and the gut, muscles, gonads and nephridia at the rear. The blood circulation seems not to be completely closed, and the coelomic fluid and blood must mix to a degree. The main function of the blood may be to deliver nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted the demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> {{the pleasures of}} food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came {{to be associated with}} decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E

5|$|The {{forewings}} of beetles are {{not used}} for flight, but form elytra which cover the hind part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> protect the hindwings. The elytra are usually hard shell-like structures which must be raised to allow the hind wings to move for flight. However, in the soldier beetles (Cantharidae), the elytra are soft, earning this family the name of leatherwings. Other soft wing beetles include the net-winged beetle Calopteron discrepans, which has brittle wings that rupture easily in order to release chemicals for defence.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} {{of an individual}} scleractinian polyp {{is known as a}} corallite. It is secreted by the epidermis of the lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> initially forms a cup surrounding this part of the polyp. The interior of the cup contains radially aligned plates, or septa, projecting upwards from the base. Each of these plates is flanked by a pair of mesenteries.|$|E

This led Al-Nafis to seek his own understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living <b>body</b> <b>and</b> its soul through theoretical study of medicine, physics, and theology.|$|R

5|$|The wings lie flat on {{the body}} and are very {{variable}} in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others.

The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings. In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.|$|E

5|$|After Katja is shot, Sarah flees in Beth's car and {{receives}} {{a call from}} a woman on Beth's phone. The woman, after hearing that Katja is dead, instructs Sarah to dispose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> retrieve Katja's briefcase. While burying Katja's body, Sarah finds a hotel key in her pocket and keeps it. She visits her foster brother Felix's apartment and discovers that the $75,000 she stole from Beth's bank account has been taken by Beth's detective partner Art. When she returns to Beth's apartment she is surprised to find Beth's boyfriend, Paul, who seems confused by Sarah's demeanour but does not realise that she is not Beth. The next day, Sarah prepares to meet Art, and lies that the $75,000 belongs to Paul, but Art says he will return the money only after the hearing Beth must attend about a suspicious shooting in which she was involved.|$|E
50|$|Belge {{was indicted}} {{for refusing to}} {{disclose}} <b>the</b> locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies,</b> <b>and</b> Armani's bar association began a disbarment proceeding against him. Both were ultimately exonerated and their conduct was vindicated by the bar. Four years after his conviction, Garrow escaped from prison. Armani provided advice to the police which led to them finding Garrow hiding near the prison. Garrow, who was armed, was shot and killed.|$|R

30|$|Figure  9 shows that, with an {{increase}} in track damping, <b>the</b> vertical vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car <b>body</b> <b>and</b> bogie are basically unchanged at a frequency lower than 35  Hz, slightly decrease within <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 35 – 70  Hz, and slightly increase above 70  Hz. It is thus considered that track damping has little effect on <b>the</b> vertical vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car <b>body</b> <b>and</b> bogie. <b>The</b> vertical vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheel–rail force and rail decrease within <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> 40 – 70  Hz and change little at other frequencies. It is thus evident that {{an increase}} in track damping effectively reduces <b>the</b> vertical vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheel–rail force and track structure but has little effect on <b>the</b> vertical vibrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car <b>body</b> <b>and</b> bogie.|$|R
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) which most palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified on the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologist Don Brothwell {{considers}} {{that many of}} the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques, such as computer tomography (CT) scans, has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> <b>and</b> internal examination. Of the 27bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4thcenturies. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two valves, but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two valves are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the valves are on the left and right sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E
