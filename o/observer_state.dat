2500|$|On January 9, 2013, {{the first}} stamp with the [...] "State of Palestine" [...] wording was issued by Palestinian postal service. The move came {{following}} the historic upgrade of Palestine mission of PLO (Palestinian Authority) to the UN to non-member <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> on 29 November 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The bid was {{expected}} to be submitted on 23 September in the Security Council, even though the 129 member states that recognise Palestine constitute the necessary 2/3 majority; however approval needs nine of 15 of the SC votes, though the U.S. promised to veto the measure. It also follows Obama's widely condemned statement to the UNGA that the recognition should be bilaterally negotiated. Abbas's diplomatic advisor Majdi al-Khaldi said that though the Palestinians believed they could win the votes needed, [...] "Three {{of the members of the}} Security Council (Bosnia, Gabon and Nigeria) are under pressure from the Americans." [...] In turn, French President Nicolas Sarkozy suggested an alternative proposal temporarily non-member <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> status should be granted with a timetable for new negotiations to conclude in a year.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. State Department {{spokesperson}} Victoria Nuland said: [...] "The resolution {{does nothing}} to get them (Palestinians) closer to statehood, and it may actually make the environment more difficult." [...] She also said that Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns and U.S. Special Envoy for Middle East Peace David Hale met Abbas and told him of the U.S.' [...] "very real concern" [...] about the initiative. [...] "We've been clear, we've been consistent with the Palestinians that we oppose <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> status in the General Assembly and this resolution. And the Deputy Secretary also reiterated {{that no one should}} be under any illusion that this resolution is going to produce the results that the Palestinians claim to seek, namely to have their own state living in peace next to Israel." [...] U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch warned against the draft resolution, with Hatch introducing a motion to cut off financing to the UN if it passes.|$|E

2500|$|Similar to the {{previous}} year, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas vowed {{to take up the}} issue of Palestinian membership in some form on 27 September at the General Debate, as part of a campaign the Western media viewed as an attempt to gain the international community's attention. However, Abbas did not call for formally putting the issue to a vote. [...] The move followed days of Palestinian protests directed against the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank cities of Bethlehem, Nablus and Hebron. [...] However, unlike {{the previous}} year, where Abbas sought full-member status, he will symbolically seek non-member status. At the same time, the Palestinian delegation will be half the size of that of the previous year. Following Operation Pillar of Defense, the Palestinians promised to seek a vote on an upgrade in status to non-member <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> in the UN General Assembly on 29 November, the symbolic date the UN chose voted on the Partition Plan in 1947, leading to the founding of Israel, and the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. On 29 November, the UNGA voted on the issue.|$|E
2500|$|United Nations General Assembly {{resolution}} 67/19 is {{a resolution}} upgrading Palestine to non-member <b>observer</b> <b>state</b> {{status in the}} United Nations. It {{was adopted by the}} sixty-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly on 29 November 2012, the date of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People and the 65th anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 181(II) on the Future Government of Palestine. The draft resolution was proposed by Palestine's representative at the United Nations. It, however, maintains the status of the Palestinian Liberation Organization as the representative of the Palestinian people within the United Nations system. Though strongly contested by the United States and the government of Israel, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed support for the measure. The motion was seen as largely symbolic, though it could allow Palestine to start proceedings at the International Criminal Court against Israel. [...] Its timing, following a year in which Palestine obtained membership of UNESCO and the UN Security Council was unable [...] "to make a unanimous recommendation" [...] on their application for full UN membership, and coming several days after the completion of Operation Pillar of Defense, was also noted. The new status equates Palestine with that of the Holy See within the United Nations system and implicitly recognises Palestinian sovereignty.|$|E
