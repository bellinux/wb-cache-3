25|$|The {{first part}} of the name Skarstind is one of the Norwegian words for {{mountain}} pass, although it is impossible to say which pass has given its name to the mountain. It might be the pass to the south <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the pass between the summit itself and the pinnacle, Nåle. Nåle, the Needle, has got its name from the local word for pinnacle, which describes the shape of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{representation}} of tone. Most non-linguistic transcriptions of Mixtec {{do not fully}} record the tones. When tone is represented, acute accent over the vowel is typically used to indicate high tone. Mid tone is sometimes indicated with a macron over the vowel, {{but it may be}} left unmarked. Low tone is sometimes indicated with a grave accent overt the vowel, but it might be left unmarked, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> indicated with an underscore to the vowel.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis {{can take}} many forms. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a matter of naming the disease, lesion, {{dysfunction}} <b>or</b> disability. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a management-naming <b>or</b> prognosis-naming exercise. <b>It</b> may indicate either degree of abnormality on a continuum or kind of abnormality in a classification. It’s influenced by non-medical factors such as power, ethics and financial incentives for patient <b>or</b> doctor. <b>It</b> can be a brief summation or an extensive formulation, even taking {{the form of a}} story <b>or</b> metaphor. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a means of communication such as a computer code through which it triggers payment, prescription, notification, information <b>or</b> advice. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> pathogenic <b>or</b> salutogenic. <b>It’s</b> generally uncertain and provisional.|$|R

Mrs. Robin left them {{to come over here}} to help drive away Mr. Blacksnake, and while she was here some one ate those eggs. Nobody knows who it could have been, because all the birds of the Old Orchard were over here at that time. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> leave <b>been</b> Chatterer the Red Squirrel, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> Sammy Jay, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> Creaker the Grackle, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> Blacky the Crow. Whoever it was just took that chance to sneak over there and rob that nest when {{there was no one to}} see him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lily can {{be short}} for Lillian, Liliana <b>or</b> Lilith. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> from the Greek word [...] "louloudi" [...] which means flower.|$|R
25|$|At {{one time}} people were carried across rivers, usually at fords, but not necessarily. A fee would {{normally}} be charged <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> part of the 'job description' of a servant. One Ayrshire story tells of a rich farmer who employed a servant girl to carry him across the river {{on his way to}} church each Sunday. As time went by he became very fond of the servant and eventually they married. She willingly carried him across on the way to their wedding, but she refused on the way back and never carried him again.|$|E
25|$|Although {{procedures}} {{vary from}} one field of inquiry to another, they are frequently {{the same from}} one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, implying {{that it is possible}} to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.|$|E
500|$|These {{lines have}} led to {{conflicting}} interpretations among Harrison biographers regarding a supposedly superior attitude on the singer's part. Ian Inglis writes of [...] "an increasingly familiar elitism in his apparent perception of himself", adding: [...] "When [...] sings of 'the pure of heart' and tells the Lord that 'there {{are just a few}} who bow before you,' the implied conclusion is that he counts himself among their number." [...] While acknowledging the ambiguity of this message, Leng writes: [...] "This could be taken as Harrison's statement of his own spiritual superiority, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> his metaphor for a rejection of conceit. If ego-driven politicians and self-serving military leaders were able to bow before anything, even a 'concept' like God, the world would be a better place. 'The Day the World Gets 'Round' laments human nature and calls for a little humility." ...|$|E
60|$|His wife, hurrying eagerly to meet him, checked herself. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> distrust, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> unreasoning fear--she hesitated on {{the point}} of {{approaching}} him.|$|R
50|$|Many people {{involved}} in, or {{commenting on the}} case, including prosecutor Mike Nifong (who was later disbarred), called the alleged assault a hate crime <b>or</b> suggested <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> one.|$|R

500|$|Scholars such as Claudia Tate suggest {{there is}} a theme of jealousy {{throughout}} the novel. Irene displays it here when deciding whether to expose Clare or not [...] "She was caught between two allegiances, different, yet the same. Herself. Her race. Race! The thing that bound and suffocated her. Whatever steps she took, or if she took none at all, something would be crushed. A person or the race. Clare, herself, or the race. <b>Or,</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> all three. Nothing, she imagined, was ever more completely sardonic.” Larsen uses jealousy as {{the main source of}} conflict in the novel, and uses race solely as a vehicle for Irene to potentially rid herself of Clare. At this point in the story Irene realizes she can expose Clare’s true racial identity to remove Clare from her life, and regain that security she desires more than anything.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} in The Washington Post, critic Philip Kennicott had a cynical view: [...] " [...] {{place in a}} world of lies. Innocent lies? Not necessarily. The Red Balloon may be the most {{seamless}} fusion of capitalism and Christianity ever put on film. A young boy invests in a red balloon the love of which places him on the outside of society. The balloon is hunted down and killed on a barren hilltop–-think Calvary–-by a mob of cruel boys. The ending, a bizarre emotional sucker punch, is straight out of the New Testament. Thus is investment rewarded-–with Christian transcendence or, at least, an old-fashioned Assumption. This might be sweet. <b>Or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a very cynical reduction of the primary impulse to religious faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|Georg Forster, who had sailed under Lieutenant James Cook in {{the voyage}} of the Resolution (1772–1775), wrote in 1786 {{on the future}} {{prospects}} of the British colony: [...] "New Holland, an island of enormous extent <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> said, a third continent, is the future homeland of a new civilized society which, however mean its beginning may seem to be, nevertheless promises {{within a short time}} to become very important." [...] And the merchant adventurer and would-be coloniser of southwestern Australia under the Swedish flag, William Bolts, said to the Swedish Ambassador in Paris, Erik von Staël in December 1789, that the British had founded at Botany Bay, [...] "a settlement which in time will become of the greatest importance to the Commerce of the Globe".|$|E
50|$|An {{endpoint}} {{that generates}} an event may be observing some activity directly and reporting salient state changes <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> just <b>be</b> reporting <b>or</b> transforming event data from another source (e.g., a webhook).|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} empire one finds milites medici who were immunes ("exempt") from other duties. Some were {{staff of the}} hospital, which Pseudo-Hyginus {{mentions}} in De Munitionibus Castrorum [...] as being set apart from other buildings so that the patients can rest. The hospital administrator was an optio valetudinarii. The orderlies aren't generally mentioned, but they must have existed, as the patients needed care and the doctors had more important duties. Perhaps they were servile or civilians, not worth mentioning. There were some noscomi, male nurses not in the army. Or, {{they could have been}} the milites medici. The latter term might be any military medic <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> orderlies detailed from the legion. There were also medici castrorum. Not enough information survives in the sources to say for certain what distinctions existed, if any.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding her {{intake of}} food, Jasmuheen is quoted by the Correx Archives as saying: [...] "Generally not much at all. Maybe a few {{cups of tea}} {{and a glass of}} water, but now and then if I feel a bit bored and I want some flavour, then I will have a mouthful of {{whatever}} it is I'm wanting the flavour of. So it might be a piece of chocolate <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a mouthful of a cheesecake or something like that." [...] In the aftermath of the 60 Minutes broadcast, Kathy Marks noted in The Independent, [...] "Visitors to her large villa in the prosperous Chapel Hill area of Brisbane invariably find her refrigerator generously stocked with food, all of it destined, she insists, for the stomach of her second husband, Jeff Ferguson, a convicted fraudster".|$|E
2500|$|It {{might be}} {{during the day}} there were {{opportunities}} to shoot at opponents if they came into range, or hostile aircraft might fly over the area, [...] "running the gauntlet as the white puffs of shrapnel or black splotches of high explosive anti-aircraft shells burst around them thousands of feet up in the air." [...] However, the troop could be in danger from [...] "shrapnel, shell fragments, and nose-caps", which could [...] "fall, with a whirring noise, from the sky" [...] after the shells had exploded in the air. <b>Or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> that the opponents know about this particular post, shelling {{it as soon as}} it was light. Then [...] "there will be a muffled roar in the distance, a whine that quickly grows to a hissing shriek, and with a shocking crash in the stillness a shell bursts near at hand." [...] While everyone dives for cover an eye is kept on the horses without which they will have a long weary trek back to the regiment. If the shells go increasingly wide the guns will stop as the target could not be found. Later they may get a visit from an artillery officer wanting to know about any new targets, or a member of the high command may visit to familiarise [...] "himself with all the features of the front he is responsible for." [...] Later when a dust cloud indicates the arrival of the relieving troop, the horses are saddled, and then the order, [...] "Get Ready to Move!" ...|$|E
60|$|Two reasons {{existed for}} the difference. This one <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> trodden by a similar weight of tread to the other, {{exercised}} a less number of times; <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> walked just as frequently, but by lighter feet.|$|R
50|$|The AN/ARC-164 is a {{military}} airborne UHF radio station that operates in the aeronautical mobile (<b>OR)</b> service. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> found on B-52G/H, B-1B, C/EC/RC-26D, KC-135, C-23, C-130, C-141, F-15, A-10, F-16, UH-1D, CH-47, H-53, H-60 and S-3B aircraft.|$|R
50|$|For big weapons, the toy {{version is}} usually {{on a smaller}} scale. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> much smaller, such as a toy {{catapult}} that is 20 cm tall. <b>Or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> just <b>be</b> sized for children, such as a water pistol that is {{half the size of}} a similar firearm.|$|R
2500|$|... "One covereth {{violence}} {{with his}} garment": or, [...] "and violence covereth his garment," [...] <b>or,</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be,</b> {{in the same}} sense, [...] "he covereth his garment with violence" [...] , so that it cannot be hid, nor washed away, nor removed, but envelopes him and his garment; and that, to his shame and punishment. It was, as it were, [...] "an outer garment of violence", as Asaph says in Psalm 73:6, [...] "violence covereth them as a garment;" [...] or David in Psalm 109:18, [...] "he clothed himself with cursing as with a garment." [...] It was like a garment with [...] "fretting leprosy," [...] unclean and making unclean, to be burned with fire. Leviticus 13:47-58. Contrariwise, the redeemed saints had Revelation 7:14 [...] "washed their robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb." [...] Having declared God's hatred of this their doing, he sums {{up in the same}} words, but more briefly; [...] "and this being so, ye shall take heed to your spirit, and not deal treacherously." [...] Maurer translates, [...] "And (Jehovah hateth him who) covereth his garment (that is, his wife, in Arabic idiom; compare Genesis 20:16, 'He is to thee a covering of thy eyes'; the husband was so to the wife, and the wife to the husband; also Deuteronomy 22:30; Ruth 3:9; Ezekiel 16:8) with injury." [...] The Hebrew favors [...] "garment," [...] being accusative of the thing covered (as in Psalm 73:6). Their [...] "violence" [...] is the putting away of their wives; the [...] "garment" [...] with which they try to cover it is the plea of Moses' permission (Deuteronomy 24:1; compare Matthew 19:6-9).|$|E

50|$|The games {{ranged from}} spot the difference, {{to making a}} word out of jumbled up letters, to {{guessing}} words when given a clue. The word guessing game required viewers to identify an obscure object based on its colour, <b>or</b> where <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> found.|$|R

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> Mr. Pickwick's appearance, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> his manner, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> the temptation--irresistible to {{a female}} mind--of hearing {{something}} at present enveloped in mystery, that reduced the more reasonable portion of the establishment (some four individuals) {{to a state of}} comparative quiet. By them it was proposed, as a test of Mr. Pickwick's sincerity, that he should immediately submit to personal restraint; and that gentleman having consented to hold a conference with Miss Tomkins, from the interior of a closet in which the day boarders hung their bonnets and sandwich-bags, he at once stepped into it, of his own accord, and was securely locked in. This revived the others; and Miss Tomkins having been brought to, and brought down, the conference began.|$|R
