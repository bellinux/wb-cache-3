Very few of the men who had defended the Schellenberg rejoined the Elector's and Marsin's army. Included amongst this number, however, were the Comte d'Arco and his second-in-command, the Marquis de Maffei, both of whom later defended Lutzingen at the Battle of Blenheim. Of the 22,000 Allied troops engaged, over 5,000 had become casualties, overwhelming the hospitals that Marlborough had set up in Nördlingen. Amongst the Allied fatalities were six lieutenant-generals, four major-generals, and 28 brigadiers, colonels and lieutenant-colonels, reflecting the exposed positions <b>of</b> <b>senior</b> officers as they led their men forward in the assaults.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to create two {{composite}} indicators which will provide an informative value about the standard <b>of</b> living <b>of</b> <b>seniors</b> in selected countries of OECD. Using these indicators {{it will be possible}} to make a comparison of standards of living on the international level. First of the indicators is Consolidated replacement rate (CRR) which measures income conditions <b>of</b> <b>seniors,</b> which from the economical point of view is considered as the source of standard of living. The construction of CRR is built on theoretical basics from an OECD publication - Pension at Glance 2013. The main component of CRR indicator is a replacement rate which compares income <b>of</b> <b>seniors</b> before and after the retirement. CRR is also composed of two other indicators influencing disposable pension <b>of</b> <b>seniors</b> - imputed rents and services provided by the public sector. The highest values of CRR were reached by Netherlands, Hungary, Iceland and Denmark. On the opposite side the lowest values had countries like Great Britain, Germany and Poland. The reason of this low score for Great Britain and Germany was unavailability of data of private incomes <b>of</b> <b>seniors</b> and therefore it could not be included into CRR. The second constructed indicator is Standard <b>of</b> living <b>of</b> <b>seniors</b> (SLS) which provides a more complex view on the standard <b>of</b> living <b>of</b> <b>seniors</b> using variations <b>of</b> different indicators selected by the author. It includes for example the income situation, risk of poverty and social exclusion or happiness <b>of</b> <b>seniors.</b> Countries with the best values of SLS were Denmark, Netherlands, Iceland and Luxembourg. By far the lowest score was gained by Portugal followed by Estonia, Poland and Greece. In comparison with other countries the Czech Republic was below average among the observed OECD countries with the fifth lowest score of CRR and slightly below average in SLS...|$|R
