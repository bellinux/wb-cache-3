5|$|Although Tasmania {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the Australian mainland for about 10,000 years, islands in the Bass Strait between the two landmasses have allowed many species to traverse. With around 5,400km (3,400mi) of coastline and 350 offshore islands, Tasmania provides a diverse haven for birds despite its relatively small size. Birds are abundant in Tasmanian wetlands and waterways, and ten of these habitats are internationally important and protected under the Ramsar Convention. Many migratory birds {{make use of the}} bays, mudflats and beaches for feeding, including the threatened hooded plover and little tern, both of which breed along the coast. The near-coastal button grass grasslands of the southwest, harbour the breeding grounds of the critically endangered <b>orange-bellied</b> <b>parrot.</b> Many of the rarer species dwell in Tasmania's eucalyptus (sclerophyll) forests or rainforests, which cover much of the island.|$|E
25|$|The {{peninsula}} contains several significant wetlands, many {{of which}} form part of the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site and are of international significance {{for the protection of}} waterbirds and the critically endangered <b>orange-bellied</b> <b>parrot.</b> They are also recognised by BirdLife International in the Bellarine Wetlands and Swan Bay and Port Phillip Bay Islands Important Bird Areas.|$|E
25|$|Swan Bay, {{adjacent}} to Queenscliff, {{is an important}} feeding ground for waterbirds and migratory waders. The Mud Islands, off Sorrento, are an important breeding habitat for white-faced storm petrels, silver gulls, Australian pelicans and Pacific gulls. Salt marshes in the northwestern sections of the bay, such as that in the Werribee Sewage Farm and the adjacent Spit Nature Conservation Reserve, are within the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site, listed as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, and the critically endangered <b>orange-bellied</b> <b>parrot</b> is found at three wintering sites with saltmarsh habitat around Port Phillip and the Bellarine Peninsula. A variety of seabirds, such as Australasian gannets, nest on artificial structures in the bay.|$|E

A {{proposed}} relocation of the Coode Island Chemical storage facility to a location near Point Wilson, Victoria was jeopardised by the potential impacts upon <b>orange-bellied</b> <b>parrot</b> habitat.

50|$|The {{wetlands}} {{have been}} identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support significant numbers of critically endangered <b>orange-bellied</b> <b>parrots,</b> endangered Australasian bitterns and over 1% of the world populations of chestnut teals, sharp-tailed sandpipers, red-necked stints and banded stilts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{group of}} sites has been {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of critically endangered <b>orange-bellied</b> <b>parrots</b> and vulnerable fairy terns, and over 1% of the world populations of blue-billed ducks, chestnut teals, Australian white and straw-necked ibises, red-necked stints and silver gulls.|$|R
50|$|The greater {{amount of}} blue on the wing helps {{distinguish}} the Blue-winged parrot from the elegant parrot and the <b>orange-bellied</b> <b>parrot.</b> The latter two species have more yellow-green and bright green plumage overall respectively.|$|E
