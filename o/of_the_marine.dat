5|$|Although {{not officially}} {{considered}} a Sergeant Major <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Marine</b> Corps, when Archibald Sommers {{was appointed to}} the grade of Sergeant Major January 1, 1801, it was a solitary post, similar to the modern billet of Sergeant Major <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Marine</b> Corps. In 1833, an act of legislation made the rank of sergeant major permanent for the Marine Corps and by 1899 five Marines held the rank of sergeant major. This continued until 1946, when the rank was abolished, only to be re-introduced in 1954 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Marine</b> Corps rank structure.|$|E
