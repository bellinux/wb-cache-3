Second <b>order</b> pyramidal <b>slip</b> is also almost entirely stage II deformation, but the work hardening rate is 10 · 10 ⁻³. The critical resolved shear stress for second <b>order</b> pyramidal <b>slip</b> is about two times higher than for first <b>order</b> prism <b>slip.</b> The athermal temperature is approximately 300 °K.

The obstacle energy is 0. 54 eV at the athermal temperature. However, the Dorn-Rajnak model supporting a Peierls mechanism is satisfied below 165 °K, thus this mechanism could be rate controlling below 165 °K.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to analyze numerically the steady {{boundary}} layer flow and heat transfer characteristics of Casson fluid with variable temperature and viscous dissipation past a permeable shrinking sheet with second <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> velocity. Using appropriate similarity transformations, the basic nonlinear partial differential equations have been transformed into ordinary differential equations. These equations have been solved numerically for different values of the governing parameters namely: shrinking parametersuction parameterCasson parameterfirst <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> parametersecond <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> parameter  Prandtl number  and the Eckert number  using the bvp 4 c function from MATLAB. A stability analysis has also been performed. Numerical results have been obtained for the reduced skin-friction, heat transfer and the velocity and temperature profiles. The results indicate that dual solutions exist for the shrinking surface for certain values of the parameter space. The stability analysis indicates that the lower solution branch is unstable, while the upper solution branch is stable and physically realizable. In addition, it is shown that for a viscous fluida very good agreement exists between the present numerical results and those reported in the open literature. The present results are original and new for the boundary-layer flow and heat transfer past a shrinking sheet in a Casson fluid. Therefore, this study has importance for researchers working in the area of non-Newtonian fluids, {{in order for them to}} become familiar with the flow behavior and properties of such fluids...|$|E

A wide range of Mach numbers is considered, from nearly incompressible to chocked flow conditions and a Reynolds number up to 170.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of modeling the Navier–Stokes equations and {{together with the}} conventional second <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> boundary condition at high Knudsen numbers is explored in this paper by incorporating the Knudsen diffusion phenomenon in rarefied gases.

This simple modification is shown to implicitly take care of the complexities associated in the transitional flow regime, without necessitating dependency of the slip coefficients on the Knudsen number. Unique analytical model with fixed values of slip coefficients is proposed and rigorous comparisons with the experimental and simulation data for pressure driven and thermally driven rarefied gas flows support this conjecture. First and second <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> coefficients have been proposed as 1. 1466 and 0. 9756 for rectangular channels and 1. 1466 and 0. 14 for the capillaries, from the continuum to the transition flow regime.

40|$|Abstract: Incorporating the {{velocity}} slip {{effect of the}} gas flow at the solid boundary, the performance and dynamic response of a micro gas-bearing-rotor system are investigated in this paper. For the characteristic length scale of the micro gas bearing, the gas flow in the bearing resides in the slip regime {{rather than in the}} continuum regime. The modified Reynolds equations of different slip models are presented. Gas pressure distribution and load carrying capacity are obtained by solving the Reynolds equations with finite different method (FDM). Comparing results from different models, it is found that the second <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> model agrees reasonably well with the benchmarked solutions obtained from the linearized Boltzmann equation. Therefore, dynamic coefficients derived from the second <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> model are employed to evaluate the linear dynamic stability and vibration characteristics of the system. Compared with the continuum flow model, the slip effect reduces dynamic coefficients of the micro gas bearing, and the threshold speed for stable operation is consequently raised. Also, dynamic analysis shows that the system responses change with variation of the operating parameters including the eccentricity ratio, the rotational speed, and the unbalance ratio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to broaden the fundamental understanding of the emerging field of microfluidics especially in a long channel. The quasi gasdynamic (QGD) equations, originally developed on the basis of a kinetical model are used for numerical and analytical simulation. A two-dimensional analysis of the QGD equations with a first <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> velocity boundary conditions demonstrates that both compressibility and rarefied effects are present in long microchannels. Analytical solutions for the pressure and the velocity profiles are derived from the quasi gasdynamic equations by undertaking perturbation expansions according to a small parameter ε (the height-to-length ratio of the channel) and using the isothermal flow assumption. The deduced expression for the mass flow rate is similar to the analytical expression obtained from the Navier-Stokes equations with a second <b>order</b> <b>slip</b> boundary condition and gives results in agreement with the measurements. The effects of the rarefaction and of the compressibility on pressure distributions are analyzed. The analytical expression of the pressure predicts accurately the measured pressure distribution. The Knudsen numbers calculated at the exit of the channel and based on the channel height vary from 10 − 3 to 0. 4. The comparisons of analytical and numerical solutions confirm the validity of the analytical approach...|$|E
