5|$|The {{imperial}} {{administration was}} coordinated by the chancery with headquarters at Persepolis, Susa, and Babylon with Bactria, Ecbatana, Sardis, Dascylium and Memphis having branches. Darius chose Aramaic {{as a common}} language, which soon spread throughout the empire. However, Darius gathered a group of scholars to create a separate language system <b>only</b> <b>used</b> for Persis and the Persians, which was called Aryan script which was <b>only</b> <b>used</b> for official inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now <b>only</b> <b>used</b> sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|A {{study in}} 2004 by Melanie Metzger and Susan Mather found that Black male signers used {{constructed}} action, {{with or without}} constructed dialogue, more often than White signers, but never used constructed dialogue by itself. These results were not reproduced in a later study into constructed action and constructed dialogue by McCaskill, which found that Black signers not <b>only</b> <b>used</b> constructed dialogue, but did so more frequently than white signers.|$|E
5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was <b>only</b> <b>used</b> for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E

In 2015, the decision voted by Greenland's governments to extend the runways of Nuuk and Ilulissat airports directly threatened the purpose of Air Greenland's single widebody aircraft. The A330 was <b>only</b> <b>used</b> from Pituffik and Kangerlussuaq to Copenhagen Kastrup, but in January 2017, Air Greenland had announced more commercial routes to {{be covered by the}} aircraft between Iceland and Greenland.

5|$|All {{three of}} the ships in Toulon were placed in reserve {{and two of them}} were {{captured}} virtually intact when the Germans attempted to seize the French fleet in November 1942. They were turned over to the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina), but they were <b>only</b> <b>used</b> for transport missions before the Italy surrendered in September 1943. The Italians scuttled one, but the other escaped to join the Free French and spent the remainder of the war as a convoy escort in the Mediterranean or protecting Allied forces in the Ligurian Sea.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} answering datalog queries using materialized views. The ability to answer queries using views is crucial {{in the context of}} information integration. Previous work on answering queries using views restricted queries to being conjunctive. We extend this work to general recursive queries: Given a datalog program P and a set of views, is it possible to find a datalog program that is equivalent to P and <b>only</b> <b>uses</b> views as EDB predicates? In this paper, we show that the problem of whether a datalog program can be rewritten into an equivalent program that <b>only</b> <b>uses</b> views is undecidable. On the other hand, we prove that a datalog program P can be effectively rewritten into a program that <b>only</b> <b>uses</b> views, that is contained in P, and that contains all programs that <b>only</b> <b>use</b> views and are contained in P. As a consequence, if there exists a program equivalent to P that <b>only</b> <b>uses</b> views, then our construction is guaranteed to yield a program equivalent to P. 1 Introductio [...] ...|$|R

He occupied Bosnia already in the year of his appointment and forced Tzar Michael Asen I of Bulgaria to cede Belgrade and Barancs (Braničevo, Serbia) in 1255. Béla adopted the title of King of Bulgaria, but he <b>only</b> <b>used</b> it occasionally in the subsequent years.|$|E

For example, a row of isosceles triangles, forming the pasung motif, as well as diagonal floral motifs called dhlorong, are commonly used for the head.

5|$|During {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries.
