500|$|Appel {{wrote of}} Stengel, [...] "He {{was not a}} man for all seasons; he was a man for {{baseball}} seasons." [...] Stengel remains the only manager to lead his club to victory in five consecutive World Series. How much credit he is due for that accomplishment is controversial, due to the talent on the Yankee teams he managed—Total Baseball deemed that the Yankees won only six games more than expected during the Stengel years, given the number of runs scored and allowed. According to Bak, [...] "the argument—even among some Yankees—was that the team was so good anybody could manage it to a title". Rizzuto stated, [...] "You <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have managed and gone away for the summer and still won those pennants." [...] Appel noted, [...] "There was no doubt, by taking on the Mets job, he hurt his reputation as a manager. Once again, it was clear that with good players he was a good manager, and with bad players, not. Still, his Yankee years had put him so {{high on the list of}} games won, championships won, etc., that he will always be included in conversations about the greatest managers." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that actor Matt Damon would guest star on 30 Rock. He made his debut in the fourth season finale episode [...] "I Do Do" [...] as Carol, an airline pilot and love interest for Fey's character, Liz Lemon, and reprised the role in [...] "The Fabian Strategy". In December 2009, prior to the confirmation of his first guest appearance, Entertainment Weekly informed Damon that he {{was at the top of}} Fey's guest star wish list for the show. A fan of the series, Damon replied [...] "I would do [...] in a heartbeat if they asked me to come on. She should call my people—or even better me. <b>Or</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> call her. Let's make this happen." [...] A day after the airing of [...] "I Do Do" [...] he was asked if he would reprise his role as Carol in the upcoming season and responded [...] "If they'll have me, I would love to pop in and see the gang again. I had a great time doing it." [...] In August 2010, Fey confirmed Damon's return saying that he would play her boyfriend once the new season began.|$|E

When asked if he would return as Carol in the show's fifth season, Damon said [...] "If they'll have me, I would love to pop in and see the gang again. I had a great time doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what you get on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, all of that stuff - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. <b>Or</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E
2500|$|When Gladwell {{started at}} The New Yorker in 1996 {{he wanted to}} [...] "mine current {{academic}} research for insights, theories, direction, or inspiration". His first assignment was to write a piece about fashion. Instead of writing about high-class fashion, Gladwell opted to write a piece {{about a man who}} manufactured T-shirts, saying: [...] "it was much more interesting to write a piece about someone who made a T-shirt for $8 than it was to write about a dress that costs $100,000. I mean, you <b>or</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make a dress for $100,000, but to make a T-shirt for $8 – that's much tougher." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a scathing}} review, Billy Hamilton of Under the Radar critiques the poptimism {{narrative}} surrounding Jepsen and her perceived effort to appease [...] "indie tastemakers", regarding her as [...] "the pet project of a creative hipsterati that's determined to prove pop is cooler than you, <b>or</b> <b>I,</b> <b>could</b> possibly ever imagine," [...] further expressing that [...] "Carly Rae Jepsen and her production team try overly {{hard to be}} clever." [...] In a similar conclusion, Evan Sawdey of PopMatters writes that [...] "Emotion {{is still a very}} pleasing album if not just a shade overambitious, clearly trying too hard to make the same genius pop moments that Kiss churned them out with effortless flair." ...|$|E
