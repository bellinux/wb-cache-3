5|$|Currently Silverthrone is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active the volcano's magma system is.

5|$|Formidables arrival allowed Rawlings {{to order}} Illustrious to the advance base in San Pedro Bay, in the Philippines, {{for a more}} {{thorough}} inspection. She arrived on 16 April and the examination by divers revealed that some of her outer plating was split and that some transverse frames were cracked.

Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April for a more thorough replenishment period and Illustrious transferred aircraft, spares, stores, and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May. She arrived on 14 May and departed 10 days later, bound for Rosyth for permanent repairs. 854 Squadron was disembarked while at Sydney, but the carrier kept her two Corsair squadrons until after arriving in the UK on 27 June.|$|E

Vitamin A and E supplements not <b>only</b> <b>provide</b> no health benefits for generally healthy individuals, but they may increase mortality, though the two large studies that support this conclusion included smokers for whom it was already known that beta-carotene supplements can be harmful. While other findings suggest that vitamin E toxicity is limited to only a specific form when taken in excess.|$|E
5|$|Like other volcanoes in the NCVP, Level Mountain is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the GSC to ascertain how active its magma system is. The Canadian National Seismograph Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the mountain.

If Level Mountain were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would respond to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption that would affect Canada.|$|E

5|$|With dive tables, it is {{generally}} assumed that the dive profile is a square dive, meaning that the diver descends to maximum depth immediately and stays at the same depth until resurfacing (approximating a rectangular outline when drawn in a coordinate system where one axis is depth {{and the other is}} duration). Some dive tables also assume physical condition or acceptance of a specific level of risk from the diver.

5|$|Immediately after Omar's {{landfall}} in Guam, former Governor Joseph Franklin Ada {{declared a}} state of emergency, and former U.S. President George H. W. Bush declared the island a federal disaster area. In the wake of the storm, several people were arrested for looting. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened up disaster assistance centers where residents were able to apply for federal aid; it ultimately provided about $18.4million in assistance, including disaster housing, storm-related unemployment benefits, and grant programs for families or businesses, helping over 11,000people. The federal government paid for 100% of the debris removal, emergency work, and reconstruction of uninsured public buildings, although it usually <b>only</b> <b>provide</b> 75% of the cost for typical disasters. This was due to the sequence of three significant tropical cyclones affecting the United States in three weeks; in addition to Omar, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida in August and Hurricane Iniki hit Hawaii in September. The Department of Defense assisted the affected areas with 27members of the Guam National Guard and 700members of the military. The military provided temporary housing, generators, and construction supplies, at a cost of $5.75million, though most of the disaster needs were handled by the government. The local Red Cross provided $6million in assistance after the storm. Due to the combined damages from Andrew, Iniki, and Omar, the United States Congress passed the Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1992, which provided additional funding for the agencies responding to the disasters through the fiscal year ending on September30.|$|E
