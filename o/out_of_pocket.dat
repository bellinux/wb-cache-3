5|$|All health {{policies}} {{sold in the}} United States {{must provide}} an annual maximum <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> (MOOP) payment cap for an individual's or family's medical expenses (excluding premiums).

5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} {{had been reached}} {{and that they would}} once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E

5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Booth was {{selected}} for the New South Wales hockey team in 1955 and toured New Zealand in 1956. Good performances on this tour led to his selection in the Australian Olympic squad for the 1956 Summer Olympics, but he had an anxious wait following media claims that he had received <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> expenses for playing cricket, which would make him a professional and therefore ineligible {{to participate in the}} Olympics. Eventually, Booth and fellow first-class cricketers Ian Dick and Maurice Foley were cleared to play for Australia. Booth then missed the 195657 Sheffield Shield season because {{he was part of the}} Australian field hockey team that finished fifth at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Booth {{was selected}} as an inside left, but was not utilised in any of Australia's matches. In his absence, New South Wales won a fourth consecutive domestic title.|$|E
5|$|Some {{customers}} {{also reported}} problems with direct debits and standing orders being returned unpaid {{due to their}} account balances not updating correctly, however RBS said in an announcement that they would work directly with the receiving banks and companies {{to ensure that all}} payments were processed. As a result of the system outage, RBS also announced that they would work with credit rating agencies directly to ensure no customer's credit file was permanently impacted. They also announced that no customer will be permanently <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pocket</b> because of the system outage, and launched a dedicated new freephone helpline for the incident, as well as an online help point to guide and advise customers with any queries they had during the outage.|$|E

25|$|Some {{beneficiaries}} are dual-eligible. This {{means they}} qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid.

25|$|Due to the {{comprehensive}} public sector, private healthcare sector is relatively small. Between 3-4% of in-patient care {{is provided by}} the private healthcare system. Physiotherapy, dentistry and occupational health services are the most often used health services on the private sector. Approximately 10% of medical doctors work solely on private sector. Although high user fees may cause a barrier to use the private sector services as most is paid for <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>pocket,</b> a significant share of the cost is reimbursed by the Social Insurance Institution (SII) KELA.|$|E
