5|$|A {{considerable}} amount of {{research has been done}} at Mount Baker over the past decade, and it is now among the most-studied of the Cascade volcanoes. Recent and <b>ongoing</b> <b>projects</b> include gravimetric and GPS-based geodetic monitoring, fumarole gas sampling, tephra distribution mapping, new interpretations of the Schriebers Meadow lava flow, and hazards analyses. Mapping of Carmelo and Sherman craters, and interpretations of the eruptive history, continues, as well. The Mount Baker Volcano Research Center maintains an online archive of abstracts of this work, and an extensive references list, as well as photos.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, it was {{reported}} that Vijay and AR Murugadoss would collaborate to make an action film, after completing their then-respective <b>ongoing</b> <b>projects,</b> Velayudham and 7aum Arivu. Vijay's father S. A. Chandrasekhar was initially going to produce the film, but S. Thanu eventually took over, producing it under his banner V Creations. Although the film was initially titled Maalai Nerathu Mazhaithuli, in December 2011, the new title was revealed: Thuppakki. Instead of his regular editor Anthony and art director Rajeevan, Murugadoss chose A. Sreekar Prasad and Thotta Tharani for those positions, respectively. Santosh Sivan was hired as cinematographer.|$|E
5|$|Level-5 {{collaborated with}} Studio Ghibli {{to produce the}} game's {{animated}} sequences, and the game features graphics and visuals replicating the traditional animation style of Studio Ghibli films. The collaboration began when musician Naoya Fujimaki, who had previously worked with both companies, introduced Level-5 president Akihiro Hino to Studio Ghibli president Toshio Suzuki. At the time, Studio Ghibli had completed work on Ponyo (2008), and the animation team had no <b>ongoing</b> <b>projects,</b> which influenced Suzuki's decision to collaborate with Level-5. Another influencing factor of the collaboration was witnessing Hino's passion for the project. Studio Ghibli approached the production process {{in the same way}} that they would create an animated film. Work on the animation began in July 2008, and took much longer than the predicted three months.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} of finite simple groups is regarded {{by some to}} be the longest proof of a theorem. It comprises tens of thousands of pages in 500 journal articles by some 100 authors.

Another theorem of this type is the four color theorem whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. It is certainly the longest known proof of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.|$|E
