5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{has also}} revealed two distinct lineages within this species, one occupying the western Atlantic {{and the other}} occupying the eastern Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans. This suggests that Indo-Pacific blacktip sharks are descended {{from those in the}} eastern Atlantic, while the western Atlantic sharks became isolated by the widening Atlantic Ocean on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> formation of the Isthmus of Panama on the other. Blacktip sharks from these two regions differ in morphology, coloration, and life history characteristics, and the eastern Atlantic lineage may merit species status. Fossil teeth belonging to this species have been found in Early Miocene (2316 Ma) deposits in Delaware and Florida.|$|E
5|$|In 1586, {{following}} the death of previous Polish king, Stefan Bathory, the Swedish duke Sigismund III Vasa and Habsburg Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria took part in the election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne. Each of the two candidates had supporters in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with the two opposing sides gathered around pro-Sigismund Chancellor and Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski and the Primate of Poland, Stanisław Karnkowski on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pro-Maximilain Zborowski family on the other. The rivalry between Zamoyski and the Zborowski family dated years past and tensions during the elections ran high.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1990s the authorities in Eilat have considered relocating the airport, approximately 20km north of Eilat, to the Ora Well area near Be'er Ora. There were numerous reasons behind this idea. Primarily, the fact that safety would be improved as in its current location, there is the chance of aircraft crashing into buildings in the city. Other reasons were the pure value of the land which the airport occupies, {{and the fact that the}} airport is dividing the city of Eilat into two parts with the hotels and tourist areas on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> residential buildings on the other.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kupres (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: Bitka za Kupres) was {{a battle}} of the Bosnian War, fought between the Bosnian Croat Territorial Defence Force (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) {{supported}} by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) troops on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA), augmented by the Bosnian Serb TO on the other at the Kupres Plateau, on 3–11 April 1992. During the fighting on 8 April, the Bosnian Croat TO was reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO). The objective of the battle was to control the strategic Kupres Plateau, a major supply route.|$|E

5|$|According to U.S. officials, bin Laden {{was buried}} at sea because no country would accept his remains. Before {{disposing}} of the body, the U.S. called the Saudi government, who approved of burying {{the body in}} the ocean. Muslim religious rites were performed aboard Carl Vinson in the North Arabian Sea within 24 hours of bin Laden's death. Preparations began at 10:10am local time and at-sea burial was completed at 11am. The body was washed, wrapped in a white sheet and placed in a weighted plastic bag. An officer read prepared religious remarks which were translated into Arabic by a native speaker. Afterward, bin Laden's body was placed onto a flat board. The board was tilted upward on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body slid off into the sea.|$|E
5|$|After World War II the United States and the Soviet Union jockeyed {{for power}} during {{what became known}} as the Cold War, driven by an ideological divide between {{capitalism}} and communism and, according to the school of geopolitics, a divide between the maritime Atlantic and the continental Eurasian camps. They dominated the military affairs of Europe, with the U.S. and its NATO allies on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> USSR and its Warsaw Pact allies on the other. The U.S. developed a policy of containment towards the expansion of communist influence. While the U.S. and Soviet Union engaged in proxy wars and developed powerful nuclear arsenals, the two countries avoided direct military conflict.|$|E
5|$|After {{rounding}} Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly {{along the}} eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the Arch Rock viewing area just beyond the mile1 marker. The next two miles (3.2km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur's Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile3 is the Lake Shore Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile3, Scott's Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, the Croat-Bosniak {{conflict}} {{erupted in}} Bosnia and Herzegovina, just as each was {{fighting with the}} Bosnian Serbs. The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH) on the other, but by 1994, the Croatian Army had an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 troops involved in the fighting. Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing {{for the creation of}} Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} edition Darwin {{inserted}} {{a new chapter}} VII (renumbering the subsequent chapters) to respond to criticisms of earlier editions, including the objection that many features of organisms were not adaptive and {{could not have been}} produced by natural selection. He said some such features could have been by-products of adaptive changes to other features, and that often features seemed non-adaptive because their function was unknown, as shown by his book on Fertilisation of Orchids that explained how their elaborate structures facilitated pollination by insects. Much of the chapter responds to George Jackson Mivart's criticisms, including his claim that features such as baleen filters in whales, flatfish with both eyes on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> camouflage of stick insects could not have evolved through natural selection because intermediate stages would not have been adaptive. Darwin proposed scenarios for the incremental evolution of each feature.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli {{construction}} of the West Bank barrier has affected Bethlehem politically, socially, and economically. The barrier is located along the northern side of the town's built-up area, within m of houses in 'Aida refugee camp on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Jerusalem municipality on the other. Most entrances and exits from the Bethlehem agglomeration {{to the rest of}} the West Bank are currently subjected to Israeli checkpoints and roadblocks. The level of access varies based on Israeli security directives. Travel for Bethlehem's Palestinian residents from the West Bank into Jerusalem is regulated by a permit-system. Palestinians require a permit to enter the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb. Israeli citizens are barred from entering Bethlehem and the nearby biblical Solomon's Pools.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} and internal layout of these missions followed a scheme which was repeated later with some {{variations in the}} rest of the missionary reductions. In Chiquitos, the oldest mission, San Xavier, formed the basis for the organizational style, which consisted of a modular structure, the center formed by a wide rectangular square, with the church complex on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> houses of the inhabitants on the three remaining sides. The centralized organization of the Jesuits dictated a certain uniformity of measures and sizes. Despite being based on the same basic model, the towns of Chiquitos nonetheless show remarkable variations. For example, the orientation of the settlements toward the cardinal points differed and was determined by individual circumstances.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy Tactics differs {{in several}} key areas from other {{titles in the}} Final Fantasy series. Instead of a generic battle screen, with the player's characters on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> enemies on the other, encounters take place on three-dimensional, isometric fields. Characters move on a battlefield composed of square tiles; movement and action ranges {{are determined by the}} character's statistics and job class. Battles are turn-based; a unit may act when its CT (Charge Time) reaches 100. Charge time is increased once every CT unit (a measure of time in battles) by an amount equal to the unit's speed statistic. When CT reaches 100 or greater, the unit may act. During battle, whenever a unit performs an action successfully, it gains Experience Points (EXP) and Job Points (JP).|$|E
5|$|Various {{technological}} and aesthetic {{changes have been}} made to the Jeopardy! set over the years. The original game board was exposed from behind a curtain and featured clues printed on cardboard pull cards which were revealed as contestants selected them. The All-New Jeopardy!s game board was exposed from behind double-slide panels and featured flipping panels with the dollar amount on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> clue on the other. When the Trebek version premiered in 1984, the game board used individual television monitors for each clue within categories. The original monitors were replaced with larger and sleeker ones in 1991. In 2006, these monitors were discarded in favor of a nearly seamless projection video wall, which was replaced in 2009 with 36 high-definition flat-panel monitors manufactured by Sony Electronics.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E
