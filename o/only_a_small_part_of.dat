5|$|Econometric {{analysis}} of DSGE models suggested that real factors sometimes affect the economy. A paper by Frank Smets and Rafael Woulters (2007) stated that monetary policy explained <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the fluctuations in economic output. In new synthesis models, shocks can affect both demand and supply. The new synthesis implies that monetary policy {{can have a}} stabilizing effect on the economy, contrary to new classical theory.|$|E

5|$|A {{few months}} later, {{at a party}} meeting, {{it was decided that}} {{administrative}} actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over Literární noviny and several other publishing houses was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even members of the party who later became major reformers — including Dubček — endorsed these moves.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed before they reached the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected.

5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set up its own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately {{from the rest of}} the troop.|$|E

5|$|The RMNDH was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the armed}} forces of the NDH, largely due to {{restrictions}} imposed by Italy. To avoid these restrictions, the Germans raised the Croatian Naval Legion which fought as part of the German Navy in the Black Sea campaign between 1941 and 1944. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans transferred several captured Italian vessels to the RMNDH, although all of the significant ones had been lost by December 1944 when the remaining personnel were assigned to duties ashore to circumvent their defection to the Yugoslav Partisans. The RMNDH was disbanded in May 1945 with the collapse and defeat of the NDH.|$|E
5|$|The chapel's Collegiate Gothic design evokes an English {{church of}} the Middle Ages, {{although}} several aspects of it, including the vault and its supports, recall French churches.

The only precedent for a university chapel of this size was King's College Chapel, and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> that chapel was used regularly. Stillwell cites Exeter Cathedral and the Octagon tower of Ely Cathedral as precedents for the architectural detail, but notes that the Princeton chapel's detail nonetheless differs significantly from these.|$|E

5|$|Bruce's {{early work}} {{involved}} advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. Panmure House and Leslie House (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been projects of the king's master mason John Mylne. At Panmure, although Bruce has {{been credited with}} the design in the past, the works were overseen by Alexander Nisbet, although Bruce did design the gates and gate piers. At Leslie, Bruce oversaw the works after Mylne's death, and probably made his own amendments. Panmure was demolished in the 1950s, and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Leslie House remains standing, following {{a fire in the}} 18th century. Bruce later advised the Duke of Queensberry regarding his plans for Drumlanrig Castle.|$|E
5|$|Ferrier's discography {{consists}} of studio recordings originally {{made on the}} Columbia and Decca labels, and recordings taken from live performances which were later issued as discs. In the years since her death, many of her recordings have received multiple reissues on modern media; between 1992 and 1996 Decca issued the Kathleen Ferrier Edition, incorporating much of Ferrier's recorded repertoire, on 10 compact discs. The discographer Paul Campion has drawn attention to numerous works which she performed but did not record, or for which no complete recording has yet surfaced. For example, only one aria from Elgar's Dream of Gerontius, and none of her renderings of 20th century songs by Holst, Bax, Delius and others were recorded. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> her St John Passion was captured on disc.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's total {{foreign debt}} in 2012 was $22 billion, {{representing}} 72% of its GDP. In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion representing 90.6% of its GDP. This substantial increase {{is attributed to}} effects of regional instability causing: decrease in tourist activity; decreased foreign investments; increased military expenditure; attacks on Egyptian pipeline; the collapse of trade with Iraq and Syria; expenses from hosting Syrian refugees and accumulated interests from loans. According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees have cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year, amounting to 6% of the GDP and 25% of the government's annual revenue. Foreign aid covers <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> these costs, 63% of the total costs are covered by Jordan.

5|$|Lowe speculated in his 1927 paper that, in {{the absence}} of {{mammalian}} predators on the island, the brown skua would be the Inaccessible Island rail's only predator. A study of the diet of brown skuas on Inaccessible Island confirmed this, but found that although skuas do eat adults of this species, the rail and other landbirds formed <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the diet of that seabird, especially compared to their abundance on the island. They noted that the landbirds alarm-called when brown skuas were seen. After hearing another rail make an alarm call, adult Inaccessible Island rails become alert, while chicks fall silent. Adults are rarely preyed upon, but the mortality of chicks is high and predation by Tristan thrushes is a major cause.|$|E
5|$|The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) {{developed}} the current classification system and wrote guidelines {{that put a}} greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity.

However, at present <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the total diversity of viruses has been studied, with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus sequences recovered have not been seen before, and samples from the environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction.
