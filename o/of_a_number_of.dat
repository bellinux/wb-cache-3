40|$|AbstractWe study modular {{properties}} in strongly convergent infinitary term rewriting. In particular, we show that:•Confluence is not preserved across direct sum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> systems, even when these are non-collapsing. •Confluence modulo equality of hypercollapsing subterms is not preserved across direct sum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> systems. •Normalization is not preserved across direct sum <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> left-linear systems. •Unique normalization {{with respect to}} reduction is not preserved across direct sum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> left-linear systems. Together, these facts constitute {{a radical departure from}} the situation in finitary term rewriting. Positive results are:•Confluence is preserved under the direct sum <b>of</b> <b>an</b> infinite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> left-linear systems iff at most one system contains a collapsing rule. •Confluence is preserved under the direct sum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> non-collapsing systems if only terms of finite rank are considered. •Top-termination is preserved under the direct sum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> left-linear systems. •Normalization is preserved under the direct sum <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finite <b>number</b> <b>of</b> left-linear systems.
