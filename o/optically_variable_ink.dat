5|$|The $50000 {{denomination}} was {{the first}} denomination to use the <b>Optically</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Ink</b> technique, on the value positioned at the top right of the obverse. The $750000 denomination of the December 2007 series was the only note out of all cheques of the second dollar to bear a holographic strip, as the cheque was printed on paper that was prepared for the 1000ZWD notes (Pick No. 12).|$|E
5|$|The 2007 {{banknote}} series was {{prepared by the}} Reserve Bank in October 2006 for the abandoned second phase of Operation Sunrise. The Chiremba Balancing Rocks was to be reinstated as the main feature on the obverse whilst use of the Zimbabwe Bird watermark continued. There were additional security features as opposed to previous issues, which included security threads, see-through register marks and recognition marks for the partially sighted. Holographic security threads and <b>Optically</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Ink</b> were used on the $100, $500 and $1000 notes. When the redenomination of 1 August 2008 occurred these notes were put into circulation as banknotes of the third dollar between 1 August 2008 to 31 December 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Zimbabwe dollar {{was again}} {{reformed}} on 2 February 2009 when the fourth dollar replaced the third dollar {{at the ratio}} of 1000000000000 (1012) to 1 with the original intention of phasing out the latter by 1 July 2009. The 2009 banknote series was issued for the fourth dollar which circulated from 2 February 2009 until the suspension of the dollar on 12 April 2009. The series consisted of denominations ranging from $1 to $500. The notes had a revised design with chevrons as registration devices, the Zimbabwe Bird in <b>Optically</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Ink</b> and an iridescent strip. Most parts of the design were recycled from designs of past issues {{and do not have}} a watermark although a plain space existed in the areas where it would normally be positioned.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{security}} features were applied {{in order to}} avoid counterfeit banknotes. Anti-counterfeiting measures used included holograms, multi-colored bills, embedded devices such as strips, microprinting, watermarks and different types of <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> <b>inks,</b> and the use of design features which prevent counterfeiting by photocopying or scanning.|$|R

[...] The card's header {{is made up}} of alternating rows of [...] "RÉPUBLICA DOMINICANA" [...] and the card's type (either [...] "CÉDULA DE IDENTIDAD Y ELECTORAL" [...] or [...] "CÉDULA DE IDENTIDAD") printed in microtext. The bottom right corner features an image of the island in <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> color-changing <b>inks</b> and a semi-transparent version of the cardholder's photo. The card's centre {{features the}} Dominican Republic's emblem inside a gulloché printed with invisible ink.

5|$|The {{large number}} of {{denominations}} issued in late-2008 {{as well as the}} suspension of paper supply by Giesecke & Devrient affected the Reserve Bank's ability to maintain the quality of the banknotes. Later denominations copied design features from the original 2007 banknote series and lacked many modern security features that banknotes of major currencies (such as the Canadian Dollar) relied on. The notes denominated from $20000 to $500000 and then from $10 million onwards used non-watermarked paper, whilst the $500 million notes were printed on pure cotton. A silhouette of the Zimbabwe Bird in <b>Optically</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Ink</b> was used in such notes to compensate for this, but the iridescent strip was dropped for higher denominations. The $10000 and $1000000 notes reused paper for the $1000 notes (Pick no. 72), thereby carrying the embedded holographic thread and watermark. Two types of paper (regular and lined) were used on $20000, $50000 and $500000 banknotes.|$|E

Canadian diplomatic missions abroad adopted this version in 2006. In March 2010, the passport was upgraded to include a new design of the identification page and more anti-counterfeit elements, such as the new colours of <b>Optically</b> <b>Variable</b> <b>Ink</b> and addition of laser perforated number.

High quality replicas of each type of device have been fabricated using this process. Embossed replicas of grating-based OVDs have shown optical effects including image switching and color movement. For devices based on micro-mirror arrays, the embossed replicas have shown an <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> switch between a portrait and a non-portrait image.

40|$|Deep X-ray surveys using Chandra {{have found}} the highest density of AGN on the sky (˜ 5000 deg- 2) and {{are thought to be}} the most {{efficient}} means of finding AGN. However, a recent two-epoch variability analysis of the HDF-N found comparable sky densities of sources with variable nuclei, which strongly suggest the presence of an AGN. There is only a small amount of overlap between the <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> (OV) and X-ray selected AGN, which indicates that the majority of these <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> selected AGN are underluminous in the X-ray band. In this poster we investigate the nature of the X-ray faint, <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> GOODS source population. We employ X-ray stacking techniques to measure the average X-ray photometric and spectroscopic properties of these sources. A comparison between the (stacked) X-ray undetected and X-ray detected OV sources shows the hardness ratios of the two populations differ with redshift. The X-ray undetected OV population appears to get harder with redshift, while the hardness ratios of the X-ray detected OV sources remain relatively unchanged. This is consistent with the X-ray undetected OV population being comprised of moderately Compton thick sources (NHI ˜ 2 × 1024 cm- 2) where, at higher redshifts, the > 10 keV photons that can penetrate this column {{can be seen in the}} hard (2 - 8 keV) X-ray band. In addition, we combine the optical spectra, when available, to look for the presence of high ionization lines that are indicative of AGN. We fail to find high-ionization lines in the stacked optical spectra of the X-ray undetected, <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> sources, but we do find weak NeIII, NeV, and MgII lines in the stacked X-ray detected, OV population...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{properties}} of active galactic nuclei (AGN) selected by optical variability in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Field (SXDF). Based on the locations of variable components and light curves, 211 <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> AGN were reliably selected. We made three AGN samples; X-ray detected optically non-variable AGN (XA), X-ray detected <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> AGN (XVA), and X-ray undetected <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> AGN (VA). In the VA sample, we found a bimodal distribution of the ratio between the variable component flux and the host flux. One of these two components in the distribution, a class of AGN with a faint variable component i'_vari∼ 25 mag in bright host galaxies i'∼ 21 mag, is not seen in the XVA sample. These AGN {{are expected to have}} low Eddington ratios if we naively consider a correlation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass. These galaxies have photometric redshifts z_photo∼ 0. 5 and we infer that they are low-luminosity AGN with radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). The properties of the XVA and VA objects and the differences from those of the XA objects can be explained within the unified scheme for AGN. Optical variability selection for AGN is an independent method and could provide a complementary AGN sample which even deep X-ray surveys have not found.

40|$|At {{the past}} optical {{security}} conferences attention {{was focused on}} diffractive structures, e. g. holograms, embossed gratings and thin—film devices, as security elements on valuable documents. The main reasons for this emphasis are, that the iridescent effect of such diffractive <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> devices (OVD’s) can be easily observed by the naked eye and that their fraud-resistance is considered excellent. No {{attention has been paid}} to non—diffractive <b>optically</b> <b>variable</b> phenomena like reversible photosensitivity, e. g. luminescence and photochroism. These may be employed in non-diffractive OVD’s which may be readily authenticated and may provide excellent fraud-resistance as well. In order to survey the enormous variety of document security features the library SECURIDAT was compiled from a number of public domain databases.
