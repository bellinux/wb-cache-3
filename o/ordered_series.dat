25|$|An <b>ordered</b> <b>series</b> of chords {{is called}} a chord {{progression}}. One example of a widely used chord progression in Western traditional music and blues is the 12 bar blues progression. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords are more common in Western music, and some patterns have been accepted as establishing the key (tonic note) in common-practice harmony–notably the movement between tonic and dominant chords. To describe this, Western music theory has developed the practice of numbering chords using Roman numerals which represent the number of diatonic steps up from the tonic note of the scale.|$|E
5000|$|The {{distinction}} {{often made}} between Hauer and the Schoenberg school—that the former's music {{is based on}} unordered hexachords while the latter's {{is based on an}} ordered series—is false: while he did write pieces that could be thought of as [...] "trope pieces", much of Hauer's twelve-tone music employs an <b>ordered</b> <b>series.</b>|$|E

Hermann showed that the entire surface of an uninjured muscle was electrically equipotential. His discoveries in this field were instrumental to the modern use of the electrocardiograph as a diagnostic tool.

5000|$|Scotus {{acknowledges}} two objections {{and deals}} with them accordingly. First {{is that he}} begs the question in assuming a first in the series. Here he argues that while many admit an infinite regress in an accidentally <b>ordered</b> <b>series</b> of causes, no philosopher admits infinite regress in an essentially <b>ordered</b> <b>series.</b> Scotus explains {{the differences between the}} two and offers proofs for the conclusion that an infinity of essentially order causes in a series is impossible. Second, it is objected that his proof is not really a demonstration since it begins with a contingent premise. That something is produced is contingent and not necessary. Therefore, the proof proceeds from a contingent and not a necessary premise. Scotus says that while that is true, it is utterly manifest that things are produced or effected. But in order to respond, Scotus makes a modal move and reworks the argument. Now he argues from the possibility of production. [...] "It is possible that something can be produced" [...] is a necessary proposition. From there he is able to conclude that it is possible that the first efficient cause exists, and if it is possible that it exists, then it does exist. He assures us that the last claim will be proved later in the argument. In the Lectura proof, Scotus argues the following way: ...|$|E

This result is true for both aggregate and industry-level measures of new orders, using several econometric techniques. New orders {{may have been a}} more useful measure of future shipments in the 1960 s than today. This failure may be caused by changes in manufacturing methods. In addition, the structure of the economy may have made new orders less relevant. Also, the new <b>orders</b> <b>series</b> may suffer from measurement problems. Moreover, parameter uncertainty and instability may overwhelm any available information in the new <b>orders</b> <b>series.</b> Analysts should consider reducing the emphasis placed on NDOG as a measure of future economic activity. ...|$|R

50|$|In {{computational}} geometry and robot motion planning, a visibility graph is a graph of intervisible locations, typically {{for a set}} of points and obstacles in the Euclidean plane. Each node in the graph represents a point location, and each edge represents a visible connection between them. That is, if the line segment connecting two locations does not pass through any obstacle, an edge is drawn between them in the graph. When the set of locations lies in a line, this can be understood as an <b>ordered</b> <b>series.</b> Visibility graphs have therefore been extended to the realm of time series analysis.|$|E

5000|$|An {{alternative}} estimate to NISP, often done in concert, is {{minimum number}} of individuals (MNI). Both are influenced by fragmentation and limited preservation, but in different ways. [...] NISP tends to overestimate {{the number of individuals}} under moderate fragmentation, but the overestimate lessens as fragmentation increases due to the inability to classify the bones. MNI tends to underestimate the actual number under medium fragmentation, and even more severely when bones are highly fragmented. Under hypothetically perfect preservation and no fragmentation, these estimates should be the same. MNI also suffers from the aggregation problem, in which different aggregations will generate at least two values, a MNI minimum and maximum, which are generally empirically indistinguishable. Both NISP and MNI are likely only ordinals scale measurements, which means at best they can only give an <b>ordered</b> <b>series</b> of taxonomic abundance, i.e. [...] "Taxon A is more numerous than Taxon B." ...|$|E

Hitler was briefed thoroughly on the comparison between the MAN and DB designs in the report by Guderian's tank commission. Armour protection appeared to be inadequate, while [...] "the motor mounted on the rear appeared to him correct". He agreed that the [...] "decisive factor was the possibility of quickly getting the tank into production". On 15 May 1942, Oberst Fichtner informed MAN that Hitler had decided in favour of the MAN Panther and <b>ordered</b> <b>series</b> production. The upper glacis plate was to be increased from 60 mm to 80 mm. Hitler demanded that an increase to 100 mm should be attempted and that at least all vertical surfaces were to be 100 mm; the turret front plate was increased from 80 mm to 100 mm.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "scale" [...] is an <b>ordered</b> <b>series</b> of pitches that, {{with the}} key or tonic (first tone) as a {{reference}} point, defines that scale's intervals, or steps. The concept of [...] "mode" [...] in Western music theory has three successive stages: in Gregorian chant theory, in Renaissance polyphonic theory, and in tonal harmonic music of the common practice period. In all three contexts, [...] "mode" [...] incorporates {{the idea of the}} diatonic scale, but differs from it by also involving an element of melody type. This concerns particular repertories of short musical figures or groups of tones within a certain scale so that, depending on the point of view, mode takes on the meaning of either a [...] "particularized scale" [...] or a [...] "generalized tune". Modern musicological practice has extended the concept of mode to earlier musical systems, such as those of Ancient Greek music, Jewish cantillation, and the Byzantine system of octoechos, as well as to other non-Western musics ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E

5000|$|The {{second of}} the études, [...] "Mode de valeurs et d'intensités", overshadows all the others for having become the model for composers {{interested}} in the serialisation of musical parameters other than pitch. Initially, this influence occurred through works composed in 1950 and 1951 by two of Messiaen's pupils, Karel Goeyvaerts and Michel Fano. Messiaen's composition {{and one of the}} works inspired by it, Goeyvaerts's Sonata for Two Pianos, impressed Karlheinz Stockhausen at the Darmstädter Ferienkurse in 1951, prompting him to compose Kreuzspiel—his first acknowledged work [...] Pierre Boulez, after a period of estrangement from Messiaen caused by what Boulez viewed as the excessively sensual Turangalîla-Symphonie, belatedly discovered the [...] "Mode de valeurs" [...] in 1951 and composed his Structures, Book I as a gesture of conciliation to his former teacher, transforming the twelve [...] "triplum" [...] elements of the Mode's first division into <b>ordered</b> <b>series</b> and composed Structures 1a in a single night [...]|$|E
50|$|The {{hierarchical}} list {{is constructed}} between client and therapist in rank <b>ordered</b> <b>series</b> of {{steps from the}} least disturbing to the most disturbing fears or phobias. Secondly the client is taught techniques that produce deep relaxation. It is impossible to feel both anxiety and relaxation at the same time, so easing the client into deep relaxation helps inhibit any feelings of anxiety. Systematic desensitization (a guided reduction in fear, anxiety or aversion) can then be achieved by gradually approaching the feared stimulus while maintaining relaxation. Desensitization works best when individuals are directly exposed to the stimuli and situations they fear so anxiety-evoking stimuli are paired with inhibitory responses. This is carried out either by clients performing in real life situations (known as vivo desensitization), or, {{if it is not}} practical to directly act out the steps of hierarchy, by clients observing models performing the feared behaviour (known as vicarious desensitization). Clients slowly move up the hierarchy, repeating performances if necessary, until the last item on the list is performed without fear or anxiety.|$|E
5000|$|Raggs was {{originally}} created in 1990 by U.S. advertising executive Toni Steedman for her then six-year-old daughter, Alison, {{as a series}} of carpool stories. Steedman later used the Raggs character for a regional mall promotion and advertising campaign. By 2001, the successful mall programs encouraged Steedman, along with former HBO producer Carole Rosen, to create a one-hour music video-inspired pilot called [...] "Pawsuuup," [...] which was shot in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and New York City in August 2001. While Steedman shopped the pilot for a production or broadcast partner, The Raggs Band (also known as the Raggs Kids Club Band because of the regional mall kids clubs for which Raggs served as mascot) began playing concerts at fairs, festivals and performing arts venues. In 2005, Steedman and her company, Raggs LLC, entered into a co-production relationship with Southern Star International (now Endemol Australia) to produce the Raggs series for the Seven Network in Sydney, Australia. Production began in 2005 at the ABC Studios in Sydney, and the first episode of Series 1 began airing daily at 9 am on Seven in January 2006. Series 1 consisted of 65 half hours episodes. Raggs quickly garnered strong ratings and, within a few months of airing, Seven <b>ordered</b> <b>Series</b> 2, an additional 65 episodes. In 2007, Seven <b>ordered</b> <b>Series</b> 3, also 65 episodes, bringing the total to 195 original half hours by 2009. Each episode featured original Raggs’ music, written and produced in the U.S. by Concentrix Music and Sound Design, requiring over 200 original songs for the 195 half hours of shows. Southern Star distributed Raggs to several countries including Singapore, Bulgaria, South Africa and India. In the U.S., Steedman worked to establish Raggs on public television. KQED San Francisco signed on as the presenting station in association with American Public Television, and Raggs began airing on public TV stations in 2007. In January 2010, Steedman reacquired Southern Star’s distribution and licensing rights under Blue Socks Media LLC. Blue Sock Media LLC, completing a complete consolidation of the worldwide assets, later purchased Raggs LLC. Steedman continues to head Blue Socks Media in Charlotte, North Carolina. In July 2012, Telemundo, the NBC-owned Spanish language network, licensed 120 episodes of Raggs in Spanish. Raggs airs on Telemundo Saturdays at 8 am ET and Sundays at 8 and 8:30 am ET.|$|E
