For instance, the word for [...] "to come" [...] (infinitive: gelmek) is modified in the optative to geleyim.

40|$|This {{project is}} a psycholinguistic study about the child {{language}} acquisition in which {{the main focus of}} this study is concentrated on kinds of sentences such as simple affirmative sentence, negative sentence, interrogative sentence that require yes or no as an answer, interrogative sentence with question word, passive sentence, imperative sentence, and request sentences produced by a two year old Indonesian child in his <b>one-word</b> <b>sentences</b> up to more than three word sentences and the syntactic patterns in making those sentences. This research uses one subject in which his utterances were recorded for two hours weekly for approximately five months and the mother was present in all recording sessions. The data were transcribed and grouped into variation of words namely <b>one-word</b> <b>sentences,</b> two-word sentences, three-word sentences and more than three word sentences. The data is analyzed based on each variations of words and the result reveals that the subject has specific patterns in making those sentences such as he utters only the essential word which is mostly the last word of the adult model sentence and in answering the interlocutors' questions with choises he also tends to choose the last choice. In addition, even though not all of the subject's utterances at this time work like by adult standart, there has been considerable achievement for a child who was not yet three...|$|R
5000|$|The {{claim that}} na-adjectives are inflectional {{rests on the}} claim that the {{syllable}} da 'is', usually regarded as a [...] "copula verb", is really a suffix—an inflection. Thus, hon 'book', generates a <b>one-word</b> <b>sentence,</b> honda 'it is a book', not a two-word sentence, hon da. However, numerous constructions seem to be incompatible with the suffixal copula claim.|$|E

(It is not disputed that nouns like 'book' and 'mountain' are noninflectional and that verbs and i-adjectives are inflectional.) The claim that na-adjectives are inflectional rests on {{the claim that the}} syllable da 'is', usually regarded as a [...] "copula verb", is really a suffix—an inflection.

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} techniques for computer-based personality assessment from sentence completions. The <b>One-Word</b> <b>Sentence</b> Completion (OWSC) instrument was designed to elicit data suitable for machine processing, while retaining most {{of the advantages of}} a free-response format. Two operative scoring systems are described. The first employs a ndictionary " of 4366 weignted response words to yield 25 scores from a 90 -item OWSC form. The second system utilizes a complex word-root data reduction procedure and a bank of 892 generic roots to produce scores for 40 variables. Initial reliability data and normative sex differences are reported, and future development of the technique is discussed. (Author/DLG) N SCOPE OF INTEREST NOTICE The ERIC Facility has assigne...|$|E

Kaw can talk, although only in <b>one-word</b> <b>sentences,</b> and {{his role in the}} story is to give information, to spy out the land while flying and sometimes to retrieve lost objects from difficult places. He has a mischievous temperament, often playing tricks on his human friends and talking more freely than he should.|$|R

5000|$|Sentences {{are always}} {{predicate}} final, {{and all of}} the signs from the open lexical classes can function as predicates. Ellipsis is extensive, and <b>one-word</b> <b>sentences</b> are common. There is a strong preference for sentences with only one lexical argument. Constituent order does not play any role in the marking of grammatical relations. These are coded exclusively by spatial mechanisms (e.g., directional signs) or inferred from the context. Temporal expressions usually come first in the sentence, {{and if there is a}} functional particle, it always follows the predicate (e.g., YESTERDAY FATHER DIE COMPLETIVE - [...] "(My) father died yesterday").|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} about first {{language}} acquisition of three-year-old Indonesian children. The thesis writer focuses her {{study on the}} syntactic structures produced by three-year-old Indonesian children in their utterances. The writer tries {{to find out the}} syntactic structures by describing the categorical and functional formulas of the children's utterances. In analyzing their utterances, the writer tries to discover the general formulas that the children follow in producing utterances. In this study, the writer uses 10 weekly meetings every Sunday in a class of three-year-old children in a Sunday School to get the samples from the utterances of 20 children. Seen from the internal structure of the main clause, the data used in this study contain perfect and imperfect sentences. As the next stage, the samples in each of the two types of sentences are classified based on the type of the sentences seen from the context and the answers or response given to the sentences in a continuous discourse. For the perfect sentences, the writer tries to figure out the functional and categorical formulas of the sentences in each type of sentences. While for the imperfect sentences, the writer draws out the categorical formula of each sentence in each type of sentences. The findings of this study show that the children produce simple sentences in their utterances. They produce from <b>one-word</b> <b>sentences</b> to complete simple sentences (the simple sentences that have the complete basic elements of sentences). The result of the study also reveals that in each type of sentences, the children produced utterances that follow certain general formula(s). It is discovered that in each type of sentences, the constructions of the children's utterances follow one or more general formulas...|$|R
40|$|In {{teaching}} and learning process, a teacher takes important roles. He/she {{does a lot of}} things in the classroom and most of her activities are talking, that is communicating verbally with the students in his/her effort to present and discuss the {{teaching and}} learning materials as clearly as possible. The teacher’s verbal communication or teacher talk enables the various classroom activities to happen. This includes the teacher’s explanations, responses to questions, instructions, praises, corrections, etc (Wajnryb, 1992). Realizing the importance of the functions of teacher talk, the writer decided to choose Teacher Talk, especially teacher talk in teaching young learners as her topic under study. In line with the introduction, the research questions raised in this study are: What kinds of teacher talk are used by the teacher in the holistic English class at Wima Lids? And What are the linguistic features of teacher talk in the holistic English class at Wima Kids? This study applies the qualitative research design. The data of this study are gained by doing observations in the field. The type of observations done was a non-participant observation. The writer sat at the back of the classroom, observed, recorded the teacher’s talk secretly, and filled in the relevant checklist. Using FIAS to analyze the data, she found out the kinds of teacher talk at Wima Kids Surabaya are divided into two parts, indirect and direct teacher talk. The indirect influence consists of “accepts feeling, praises or encourages, accepts or uses ideas, and asks questions”. While direct influence consists of “lectures, gives directions, and criticizes or justifies authority”. And the linguistic features of teacher talk used by the teacher are <b>one-word</b> <b>sentences,</b> two-word sentences, three-word sentences and full sentences. The findings suggest that the Indirect Teacher Talk took up the major portion of teacher talk in the holistic English class at Wima Kids. Indirect Teacher Talk refers to the teacher intentionally deciding to let the students to respond in their own way and encourage them to do so. And most of the teacher speeches are used full sentences to respond or initiate. It is a good fact that teacher almost always used full sentences to communicate with her students. The sentences can be good model for the students to master the use of the language learning appropriately...|$|R
