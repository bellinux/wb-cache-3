50|$|In any {{integrated}} {{energy delivery}} utility operation model, {{there are different}} functional modules like GIS, Billing & metering solution, ERP, Asset management system that are operating in parallel and supports routine operations. Quite often, each of these functional modules need to exchange periodic or real time data {{with each other for}} assessing present <b>operation</b> <b>condition</b> of the network, workflows and resources (like crew, assets, etc.). Unlike other power system segments, distribution system changes or grows every day, and this could be due to the addition of a new consumer, a new transmission line or replacement of equipment. If the different functional modules are operating in a non-standard environment and uses custom APIs and database interfaces, the engineering effort for managing shall become too large. Soon it will become difficult to manage the growing changes and additions which would result in making system integrations non- functional. Hence utilities cannot make use of the complete benefit of functional modules and in some cases; the systems may even need to be migrated to suitable environments with very high costs.|$|E
5000|$|Substantial {{intensity}} of ultrasound and high ultrasonic vibration amplitudes {{are required for}} many processing applications, such as nano-crystallization, nano-emulsification, deagglomeration, extraction, cell disruption, {{as well as many}} others. Commonly, a process is first tested on a laboratory scale to prove feasibility and establish some of the required ultrasonic exposure parameters. After this phase is complete, the process is transferred to a pilot (bench) scale for flow-through pre-production optimization and then to an industrial scale for continuous production. During these scale-up steps, it is essential {{to make sure that all}} local exposure conditions (ultrasonic amplitude, cavitation intensity, time spent in the active cavitation zone, etc.) stay the same. If this condition is met, the quality of the final product remains at the optimized level, while the productivity is increased by a predictable [...] "scale-up factor". The productivity increase results from the fact that laboratory, bench and industrial-scale ultrasonic processor systems incorporate progressively larger ultrasonic horns, able to generate progressively larger high-intensity cavitation zones and, therefore, to process more material per unit of time. This is called [...] "direct scalability". It is important to point out that increasing the power capacity of the ultrasonic processor alone does not result in direct scalability, since it may be (and frequently is) accompanied by a reduction in the ultrasonic amplitude and cavitation intensity. During direct scale-up, all processing conditions must be maintained, while the power rating of the equipment is increased in order to enable the operation of a larger ultrasonic horn.Finding the optimum <b>operation</b> <b>condition</b> for this equipment is a challenge for process engineers and needs deep knowledge about side effects of ultrasonic processors.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to optimize the <b>operation</b> <b>conditions</b> using response surface methodology (RSM) for the regeneration of sulfuric acid and ammonia from ammonium sulfate solution by BMED coupled with ammonia in situ stripping. RESULTS: A three-factor central composite design of RSM was used to analyze the effect of <b>operation</b> <b>conditions</b> (current density, flow rate, initial acid concentration) on average current efficiency (ACE) and establish the optimal <b>operation</b> <b>conditions.</b> The ACE was 76. 7 +/- 2. 2 % under optimal <b>operation</b> <b>conditions</b> (current density 23. 8 mA cm(- 2), flow rate 27. 3 L h(- 1), initial acid concentration 0. 09 mol L- 1). CONCLUSION: A suitable regression model for predicting ACE within the ranges of variables used was developed based on experimental results. The <b>operation</b> <b>conditions</b> were optimized by RSM and the ACE obtained under the optimal <b>operation</b> <b>conditions</b> was in good agreement with the value predicted by the regression model (78 %), which proved the validity of the model.
