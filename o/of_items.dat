Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize and keep track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city.

However, when the key size or the word size is very large {{relative to the}} number <b>of</b> <b>items</b> (or equivalently when the number <b>of</b> <b>items</b> is small), it may again become possible to sort quickly, using different algorithms that {{take advantage of the}} parallelism inherent in the ability to perform arithmetic operations on large words.|$|E

40|$|Several test {{procedures}} {{are available to}} measure language comprehension. In this article two tests with different item types are compared. The tests are the Dutch Reynell test – in which the subject has to carry out verbal instructions – and the BELL test – in which the subject has to select which of four pictures best rep-resents a given statement. We studied {{the contribution of the}} type <b>of</b> <b>item,</b> and the linguistic features <b>of</b> the <b>item</b> to the prediction <b>of</b> <b>item</b> difficulty. Both tests were administered to 64 Dutch kindergarten children with an average age of 70. 3 months. The simple correlation between type <b>of</b> <b>item</b> and item difficulty is rela-tively high (. 40). However, regression analyses indicate that type <b>of</b> <b>item</b> does not contribute significantly to the prediction <b>of</b> <b>item</b> difficulty. The linguistic features <b>of</b> the <b>item,</b> in contrast, do. The two tests cover successive age ranges. The results therefore indicate that the BELL test {{can be used as a}} follow up test of the Reynell test for language comprehension. ...|$|R
40|$|Item {{parameter}} invariance {{is one of}} {{the properties}} <b>of</b> <b>item</b> response theory (IRT) that enables computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for test administration.

This study examines how different representations <b>of</b> <b>item</b> position, i. e., using categorical, linear, and quadratic terms, can impact how the relationship between item position and item difficulty is expressed. An explanatory IRT model is formulated for estimating item position effects. The model is demonstrated using data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 reading data for the U. S., wherein the same items appeared in four different positions across <b>item</b> clusters. Methods <b>of</b> choosing the best model to detect item position effects are discussed as well as preliminary item analysis for the estimation <b>of</b> <b>item</b> position effects.

40|$|This study {{entitled}} The Procedures In Translating Of Cultural Expression In The Novel The Years Of The Voiceless By Okky Madasari. The {{objectives of}} the study were to find out the types of the cultural expressions found in the original and target version of The Years of the Voiceless and to find out the translation procedures used to transfer the cultural expressions from Indonesian into English. The study was conducted by applying descriptive qualitative design. The data {{of the study were}} cultural words and phrases found both in the original and the target version of The Years of the Voiceless novel, and there were 96 words and phrases found in the novel. Newmark’s theory which deals with types of cultural words and translation procedures were applies to analyze the data. The findings of the study showed that the types of cultural expression were realized in the novel with the ratio: 44 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> material culture,, 41 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> social culture, 5 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> ecology, 6 <b>items</b> <b>of</b> organizations, customs, activities, procedures, and concepts, and 0 <b>item</b> <b>of</b> gestures and habits.

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>item</b> nonresponse, i. e. missing data, in surveys is {{well known}} among methodologists. Item nonresponse is a problem when it is biased to the dependent variables in aetiological research. The occurrence <b>of</b> <b>item</b> nonresponse in self-reported delinquency studies {{has been associated with}} the threatening nature of questions about previous delinquent behaviour, but item nonresponse also occurs in scales measuring aetiological variables (theoretical concepts) in aetiological research, and in sociology has also been associated with negative attitudes towards the survey, although evidence from self-reported delinquency studies in support of this concern has not yet been given. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the seriousness of the problem <b>of</b> <b>item</b> nonresponse in two independently drawn self-reported delinquency data sets of two classroom delinquency studies conducted among adolescents in Antwerp (Belgium) and Halmstad (Sweden) using paper and pencil interviews (PAPI). We do this by evaluating the non-random character <b>of</b> <b>item</b> nonresponse in scales of delinquency and aetiological variables, by looking at the correlates <b>of</b> <b>item</b> nonresponse and by evaluating the effects of assigning values on the missing data with regard to reliability and correlational validity.
