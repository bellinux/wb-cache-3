50|$|The modern concept <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>crime</b> {{was further}} {{developed}} {{under the auspices}} of the Nuremberg Trials based on the definition in the London Charter that was published on August 8, 1945.

5|$|Bormann {{returned}} with Hitler to the Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945 as the Red Army approached the city. After Hitler committed suicide, Bormann and others attempted to flee Berlin on 2 May to avoid capture by the Soviets. Bormann probably committed suicide on a bridge near Lehrter station. The body was buried nearby on 8 May 1945, {{but was not}} found and confirmed as Bormann's until 1972. Bormann was tried in absentia by the International Military Tribunal in the Nuremberg trials of 1945 and 1946. He was convicted <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> and crimes against humanity {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Croatian {{authorities}} tried Đuro Đurić, {{a former}} SAO Krajina policeman, in absentia on charges <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> committed in Struga, Zamlača and Kozibrod.

After two months in custody, he was released and left the country. Đurić returned to Croatia in February 2009, when he was arrested once again on identical charges. One month later, he was released after witnesses were questioned and failed to link him to the war crimes of which he was accused.|$|E
5|$|In an {{incident}} {{for which he}} would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given {{to a group of}} Waffen-SS soldiers convicted <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> for carrying out the 1944 Malmedy massacre of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.|$|E

5|$|In late 1953, the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations, led by Joseph McCarthy, {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} up to 1,800 reported incidents <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> allegedly committed throughout the Korean War. The Chaplain–Medic massacre {{was one of the}} first to be investigated, and it was here that the incident got its name. Buttrey, the lone survivor of the executions, was called to testify before the committee, and the U.S. Government concluded that the North Korean army violated the terms of the Geneva Convention, and condemned its actions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), {{approximately}} 12 percent of whom were later convicted <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>crimes.</b> Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and their failure to bomb the camp or its railways remains controversial. One hundred forty-four prisoners are known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.|$|E
5|$|Martić {{was tried}} at the International Criminal Tribunal {{for the former}} Yugoslavia (ICTY) on several {{different}} charges <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> including, {{his involvement in the}} siege of Kijevo. The trial resulted in a guilty verdict, and the findings of the Trial Chamber regarding Kijevo, made in 2007, were confirmed by the ICTY Appeals Chamber in 2008, based on witness testimonies about it being ethnic cleansing. The siege was the first instance of use of the ethnic cleansing in the Yugoslav Wars. Croatian authorities tried Mladić in absentia and convicted him for war crimes committed in Kijevo.|$|E

One of Matsui's final acts before going to prison was to ask his wife to adopt their longtime maid Hisae as their daughter.

5|$|The {{incident}} at Hill 303 {{would be only}} one of {{the first of a series}} of atrocities the U.S. forces accused North Korean soldiers of committing.

5|$|The offensive, {{together}} with Operation Sana, caused controversy among military analysts regarding {{the issue of}} whether NATO airstrikes or the two ground offensives contributed more towards the resolution of the Bosnian War, and to what extent ARBiH, HVO and HV advances were helped by, or conversely the VRS hampered by, NATO bombing. In 2011, five former Croatian military personnel were convicted <b>of</b> <b>war</b> <b>crimes</b> for the summary execution of five Bosnian Serb soldiers and an unknown civilian during the offensive.|$|E
