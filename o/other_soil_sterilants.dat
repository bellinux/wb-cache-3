50|$|In 1999, an {{estimated}} 71,500 tonnes of synthetic methyl bromide were used annually worldwide. 97% of this estimate {{is used for}} fumigation purposes, whilst 3% {{is used for the}} manufacture of other products. Moreover, 75% of the consumption takes place in developed nations, led by the U.S. (43%) and Europe (24%). Asia and the Middle East combine to use 24% whereas Latin America and Africa have the lowest consumption rates at 9%.Until its production and use was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol, bromomethane was widely applied as a soil sterilant, mainly for production of seed but also for some crops such as strawberries and almonds. In commercial large-scale monoculture seed production, unlike crop production, it is of vital importance to avoid contaminating the crop with off-type seed of the same species. Therefore, selective herbicides cannot be used. Whereas bromomethane is dangerous, it is considerably safer and more effective than some <b>other</b> <b>soil</b> <b>sterilants.</b> Its loss to the seed industry has resulted in changes to cultural practices, with increased reliance on soil steam sterilization, mechanical rogueing, and fallow seasons. Bromomethane was also used as a general-purpose fumigant to kill a variety of pests including rats and insects. Bromomethane has poor fungicidal properties. Bromomethane is the only fumigant allowed (heat treatment is only other option) under ISPM 15 regulations when exporting solid wood packaging (forklift pallets, crates, bracing) to ISPM 15 compliant countries. Bromomethane is used to prepare golf courses, particularly to control Bermuda grass. The Montreal Protocol stipulates that bromomethane use be phased out.|$|E

The question which now arises is what happens to atrazine in the subsoil where factors affecting degradation would differ from those in the topsoil. This research reports studies of atrazine degradation in two soil profiles and the effects of moisture content, microorganism populations, temperature, and adsorption on atrazine degradation.

This chemical decomposes to methylisothiocyanate (MITC), the primary active ingredient, {{as well as other}} products; but the rate of decomposition in wood is too slow to be effective unless certain catalysts are used. This study explored conditions and additives that accelerated Basamid decomposition in Douglas-fir heartwood. MITC production increased with increasing temperature and moisture content. Decomposition was also enhanced by a buffer powder formulated to reach pH 12 when mixed with 100 ml of water and, more efficiently, by copper sulfate. Carbon disulfide, a less fungitoxic compound, was the only other decomposition product detected in this study. Additional tests using a purge-and-trap system indicated that MITC was produced at a steady, moderate rate over a 28 -day period. Addition of copper as a catalyst in these tests increased MITC production only during the first 7 days. Chemical analyses of residues {{at the conclusion of the}} tests indicated that most of the Basamid remained unchanged, providing a reservoir of chemical that should provide long-term MITC release...|$|R

40|$|Methyl bromide {{is a broad}} {{spectrum}} pesticide, principally used as a fumigant. On soil, it {{is used as a}} pre-plant soil fumigant in locations where a broad complex of soil-borne pests limit the production of certain crops, particularly when they are repeatedly grown on the same land. In SE Asia and the Pacific, the use of methyl bromide as a <b>soil</b> <b>sterilant</b> is only about 6 % of all methyl bromide used (UNDP, 1995). Alternative methods to control soil pests are widespread. Aware of the negative side effects of pesticides, alternative soil pest control practices with reduced chemical inputs are being suggested. Soil pest control practices include biological control by means of natural enemies and integrated methods, such as integrated pest management (IPM) or integrated crop management (ICM). This paper documents a number of cases of alternative soil pest control methods with reduced chemical inputs in commercial use for horticultural crops in Asia. In addition, alternatives that have been found effective in field and/or greenhouse trials are reviewed. Cases of alternative soil pest control methods used commercially for horticultural crops on modem as well as traditional farms in Asia are listed in Table 1. The methods range from relatively new techniques, such as substrates and solarisation, to improved methods of traditional techniques, such as composting. There is now greater appreciation and respect for low-input, traditional agricultural systems, and the methods that are employed by traditional farmers are recognised as often being more efficient and logical than previously thought. In fact, to manage nematodes, integrated systems are being developed that incorporate or consider many alternative small-scale farmer practices (Bridge, 1996) ...|$|R

Mycorrhizal fungi grow in or on some plants' roots and can help that plant take up phosphates and water, thereby increasing yields. CIAT researchers say that for on-farm production farmers will need a cheap and relatively safe <b>soil</b> <b>sterilant,</b> a host plant and a very small amount of starter inoculum with a highly effective mycorrhizal isolate which must be adapted to local conditions. By sterilizing 25 square metres of land {{to a depth of}} 20 cm, inoculating this area and planting a host plant, the farmer can produce enough inoculum in three or four months to inoculate one hectare of cassava. The most effective way of inoculating plants with mycorrhizal fungi is to put half of the inoculum under the cassava stake at planting time and to apply the other half in bands {{on either side of the}} plant five months later. CIAT also says that grasses inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi and phosphate fertilizer from cheap sources can produce eleven times more dry matter than untreated pastures. (For the plants to take up more phosphates there must phosphate in the soil to begin with.) Scientists at CIAT have been looking at ways of increasing production on the phosphate-poor, acid savannah soils of South America. They found that once mycorrhizal fungi were present in the soil most grasses were able to increase their uptake of phosphates. Results were better when rock phosphate and potassium feldspar rock were applied to grasses inoculated with fungi. Small farmers could grow their own mycorrhizal inoculum, according to the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) of Colombia.

40|$|The Montreal Protocol {{was signed}} 25 years ago. As a result, the {{irreversible}} {{destruction of the}} ozone layer was prevented. However, stratospheric ozone will not recover completely until 2060 and the consequent epidemic in skin cancer cases will persist until 2100. Many millions of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have safely switched from chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) -powered metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) to either hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) or DPIs. China will be the last country to phase out CFCs by 2016. HFCs are global warming gases which will be controlled in the near future. HFCs in MDIs may be phased out over the next 10 – 20 years. In November 2012, the Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol for the Protection of the Ozone Layer celebrated its 25 th anniversary in Geneva. There is much to celebrate since the Montreal Protocol has been the most successful in the UN Environment Programme and is unique in being signed by all 196 members of the UN. STRATOSPHERIC OZONE Stratospheric ozone is critical in shielding the Earth and its life forms from excessive ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation. Reductions in ozone increase skin cancer and cataracts, and have major effects on plankton and crops. The Montreal Protocol controls the production of a range of chemicals that deplete stratospheric ozone, including methyl bromide used as a <b>soil</b> <b>sterilant</b> in agriculture, halons for fire extin-guishers in aeroplanes and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were widely used in refrigeration, foam blowing and as aerosol propellants, especially in metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) used for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

40|$|The main {{issues related}} to the {{atmospheric}} pollution are the stratospheric ozone depletion, the transboundary air pollution, the troposphere air quality and the climate change. The three last decades have seen the birth of several measures for the atmosphere safeguard. Agricultural activities {{play a key role in}} determining, preventing and mitigating atmospheric pollution. The emission to atmosphere of different ozone-depleting substances is regulated by the Montreal Protocol. The role of agriculture activity in ozone depletion is linked to the utilization of methyl bromide as <b>soil</b> <b>sterilant</b> and to the emission of nitrogen oxides and nitrous oxide, from agricultural soils. The Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution regulates the emission of several pollutants, i. e. sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, non methane volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, and tropospheric ozone. The agriculture sector is responsible for a large part of the emissions of ammonia and nitrogen oxides, mainly through manure management and nitrogen fertilization, and of most persistent organic pollutants, largely used in the past as insecticides and fungicides. The increase of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) concentration in the atmosphere is under the control of the Kyoto Protocol. Agriculture accounts for 59 - 63 % of global non-CO 2 GHGs emissions but at the same time it contributes to the atmospheric CO 2 concentration stabilisation through the substitution of fossil fuels by biofuels and the sequestration of C in soil and vegetal biomass. In this paper we provide an outline of the numerous scientific and legislative initiatives aimed at protecting the atmosphere, and we analyse in detail the agriculture sector in order to highlight both its contribution to atmospheric pollution and the actions aimed at preventing and mitigating it...|$|R
