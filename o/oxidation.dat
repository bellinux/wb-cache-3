5|$|The formal <b>oxidation</b> {{number in}} boranes is positive, {{and is based}} on the {{assumption}} that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean <b>oxidation</b> number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B2H6, the boron <b>oxidation</b> state is +3, but in decaborane B10H14, it is 7/5 or +1.4. In these compounds the <b>oxidation</b> state of boron is often not a whole number.|$|E

5|$|The <b>oxidation</b> {{state of}} oxygen is −2 {{in almost all}} known {{compounds}} of oxygen. The <b>oxidation</b> state −1 is found in a few compounds such as peroxides. Compounds containing oxygen in other <b>oxidation</b> states are very uncommon: −1/2 (superoxides), −1/3 (ozonides), 0 (elemental, hypofluorous acid), +1/2 (dioxygenyl), +1 (dioxygen difluoride), and +2 (oxygen difluoride).|$|E
5|$|Actinium reacts rapidly {{with oxygen}} and {{moisture}} in air forming a white coating of actinium oxide that impedes further <b>oxidation.</b> As with most lanthanides and actinides, actinium {{exists in the}} <b>oxidation</b> state +3, and the Ac3+ ions are colorless in solutions. The <b>oxidation</b> state +3 originates from the 6d17s2 electronic configuration of actinium, with three valence electrons that are easily donated to give the stable closed-shell structure of the noble gas radon. The rare <b>oxidation</b> state +2 is only known for actinium dihydride (AcH2); even this may in reality be an electride compound like its lighter congener LaH2.|$|E

40|$|A {{phospholipid}} {{requirement of}} 2 -acetamidofluorene N- and ring-hydroxylation was investigated with partially delipidated microsomal fraction from livers of 3 -methylcholanthrene-pretreated hamsters. Butan- 1 -ol extraction of microsomal fraction removed 90 % {{of the total}} lipid content without any appreciable effect on microsomal proteins.

Addition of butan- 1 -ol-extracted total lipid restored both <b>oxidations</b> to some extent, whereas addition of phosphatidylcholine fraction restored both <b>oxidations</b> almost completely.

5|$|Although {{these are}} not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable {{compounds}} with formal <b>oxidation</b> state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal <b>oxidation</b> states are often of little meaning in boron hydrides and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II).

5|$|Americium readily {{reacts with}} oxygen and dissolves well in acids. The most common <b>oxidation</b> state for {{americium}} is +3, in which americium compounds are rather stable against <b>oxidation</b> and reduction. In this sense, americium is chemically similar to most lanthanides. The trivalent americium forms insoluble fluoride, oxalate, iodate, hydroxide, phosphate and other salts. Other <b>oxidation</b> {{states have been}} observed between +2 and +7, which is the widest range among the actinide elements. Their color in aqueous solutions varies as follows: Am3+ (colorless to yellow-reddish), Am4+ (yellow-reddish), AmV; (yellow), AmVI (brown) and AmVII (dark green). All <b>oxidation</b> states have their characteristic optical absorption spectra, with a few sharp peaks in the visible and mid-infrared regions, and the position and intensity of these peaks can be converted into the concentrations of the corresponding <b>oxidation</b> states. For example, Am(III) has two sharp peaks at 504 and 811nm, Am(V) at 514 and 715nm, and Am(VI) at 666 and 992nm.|$|E

5|$|Europium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Eu and atomic number 63. It was isolated in 1901 and {{is named after}} the continent of Europe. It is a moderately hard, silvery metal which readily oxidizes in air and water. Being a typical member of the lanthanide series, europium usually assumes the <b>oxidation</b> state +3, but the <b>oxidation</b> state +2 is also common. All europium compounds with <b>oxidation</b> state +2 are slightly reducing. Europium has no significant biological role and is relatively non-toxic compared to other heavy metals. Most applications of europium exploit the phosphorescence of europium compounds.

5|$|Industrial {{production}} of selenium usually involves {{the extraction of}} selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper.
