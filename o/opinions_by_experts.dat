40|$|Background: Research on {{oral health}} {{contributes}} to improved health outcomes; {{it is an}} indispensable tool in health policy. But how to fill the gaps in research oral health and to strengthen its capacity is the question. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to identify the current status of oral health research and potential strategies, thereby strengthening the research infrastructure and capacity. Delphi consultation, in the perspective of assisting decision-makers to identify strategies to promote better research on oral health in Africa, was initiated. Design and Methods: The panels of 30 experts were asked to complete the questionnaire with 42 items into four groups by web survey. Each indicator statement was considered to be in consensus if the expert′s opinion rating was of "A or B" for more than 75 % in a scale of seven categories. Quantitative analysis was made from the answers of Delphi round. Results: There was a strong consensus about three items concerning the role of oral health research, the development of research policy for oral health going through an effective governance of research institutes, migration of researchers and fund raising. Conclusion: This study shows strong many dispersal <b>opinions</b> <b>by</b> <b>experts,</b> but highlights the need for to improve the effectiveness of oral health research capacity strengthening activities.

40|$|The ever-growing {{interconnectivity}} {{of industry}} and infrastructure through cyberspace has increased their vulnerability to cyber attack. The lack of any formal codification of cyber warfare {{has led to the}} development of contradictory state practices and disagreement as to the legal standing of cyber warfare, resulting in an increased risk of damage to property and loss of life. Using the just war theory as a foundation, the research questions asked at the point at which cyber attacks meet the definition of use of force or armed attack under international law and what impediments currently exist in the development of legal limitations on cyber warfare. The research design was based on using the Delphi technique with 18 scholars in the fields of cyber warfare and international law for 3 rounds of questioning to reach a consensus of opinion. The study employed qualitative content analysis of survey questions during the first round of inquiry in order to create the questions for the 2 subsequent rounds. The first round of inquiry consisted of a questionnaire composed of 9 open-ended questions. These data were inductively coded to identify themes for the subsequent questionnaires that consisted of 42 questions that allowed the participants to rank their responses on a Likert-type scale and contextualize them using written responses. Participants agreed that a computer attack is comparable to the use of force or armed attack under international law, but fell short of clearly defining the legal boundaries of cyber warfare.

While this necessity has been highlighted in Iran’s Fifth Development Plan as well as its National 2025 Vision Plan, the determinants of social accountability have not been explained yet. This study aimed to develop determinants of social accountability in the Iranian Nursing and Midwifery Schools. Methods: This classic Delphi study included thirty experts in Nursing and Midwifery Education, Research and Services selected based on purposive sampling and three rounds of Delphi technique and conducted in Nursing and Midwifery School of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. The primary data were collected using an initial structured questionnaire prepared through extensive review of literature. SPSS 11. 5 software was used to analyze the data. The interquartile deviation and percentage of agreement were also used to study the consensus of <b>opinion</b> <b>by</b> <b>experts.</b> Results: Finding obtained from the rounds of Delphi resulted in selecting 69 determinants out of the initial pool of 128 primary determinants of social accountability.

Conclusion: Social accountability determinants were explained by 69 items for Schools of Nursing and Midwifery in Iran.

40|$|The {{dispute over}} whether litigants may use experts to run unexamined hearsay into the trial record is a {{microcosm}} of a larger debate. The larger question is whether judicial review of expert testimony should be passive, or whether the expert witness process should be marked by active judicial policing. Does the plethora of expert opinions presently being offered in modern trials merit special scrutiny by the courts? Some scholars urge that courts must accommodate experts. Proponents of this view favor few challenges to the unrestricted rendition of <b>opinions</b> <b>by</b> an <b>expert,</b> whether the expert is real or self-proclaimed. Under this approach, 2 ̆ 2 [a]s long as the expert testified that he was qualified, that the data he used was of the type reasonably relied upon <b>by</b> other <b>experts</b> in the field, and that he was reasonably certain of his conclusions, judges would present the evidence to the jury without further scrutiny. 2 ̆ 2 A passive judicial approach to expert testimony facilitates ready admission of the underlying data used <b>by</b> an <b>expert</b> to reach her conclusions. It means that rigorous application of hearsay doctrine, requiring that the author of the underlying hearsay document be present or at least have been cross-examined, is abandoned. A growing number of courts and commentators have criticized the passive approach to expert testimony. Some have urged strict control of runaway expert testimony. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has remarked: 2 ̆ 2 It is time to take hold of expert testimony in federal trials. 2 ̆ 2 To this end, Minnesota amended its evidence rules to embrace a policy prohibiting, on direct examination, the wholesale introduction of the background documents used <b>by</b> an <b>expert</b> to reach his or her conclusions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to the problem of expert resolution. The proposed analytic structure provides a mechanism by which a decision maker can incorporate the possibly conflicting probability assessments of a group of experts. The approach is based upon the Bayesian inferential framework presented in [Morris, P. A. 1974. Decision analysis expert use. Management Sci. 20 (9, May) ]. A number of specific results are derived from analysis of a generic model structure. In the single expert continuous variable case, we prove that the decision maker should process a calibrated <b>expert's</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>by</b> multiplying the <b>expert's</b> probability assessment <b>by</b> his own prior probability assessment and normalizing. A method for subjectively calibrating an expert is also presented. In the multi-expert case, we obtain a simple multiplicative rule for combining the expert judgments.
