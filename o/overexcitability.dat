Scientists believe that some types of stimulus-sensitive myoclonus may involve <b>overexcitability</b> of {{the parts of the}} brain that control movement. These parts are interconnected in a series of feedback loops called motor pathways. These pathways facilitate and modulate communication between the brain and muscles. Key elements of this communication are chemicals known as neurotransmitters, which carry messages from one nerve cell, or neuron, to another. Neurotransmitters are released by neurons and attach themselves to receptors on parts of neighboring cells. Some neurotransmitters may make the receiving cell more sensitive, while others tend to make the receiving cell less sensitive. Laboratory studies suggest that an imbalance between these chemicals may underlie myoclonus.|$|E

40|$|Twice {{exceptional}} {{students are}} those who have emotional disturbances or behavioral disorders (E/BD) and who also display characteristics of high intellectual ability. Case studies were developed over a 3 -year period on three male junior high school students who fit this definition. Data were interpreted using Kazimierz Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration, in which progressive conflicts and contradictions arise from life experience and become a fundamental and positive factor of development. The theory stresses the affective aspect of development and postulates five levels of individual development, each with a distinguishable personality organization. Dabrowski indicated that advanced development could be predicted by examining five types of <b>overexcitabilities</b> in response to stimuli. More numerous and more intense <b>overexcitabilities</b> suggest higher potential for advance...|$|R
50|$|Dąbrowski also {{encouraged}} {{people to see}} their reactions (<b>overexcitabilities)</b> and their phenomenological {{view of the world}} {{in the context of their}} developmental potential. The experience of, and reaction to, crises are a very important aspect of this approach and people are encouraged to experience personal crises with a positive and developmental view.|$|R
50|$|One severe hurdle to the {{investigation}} and study {{of the theory of}} positive disintegration is the fact that no suitable psychological test exists that measures any Dabrowskian constructs well. The most widely known instrument, the <b>Overexcitability</b> Questionnaire—Two has poor psychometric properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Overexcitability</b> is {{a measure}} of an individual’s level of nervous response. Dąbrowski found that the exemplars he studied all {{displayed}} an overly sensitive nervous system, also making them prone to angst, depression and anxiety - psychoneuroses in Dąbrowski's terms, a very positive and developmental feature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most evident}} aspect of {{developmental}} potential is <b>overexcitability</b> (OE), a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. The greater the OE, the more intense are the day-to-day experiences of life. Dąbrowski outlined five forms of OE: psychomotor, sensual, imaginational, intellectual and emotional. These overexcitabilities, especially the latter three, often cause {{a person to}} experience daily life more intensely and to feel the extremes of the joys and sorrows of life profoundly. Dąbrowski studied human exemplars and found that heightened <b>overexcitability</b> was {{a key part of}} their developmental and life experience. These people are steered and driven by their value [...] "rudder", their sense of emotional OE. Combined with imaginational and intellectual OE, these people have a powerful perception of the world.|$|E
50|$|Although {{based in}} the nervous system, <b>overexcitabilities</b> come to be {{expressed}} psychologically {{through the development of}} structures that reflect the emerging autonomous self. The most important of these conceptualizations are dynamisms: biological or mental forces that control behavior and its development. Instincts, drives and intellectual processes combined with emotions are dynamisms. With advanced development, dynamisms increasingly reflect movement toward autonomy.|$|R
50|$|The {{theory of}} {{positive}} disintegration (TPD) by Kazimierz Dabrowski describes {{a theory of}} personality and personality development. Unlike mainstream psychology, Dabrowski's theoretical framework views psychological tension, anxiety, and depression as necessary for growth. The strongest potential for tensions that lead to advancement stem from mental <b>overexcitabilities,</b> above-average reactions to stimuli. Also, unlike some other theories of development such as Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels, which are not tied to ages.|$|R

Specifically, [...] "a group {{of gifted children}} and young people aged 8 to 23" [...] were examined (p. 251). Of the 80 youth studied, 30 were [...] "intellectually gifted" [...] and 50 were from [...] "drama, ballet, and plastic art schools" [...] (p. 251). Dąbrowski found that every one of the children displayed <b>overexcitability,</b> [...] "which constituted the foundation for the emergence of neurotic and psychoneurotic sets.

Dąbrowski asked why these children should display such [...] "states of nervousness or psychoneurosis" [...] and suggested that it was due to the presence of OE (p. 255).

40|$|In {{even the}} {{earliest}} studies of giftedness {{in young children}} (Burks, Jensen, & Terman, 1930; Hollingworth, 1926), researchers noted distinct character traits among gifted students, which included global aware-ness, sensitivity to complex issues, and a tendency to worry about injustice and dangers that often are beyond a child’s control. Dabrowski and Piechowski (1977) described what they called emotional <b>overexcitabilities</b> that can be observed among gifted students as great depth and intensity of emotional life expressed through {{a wide range of}} “feeling, attachments, compassion, heightened sense of responsibility, and scrupulous self-examination” (p. 287).

Similarly, we may identify whether the learners exhibit <b>overexcitabilities,</b> such as emotional, imaginational and intellectual. Differentiation of these psychological and neurological characteristics enable us be inclusive in our practices; for example, {{we will be able}} to meet the needs of highly sensitive gifted learners in the mainstream education system, instead of requiring special programs. We cannot expect the presence of idealistic learners possessing extreme visual spatial and auditory sequential skills at the same time. From a pedagogical point of view, we need to stress on higher-order learning by having assessment targeting higher-order learning. One of the important aspects when targeting higher-order learning is the timing aspect; that is how much time we spend on elaborating the most important concepts in the subject area as well as the time allocated for assessment, considering that human brain is a parallel processor, not a sequential operator such as a machine, or robot...|$|R

40|$|Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is {{associated}} with hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity. A {{review of the literature}} seems to indicate that gifted individuals can be at risk of being misdiagnosed as having ADHD. This study investigated the current literature to determine what types of behaviors demonstrated in gifted individuals can cause such a misdiagnosis. We look at the neurobiological origins of ADHD and intelligence in order to identify potential parallels that can cause similar behavior. Further, because ADHD and intelligence are highly heritable, we will also explore the literature on genetic and environmental factors that influence their development. The ADHD-like behaviors that gifted individuals can exhibit are so-called ‘overexcitabilities’ which are driven by different neurobiological mechanisms. Whereas high intelligence {{is associated}} with increased brain size and a more efficient neural network in healthy subjects, ADHD {{is associated with}} reductions in brain size and deficiencies in the neural networks of executive functions. As of yet, genetic research has been unsuccessful in identifying strong candidate genes associated with the development of either intelligence or ADHD. However, increasing evidence points to intelligence holding phenotypical properties in ADHD as well as a moderating effect in the development of ADHD. In conclusion, gifted individuals can exhibit behaviors, or <b>overexcitabilities,</b> that may mistakenly be associated with ADHD. However, the neurobiological mechanisms that are associated with high intelligence are completely different from those that are associated with ADHD. This suggests that similarities between the inattentive and hyperactive behaviors associated with giftedness and ADHD are not due to similar neurobiological mechanisms. The different neurobiological mechanisms, together with cognitive tasks with discriminative properties, may provide a successful measure to distinguish ADHD and giftedness, and thus prevent misdiagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Dabrowski {{presents}} {{a theory of}} personality development based on a multilevel, hierarchical view of life. The theory suggests individual developmental potentials are important factors in determining the course of personality growth. Developmental potential includes three aspects; special talents and abilities, a physiological measure of neural reactivity Dabrowski called <b>overexcitability</b> (OE) and a factor describing an inner motivation to develop. Individuals with strong developmental potential tend to experience frequent and intense crises (positive disintegrations) that create opportunities {{for the development of}} an autonomous, self-crafted personality.

While recent work has focussed on the link between <b>overexcitability</b> and giftedness, developmental potential and giftedness are not synonymous, indeed, many (most) with developmental potential will not be classified as gifted, and many gifted will display little overall developmental potential.
