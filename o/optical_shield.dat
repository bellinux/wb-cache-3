The measured ionization spectrum does not contain resonances due {{to the formation of}} photoassociated molecules connected to the omega = 5 excited state potential as predicted by Doery et al (1998 Phys.

Our aims in this note are {{to explain the}} underlying mechanism and estimate the possible thermal effects of multiple pulses in vascular structures typical of PWS. Based on linear response theory, the linear combination of two thermal contributions {{is responsible for the}} total increase in temperature in laser irradiated blood vessels: direct light absorption by blood and direct bilateral thermal heat conduction from adjacent blood vessels. The latter contribution to the increase in temperature in the targeted vessel can be significant, particularly if some adjacent vessels are in close proximity, such as in cases of <b>optical</b> <b>shielding</b> of the targeted vessel, or if the vessels are relatively distant but many in number.

40|$|For {{measurements}} on rotating machinery, e. g. torque, {{it is necessary}} to transfer data from the rotating to the stationary system. Telemetry equipment is normally used for this task, transferring data electromagnetically by means of antennae to a telemetry receiver mounted on the stationary system. The telemetry principle works well for applications with weak electromagnetic interference (EMI). However it does not work with an acceptable degree of reliability in many industrial applications where EMI is very strong, especially for {{measurements on}} AC adjustable-speed drives. In some cases it does not work under any circumstances. Therefore a very cheap, robust frequency modulated infrared data transfer system was developed for such ambient conditions.

40|$|In the past, light-assisted cold {{collisions}} between laser cooled atoms {{have been}} widely studied in magneto-optical atom traps (MOTs). We describe here theoretical studies of dynamical interactions, specifically cold collisions, between atoms trapped in near-resonant, dissipative optical lattices. The developed quantum-mechanical model is based on Monte Carlo wave-function simulations and combines atomic cooling and collision dynamics in a single framework. It turns out, that the radiative heating mechanism affects the dynamics of atomic cloud in a red-detuned lattice {{in a way that}} is not directly expected from the MOT studies. The optical lattice and position dependent light-matter coupling introduces selectivity of collision partners. Atoms, which are most mobile and energetic, are strongly favored to participate in collisions, and are more often ejected from the lattice, than the slow ones in the laser parameter region selected for study. For blue-detuned lattices, we study how <b>optical</b> <b>shielding</b> emerges as a natural part of the lattice and look for ways to optimize the effect. The simulations are computationally very demanding and would obviously benefit from the simplification schemes.

40|$|Laser-Induced Incandescence (LII) {{occurs when}} a high-energy pulsed laser beam {{encounters}} graphitic particulate matter particles like soot or carbon black. The particles absorb laser energy from the beam and see an increase in their internal energy, resulting in an increase of temperature. At the same time, the particles loose energy through heat transfer mechanisms. If the energy absorption rate is sufficiently high, particle temperature will rise to levels where significant incandescence (blackbody emission) can occur. Typically, Laser-Induced Incandescence produces 50 ns to 1 Î¼s long light pulses at atmospheric pressure. So far, LII measurements had been restrained to conduction-dominated conditions, whereby signals are short-lived (less than one microsecond) and require sensitive nanosecond resolution instrumentation. This thesis introduces a novel LII â€“ based measurement method performed under high vacuum conditions. The novelty of LII under vacuum resided {{in the fact that}} heat conduction away from the soot particle becomes negligible below 10 - 2 mbar and this constituted a step away from the typical situation, whereby laser absorption is followed by heat conduction from the particles to the surrounding medium. Instead, sublimation and radiative heat transfer would follow laser absorption. The consequence was the obtention of long-lived LII signals (up to 100 microseconds) and a large gain of photons (ranging between 50 to 300) emitted per primary soot particle during LII temperature decays. Furthermore, the refractive index function E(m) value could be determined directly from measured radiative temperature decays, with potentially an uncertainty of circa 7 %, which outperformed current soot extinction measurements. In addition, for laser fluences below 0. 06 J/cm 2, a regime where only laser energy absorption and radiative heat transfer apply would be reached and LII signals became independent of particle size. Throughout this project, Laser-Induced Incandescence under vacuum was applied to a sample of carbon powder (agglomerated soot particles) sealed in a glass vessel and held below 10 - 3 mbar. Initial spectral measurements performed at a laser fluence of 0. 3 J/cm 2 confirmed the obtention of long-lived (60 microseconds long) blackbody spectra, which confirmed the feasibility of the technique and yielded an E(m) measurement of between 0. 35 and 0. 45. A second study was performed with a dualwavelength pyrometric system specifically designed for recording live LII temperatures and signal intensities coupled to an absolute light intensity calibrated intensified imaging system. Experimental results unveiled the thermo-physical behaviours of agglomerates enduring LII. The most remarkable outcomes of the results concerning carbon nanoparticles agglomerates were that: clusterous particulate matter absorbs and radiates light in a very similarly to single isolated carbon nanoparticles and therefore obey largely the Rayleigh limit; soot agglomerates also dissociate during LII in an explosive mode and ejecta were measured to reach up to 400 m/s following chain dissociations; complete agglomerate dissociations can be obtained and measurements performed on individual aggregates of primary soot nanoparticles. In parallel, LII measurements revealed that <b>optical</b> <b>shielding</b> is largely present within agglomerates, and therefore clusters dissociations exposed large quantities of particulate matter and increased greatly LII signal levels. Overall, radiative heat transfer measurements yielded E(m) = 0. 4 to 0. 6 and time-integrated ICCD measurements resolved signal levels as low as groups of 6 carbon nanoparticles. This sensitivity clearly was the highest recorded to date for Laser Induced Incandescence and the sensitivity boundary of the technique was increased to nearly resolving single nanoparticles. Further measurements were performed in collaboration with the National Research Council (NRC) of Ottawa, Canada, at the Combustion Research Group facility. The results obtained validated the obtention of repeatable temperature profiles for Laser- Induced Incandescence under vacuum. In addition, comparison between results obtained on a controlled source of agglomerates at atmospheric pressure established that the increase for LII signals with laser fluence for both atmospheric and vacuum conditions could be directly associated with agglomerates dissociations. Indeed, net diminutions in <b>optical</b> <b>shielding</b> were measured in both conditions and could be coupled with diminutions in thermal shielding at atmospheric pressures. Highresolution temperature measurements established that laser absorption, annealing, sublimation and radiative heat transfer rates could be unprecedently and directly measured by laser-induced incandescence under vacuum. Annealing and sublimation of soot primary particles could also reasonably be assumed to be the phenomena at the heart of agglomerate dissociations. It was also established that agglomerate dissociation was dependent not only on laser fluence but also on the instantaneous laser power absorbed by the carbon agglomerates: indeed measurements performed at NRC were effected with a instantaneous laser powers four times lower than previously and radiative heat transfer measurements attested incomplete agglomerate dissociations with E(m) values measured between 0. 8 and 1. Overall, the present work introduces LII under vacuum as a high sensitivity measurement method for particulate matter. The sensitivities obtained approached nanoparticles resolution and constitutes one of the most sensitive particulate matter measurement technique to date with real-time measurements capability. Because of the sample studied, agglomerate dynamics during LII were unveiled {{for the first time and}} explained the increase of LII signals with laser fluence as a diminution of both thermal and <b>optical</b> <b>shielding.</b> The LII under vacuum technique also proved its ability to resolve and isolate some of the key phenomena occurring during LII: laser absorption, annealing, sublimation and heat radiation.

30|$|The {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} the pulsed laser at 25 -kHz repetition rate, which means the delay between two laser pulses was 40 Â Î¼s. This is much shorter than the time duration of a cavitation bubble which is usually ~ 300 â€“ 680 Â Î¼s depending on laser parameters and solvent properties. This results in strong screening of the laser for every pulse after the first pulse. The fully expanded cavitation bubble acts as a negative lens and strongly defocusses the incident laser beam, thereby reducing the laser fluence at the target surface. This strong defocusing of subsequent laser pulses by bubble formed by previous pulse causes screening of laser pulses and results in irregular ablation by the successive pulses [22]. With the laser and scanning parameters used (25 Â kHz repetition rate, 500 Â ns pulse duration, 2000 Â mm/s scanning speed, and 8 [*]Ã—[*] 8 Â mm scanning area), the distance between two laser pulses on the target surface was 80 Â Î¼m. This is smaller than the spot size of the laser, especially after the defocusing caused by cavitation bubbles. Due to this, re-ablation on the same spot occurs which raises {{the temperature of the}} plasma formed by previous laser pulse. Moreover, in PLAL using a nanosecond laser, there is a temporal overlap between the laser pulses and the ablated material. The plasma plume formed by the laser pulse absorbs part of the energy from the subsequent laser pulse and results in <b>optical</b> <b>shielding</b> of the target from the laser pulses [14]. This also increases the temperature of the plasma plume and decreases in the energy absorbed by the target surface. As the PLAL process continues, more and more nanoparticles are released in the surrounding solvent which interact with the incident laser pulses and absorb its energy. The laser beam in the experiments is focused at the target, so the synthesized nanoparticles undergo laser processing without laser beam focusing on them. For this configuration with a nanosecond laser, Pyantenko et al. reported that the nanoparticles get intensely heated by the energy absorbed from the laser pulses and can evaporate or explode to form smaller fragments, thereby causing size reduction [24]. Werner et al. concluded that the photothermal mechanism alone (without Coulomb explosion) can explain this pulsed laser-induced size reduction of nanoparticles with nanosecond pulsed laser [25].|$|R

40|$|The meteoroids {{and debris}} {{environment}} {{play an important}} role in the reduction of spacecraft life time. Ejecta or secondary debris, are produced when a debris or a meteoroid impact a spacecraft surface. These ejecta can contribute to a modification of the debris environment: either locally by the occurrence of secondary impacts on the component of complex and large space structures, or at long distance by formation of small orbital debris. This double characteristic underlines the necessity to model the damages caused by an HVI as well as the material ejection caused by the impact. Brittle materials are particularly sensitive to hypervelocity impacts because they produce features larger than those observed on ductile targets and the ejected fragments total mass including ejectas and spalls is in the order of 100 times bigger than the impacting mass. The French atomic energy commission (CEA) faces to the same problem in the Laser MÃ©gaJoule project (LMJ).

The structure will then be moved to the payload pointing system for pointing, optical control and scientific optical measurement for the third experiment...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} days of laser physics and laser {{radiation}} sources the optical components such as mirrors, windows, output couplers, beamsplitters and lenses limit the performance of high power and high energy laser radiation sources and their applications as well. The continuous trends / 1, 2 / towards industrial laser radiation sources with increased output power, improved beam quality and easy beam modulation requires a corresponding improvement in the power-handling capability of the optical components. The optical components usually take advantage of the use of thin film coatings / 3, 4 /. These thin film coatings are widely used in a variety of applications either as structural overcoats or as functional coatings. The former case implies thin films on machine tools to decrease wear and protective overcoats on <b>optical</b> components to <b>shield</b> surfaces from an adverse environment. The latter case implies thin films on optical components for reflection modifications and wavelength selective or polarization sensitive uses as for interference filters and related components. A successful thin film coating claims for the survive of an optical component in an operating environment at least to the extent resulting to an improvement over a similar uncoated component...|$|R
