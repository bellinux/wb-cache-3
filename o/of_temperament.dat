5|$|Since the mid-1990s, Limousin breeders {{have worked}} {{extensively}} on improving disposition issues in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand. This has been {{aided by the}} high heritability <b>of</b> <b>temperament</b> and {{by the development of}} genetic measures of docility (among many other traits) predicted from field measurements and subsequent analysis using BLUP techniques to produce docility EBVs and EPDs. Significant improvement has been recorded in the temperament of Limousins, as can be observed from trait trends published by various international breed associations.|$|E
5|$|There {{is as yet}} no {{explanation}} for why similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited. The issue <b>of</b> <b>temperament</b> and its influence {{on the development of}} attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment vary widely.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types <b>of</b> <b>temperament</b> may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

25|$|David Keirsey {{expanded}} on {{the ancient}} study <b>of</b> <b>temperament</b> by Hippocrates and Plato. In his works, Keirsey used the names suggested by Plato: Artisan (iconic), Guardian (pistic), Idealist (noetic), and Rational (dianoetic). Keirsey divided the four temperaments into two categories (roles), each with two types (role variants). The resulting 16 types correlate with the 16 personality types described by Briggs and Myers.|$|E

She early gave evidence of peculiarities <b>of</b> <b>temperament,</b> shy, dreamy and meditative, with an exceeding love for nature. Her interest in Indian lore and legend developed after a meeting with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow during her childhood.|$|E
25|$|Finally, any {{critique}} of attachment theory needs {{to consider how}} the theory has connected with changes in other psychological theories. Research on attachment issues has begun to include concepts related to behaviour genetics and to the study <b>of</b> <b>temperament</b> (constitutional factors in personality), but it is unusual for popular presentations of attachment theory to include these. Importantly, some researchers and theorists have begun to connect attachment with the study of mentalization or Theory of Mind, the capacity that allows human beings to guess with some accuracy what thoughts, emotions, and intentions lie behind behaviours as subtle as facial expression or eye movement. The connection of theory of mind with the internal working model of social relationships may open a new area of study and lead to alterations in attachment theory.|$|E
