50|$|In {{the case}} of {{two-stage}} spring there are two curved parallel springs, one inside the other, but the internal spring is shorter so that it acts later. The characteristic curve of the <b>outer</b> <b>spring</b> is adapted to increase when the engine is started. The softer <b>outer</b> <b>spring</b> only acts to increase the problematic resonance frequency range. When the torque increases, reaching the maximum value, the internal spring also acts.

50|$|The {{wide and}} large port heads with {{staggered}} valve placement give the Boss 302 high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof {{design of the}} heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake (2.23 inches) and exhaust (1.70 inches) valves sitting in a small quench style combustion chamber. Exhaust valves were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and <b>outer</b> <b>spring</b> to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable rocker arms. Fuel was provided by a Holly 780cfm manual choke carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer. Ford used a phenolic spacer that incorporated an aluminum tube for the PCV hose, and also helped isolate the carburetor from {{the heat of the}} intake. Ignition was handled by a dual point distributor firing then unique 14mm AF 32 Autolite sparkplugs specified because of their smaller size (5/8 inch wrench vs. 13/16 inch wrench) so as to fit within the tight confines of the combustion chamber alongside the very large valves.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{due to a}} need {{to reduce}} emissions, the {{automotive}} industry has focused on increasing vehicle efficiency. One of the areas being examined for potential improvement is the automatic transmission; specifically, the torque converter clutch damper. The better {{the performance of the}} damper, the more time the torque converter can be kept in the optimum locked position, thus increasing vehicle efficiency. Currently a large number of vehicle manufacturers use transmission technology sourced from external OEMs; {{due to a lack of}} available performance data or validated simulations, sometimes vehicle manufacturers are not able to fully understand the behaviour of the damper. If damper performance (or interactions with other components) cannot be fully assessed during the design development phase, key issues may become known too late in the development process. Thus a deeper understanding of the processes of experimentally characterising and simulating torque converter dampers is required. This thesis describes the development of an arc spring torque converter damper simulation, including the gathering of the experimental data required to validate the simulation. The simulation is used to draw conclusions on the impact of excitation signal form on damper behaviour, leading to new knowledge on the signals required to experimentally characterise a damper. In this thesis a methodology for (and implementation of) the characterisation of torque converter dampers is detailed. It was found that existing available technologies (e. g. fired engines, electric dynamometers) were either too inflexible or prohibitively expensive; thus a novel high frequency mechanical pulsation generator was developed. This solution was developed from a 4 cylinder motored diesel engine; the cylinders are filled with compressed air and the crankshaft driven using an electric dynamometer. Simulation and experimental data has confirmed that mean torque can be controlled using the input dynamometer, with the compressed air producing fluctuations of up to 900 Nm amplitude. However, it was found that the frequency of the output pulsations varied from a fired engine; this is due to reactions between the pulsation generator and the stiffness and inertias of other components on the rig. A review of the performance of the novel pulsation generation concept against other damper excitation methods was also conducted. It was determined that fired engines and electric motors are more suitable for durability testing; the flexibility of the electric motors and the low running costs of the pulsation generator suit damper performance tests. The second phase of this project was to develop a simulation of a two-stage arc spring turbine damper. This damper consists of three inertias, separated by two spring sets; the <b>outer</b> <b>spring</b> set has 3 individual arc springs, while the inner spring set has 5 nested pairs. The principle of conservation of angular momentum is applied to each of the three inertias in order to calculate their individual accelerations. This method is also applied when calculating the acceleration and movement of the springs; the arc springs are discretised into mass and (massless) spring segments. Two features not previously seen in literature are included in the simulation; hardstops and nested springs. The physical hardstops limit the movement of the spring sets (relative movements of the inertias). In this study, the nested springs were simulated as a pair of parallel springs, rather than as a single stiffer arc spring; this is due to the friction that occurs between the springs (the inner race of the larger spring forms the housing for the inner spring). These two features highlight the need for hardware examination before simulation development; disassembling the hardware also allows the location of hardstops (and other features) to be measured rather than relying on the test data. Once a damper simulation was designed, a methodology for simulation parameterisation was required; parameterisation is the process of improving simulation performance through iterations of estimated parameters. The simulated damper was excited using sampled experimental data; to maximise parameterisation process efficiency, each time a parameter change was made, a set of key test points were selected in order to assess simulation performance change. It is not recommended that single test points be examined individually; parameter changes may improve simulation performance at one test point but have an adverse reaction at another. A clear causal relationship between simulation timestep and accuracy (as well as simulation run time) was found; a link between the number of discretised segments and simulation accuracy (and run time) was also confirmed. It was determined that 8 segments was optimal for the inner springs and 18 outer segments offered the best balance between computing power and simulation time. A variety of methods for analysing damper (and simulation) performance are presented in this thesis; it was found that for the 2. 5 bar torque curve experimental data set the simulation performs excellently, with on average less than 5 % error. Overall torque error is less than 10 % across the tested speed range (900 to 2800 rpm), with mean torque differences between simulated and tested order magnitudes of less than 5 Nm. It has been determined that hysteresis loops are not an accurate predictor of real-world damper performance; while they can approximate general trends, they do not cover the normal operating condition. In the final phase of this thesis, the validated simulation has been used to investigate excitation signal, areas of poor damper performance and the link between speed and damper stiffness. By subjecting the simulation to a variety of sinusoidal input signals, it was established that if a sinusoidal signal approximates the 3 most dominant frequencies in a real signal, the damper will behave in a representative manner. Additional orders that have lower frequencies than the dominant order will have a greater impact on the attenuation behaviour of the damper; the effect of additional orders on attenuation behaviour is also linked to their magnitude (relative to the dominant order). A methodology for efficient damper mapping is proposed; the key aim is to produce a dataset that will minimise the length of the parameterisation process while capturing key damper behaviours. It was found that the magnitude of the torque oscillations used to excite the damper is linked to parameter adjustment impact, though this relationship is not linear for all parameters; an approximate level of 300 Nm should be used for excitation. Parameters such as spring stiffness and plate inertias are more likely to have a substantial impact on damper performance at frequencies below 70 Hz; friction tuning factors are impacted more by magnitude changes at frequencies above 150 Hz. It has been demonstrated that while speed can have an effect on magnification ratio, this effect is far less significant at mean torques above the knee point and when sinusoidal input magnitude is kept at or above 300 Nm. It was concluded that neither engine speed nor precise excitation magnitude must be replicated in order to predict approximate performance. During the investigation into areas of poor damper performance, it was confirmed that the trend of increasing magnification ratio with lower frequencies (< 30 Hz) seen in experimental data continued. Simulation testing above 140 Hz revealed that there is not a linear relationship between increased frequency and increased magnification ratio; these areas of magnification ratio spikes are likely due to system resonances. It has been confirmed that while fluctuation magnitude does impact magnification ratio, fluctuation frequency has the most significant (dominant) impact. Finally, the effect of speed on apparent damper stiffness was investigated for both hysteresis loop testing and across a range of <b>outer</b> <b>spring</b> vibration angles; it was confirmed that increasing speed does result in non-homogeneous compression of the springs. It was established that while speed can have an effect on spring stiffness, this effect will vary significantly depending on the movement range (vibration angle) of the spring. The largest increase in spring stiffness with speed is seen when segments of the spring become inactive (cease to move), hence why the effect of speed is more substantial at vibration angle of < 10 °. The simulation was used to confirm the theories linking speed and stiffness found in the literature; higher speeds increase frictional forces, slowing damper segments, resulting in reduced movement. The findings of this thesis are relevant to damper simulation and testing engineers; by expanding knowledge of damper behavioural responses to high frequency excitation signals, as well as demonstrating an effective method for producing validated damper simulations, it is hoped that the vehicle design process will be more efficient and damper modifications more effective...|$|E

50|$|The modern going barrel, {{invented in}} 1760 by Jean-Antoine Lépine, {{produces}} a constant force by simply using a longer mainspring than needed, and coiling it under {{tension in the}} barrel.

Mathematically, the tension creates a 'flat' section in the spring's 'torque curve' (see graph at right) and only this flat section is used. In addition, the outer end of the spring is often given a 'reverse' curve, so it has an 'S' shape. This stores more tension in the <b>spring's</b> <b>outer</b> turns where it is available {{toward the end of}} the running period.

The density of the inner layer can be set different from {{the density of the}} outer layer; the motion of the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer.

The construction of the double-layered elastic object is closer to the real tissue's physical structure. The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well illustrated in environments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling, and floor. The collision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty method and the motion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential Equation computation.

In karst environments in Grobogan District, Central Java Province, formed Urang Cave, with an interesting endokarst phenomenon. This study aims to do zoning district Urang Cave as tourist sites. The research method is using contour maps as a base map of Urang Cave karst environment geomorphological mapping. Geomorphological data processing is using ArcView GIS 3. 3 program. Land use map refers to RBI, scale 1 : 25. 000. Geomorphological analysis refers to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources No. 1456. K/ 20 /MEM/ 2000, and petrography. Each development zone is analyzed its geophysical environmental element, then set scoring and value summation. For comprehensive environmental element analysis, chemical analysis of rocks, and water-soil chemistry. In reference to Minister of Energy Mineral Resource decrees No. 1456 /K/ 20 /MEM/ 2000, Urang Cave zoning defined into 3 (three) zone, as follow: the Protected Zone, Cultivation Zone 1, and Cultivation Zone 2. Protected Zone, consists of Urang Cave tunnel/hallway with a unique spheleothem in it. This zone as a cave tracking site tourism, potential to produce karst water as a decent drinking water while maintaining hardness. Cultivation Zone 1 is spreading about 200 m in distance from <b>outer</b> appearance of <b>spring</b> around the cave hallway. In this zone mining of cave sediments may be done in the inactive form caves, without changing the state of the existing major exokarst morphology. Cultivation Zone 2, an outer zone, located farthest from the tunnel/hallway Urang Cave. Utilization of this zone as a limestone mining quarry, although only on a small scale...|$|R
40|$|Diapterus rhombeus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} fish species in the Sepetiba bay, which is a 520 km² semi-closed coastal area in Southeastern Brazil. The size and distribution of this species have been described in order to assess the use of the area as a rearing ground in both spatial and temporal (seasonal) dimensions. A fish sampling program was conducted monthly by using an otter trawl between October 1998 and September 1999, in three bay zones (outer, middle and inner), defined according to depth and salinity gradient. Highly significant differences were found for CPUEs (number and biomass) among seasons and zones. Size ranged from 50 to 230 mm TL, and three size-groups were defined according to a maturation scale (n = 1435) : 1 - immature ( 100 mm TL). Immature and L 50 individuals were more abundant (number and biomass) during Autumn in the inner zone, while adults (L 100) predominated during Summer in the outer zone. Evidences of movements of young-of-the-year (50 - 90 mm TL) individuals from the inner to the outer zone were detected as they reach larger sizes (180 mm TL) in the second year of life. Condition (k) was higher in larger sized individuals in the <b>outer</b> zone during <b>Spring,</b> when they are apt to start the reproductive process. Two cohorts were detected according to modal progression: the first (smaller size) showing faster growth than the second, evidencing a slower growth rate as they reach larger size. Distinct size classes occupying different bay zones suggest that the age-groups optimize their coexistence by partitioning the available resources, avoiding intra-specific competition...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{partial pressure}} of CO 2 (pCO 2) dynamics {{in the inner}} and outer Loire estuary (coastal margin of north-western Europe) over an annual cycle (2009 - 2010) using a comprehensive dataset of pCO 2, dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) and ancillary data collected during four cruises conducted in different seasons. In the inner estuary, pCO 2 exhibited very large spatial and inter-seasonal amplitudes (from 294 to 2744 μatm) mainly driven by strong heterotrophic respiration from spring to fall, thermodynamic effects in summer and mixing during winter floods. In the <b>outer</b> estuary, during <b>spring</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} during summer, the large extension of the plume resulted in stratification of the water column and autotrophic processes induced pCO 2 below atmospheric equilibrium in the plume's surface waters (mean values of - 65 μatm compared to the atmosphere). During fall, mixing with inner estuary waters influenced by heterotrophic processes induced pCO 2 above atmospheric equilibrium (mean values of + 86 μatm) in the very restricted and shallow plume. During winter floods, thermodynamics as well as episodic winter phytoplankton blooms were responsible for pCO 2 values below atmospheric equilibrium in the plume (mean values of - 42 μatm), whereas the adjacent surface waters were at equilibrium with the atmosphere. Air-sea CO 2 fluxes in the inner estuary ranged from 41 ± 4 mmol m - 2 d - 1 during spring to 140 ± 18 mmol m - 2 d - 1 during fall, compared to an outer estuary minimum of - 9. 0 ± 1. 0 mmol m - 2 d - 1 during spring and maximum of 7. 7 ± 1. 1 mmol m - 2 d - 1 during fall. Integrated over their respective areas, annual CO 2 emissions from the inner estuary of 3. 2 10 9 mol C yr - 1 were offset by the annual CO 2 sink of - 17. 9 10 9 mol C yr - 1 from the plume alone. Based on four seasonal cruises, it seems that because of its large size during spring and to a lesser extent during winter, the Loire plume significantly impacted estimates of air-sea CO 2 fluxes at a regional scale. Comparison with other major estuarine plumes in diverse continental shelf zones seems to indicate a predominance of CO 2 sinks in these systems suggesting that other estuarine plumes might counteract inner estuary CO 2 emissions at seasonal to annual level...|$|R
