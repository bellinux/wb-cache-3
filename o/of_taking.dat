40|$|Takings {{jurisprudence}} {{has long}} been and remains, {{in the opinion of}} many, a constitutional quagmire, with {{little in the way of}} predictable results or coherent principles. The Supreme Court itself has acknowledged the largely ad hoc nature <b>of</b> its <b>takings</b> analysis, emphasizing the fact-sensitive nature <b>of</b> <b>takings</b> decisions and its reluctance to articulate precise formulae in this area. Moreover, although articulating a variety of standards and tests, such as “investment-backed expectations” and “economic viability,” the Court has not clearly stated their relation to each other or their precise meanings. This has led a number of commentators to lament these unclear standards, labeling this area of law an unworkable “muddle,” a “jumble of * 2 confusing holdings,” an “enduring legal dilemma,” and a state of “doctrinal and conceptual disarray. ” What is sometimes lost in the lament, however, is the degree to which the Court has established, with some clarity, three distinct types <b>of</b> <b>takings</b> concerns and three analytical approaches in resolving them. Thus, despite continued ambiguity on some details, the “big picture” <b>of</b> <b>takings</b> jurisprudence is shaping up rather nicely and in a way that is quite sensible. This has been particularly true in the last several decades, where in a number of decisions the Court has fleshed out the broad outlines of differing levels <b>of</b> <b>takings</b> review. Although these decisions are often seen as reflecting a growing protection of property rights, they in fact establish several distinct levels of protection depending upon the type <b>of</b> <b>takings</b> issue posed. As a practical matter, these distinct approaches provide heightened protection for landowners when autonomy and fairness concerns are present, but provide substantial latitude for government to regulate property for environmental and other purposes...|$|R
40|$|When {{considering}} applications <b>of</b> the <b>Takings</b> Clause to appropriations {{of interest}} and principal, courts rely on the quaintly expressed 18 th century rule that 2 ̆ 2 interest shall follow the principal, as the shadow the body. 2 ̆ 2 Since that time, an elaborate body <b>of</b> regulatory <b>takings</b> law has evolved. As part of this evolution, courts delved into questions <b>of</b> temporary <b>takings</b> <b>of</b> property, occurring both {{as a result of}} outright physical occupation and through regulatory limitations. This Note argues that courts should reject the old 2 ̆ 2 interest follows principal 2 ̆ 2 rule and adopt the modern temporary takings rules. In particular, this Note explores the results of such a change in three cases involving prisoners alleging an unconstitutional taking when their interest was deposited in accounts with the Departments of Corrections while incarcerated. Adopting a temporary takings analysis would not only bring consistency between the analyses <b>of</b> <b>takings</b> <b>of</b> money and <b>takings</b> <b>of</b> land, but also offer a more consistent outcome within this group of prisoner interest cases...|$|R
