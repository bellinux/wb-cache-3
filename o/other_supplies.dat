5|$|After several {{damaging}} air attacks, {{the naval}} surface combatants from both America and Japan {{withdrew from the}} battle area without either side securing a clear victory. However, the U.S. and its allies gained tactical and strategic advantage. Japan's losses were greater and included dozens of aircraft and their experienced aircrews. Also, Japanese reinforcements intended for Guadalcanal were delayed and eventually delivered by warships rather than transport ships, giving the Allies more {{time to prepare for}} the Japanese counteroffensive and preventing the Japanese from landing heavy artillery, ammunition, and <b>other</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|E

5|$|After several false {{starts in}} early September, the Continental Army {{established}} a siege around Fort St. Jean. Beset by illness, bad weather, and logistical problems, they established mortar batteries that {{were able to}} penetrate into the interior the fort, but the defenders, who were well-supplied with munitions, but not food and <b>other</b> <b>supplies,</b> persisted in their defence, believing the siege would be broken by forces from Montreal under General Guy Carleton. On October 18, the nearby Fort Chambly fell, and on October 30, an attempt at relief by Carleton was thwarted. When word of this {{made its way to}} St. Jean's defenders, combined with a new battery opening fire on the fort, the fort's defenders capitulated, surrendering on November 3.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{constant}} bombing sorties, Potez 25 and Breguet 19 aircraft {{were also}} used for daily supply missions to the besieged army garrison at Rogatica. They would land under fire at a small improvised grass landing strip, unloading ammunition and <b>other</b> <b>supplies</b> while keeping their engines running and taking off as soon as was possible. On 23 March, a ZNDH Potez 25 was shot down by the Partisans and the crew were killed. Three days later an Avia Fokker F.9 was damaged whilst dropping ammunition to Rogatica but managed to return to base safely. As {{a result of the}} determined re-supply effort by the ZNDH, the Rogatica garrison succeeded in holding out until relieved by German-NDH forces on 17 April.|$|E
5|$|Baum's {{detachment}} was a mixed {{force of}} 700 composed primarily of Hessians but also including {{small amounts of}} dismounted Brunswick dragoons, Canadians, Loyalists, and Indians. He was sent by Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area for horses, draft animals, provisions, and <b>other</b> <b>supplies.</b> Believing the town to be only lightly defended, Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 militiamen were stationed there. After a rain-caused standoff, Stark's men enveloped Baum's position, taking many prisoners, and killing Baum. Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up, and the battle restarted, with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann's reinforcements with heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|Britain's hold on Gibraltar was {{reconfirmed}} in 1729 by the Treaty of Seville, which satisfied neither side; the Spanish {{had wanted}} Gibraltar returned, while the British disliked {{the continuation of}} the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Utrecht. Spain responded the following year by constructing a line of fortifications across {{the upper end of the}} peninsula, cutting off Gibraltar from its hinterland. The fortifications, known to the British as the Spanish Lines, and to Spain as La Línea de Contravalación (the Lines of Contravallation), were later to give their name to the modern town of La Línea de la Concepción. Gibraltar was effectively blockaded by land but was able to rely on trade with Morocco for food and <b>other</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{reaction}} to the losses suffered by Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer's unit at the Battle of the Little Big Horn in 1876 was shock and dismay at {{the failure of the}} Peace Policy. Grant blamed Custer wholly for the defeat stating that the sacrifice of troops was unnecessary. The Indian appropriations measure of August 1876 marked the end of Grant's Peace Policy. The Sioux were given the choice of either selling their lands in the Black Hills for cash or not receiving government gifts of food and <b>other</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1525, {{after the}} Spanish {{conquest of the}} Aztec Empire, Hernán Cortés led an {{expedition}} to Honduras over land, cutting across the Itza kingdom {{in what is now}} the northern Petén Department of Guatemala. His aim was to subdue the rebellious Cristóbal de Olid, whom he had sent to conquer Honduras, but Cristóbal de Olid had set himself up independently on his arrival in that territory. Cortés had 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and <b>other</b> <b>supplies.</b> He also had with him 600 Chontal Maya carriers from Acalan.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{two parallel}} supply chains with interacting demand streams. Each supply chain consists of one supplier and one retailer. The two demand streams are jointly described with a vector autoregressive time-series {{process in which}} they interact and their respective innovation errors correlate contemporaneously. For each supply chain, we develop insights into when and how much the supplier and the retailer can improve on their forecasting accuracy if the external demand history of the <b>other</b> <b>supply</b> chain is utilized. When this external demand history is not available or made available after a time lag, we develop a partial process and a delayed process to characterize the demand structure that the retailer can recover from the available demand histories. Our {{results show that the}} external demand history of the <b>other</b> <b>supply</b> chain always helps the retailer make better forecasts when demand streams interact; however, the enhanced information alters the retailer’s order process, which may produce larger forecasting errors for the supplier. Conditions are established for the supplier to benefit from the external demand history of the <b>other</b> <b>supply</b> chain...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasingly}} open {{international environment}} {{is a great}} challenge for enterprises {{and at the same}} time brings not only many opportunities, but also much jeopardy. Traditional business practice does not comply with quickly changing customers’ demands, and has the target of maximizing the income of separate functions and minimizing their costs. Often those two goals are achieved, but to the damage of <b>other</b> <b>supply</b> chain participants. Supply chain management emphasises the key issue for all its participants to compose the supply chain as a whole, conquering <b>other</b> <b>supply</b> chains instead of competing among themselves. The enterprise success is related to and dependent on the success of its supply chain...|$|R
5|$|In 1980 AFL–CIO President Lane Kirkland {{appointed}} Kahn {{to organize}} the AFL–CIO's support of Solidarity. The AFL–CIO sought approval in advance from Solidarity's leadership, to avoid jeopardizing their position with unwanted or surprising American help. Politically, the AFL–CIO supported the twenty-one demands of the Gdansk workers, by lobbying to stop further U.S. loans to Poland unless those demands were met. Materially, the AFL–CIO established the Polish Workers Aid Fund. By 1981 it had raised almost $300,000, which was used to purchase printing presses and office supplies. The AFL–CIO donated typewriters, duplicating machines, a minibus, an offset press, and <b>other</b> <b>supplies</b> requested by Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|Lee gave strict {{orders for}} his army to {{minimize}} any negative {{impacts on the}} civilian population. Food, horses, and <b>other</b> <b>supplies</b> were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with Confederate money were not well received. Various towns, most notably York, Pennsylvania, were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern African Americans. A few of them were escaped fugitive slaves, but most were freemen; all were sent south into slavery under guard.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July 1942, Mihailović sent a {{telegram}} to the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{asking them to}} publicly denounce Ljotić, Nedić and the openly collaborationist Chetnik leader Kosta Pećanac as traitors. The Yugoslav government-in-exile responded by doing so publicly over BBC Radio. In October, Ljotić was forced to withdraw his two representatives in the Serbian puppet government {{in order to avoid}} being held responsible for the unpopular and difficult economic measures and food policies enacted by Nedić that month. With the surrender of Italy in September 1943, Montenegrin Chetnik commander Pavle Đurišić established ties with Ljotić.
