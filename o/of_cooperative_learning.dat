5000|$|Cooperative {{learning}} {{is becoming more}} and more popular within the American education system. It is almost uncommon not to have some cooperative learning elements within a collage class. However, it is not uncommon to hear students expressing negative opinions regarding cooperative learning. Why is this? Feichtner and Davis put it elegantly by stating, [...] "entirely too many students are leaving the classroom experiencing only the frustrations <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>learning</b> and not the numerous benefits possible through team based effort". One of the main flaws that we see with previous research is that the research is almost always done from the perspective of the instructor.

40|$|Master of EducationThis {{research}} investigates, describes and {{analyzes the}} process <b>of</b> implementing <b>cooperative</b> <b>learning</b> instructional strategies in a non-academic educational institution. The investigation took place through six case studies involving unqualified teachers from two Sunday School institutions {{run on a}} weekly basis by the Christian Coptic Orthodox Church in Melbourne, Australia. The research uses these case studies and cross-case analysis to examine the process of change that non-academic teachers undergo in the progress <b>of</b> implementing <b>cooperative</b> <b>learning.</b> The study broadly found that non-academic teachers who predominantly conducted teacher-centered learning in a whole class setting were competently able to implement active and <b>cooperative</b> <b>learning</b> in their classrooms after training, support and practice within a four month period. They went through three main change cycles: confusion, practice and competence. Further the study found that non-academic teachers planned to maintain <b>cooperative</b> <b>learning</b> in their classrooms and expand its use in their schools. The significance of this study therefore resides primarily in its approach to this unique work <b>of</b> implementing <b>cooperative</b> <b>learning</b> in non-academic educational institutions by non-academic teachers.

50|$|Cooperative Learning {{has many}} {{limitations}} {{that could cause}} the process to be more complicated than first perceived. Sharan (2010) describes the constant evolution <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>learning</b> as a threat. Because cooperative learning is constantly changing, {{there is a possibility}} that teachers may become confused and lack complete understanding of the method. The fact that cooperative learning is such a dynamic practice means that it can not be used effectively in many situations. Also teachers can get into the habit of relying on cooperative learning as a way to keep students busy. While cooperative learning will consume time, the most effective application <b>of</b> <b>cooperative</b> <b>learning</b> hinges on an active instructor. Teachers implementing cooperative learning may also be challenged with resistance and hostility from students who believe that they are being held back by their slower teammates or by students who are less confident and feel that they are being ignored or demeaned by their team.|$|E
