5|$|Temperatures {{during summer}} {{generally}} reach {{a maximum of}} 40°C and a minimum of 26.3°C, although temperatures up to 42°C are not uncommon. Winter temperatures range between 29.6°C and 18°C. A study based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> available with the Indian Meteorological Department on Madurai {{over a period of}} 62 years indicate rising trend in atmospheric temperature over Madurai city, attributed to urbanisation, growth of vehicles and industrial activity. The maximum temperature of 42°C for the decade of 2001 – 2010 was recorded in 2004 and in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In late September 1996, a {{cold front}} stalled over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, {{producing}} {{an area of}} convection. The thunderstorms were possibly related to the same tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Hernan in the eastern Pacific Ocean. A low pressure area formed in the Bay of Campeche by October2, although initially upper-level conditions did not favor tropical cyclogenesis. The convection became more persistent on October3 and gradually became better organized. On October4, classifications based on the Dvorak technique began, and later that day the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> from the flight, {{it is estimated that}} Tropical Depression Ten formed at 1800UTC that day off the northeast coast of Mexico. During its formative stages, the depression interacted with a ridge near the Great Lakes to produce strong winds across the Gulf Coast of the United States. With weak steering currents, the depression moved slowly to the northeast, and initially, wind shear prevented further organization. On October6, a strong trough caused the system to accelerate to the east-northeast. The storm's west to east motion across the Gulf of Mexico was unusual although not unprecedented.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} weakened {{slightly over}} land before emerging into the Straits of Florida and re-intensifying. On October 5, it {{turned to the}} northeast while remaining southeast of the Florida mainland, although the strongest winds remained over water. Early on October 6 while the hurricane was moving through the Bahamas, a ship reported a pressure of , although it was unknown if {{it was in the}} center or the periphery of the storm. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>data,</b> the maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125 mph (205 km/h), although the ship estimated winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). The storm maintained peak winds for about 18 hours, after which it weakened while accelerating to the northeast. After passing to the west of Bermuda on October 7, the hurricane became extratropical the next day while still maintaining hurricane-force winds. The storm brushed the coast of Nova Scotia before it was last noted approaching another extratropical storm on October 9 to the south of Atlantic Canada.|$|E
