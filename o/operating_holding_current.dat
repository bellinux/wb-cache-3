2500|$|In a {{conventional}} thyristor, {{once it has}} been switched on by the gate terminal, the device remains latched in the on-state (i.e. does not need a continuous supply of gate current {{to remain in the}} on state), providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current (IL). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls below the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> (IH). In normal working condition the latching current is always greater than <b>holding</b> <b>current.</b> In the above figure IL [...] has to come above the IH on y-axis since IL>IH.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the most}} basic of {{circuits}}, if the current falls below the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> even briefly, the circuit is turned 'OFF' (becomes blocked). However, complex circuits and devices may have different delays built-in between the time the current falls below this level and the time the device turns 'OFF'. Whether a device turns 'ON' when current is restored is a design issue. The current necessary to restore the circuit to the 'ON' state, called the [...] "threshold current" [...] (See threshold voltage), may be much greater than the <b>holding</b> <b>current,</b> or only very slightly more. Nevertheless, where the device is designed to turn back 'ON' upon restoration of the current and where the device is running at or about the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> level, slight variations in the current can cause flicker as the device cycles 'OFF' and 'ON'. If flicker is undesirable, it can be reduced by the use of capacitors or other circuits, on the other hand, flicker can be used to measure small events as in a Geiger-Müller tube.|$|R

50|$|When {{power is}} removed, the heating {{due to the}} <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> will stop and the PPTC device will cool. As the device cools, it regains its {{original}} crystalline structure and returns to a low resistance state where it can <b>hold</b> the <b>current</b> as specified for the device. This cooling usually takes a few seconds, though a tripped device will retain a slightly higher resistance for hours, slowly approaching the initial resistance value. The resetting will often not take place even if the fault alone has been removed with the power still flowing as the operating current may be above the <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> of the PPTC. The device may not return to its original resistance value; it will most likely stabilize at a significantly higher resistance (up to 4 times initial value). It could take hours, days, weeks or even years for the device {{to return to a}} resistance value similar to its original value, if at all.|$|R

When B 16 is voltageclamped near resting membrane potential, bath-applied ELH induces a prolonged inward shift in <b>holding</b> <b>current.</b> The ELHinduced inward current is not due to a decrease in the transient, the delayed, or the calcium-activated potassium currents. Current-voltage measurements, along with ion substitution and channel-blocking experiments, indicate that ELH primarily induces or increases a voltage-dependent slow inward current carried by sodium. Serotonin also causes a prolonged inward shift in <b>holding</b> <b>current</b> in B 16. Like ELH, 5 -HT induces or enhances the voltage-dependent inward current carried by sodium. In addition...|$|R
