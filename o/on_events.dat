5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{unsuccessful}} conference in Persia, Tiribazus returned to Susa to report <b>on</b> <b>events,</b> and a new general, Struthas, was sent out to take command. Struthas pursued an anti-Spartan policy, prompting the Spartans to order their commander in the region, Thibron, to attack him. Thibron successfully ravaged Persian territory for a time, but was killed along with a number of his men when Struthas ambushed one of his poorly organized raiding parties. Thibron was later replaced by Diphridas, who raided more successfully, securing a number of small successes and even capturing Struthas's son-in-law, but never achieved any dramatic results.|$|E
40|$|In this work, we have {{described}} the Brans-Dicke theory of gravity and given a particular solution by choosing a power law form of scalar field ϕ and constant ω. If we assume first law and entropy formula on apparent horizon then we recover Friedmann equations. Next, assuming first law of thermodynamics, the validity conditions of GSL <b>on</b> <b>event</b> horizon are presented. Also without use first law, if we impose the entropy relation on the horizon, then we also obtain the condition of validity of GSL <b>on</b> <b>event</b> horizon. The validity of GSL completely depends {{on the model of}} BD scalar field solutions. We have justified that on the apparent horizon the two process are equivalent, but <b>on</b> the <b>event</b> horizon they are not equivalent. If first law is valid <b>on</b> the <b>event</b> horizon then GSL may be satisfied in BD solution, but if first law is not satisfied then GSL is not satisfied in BD solution. So first law always favours GSL <b>on</b> <b>event</b> horizon. In our effective approach, the first law and GSL is always satisfied in apparent horizon, which do not depend on BD theory of gravity.

40|$|The present work {{deals with}} four {{alternative}} formulation of Bekenstein system <b>on</b> <b>event</b> horizon in $f(R) $ gravity. While thermodynamical laws holds in universe bounded by apparent horizon, these laws break down <b>on</b> <b>event</b> horizon. With alternative formulation of thermodynamical parameters (temperature and entropy), thermodynamical laws hold <b>on</b> <b>event</b> horizon in Einstein Gravity. With this motivation, we extend {{the idea of}} generalised Hawking temperature and modified Bekenstein entropy in homogeneous and isotropic model of universe <b>on</b> <b>event</b> horizon and examine whether thermodynamical laws hold in f(R) gravity. Specifically, we examine and compare validity of generalised second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) and thermodynamical equilibrium (TE) in four alternative modified Bekenstein scenarios. As Dark energy is a possible dominant candidate for matter in the univerese and Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) can give effective description of f(R) gravity, so matter in the universe is taken as in the form interacting HDE. In {{order to understand the}} complicated expressions, finally the above laws are examined from graphical representation using three Planck data sets and it is found that generalised/modified Hawking temperature has a crucial role in making perfect thermodynamical system.

5|$|The Penelopiad is a novella by Margaret Atwood. It was {{published}} in 2005 {{as part of the}} first set of books in the Canongate Myth Series where contemporary authors rewrite ancient myths. In The Penelopiad, Penelope reminisces on the events of the Odyssey, life in Hades, Odysseus, Helen of Troy, and her relationships with her parents. A Greek chorus of the twelve maids, whom Odysseus believed were disloyal and whom Telemachus hanged, interrupt Penelope's narrative to express their view <b>on</b> <b>events.</b> The maids' interludes use a new genre each time, including a jump-rope rhyme, a lament, an idyll, a ballad, a lecture, a court trial and several types of songs.|$|E
