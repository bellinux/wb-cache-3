The bioactivity of thisclass of materials, immersed in a real or simulated biological medium, is monitored bythe ability to form at its surface a layer of Ca-phosphate, which ought to crystallizein the form of either hydroxy-apatite (HA) or hydroxy-carbonate-apatite (HCA).

The detector {{is based on}} the well-established principle of electron diffraction from a W(001) single-crystal at a scattering energy of 103. 5 eV. Its special feature is that it can be operated at a high negative bias potential up to 10 kV, necessary to access the HAXPES range. The polarimeter is operated behind a large hemispherical analyzer (Scienta R- 4000). It was optimized for high transmission of the transfer optics. The exit plane of the analyzer contains a delay-line detector (20 mm dia.) for conventional multichannel intensity spectroscopy simultaneously with single-channel spin analysis. The performance of the combined setup is demonstrated by the first spin-resolved data for the valence-region of a FeCo functional layer of a tunneling device, buried beneath 3 nm of <b>oxidic</b> <b>material.</b> The well-structured spin polarization spectrum validates Spin-HAXPES in the valence energy range as powerful method for bulk electronic structure analysis.

At melt release temperatures up to 1400 {degrees}C (1673 K) only moderate thermal-type explosions occurred that produced bubbles with volumes up to approximately 1 L. Bubble growth intensified in the melt temperature range 1400 - 1525 {degrees}C (1673 [...] 1798 K) as threshold ignition of Al set in. In this range, {{one of the}} explosions emitted {{a flash of light}} and generated a bubble that grew very rapidly to approximately 14 L, broke through the water surface, and destroyed the test chamber. We attribute the behavior of this latter bubble, which grew as fast as one produced by the underwater firing of a 0. 6 g explosive detonator, to an ignition-type {{steam explosion}}. Aluminum oxides could not be detected visually in the debris recovered from either typical thermal-type or the ignition-type explosions, and only traces could be detected by X-ray diffraction.

The surface porosity of several oxides to ions is evaluated and the contribution of such porosity to the double layer properties determined by surface charge measurements. The oxides studied are B. D. H. precipitated silica, before and after heat treatment, rutile, goethite, hematite and amorphous ferric oxide. The surface porosity was evaluated using nitrogen adsorption for physical porosity, tritium exchange for surface hydration and dissolution for surface crystallinity. It is found that the surfaces of metal oxides may {{be divided into two}} categories; those that are porous to ions and those that are non-porous. Of those studied only the precipitated silica and the amorphous ferric oxide are porous. The porosity is probably due to an easily permeated layer of hydrolysed <b>oxidic</b> <b>material.</b> It does lead to exceptionally high surface charges. However the non-porous oxides also exhibit high surface charges so that while surface porosity may, in some cases, contribute to oxide double layer properties, it cannot be a general explanation of the high differential capacities observed. A site-binding model for non-porous oxide/aqueous electrolyte interfaces is introduced, in which it is proposed that the adsorbed counter ions form interfacial ion pairs with discrete charged surface groups. This model is used to calculate theoretical surface charge densities and potentials at the Outer Helmholtz Plane. The calculated values are consistent with experimental data for oxides provided a high value of the inner zone capacity is accepted. An explanation is provided for the difference between silica and most other oxides in terms of the dissociation constants of the surface groups. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with recently discovered high-pressure (HP) zirconium- and hafnium nitrides having cubic Th 3 P 4 -type structure, c-M 3 N 4 (M=Zr or Hf). These compounds belong to a rapidly growing group of new hard HP nitrides exhibiting advanced properties. The research was focused on (i) synthesis of macroscopic amounts of c-M 3 N 4, (ii) investigation of their solid state structure, composition and morphology and (iii) measurement of properties related to potential industrial applications of these compounds as hard wear-resistant materials. Nitrogen-rich starting materials for high-pressure high-temperature (HP/HT) synthesis of c-M 3 N 4, namely nanocrystalline powders of M 3 N 4 +x with distorted NaCl-type structure, had to be prepared in this work {{because they were not}} commercially available. They were obtained via HT ammonolysis of the corresponding metal dialkylamides, M[N(C 2 H 5) 2] 4, at moderate temperatures up to 873 K. Both, c-Zr 3 N 4 and c-Hf 3 N 4, were synthesized from the nanocrystalline M 3 N 4 +x powders applying a pressure of 12 GPa and a temperature of 1873 K using a multi-anvil HP-apparatus. The products were characterized using various techniques including powder XRD (Rietveld refinement), TEM, EPMA, SEM/EDX and Raman spectroscopy. In the case of zirconium nitride, formation of a single phase crystalline material was verified by both XRD and TEM. The presence of a small amount of oxygen in the sample, revealed by EPMA, suggested the formation of oxygen-bearing zirconium(IV) nitride (or oxynitride) having Th 3 P 4 -type structure, c-Zr 2. 86 (N 0. 88 O 0. 12) 4. The measured composition was found to correspond to the general formula Zr 3 -u(N 1 -uOu) 4 which fulfils the electrical neutrality condition. A high quality of the Rietveld structure refinement of the powder XRD data for c-Zr 2. 86 (N 0. 88 O 0. 12) 4 supported the above findings. Further, the assignment {{of the structure of the}} obtained oxygen-bearing zirconium nitride to the Th 3 P 4 -type was confirmed by Raman spectroscopic measurements. In contrast to zirconium nitride, a minor oxidation of the hafnium nitride sample led to formation of a mixture of oxygen-poor c-Hf 3 N 4 and an <b>oxidic</b> <b>material.</b> The latter was evident from the XRD, EPMA, and SEM/EDX measurements. A detailed analysis of the powder XRD patterns and Rietveld refinement suggested that the <b>oxidic</b> <b>material</b> is comprised of a mixture of the known γ-Hf 2 N 2 O and oI-HfO 2. The last part of the thesis concerned the investigation of the properties of the synthesized materials. The bulk moduli of c-Zr 2. 86 (N 0. 88 O 0. 12) 4 and c-Hf 3 N 4 were determined via their quasi-hydrostatic compression in a diamond anvil cell up to 45 GPa. The obtained values are B 0 = 219 GPa (B' 0 = 4. 4) and B 0 = 227 GPa (B' 0 = 5. 3) for c-Zr 2. 86 (N 0. 88 O 0. 12) 4 and c-Hf 3 N 4, respectively. The reduced elastic modulus, Er= 224 GPa, of porous c-Zr 2. 86 (N 0. 88 O 0. 12) 4 (volume fraction porosity of 0. 3) was measured using nanoindentation techniques. Combining B 0 and Er values, the lower limits of the shear modulus G 0 = 96 GPa, and of the Young’s modulus E 0 = 252 GPa were determined for the oxygen-bearing c-Zr 3 N 4. The nanoindentation hardness and Vickers microhardness, HV(1), of the porous zirconium nitride sample were measured to be 18 GPa and 12 GPa, respectively. Using a relation between hardness and volume fraction porosity, suggested in the literature, the HV(1) of the fully dense c-Zr 3 N 4 was estimated to exceed 25 GPa. The indentation fracture toughness of 3. 2 MPa m^ 1 / 2 for porous c-Zr 2. 86 (N 0. 88 O 0. 12) 4 was evaluated from the Vickers indentation cracks. The linear thermal expansion coefficient of the oxygen-bearing c-Zr 3 N 4 was found to increase from 6. 6 × 10 ^ 6 1 /K at room temperature to about 14 × 10 ^ 6 1 /K at 873 K. Onset of the material oxidation in air was observed at 773 K.

The presence of Mg noticeably enhanced the selectivity of Cu-based catalysts with respect to the hydrogenation of the carbonyl group relative to the favoured hydrogenation of the C=C bond. Moreover, the self-condensation of hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCNA) and the cross-condensation of hydrocinnamaldehyde with cinnamaldehyde were also observed especially when the basic sites of LDH structures are preponderant over hydrogenation species. Finally, all that reaction from CNA are of great interest for getting information about: (i) basic sites involved in condensation of CNA and HCNA; and (ii) active species for selective hydrogenation of CNA to cinnamyl alcohol (CNOL) which seem in strong interaction with the first ones. © 2003 Elsevier B.

We have demonstrated how inelastic neutron scattering can help us understand the interaction of H- 2 molecules with a binding site in a particular microporous material, Cu ZSM 5, and by implication of other similar materials. The H- 2 molecule is bound as a single species lying parallel with the surface. As H- 2 dosing increases, lateral interactions between the adsorbed H- 2 molecules become apparent. With rising temperature of measurement up to 70 K (the limit of our experiments), H- 2 molecules remain bound to the surface equivalent to a liquid or solid H- 2 phase. The implication is that hydrogen is bound rather strongly in Cu ZSM 5. Using the simple model for the anisotropic interaction to calculate the energy levels splitting, we found that the measured rotational constant of the hydrogen molecule is reduced as a consequence of adsorption by the Cu ZSM 5. From the decrease in total signal intensity with increasing temperature, we were able to observe the conversion of para-hydrogen into ortho-hydrogen at paramagnetic centres and so determine the fraction of paramagnetic sites occupied by hydrogen molecules, ca. 60 %.

40|$|The present article {{deals with}} pore structure-chemical {{composition}} interactions of new high surface area manganese based porous mixed oxides (MANPOs). These mixed <b>oxidic</b> <b>materials</b> were {{prepared by the}} dropwise addition of a solution containing metal nitrate into an acetonic solution containing the trinuclear complex of manganese [Mn 3 O(CH 3 COO) (6) (pyr) (3) ] ClO 4, which is water sensitive. The CPSM model (corrugated pore structure model) was employed in pore structure investigations of the MANPO materials containing Al, Fe, La, La + Ce, and La + Sr. Successful CPSM simulations of nitrogen sorption hysteresis loops for the MANPO solids enabled the evaluation of intrinsic pore size distributions (PSDs) and tortuosity factors. The latter vary over the approximate range tau(CPSM) approximate to 3. 0 - 5. 7 (i. e. tau(CPSM) 3 for materials containing Al or Fe and tau(CPSM) = 4. 7 - 5. 7 for those containing La, La + Ce, or La + Sr). These values are typical of porous catalysts and are higher than those reported for MCM- 41 materials (ca. tau(CPSM) = 1. 00 - 2. 35) and anodic aluminum oxide films (e. g. tau(CPSM) = 2. 60). The BET surface areas of the MANPO materials vary over the approximate range 180 - 900 m(2) /g, being higher than those reported for manganese oxide mesopore solids (MOMS), for example 59 - 170 m(2) /g. Intrinsic PSD predictions for the MANPO solids are of bimodal type with mean pore sizes systematically higher than the respective :mean hydraulic diameters. The addition of Fe and La + Ce caused a PSD shift toward the micropore region. Such MANPO materials are amorphous after heating to 500 C (except for the ones containing Fe) and extremely efficient catalysts for redox reactions such as lean de-NO,, applications and NO-CO conversion, probably because of the extremely high dispersion of separate nanophases into the solid...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{advanced}} nuclear fuel cycles including partitioning and transmutation (P&T), actinide co-conversion processes, such as sol-gel routes, {{play an important role}} to close the fuel cycle. During the heterogeneous recycling of minor actinides, <b>oxidic</b> <b>materials</b> containing uranium as main matrix are used as innovative nuclear fuels. Advanced fuel concepts replace the conventionally used pellets by particles (Sphere-pac or Vipac fuel) [1]. Particle fuels show good swelling behavior and can easily be fabricated. A suitable dustless preparation method is the internal gelation. This wet chemical method is a conversion process which transforms an aqueous colloidal solution sol into a solid gel. The internal gelation method was used for the particle synthesis during this work. Acid deficient uranyl nitrate (ADUN) and neodymium nitrate solutions were used as precursor, while urea acts as complexing agent and hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) as gelification agent [2]. Pure uranium oxide and uranium / neodymium oxide microspheres with a variable content of Nd (5 % - 40 %) were fabricated in the framework of the EU project ASGARD [3]. Neodymium is used as surrogate for trivalent actinides, such as americium. Mass- and size- characteristics of the prepared particles were studied. TG/DSC analyses were performed to investigate the thermal behavior. Finally the particles were thermally treated under reducing conditions at 1300 °C and 1600 °C. The products were investigated by the use of SEM/EDX and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Lattice parameter calculations were performed using the XRD data. The particles, treated at 1300 °C showed only one cubic phase, for the whole observed χ(Nd) range. The expected linear behavior according to Vegard’s rule was observed for compositions χ(Nd) ≤ 27. 59 %. The thermal treatment of the particles with compositions χ(Nd) ≥ 33. 49 % was repeated for 5 hours with a higher temperature (1600 °C). The expected linear trend could be confirmed and it could be demonstrated that equilibrium solid solutions of the UO 2 / Nd 2 O 3 system can be fabricated with the internal gelation synthesizing route.

Hydrolyse- und Kondensationsstudien werden mit dem Ziel der Aufklärung von Bildungsprozessen von Bismutoxidoclustern ausgehend von bismutnitrat- und bismutsilanolathaltigen Lösungen durchgeführt. Basierend auf polynuklearen Modellverbindungen wird durch deren Hydrolyse und anschließende thermische Behandlung die Darstellung von Nanopartikeln von verschiedenen Polymorphen des Bismut(III) -oxids erreicht.

Hydrolysis and condensation processes of bismuth nitrate {{as well as}} bismuth silanolates in solution were performed to provide an insight into the formation process of bismuth oxido clusters. Nanoparticles of different polymorphs of bismuth(III) oxide were obtained by hydrolysis, followed by annealing steps at temperatures of 370 °C and 600 °C starting from polynuclear bismuth compounds, respectively. The high reactivity of the as-prepared β-Bi 2 O 3 nanoparticles was used to synthesize sillenite-type compounds at rather low temperatures which are isostructural to metastable γ-Bi 2 O 3.

As alternative to the currently predominant closed reaction system a sparging gas reactor was identified, which offers a higher activity, selectivity and stability for homogeneous rhenium catalysts. Subsequently solid rhenium based supported catalysts were developed and examined towards activity and stability. Catalysts with <b>oxidic</b> support <b>materials</b> showed comparable activities to homogeneous reference catalysts, which could even be exceeded by utilizing activated carbons as catalyst support. Through a postsynthetic reduction step, the stability of the catalysts were improved. The highest stability was observed for ReOx/TiO 2,which showed constant activity and selectivity over seven consecutive runs. For the active catalysts the rhenium composition was determined to be approximately Re(0) :Re(IV) :Re(VII) = 1 : 1 : 2. The developed heterogeneous catalysts were applied in a continuously run fixed bed reactor for the first time. In contrast to the batch experiments, a moderate deactivation was observed over long time on streams, which could be attributed to multiple deactivation mechanisms. Through adjustments of the reaction parameters the deactivation could be reduced and the efficiency could be increased fourfold...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries, {{a number of}} process routes for {{extraction}} of metal values from an ore or other resources have been developed. These can generally be classifiedinto pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical or electrometallurgical routes. In the caseof the latter two processes, the reaction medium consists of liquid phase electrolytesthat can be aqueous, non-aqueous as well as molten salts. The present dissertationpresents the work carried out with two aspects of the above-mentioned electrolytes. First part is about the electrolyte solutions, {{which can be used}} in solvent extractionrelevant to many hydrometallurgical or chemical engineering processes; the secondpart is about the molten salts, which is often used in the electrometallurgical processesfor production of a variety of many kinds of metals or alloys, especially those that arehighly reactive. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the focus is given to the thermodynamics ofelectrolyte solutions. Since the non-ideality of high concentration solution is not wellsolved, a modified three-characteristic-parameter correlation model is proposed,which can calculate the thermodynamic properties of high concentration electrolytesolutions accurately. Model parameters for hundreds of systems are obtained foraqueous as well as non-aqueous solutions. Moreover, a new predictive method tocalculate the freezing point depression, boiling point elevation and vaporizationenthalpy of electrolyte solutions is also proposed. This method has been shown to be agood first approximation for the prediction of these properties. In the second part, a process towards the extraction of metal values from slags,low-grade ores and other <b>oxidic</b> <b>materials</b> such as spent refractories using molten saltsis presented. Firstly, this process is developed for the recovery of Cr, Fe values fromEAF slag as well as chromite ore by using NaCl-KCl salt mixtures in the laboratoryscale. The slags were allowed to react with molten salt mixtures. This extraction stepwas found to be very encouraging in the case of Cr and Fe present in the slags. Byelectrolysis of the molten salt phase, Fe-Cr alloy was found to be deposited on thecathode surface. The method is expected to be applicable even in the case of V, Mnand Mo in the waste slags. Secondly, this process was extended to the extraction of copper/iron from copperore including oxidic and sulfide ores under controlled oxygen partial pressures. Copper or Cu/Fe mixtures could be found on the cathode surface along with theemission of elemental sulphur that was condensed in the cooler regions of the reactor. Thus, the new process offers a potential environmentally friendly process routereducing SO 2 emissions. Furthermore, the cyclic voltammetric studies of metal ions(Cr, Fe, Cu, Mg, Mn) in (CaCl 2 -) NaCl-KCl salt melt were performed to understand the mechanisms, such asthe deposition potential, electrode reactions and diffusion coefficients, etc. In addition,another method using a direct electro-deoxidation concept(FFC Cambridge method),was also investigated for the electrolysis of copper sulfide. Sintered solid porouspellets of copper sulfide Cu 2 S and Cu 2 S/FeS were electrolyzed to elemental Cu, S andCu, Fe, S respectively in molten CaCl 2 -NaCl at 800 oC under the protection of Argongas. This direct electrolysis of the sulfide to copper with the emission of elementalsulfur also offers an attractive green process route for the treatment of copper ore. QC 2010071...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} of pure gold nanocrystals (“tips”) with H 2 O/CO gas mixtures was studied {{by means of}} video-field ion microscopy (FIM). While imaging with nano-scale resolution selected areas of the equivalent of ~ 200 atomic Au sites were analysed for their chemical composition using short field pulses and injecting respective ions into a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (pulsed field desorption mass spectrometry, PFDMS). At room temperature the exposure of a clean Au sample to water gas at 10 − 4 Pa, {{in the presence of}} an electric field of ~ 10 V/nm, led to water adsorption and formation of bright patterns in FIM. Additional exposure to CO gas at 5 × 10 − 3 Pa led to the removal of the water layer. This was associated with the occurrence of bright wave fronts which ignited simultaneously in several regions of the Au surface with no preference for a certain crystallographic surface plane. In some cases wave fronts were seen to collide resulting in more complicated patterns such as concentric rings. Surface areas free of water appeared with low brightness. The phenomena were completely reversible. PFDMS demonstrated water ions to be responsible for image formation. Surface hydroxyl was also detected mass spectrometrically and respective ion intensities decreased during the titration with CO. The results suggest that gold nanocrystals, in the absence of <b>oxidic</b> support <b>materials,</b> may be active in the reaction between water and CO at temperatures as low as 300 K and in the presence of an electric field of ~ 10 V/nm. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The present {{contribution}} {{reports on}} our results concerning {{the synthesis of}} different binary and ternary oxide systems by using hybrid materials as “composite” precursors. In the last years, we have developed and explored a valuable strategy to yield a very homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles of early metal transition oxide, MO 2 (M=Zr, Hf) inside a silica matrix. This route {{is based on the}} use of the sol-gel process to obtain organic-inorganic hybrid silica-based materials embedding the oxide precursors (Zr and/or Hf oxoclusters), which are then calcined at high (T> 500 °C) temperatures to give the desired oxides. The “precursor” hybrid materials are prepared by a modified sol-gel process, involving the copolymerisation of the organically modified oxozirconium or oxohafnium clusters (M 4 O 2 (OMc) 12 (M= Zr, Hf and OMc = methacrylate) with (methacryloxymethyl) triethoxysilane (MAMTES) or (methacryloxypropyl) trimethoxysilane (MAPTMS). Free radical copolymerisation of the 12 methacrylate groups of the oxoclusters with the methacrylate-functionalised siloxanes allows a stable anchoring of the oxoclusters to the silica network formed by the hydrolysis and condensation of the alkoxy groups. The sol-gel reactions of the two methacrylate-modified silanes methacryloxymethyltriethoxysilane and methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane were followed by using two independent time-resolved spectroscopic methods, viz., IR ATR and NMR with the aim to optimise their pre-hydrolysis times and consequently their use as precursors for hybrid materials. As mentioned, thermal treatment at high temperature of the hybrid yields a very homogeneous dispersion of ZrO 2 and/or HfO 2 nanoparticles in the silica matrix, since the molecular homogeneity of the starting hybrid is retained in the final mixed oxide. This route was successfully applied both to the synthesis of bulk materials and thin films characterised by different compositions (in term of M/Si molar ratios and M nature), heating route (conventional or microwave-assisted) and final temperature of annealing (from RT to 1100 °C). The first example of the ZrO 2 -HfO 2 -SiO 2 ternary oxide system was also prepared by this approach. The prepared systems, both in the form of hybrid materials as well as in the final form of binary or ternary oxides, were thoroughly characterised by a wide variety of analytical tools from a compositional, structural, morphological point of view. Moreover, in the case of the binary ZrO 2 - SiO 2 bulk materials, also the evolution under heating was followed by different methods. In particular, the composition of the hybrid as well as of the final <b>oxidic</b> <b>materials</b> was determined by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and elemental analysis (EA), whereas FT-IR and multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopies shed light on the changes occurring in the composition upon thermal heating and the degree of condensation of the silica network. The morphology and the microstructure of the hybrids and of the oxides were studied by nitrogen sorption and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy (XAFS) were used to follow the conversion of the amorphous oxides to the final materials consisting of crystalline zirconia or hafnia dispersed in amorphous silica. On selected systems, functional properties (surface reactivity, dielectric properties) were furthermore investigated. The obtained binary oxides were also used as substrates for functionalisation experiments with i) dialkycarbamates and ii) long alkyl chains to produce functional materials for catalysis and HPLC applications, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of atomic XAFS (AXAFS) to directly probe the catalytic performances {{of a set}} of supported metal oxide catalysts has been explored for the first time. For this purpose, a series of 1 wt % supported vanadium oxide catalysts have been prepared differing in their <b>oxidic</b> support <b>material</b> (SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Nb 2 O 5, and ZrO 2). Previous characterization results have shown that these catalysts contain the same molecular structure on all supports, i. e., a monomeric VO 4 species. It was found that the catalytic activity for the selective oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene increases in the order SiO 2 <Al 2 O 3 <Nb 2 O 5 <ZrO 2. The opposite trend was observed for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the absence of oxygen. Interestingly, the intensity of the Fourier transform AXAFS peak decreases in the same order. This can be interpreted by an increase in the binding energy of the vanadium valence orbitals when the ionicity of the support (increasing electron charge on the support oxygen atoms) increases. Moreover, detailed EXAFS analysis shows a systematic decrease of the V-Ob(-Msupport) and an increase of a the V-O(H) bond length, when going from SiO 2 to ZrO 2. This implies a more reactive OH group for ZrO 2, in line with the catalytic data. These results show that the electronic structure and consequently the catalytic behavior of the VO 4 cluster depend on the ionicity of the support oxide. These results demonstrate that AXAFS spectroscopy can be used to understand and predict the catalytic performances of supported metal oxide catalysts. Furthermore, it enables the user to gather quantitative insight in metal oxide support interactions...|$|R
