5000|$|The {{mail order}} side {{sustained}} major growth during the 1990s, {{with the birth}} of the Interstate Musician Drum Catalog in 1993, followed by Guitar/Bass and Keyboard/MIDI Catalogs, which eventually combined into a single catalog, but have since been discontinued. The school music catalog for band directors continued as well. A warehouse was added {{to the back of the}} store to handle this growing mail order business.The Cascio Music retail store gradually absorbed adjacent businesses to expand its <b>operational</b> and <b>floor</b> <b>space.</b> A major remodeling in 1997-1998 almost doubled the retail <b>floor</b> <b>space,</b> to 30000 sq ft. The warehouse in the back of the store was moved to a much larger, 46000 sq ft facility in Waukesha. The warehouse's removal in New Berlin allowed for another major retail expansion in the Drums, Guitar, and PA departments, including a separate acoustic guitar [...] "cabin," [...] a cymbal room, plus separate wind instrument tryout rooms.|$|R

S. energy consumption and energy-related CO 2 emissions, with <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> a major driver of building energy demands. In this work a consistent, vintage-disaggregated, annual long-term series of U. S. housing stock and residential <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> for 1891 - 2010 is presented. An {{attempt was made to}} minimize the effects of the incompleteness and inconsistencies present in the national housing survey data. Over the 1891 - 2010 period, <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> increased almost tenfold, from approximately 24, 700 to 235, 150 million square feet, corresponding to a doubling of <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> per capita from approximately 400 to 800 square feet. While population increased five times over the period, a 50 % decrease in household size contributed towards a tenfold {{increase in the number of}} housing units and <b>floor</b> <b>space,</b> while average <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> per unit remains surprisingly constant, as a result of housing retirement dynamics. In the last 30 years, however, these trends appear to be changing, as household size shows signs of leveling off, or even increasing again, while average <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> per unit has been increasing. GDP and total <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> show a remarkably constant growth trend over the period and total residential sector primary energy consumption and <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> show a similar growth trend over the last 60 years, decoupling only within the last decade...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{one method}} of modeling {{current and future}} market penetration of advanced lighting controls {{as a function of}} commercial <b>floor</b> <b>space.</b> We take advanced lighting controls to mean dimmers, photosensors, occupancy or motion sensors, multi-step switches, and timers. We initialize the model with commercial <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> data from the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey, accounting for renovation, demolition, and region. The <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> is then associated with the building code that was in effect during the construction or renovation year, providing a link between existing commercial <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> and its coverage by advanced lighting controls. We make assumptions about demolition, renovation, and compliance rates. We find that mandating full compliance with the current Federal building code would increase commercial <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> with automatic lighting shutoff from 78 % to 90 %...|$|R

40|$|Two {{studies were}} carried out over two 4 -week periods (week 6 to 10 {{post-weaning}} in Study 1 and week 12 to 16 post-weaning in Study 2) {{to determine the effects of}} <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> in the nursery and grow-finish periods on the growth performance of pigs. In both studies, subsequent growth performance at an equal <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> across treatment levels was also evaluated over a 2 -week period immediately following the <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> evaluation period. Both studies were conducted as randomized complete block designs (blocking factor = day of start of test) with 5 <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> treatment levels (0. 21, 0. 27, 0. 33, 0. 39, and 0. 44 m 2 /pig in Study 1; 0. 35, 0. 45, 0. 54, 0. 64, and 0. 73 m 2 /pig in Study 2). Treatment levels were selected to cover the range likely to be used under commercial conditions and were calculated to provide the same k values in both studies (i. e., 0. 019, 0. 025, 0. 030, 0. 035, and 0. 041 m 2 /BW 0. 67). The estimated weight at the midpoint of the <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> evaluation period (end of week 8 in Study 1 and week 14 in Study 2) was used to calculate the respective k values. All adjustment gates were moved to the back of the pens during the subsequent period, resulting in <b>floor</b> <b>spaces</b> of 0. 53 and 0. 73 m 2 /pig in Study 1 and 2, respectively. Study 1 consisted of 15 replicates with 40 pigs per pen for a total of 3, 000 pigs. Pens of pigs in Study 1 were reduced to groups of 29 pigs and re-allotted to Study 2 for a total of 2, 175 pigs in 15 replicates. During the <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> evaluation periods in Study 1 and 2, ADG was decreased (P 0. 05) in morbidity and mortality levels in the subsequent period of Study 2 or either period in Study 1. The results of these studies suggest that decreasing <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> can cause significant reductions in ADG, ADFI, and feed efficiency; however, feed efficiency can be improved by providing increased <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> subsequent to a <b>floor</b> <b>space</b> restriction...|$|R
