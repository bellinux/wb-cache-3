40|$|Abstract—This {{research}} {{presents the}} programmable logic devices- based islanding detection for grid connected inverter with under/over voltage and under/over frequency islanding detection algorithms. The design {{are based on}} the field programmable gate array (FPGA) and the complex programmable logic device (CPLD). The logic circuits inside PLDs chip are design, implementation, testing and debugging by software development without hardware modification. The prototypes of PLDs for islanding detection are monitor the grid voltage and grid frequency at the point of common coupling (PCC) between the grid connected inverter, the local load and the distribution transformer and processed the value of voltage and frequency for turned on – <b>off</b> <b>relay</b> between grid connected inverter and utility grid. The results of study, the prototypes can turn <b>off</b> <b>relay</b> when the voltage is change under 200 V or over 240 V and frequency is change under 48 Hz or over 52 Hz. The FPGA-based is operated faster and high capacity than CPLD-based but the cost of design is higher...|$|E
40|$|Recently Indonesia {{is one of}} the {{countries}} with a densely populated of population. Besides it, using of vehicles causes traffic jam in many cities, including Pekanbaru. Power outages be one of causers of traffic jam due to many traffic lights do not working properly. In this study, the authors designed a power supply that is able to keep the traffic lights on when electricity from National Electricity Company (PLN) is not active. In this case, there is addition of solar panels so the traffic light can be on for few hours during the supply of PLN is inactive. The used load is a prototype of smart traffic light (STL) 80 Watt under PLC control. Battery is used 12 V 7 Ah which filled by Solar Panel. When supply from PLN is <b>off,</b> <b>relay</b> works and the load source automatically switches to Battery. To increase output voltage of Solar Panel, Boost Converter is added to this design to gain 24 V. From switching time of PLN to battery take 0, 08 s, so the traffic lights have no chance to be inactive. This research works as framework well...|$|E

50|$|At the 2012 Short Course World Championships, Romano {{won four}} medals: two gold, one silver, and one bronze. On the first day, Romano led <b>off</b> the <b>relay</b> {{and had a}} split of 1:56.03 in the 4×200 free relay. Along with {{teammates}} Chelsea Chenault, Shannon Vreeland, and Allison Schmitt, they won {{with a time of}} 7:39.25. Romano earned her first individual medal with a silver in the 100-meter free on the third day of competition, finishing behind Germany's Britta Steffen with a 52.48. Later, she anchored the 4×100 medley relay to a bronze-medal-winning 3:51.43 with the fastest split in the field of 51.90. In Romano's last event, she led <b>off</b> the <b>relay</b> with a split of 52.86, and along with Jessica Hardy, Lia Neal, and Allison Schmitt, won the 4×100 free relay in 3:31.01, nearly two seconds ahead of second-place finisher Australia.|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{analyze the}} {{probabilistic}} cooperation of a full-duplex relay in a multiuser random-access network. The relay {{is equipped with}} on/off modes for the receiver and the transmitter independently. These modes are modeled as probabilities by which the receiver and the transmitter are activated. We provide analytical expressions {{for the performance of}} the relay queue, such as arrival and service rates, stability conditions, and the average queue size. We optimize the relay's operation setup to maximize the network-wide throughput while, simultaneously, we keep the relay's queue stable and minimize the consumed energy. Furthermore, we study the effect of the SINR threshold and the self-interference (SI) coefficient on the per-user and network-wide throughput. For low SINR threshold, we show under which circumstances it is beneficial to switch <b>off</b> the <b>relay</b> completely, or switch <b>off</b> the <b>relay's</b> receiver only.

50|$|Every time an {{electrical}} power device (for example: heaters, lamps, motors, transformers or similar power loads) turns on or <b>off,</b> its switch, <b>relay</b> or contactor transitions either from a closed {{to an open}} state (break arc) or from an open to a closed state (make arc & bounce arc), under load, {{an electrical}} arc occurs between the two contact points (electrodes) of the switch.
