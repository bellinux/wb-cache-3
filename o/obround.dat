5000|$|A {{stadium is}} a {{two-dimensional}} geometric shape constructed of a rectangle with semicircles at {{a pair of}} opposite sides. [...] Alternative names include discorectangle and <b>obround.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Bead probes {{are made}} from a very small [...] "beads" [...] of solder that fit atop of the PCB traces. They are {{manufactured}} using the same techniques as other solder features. Construction requires a hole to be opened in the solder mask, exposing the copper trace. This hole is sized to precisely control the amount of metal that forms the bead. Solder paste {{is applied to the}} location and reflowed. During reflow, solder flows and is drawn to the copper trace. Surface tension causes the bead to have a curved surface and rise above the solder mask, where it solidifies into a Bead Probe. The bead will be roughly <b>obround</b> in shape and may be 15-25 mils long. A properly constructed bead is the same width as the trace and just enough to clear the surrounding solder mask. The bead is then accessible for testing using a probe with a flat end, which can help compensate for the tolerance build up in the test fixture and PCB.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the work carried out for {{determination of stresses}} in an open ended pressure vessel of <b>obround</b> shape. In some situations, due to the limited space available, exit pipes are made of elliptical or <b>obround</b> shape. In this study, the stresses in the <b>obround</b> pressure vessel are determined using finite element method. The material of the vessel is aluminum alloy. Internal pressure {{is applied to the}} vessel. Software ‘ANSYS ’ is used for modeling & analysis purpose. Considering the symmetry about both axes, only quarter model is prepared. Firstly analysis of circular pressure vessel is done. The results of the circular vessel are validated by analytical solution. Then using the same type of element & mesh density, analysis of <b>obround</b> pressure vessel is done. During the study, different parameters were varied & their effect on the stresses was observed...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a summary of}} experiments that were performed by Fauske & Associates on the stability of vessel-spanning bubbles. The report by Fauske & Associates, An Experimental Study of the Stability of Vessel-Spanning Bubbles in Cylindrical, Annular, <b>Obround</b> and Conical Containers, is included in Appendix A. Results from the experiments confirm that the gravity yield parameter, Y{sub G}, correctly includes container size and {{can be applied to}} full-scale containers to predict the possibility of the formation of a stable vessel spanning bubble. The results also indicate that a vessel spanning bubble will likely form inside the STSC for KE, KW, and Settler sludges if the shear strengths of these sludges exceed 1820, 2080, and 2120 Pa, respectively. A passive mechanism installed in the STSC is effective at disrupting a rising sludge plug and preventing the sludge from plugging the vent filter or being forced out of the container. The Sludge Treatment Project for Engineered Container and Settler Sludge (EC/ST) Disposition Subproject is being conducted in two phases. Phase 1 of the EC/ST Disposition Subproject will retrieve the radioactive sludge currently stored in the K West (KW) Basin into Sludge Transport and Storage Containers (STSCs) and transport the STSCs to T-Plant for interim storage. Phase 2 of the EC/ST Disposition Subproject will retrieve the sludge from interim storage, treat and package sludge for disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The STSC is a cylindrical container; similar to previously used large diameter containers. A STSC (Figure 1) with a diameter of 58 inches will be used to transport KE and KW originating sludge (located in Engineered Containers 210, 220, 240, 250, and 260) to T-Plant. A STSC with an annulus (Figure 2) will be used to transport Settler Tank sludge, located in Engineered Container 230. An <b>obround</b> small canister design was previously considered to retrieve sludge from the basin. The <b>obround</b> design was selected in Small Canister Design Selection, PRC-STP- 00052. However, the small canister was not selected for transporting the sludge. The STSC was selected for sludge loading and transport to T-Plant as discussed in Decision Report for Direct Hydraulic Loading of Sludge into Sludge Transport and Storage Containers, PRC-STP- 00112. The STSC will be directly loaded with sludge as described in the Preliminary STP Container and Settler Sludge Process System Description and Material Balance, HNF- 41051...|$|E
40|$|A short {{calculation}} {{was done}} to check the attachment method of the radiation shield to it's LN 2 cooling tubes. The case considered was only for the <b>obround</b> chimney section. The proposed attachment method was to use 1 / 8 -inch plug welds spaced every 5 -inch {{along the length of}} the shield. The calculations were done conservatively for 6 -inch spacing between plug welds. The criteria used was that the LN 2 shield warmest temperature be less than 2 K above the temperature of the LN 2 fluid. Using a very conservative heat transfer model. the calculations predict that the warmest temperature on the radiation shield will be < 1. 4 K warmer than the LN 2 fluid temperature...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of new generations of laser sources for cutting of metal sheets results in the reopening of research topics that were long closed for established technologies such as CO 2 lasers. After {{the success of the}} fiber/disk generation, we now see a third generation of Direct Diode Lasers (DDLs) taking their chance. As the diode laser technology matures and the process boundaries are shifted to meet metal sheet laser cutting requirements, new challenges arise. This paper deals with gas jet optimization in laser cutting with a linearly polarized DDL setup with an output power of 750 W. Different concepts were investigated for improving the nitrogen assist gas jet when processing 3 mm thick 304 L stainless steel sheets. After performing a set of tests with conventional conical nozzles, several efforts were made in order to test possible improvements in cutting performance. This included accelerated gas jets designed for an exit Mach number of 2 (both a linearized version of the Laval nozzle and a Minimum length nozzle were tested) and nonaxis symmetric nozzle configurations, such as laser to nozzle center offset or nozzles with <b>obround</b> exit shapes. A general discussion on the design methods and procedures for these nozzle shapes is also given. Results of this exercise show the importance of well-designed nozzles for cutting with DDL’s and specifically the need to take the beam shape and laser quality constraints into consideration. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note contains {{miscellaneous information}} about the rectangular liquid helium supply tube for the D-Zero solenoid. The information is fairly superficial, but {{could be used as}} a starting point for a future engineer who is going to specify and puchase the tubing. The chimney contains 4 conductors attached to an aluminum liquid helium supply tube. Because good thermal contact is desired, the tube will have flat sides. Aluminum is chosen to match the thermal contraction coefficient of the superconductor's aluminum stabilizer. The type of aluminum is chosen as 6061 -T 6 because it's allowable stress in ANSI/ASME B 31. 3 is higher than for other alloys. A different alloy could be chosen for extrusion reasons. The highest pressures this tubing should see will be during a quench. Current calculations predict the peak pressure during a quench to be 520 psi a for one-way relieving and 250 psia for two way relieving. Whatever the final alloy selection, the tubing needs to have a high enough allowable working pressure. There is very little room in the <b>obround</b> section of the chimney. In that portion the shape is rectangular, 12. 7 mm (0. 50 -inch) x 31. 8 mm (1. 25 -inch). A drawing shows the flow path cross section. This also could be changed for extrusion reasons if necessary. The important thing here is to estimate the pressure drop and make sure it is acceptable. Pressure drop estimates for this cross section are acceptable since it only about 10 feet in length...|$|E
30|$|However, {{the seed}} size or shape cannot qualitatively explain the {{variation}} of seed loss among species. For {{the seeds of}} different species, their specific morphological characteristics affecting seed loss were quite different. Species AS and RX, with a seed weight of more than 300 mg, did not have loss {{in any of the}} experimental conditions. The DM seeds, which are small and have a rough surface, can form mucilage when absorb water and not easily be washed away, and they had no seed loss in any of the experiments. The seeds of SV and PO, which have a smooth surface and spherical shape, had seed loss rates of 80.0 % and 82.3 % at 150 mm/h rainfall. The seeds of HA, DC and BI, which have very small weight and density, had higher seed loss rates of 69.6 %, 38.6 % and 66.7 % at 100 mm/h rainfall, and 100 %, 80.6 % and 96.5 % at 150 mm/h rainfall, respectively. LD seeds, which have a smooth surface, had seed loss rates of 77.9 % and 100 % at 100 mm/h and 150 mm/h rainfall, respectively. PS seeds, which are <b>obround</b> and have hairs at the top that fall off when meeting water, had high seed loss rates of 68.3 % and 100 % at 100 mm/h and 150 mm/h rainfall, respectively. RP seeds, which have a smooth surface and a relatively mid-level weight and density, had seed loss rates of 18.8 % and 77.8 % at 100 mm/h and 150 mm/h rainfall, respectively. RC seeds, which have a bigger volume, weight and a rough surface, had lower seed loss rates of 30.0 % and 66.0 % at 100 mm/h and 150 mm/h rainfall, respectively. Seeds from PH and CF, which have a rough surface and flat shape, had lower loss rates of 25.8 % and 11.1 % at 100 mm/h rainfall, and 65.3 % and 60.3 % at 150 mm/h rainfall. The CM fruit, which is close to spherical but has a bigger volume and weight, only had low losses at 150 mm/h rainfall with a rate of 43.5 %. The BB seed is a long achene with 4 corners and 3 or 4 thorns with persistent barbed seta, and it only had low losses at 150 mm/h rainfall with a rate of 38.5 % (Tables 1 and 2).|$|E
