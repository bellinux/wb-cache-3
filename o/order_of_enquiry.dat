40|$|Murray Shanahan {{has been}} {{actively}} involved in research on the frame problem since the late eighties. When a scientist {{looks back at the}} past of his field, including his own early work, he can see how poorly the subject was understood years ago, and then two attitudes are possible. One is to think: It's amazing how naive and confused we used to be; much of this work should have never appeared in print, and the rest should have been expressed very differently! Or he can adopt a wiser view of the history of his field as a reasonable [...] maybe necessary [...] path towards the better understanding that is available today. This respect for the past, with all its embarassing mistakes, is an attractive quality of Shanahan's book. He believes that the history of attempts to solve the frame problem isn't an arbitrary record of failures which culminates in the discovery of a truth which, in hindsight, seems obvious. Rather, it seems to me to reflect a natural <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>enquiry.</b> The dead ends that people have investigated are much more than mistakes. They're obvious possibilities, which any thinker engaged in studying the frame problem is wont to investigate. A deep understanding of the knowledge representation issues surrounding the frame problem can only be acquired by getting a feel for the space of mathematical possibilities and where they lead. [p. xv] The book is about the history of research on the frame problem as much as about our current state of knowledge. This may be the only way a good book can be written today on a subject as volatile as the theory of commonsense knowledge and reasoning. 1 The book is not a comprehensive survey {{of the history of the}} problem: it is mostly about the work done within the &quot;Stanford/Imperial axis, &quot; that is to say, about the approaches that use the situation calculus and circumscription (John McCarthy) and the event calculus and logic programming (Bob Kowalski). There are also good pages on several other directions of work, including default logic, the explanation closure method, and action languages...|$|E

50|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} after the disaster the Port of Singapore's Deputy Master Attendant (equivalent to a Deputy Port Master) held an initial enquiry that was completed on 29 August. In September 1951 the Governor of Singapore, Sir Franklin Gimson, <b>ordered</b> a Commission <b>of</b> <b>Enquiry.</b> The report <b>of</b> the Commission's findings was published in February 1952. Captain Watkins and his Chief engineer, Kenneth Armstrong, {{were found to have}} acted correctly and fire precautions taken during loading were found to have been adequate. The officer of the watch was found to have failed to keep a close enough eye on the topping up process, but he was among the dead and so could not be interviewed or called to account. The report speculated, though without any actual evidence, that a member of the crew could have caused the accident by emerging from the crew quarters while smoking.|$|R
2500|$|Stephen Roskill, the British naval {{official}} historian, {{wrote in}} 1956 that the German verdict was accurate. Hitler had exchanged {{the threat to}} British Atlantic convoys for a defensive deployment near Norway, against a threat that never materialised. Roskill wrote that the British had misjudged {{the time of day}} when the German ships would sail but this mistake was less influential than the circumstantial failures of Coastal Command reconnaissance to detect the ships, which had been at sea for [...] four of them after dawn, before the alarm was raised. Churchill <b>ordered</b> a Board <b>of</b> <b>Enquiry</b> (Sir Alfred Townsend Bucknill), which criticised Coastal Command for failing to ensure that a dawn reconnaissance was flown to compensate for the problems of the night patrols off Brest and Ushant to Isle de Bréhat. The inquiry also held that there should have been more suspicion of the German radar jamming on the morning of 12 February and that involving Bomber Command in an operation for which it was untrained was a mistake.|$|R

50|$|Of all UK nations, Wales has {{the highest}} {{proportionate}} number <b>of</b> <b>enquiries</b> to the service, with Northern Ireland the fewest. Within England, there is a distribution of higher number <b>of</b> <b>enquiries</b> to the service in the north than the south, with NHS North East having the highest and NHS South of England having the least proportionate number <b>of</b> <b>enquiries.</b> The vast majority (95%) <b>of</b> <b>enquiries</b> come from A&E departments. Around 65% of poisoning is from pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, ibuprofen, citalopram, diazepam and zopiclone) and 15% from household chemicals (detergents, bleach, and isopropanol). There are very dangerous chemicals stored in most UK kitchens.|$|R

The 3 case studies are considered in relation to 7 factors identified in previous research as significant considerations when attempting to build a community <b>of</b> <b>enquiry,</b> namely: dialogue and participation; relationships; perspectives and assumptions; structure and context; climate; purpose; and control. The authors conclude by highlighting key issues and potential implications for attempts to foster collaborative partnerships between educational researchers and practitioners...|$|R

It is our interest to study the required elements that are essential to develop a community <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> within a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSLC) environment, and how the implementation of this model would benefit the students' performance, comprehension, and critical learning skills...|$|R

The intervention was a blended approach that combined facilitation, face-to-face meetings, online communications and access to e-library resources. The intervention was focused on discussions of case management issues for three fictional cases. A method of text analysis used in community <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> research was implemented to examine participant discourse. Findings indicate that practitioners developed a community <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> that privileged face-to-face communication. Online resources were primarily used as supplementary communication.

40|$|This article explores a {{range of}} {{dynamics}} which inform {{the construction of new}} era religious identities of urban professionals in Brazil through their appropriation of traditional millenarian themes most closely associated with the nation's rural peasantry. As part of this exploration, two lines <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> are followed. The first explores the continuity between the traditional millenarian paradigm most closely associated with Brazil's rural peasantry and the new era millenarianism articulated by members of the urban middle-classes. While not denying narrative similarities with traditional millenarian movements in Brazil, the second line <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> engages new era millenarianism by regarding it as embodying {{a range of}} dynamics typical of the late modern context within which its urban professional adherents are situated. While the dynamics of practical-symbolic crisis identified by the first line <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> are not discounted, the second line <b>of</b> <b>enquiry</b> regards new era millenarianism as primarily expressive of a number of reflexive preoccupations typical of late modern urban existence...|$|R
