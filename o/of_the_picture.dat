5|$|A sexy belly dancer named Princess Kashmir {{arrives at}} the party and invites Homer on stage to dance with her. On {{the way to the}} {{restaurant}} bathroom, Bart wanders into the bachelor party room and eagerly snaps a picture of Homer and Kashmir. Bart brings the picture to school and gives a copy of it to Milhouse, who promptly gets requests from other students for a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> It is not long before everyone in Springfield has one and Marge sees a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> at her aerobics class and is furious. When Homer gets home that day, Marge immediately shoves the picture in his face and demands an explanation. At that point, Bart inadvertently reveals that it was his picture, angering both his parents. After sending Bart to his room, Marge emotionally kicks Homer out of the house. Homer spends the night at Barney's apartment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the image}} {{selected}} by McCartney, the group {{walk across the}} street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and {{out of step with the}} other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement to the right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E
5|$|Pre-Code female audiences {{liked to}} indulge in the carnal lifestyles of mistresses and adulteresses {{while at the same}} time taking joy in their usually {{inevitable}} downfall in the closing scenes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> While gangster films were claimed to corrupt the morals of young boys, vice films were blamed for threatening the purity of adolescent women.|$|E

5|$|The {{background}} vocals are {{an important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> for me. That's why I like to do them myself a lot of the time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks. I'll double my voice or do a couple of tracks of my own voice. It's easy for me to match my voice. And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.|$|E

5|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} natural philosopher, a forerunner {{of the modern}} scientist, recreating one of Robert Boyle's air pump experiments, in which a bird is deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers.

The central figure looks out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome.|$|E

5|$|The {{total cost}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> was {{reported}} variously as $935,000 or $1.5 million. Even the lower figure was an exceptionally large amount for the time. To recoup its costs, MGM kept {{the film in}} circulation for many years. The running time of the film in previews was 160 minutes. Major cuts were made afterward, however. The final running time for the film was either 117 or 120 minutes.|$|E
5|$|When he {{is about}} to have dinner with Dr. No, Bond is amazed to see Goya's Portrait of the Duke of Wellington. The {{painting}} had been stolen from the National Gallery by a 60-year-old amateur thief in London just before filming began. Ken Adam had contacted the National Gallery in London to obtain a slide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> painting the copy {{over the course of the}} weekend, prior to filming commencing on the Monday.|$|E
5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, {{and the fact that it}} is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{months were}} spent {{scouting}} locations, including Ireland, China and Argentina, before New Zealand, Prague, Slovenia and Poland were chosen. Whereas the previous film was predominantly shot in New Zealand {{with a few}} months of filming in Central Europe, Adamson decided New Zealand lacked enough sound stages to accommodate the larger scale of the film. The decision to film most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> in Europe also allowed the ability to shoot during summer in both continents, although the weather turned out to be so erratic during filming that Adamson joked he had been lied to.|$|E

5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme... The details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> disclose untiring care.|$|E
5|$|Fuseli painted other {{versions}} of The Nightmare following {{the success of}} the first; at least three survive. The other important canvas was painted between 1790 and 1791 and is held at the Goethe Museum in Frankfurt. It is smaller than the original, and the woman's head lies to the left; a mirror opposes her on the right. The demon is looking at the woman rather than out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> and it has pointed, catlike ears. The most significant difference in the remaining two versions is an erotic statuette of a couple on the table.|$|E
5|$|General Amherst, the British {{commander-in-chief}} in North America, was {{in overall}} charge of administering policy towards Native Americans, which involved both military matters and {{regulation of the}} fur trade. Amherst believed that with France out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture,</b> the Native Americans would have no other choice than to accept British rule. He also {{believed that they were}} incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major Henry Gladwin, commander at Fort Detroit, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans. Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.|$|E

5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> is a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
5|$|In {{the trail}} of the related {{negative}} publicity, Turner accepted the lead role in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) under the direction of Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of the earnings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> and during just the first year of the film's release she earned $11 million. According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life each seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|E
5|$|Lombard {{was eager}} to win an Academy Award, and {{selected}} her next project—from several possible scripts—with the expectation that it would bring her the trophy. Vigil in the Night (1940), directed by George Stevens, featured Lombard as a nurse who faces a series of personal difficulties. Although the performance was praised, she did not get her nomination, as the sombre mood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> turned audiences away and box-office returns were poor. Despite the realization that she was best suited to comedies, Lombard completed one more drama: They Knew What They Wanted (1940), co-starring Charles Laughton, which was mildly successful.|$|E
