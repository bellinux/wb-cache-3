5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency {{is widely regarded as}} a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped {{bring an end to the}} dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
