5000|$|Focal {{length and}} {{diaphragm}} aperture affect the depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> a scene - that is, {{how much the}} background, mid-ground and foreground will be rendered in [...] "acceptable focus" [...] (only one exact plane of the image is in precise focus) on the film or video target. Depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> (not {{to be confused with}} depth of focus) is determined by the aperture size and the focal distance. A large or deep depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> is generated with a very small iris aperture and focusing on a point in the distance, whereas a shallow depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> will be achieved with a large (open) iris aperture and focusing closer to the lens. Depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> is also governed by the format size. If one considers the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view and angle of view, the smaller the image is, the shorter the focal length should be, as to keep the same <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view. Then, the smaller the image is, the more depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> is obtained, for the same <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view. Therefore, 70mm has less depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> than 35mm for a given <b>field</b> <b>of</b> view, 16mm more than 35mm, and video cameras even more depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> than 16mm. As videographers try to emulate the look of 35 mm film with digital cameras, this is one issue of frustration - excessive depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> with digital cameras and using additional optical devices to reduce that depth <b>of</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R

40|$|A common way {{to present}} 3 D {{materials}} to human observers nowadays is by stereoscopic displaying on 3 D TVs or head-mounted displays {{such as the}} Oculus Rift. However, not everyone can see three-dimensional solid shape from stereoscopic viewing and the three-dimensional images remain two-dimensional pictures to them rather than solid shapes. Scientists and artists {{have spent a lot}} of effort in finding ways to dissolve pictorial space into visual space. In other words, they want to figure out how to create a sense of stereopsis in an observer when he or she is looking at non-stereo and stereo pictures. There are many monocular depth cues in addition to binocular disparity that can enhance depth perception, and these cues can therefore also create an impression of stereopsis when the viewing conditions are right. One of these depth cues is depth <b>of</b> <b>field.</b> Depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> is defined as the distance range in which objects are perceived as sharp. Depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> is a popular photographic technique that effectively makes the main subject in a picture appear sharp and the foreground and background blurred. The goal of this thesis is to understand the roles <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> in pictures from a relatively low perceptual level to a relatively high cognitive level. This thesis mainly reveals how depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> influences the impression of stereopsis and how binocular disparity influences the perception <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field.</b> I start the thesis with a study on the discrimination thresholds <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field.</b> Then, a subjective study is reported in which I investigated the effects <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on depth perception for binocular viewing. The next two studies address the roles <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on a more cognitive level. The first of these two studies explored the effects <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on change detection in pictures. The other one was conducted to evaluate how depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> influences the aesthetic appeal and overall quality in photographs. Four subjective studies were conducted to achieve our goals. The cornerstone of the work described in this thesis is that humans are much more sensitive to changes in small depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> than in large depth <b>of</b> <b>field.</b> A second important finding is that stereoscopic viewing does not significantly affect discrimination thresholds. Based on the discrimination thresholds that were measured in this study, I selected five levels <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> that can be well discriminated under stereo viewing conditions in the second study to explore the effects <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on depth perception. I found that the presence of strong depth cues, in this case binocular disparity, weakens the effects <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> as a depth cue when depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> is small. In contrast, when depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> is not small, perceived depth decreases with increasing depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> irrespective <b>of</b> whether binocular disparity is zero or not. With respect to the effects <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on change detection, I found that depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> directs viewers' attention similarly under both non-stereo and stereo viewing conditions. Depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> does however weaken the effect of binocular disparity on change detection. In the final study, I found that there are no common rules on how to manipulate depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> to make pictures more beautiful or have higher quality. The role <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on aesthetic appeal and overall quality varies across content categories.

40|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} that depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> influences depth perception in nonstereo photographs, it remains unclear how depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> affects depth perception under stereo viewing conditions. We showed participants stereo photographs with different depths <b>of</b> <b>field</b> using a Wheatstone stereoscope and a commercially available 3 D TV. The depicted scene contained a floor, a background, and a measuring probe at different locations. Participants drew a floor plan of the depicted scene to scale. We found that perceived depth decreased with decreasing depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> for shallow depths <b>of</b> <b>field</b> in scenes containing a heightin-the-field cue. For larger depths <b>of</b> <b>field,</b> different effects were found depending on the display system and the viewing distance. There was no effect on perceived depth using the 3 D TV, but perceived depth decreased with increasing depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> using the Wheatstone stereoscope. However, in the 3 D TV case, we found that the perceived depth decreased with increasing depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> in scenes in which the height-in-the-field cue was removed. This indicates that the effect <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on perceived depth may be influenced by other depth cues in the scene, such as height-in-the-field cues...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Computer {{generated}} images {{by default}} render the entire scene in perfect focus. Both camera optics {{and the human}} visual system have limited depth <b>of</b> <b>field,</b> due to the finite aperture or pupil of the optical system. For more realistic computer graphics {{as well as to}} enable artistic control over what is and what is not in focus, it is desirable to add depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> blurring. Starting with the work of Potmesil and Chakravarty[33][34], there have been numerous approaches to adding depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> effects to computer graphics. Published work in depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> for computer graphics has been previously surveyed by Barsky [2][3]. Later, interactive depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> techniques were surveyed by Demers [12]. Subsequent to these surveys, however, there have been important developments.

The results show that depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> has effects on change detection: the hit rate is smaller and response time is longer in the scene with small depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> than in the scene with large depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> or uniform blur. It is concluded that when depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> is small and binocular disparity is not zero in a picture, the influence <b>of</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>field</b> on change detection is more significant than binocular disparity. This conclusion leads to the result that {{the change in the}} sharp area is detected easier and faster than in the area that is closer to the observer...|$|R

5|$|Although {{from the}} outset of the oil boom there were efforts at {{conservation}} and protection of the environment, they generally enjoyed little success. Because of the ease of finding oil in the early decades, wells were often not fully developed before prospectors began looking for more productive wells. The wildcatters not only wasted the valuable resource, but created avoidable environmental contamination with the numerous oil strikes. The rush to extract oil frequently led to the construction of poor storage facilities where leaks were common and water pollution became a serious issue. After heavy logging during the 19th century, the clearing <b>of</b> <b>fields</b> for oil exploration and the demand for lumber to be used in new construction destroyed most of the remaining forest lands in the state.
