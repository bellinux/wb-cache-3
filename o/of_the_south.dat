5|$|In the quarter-finals, Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> played Second Division club Dumbarton, also at Palmerston Park. John O'Neill scored {{his second}} {{goal of the}} tournament to give Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> the lead after 25 minutes. Dumbarton had {{opportunities}} to score an equaliser {{for the remainder of}} the game but were denied by the home team's goalkeeper, Colin Scott. Despite Dumbarton's efforts, Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> sealed the victory with a goal from Derek Lyle in the final minute of the match to win 2–0 and progress to the semi-finals. With four teams left in the tournament, Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> travelled to Love Street to face fellow First Division club St Mirren. Paul Shields scored first for Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> in the seventh minute but was cancelled out five minutes later with a goal from Brian McGinty to make it 1–1 before Derek Lyle put Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> back in front shortly before half time. Early in the second half, both teams scored again; Martin Cameron for St Mirren and Steve Bowey for Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> to make the scoreline 3–2 to the away team. With ten minutes left to play, Gerhard Fellner equalised for St Mirren to make it 3–3 but late goals in the final two minutes from a Peter Weatherson free kick and Shields' second goal of the game won the match 5–3 and sent Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> into the final for the second time in its history.|$|E
5|$|Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> also {{entered the}} first round and were drawn to play Third Division club Peterhead away from home at Balmoor Stadium. Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> {{dominated}} {{the majority of the}} game and scored two late goals in the second half from John O'Neill and Peter Weatherson to progress to the next round as 2–0 winners. In the second round Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> played another Third Division club, Greenock Morton, at home at Palmerston Park. The game was marred with incidents with Dean Keenan, Colin Reilly and Alex Williams all being sent off for Greenock Morton. Sean O'Connor scored the winning goal for Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> with only seven minutes left to play but shortly before the end sustained an injury from a tackle by Reilly which resulted in his sending off. Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> won the game 1–0 and advanced to the quarter-finals.|$|E
