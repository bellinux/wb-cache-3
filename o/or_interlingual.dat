40|$|In {{a foreign}} country where an {{unfamiliar}} language is spoken, words such as hotel, taxi, and café can often still be recognized because they possess the same or a similar spelling and meaning across languages.

These items are called false friends <b>or</b> (noncognate) <b>interlingual</b> homographs. An example is the word spot, which means “mockery ” in Dutch. Apart from spelling (or-thography) and meaning (semantics), a third code thought {{to play a major role}} in word processing is sound (phonol-ogy), which can also be shared between words of different languages.

40|$|Machine {{translation}} (MT) is {{a relatively}} new field combining linguistics and computer science. From a linguistic perspective, {{one of the most important}} components of MT systems is undoubtedly dictionaries. Until now, few studies have been carried out on the role played by dictionaries in such systems. The objective of this thesis is therefore to advance research in machine lexicography, or more precisely, in bilingual machine lexicography. This thesis examines MT dictionaries in a certain number of systems in order to gain a better understanding of the role played by MT bilingual dictionaries in relation to other parts of the system. This is important since, unlike human translators who can choose to consult bilingual dictionaries whenever they wish, according to their own particular needs, MT systems dictate when consultation takes place and the type of information sought. Furthermore, the type of MT system (direct, transfer <b>or</b> <b>interlingual)</b> has a direct impact on the content and use of bilingual dictionaries. Bilingual dictionaries in direct systems, which do not contain unilingual dictionaries, usually contain more information than those in transfer <b>or</b> <b>interlingual</b> systems. However, the linguistic analysis of bilingual dictionaries in direct systems is less sophisticated than that of unilingual dictionaries in transfer <b>or</b> <b>interlingual</b> systems. This thesis also compares traditional bilingual dictionaries with MT bilingual dictionaries in order to determine to what extent it is possible to adapt a traditional bilingual dictionary entry for use in MT systems...|$|E

This ‘automaticity of stereotyping’ will be analyzed within the framework of discourse transfer, be it intralingual <b>or</b> <b>interlingual.</b> It is no coincidence that both journalism and translation studies have recently focused more on the automaticity features of transfer. This approach will be illustrated by a case study on stereotyping in sports journalism.

A total of 68 sophomores University students in Hamadan city participated in this study. Thirty-eight assignments and thirty-eight in-class practice were collected and analyzed for collocational errors. The unacceptable grammatical and lexical collocational errors were identified based on the modified version originally proposed by Benson, et al. (1986) and Chen (2002). The BBI Dictionary of English Word Combinations, the British National Corpus, was employed to analyze the participants’ collocational errors and to provide suggestions for correction. Moreover, a questionnaire was administered to explore the participants’ perceptions of difficulty in collocations. The results of the questionnaire showed that the participants’ perceptions of collocational types were different from the collocational error types the participants made in their writing samples. Ignorance of rule restrictions was the major source of collocational errors. EFL students make collocational errors in their writing because of the interference of their mother tongue, lack of the collocational concept, the <b>interlingual</b> <b>or</b> intra lingual transfer, paraphrase and their shortage of their collocational knowledge...|$|R
40|$|How do the two {{languages}} of bilingual individuals interact in everyday communication? Numerous behavioral- and event-related brain potential {{studies have suggested}} that information from the non-target language is spontaneously accessed when bilinguals read, listen, or speak in a given language. While {{this finding is consistent with}} predictions of current models of bilingual processing, most paradigms used so far have mixed the {{two languages}} by using language ambiguous stimuli (e. g., cognates <b>or</b> <b>interlingual</b> homographs) or explicitly engaging the two languages because of experimental task requirements (e. g., word translation or language selection). These paradigms will have yielded different language processing contexts, the effect of which has seldom been taken into consideration. We propose that future studies should test the effect of language context on cross-language interactions in a systematic way, by controlling and manipulating the extent to which the experiment implicitly or explicitly prompts activation of the two languages...|$|E
40|$|Current {{models of}} {{bilingualism}} (e. g., BIA) posit that lexical access during reading is not language selective. However, {{much of this}} research is based on the comprehension of words in isolation. The authors investigated whether nonselective access occurs for words embedded in biased sentence contexts (e. g., A. I. Schwartz & J. F. Kroll, 2006). Eye movements were recorded as French–English bilinguals read English sentences containing cognates (e. g., piano), interlingual homographs (e. g., coin, meaning corner in French), or matched control words. Sentences provided a low or high semantic constraint for target-language meanings. Both early-stage comprehension measures (e. g., first fixation duration, gaze duration, and skipping) and late-stage comprehension measures (e. g., go-past time and total reading time) showed significant cognate facilitation and interlingual homograph interference for low-constraint sentences. For high-constraint sentences, however, only early-stage comprehension measures were consistent with nonselective access. There was no evidence of cognate facilitation <b>or</b> <b>interlingual</b> homograph interference for late-stage comprehension measures. Thus, nonselective bilingual lexical access at early stages of comprehension is rapidly resolved in semantically biased contexts at later stages of comprehension...|$|E
40|$|Existing {{literary}} translations can be reused in {{a number}} of complex ways that extend their lives beyond their publication and reception.

Mediated translation tends to distance the target text from the source text. In a study of Raymond Chandler’s The Little Sister in Gallimard’s Série Noire and in three different publishers in Spain, it is found that in contexts that could be characterised as mass market, or “factory”, translation, both inter-and intralingual intermediated translation are used. In the three most recent publication situations involving The Little Sister, while still operating within mercantile models, the publishers use intralingual mediated translation, and also retranslation, to restore target literary texts that have been condensed, attenuated or censored to the closest possible balance with regard to the source texts.

40|$|Mediation, like translation, {{may take}} {{different}} forms {{and may be}} classified according to Jakobson’s classic model as intralingual, <b>interlingual</b> <b>or</b> intersemiotic communication. In all three modes of communication, texts essentially become recontextualisations of pre-existing discourses and often {{give rise to a}} chain of other texts, each of which is subject to a certain degree of mediation. Although the bridge-building metaphor is undoubtedly a legitimate way of approaching most forms of mediation, there is increasing evidence in the literature that this is not always the case. The scenario in which mediation operates is much more complex and it is one in which mediators’ compliance or resistance to contextual and socio-cultural factors and prevailing norms in a given point in history play a major role. Attention is increasingly being focussed {{on the nature of the}} rewritings they produce and on how their agency is made manifest. This holds true for rewritings that take place within the same language, across language boundaries and in the growing area of audio-visual translation. Of particular interest in this regard is the broadening of the notion of translation to include other forms of rewriting in which the rewriter’s interventionist role is a central feature. The present volume addresses various forms of translation and rewriting and explores the strategies rewriters use to achieve their goal of rendering the target text accessible to its recipient audience. "Knowing how" to rewrite in English entails developing an awareness of the whys and wherefores of rewriting. Just as knowledge about language leads to awareness of language, which in turn leads to increased efficiency and sensitivity to language, so familiarity with the general principles of translation and rewriting leads to enhanced competence and performance...|$|R

The problems that the writer wanted to discover are the grammatically deviated expressions demonstrated by the Balinese souvenir vendors and the factors {{that are responsible for}} those errors. The data of this study were collected by secretly recording the conversations of the vendors while they were talking or bargaining. Then the writer transcribed the conversations and {{analyzed the}}m using Error Analysis approach which consists of three steps. First step is the recognition of idiosyncracy. Second step is the accounting for a learner's idiosyncratic dialect. The last step is explanation. The classification is based on the Linguistic Category, Surface Strategy taxonomy, Comparative Analysis, and Communicative Taxonomy. Finally, the origin or factor that causes error was discussed. The data analysis shows that most of the errors found in the conversations are errors in grammar. The type of error most likely to occur is omission errors. All of them are <b>interlingual</b> <b>or</b> internal errors and none of them is the error which caused miscommunication. The main reason that underlies the existence of errors is the intrusion of the first language structure into the target one. It could happen because the differences between rules of both languages made the learners confuse. Then they apply their native language pattern into the target one, thus cause errors. The consequence is disorganized English. It will hamper the communication, so sometimes the purpose of trading do not achieved. Therefore, the vendors should develop their competence, by studying more and improve their weaknesses. Hopefully, this thesis will be able to help people identify the errors experienced by the Balinese vendors, i. e, the location, the origin, and the cause, so that the way out could be found...|$|R

Critical LPP draws on poststructuralist theory to deconstruct normalized categories that maintain systems of inequality. It {{is akin to}} the queer theory project for gender and sexuality. Since the country regained its independence in 1991, Estonian language planners have attempted to promote Estonian given the domain loss it suffered under Soviet occupation. But what justification can there be today for a policy in favor of Estonian when this is once again a majority language? The poststructuralist perspective allows us to view operations of power not {{as the result of}} intergroup <b>or</b> <b>interlingual</b> tensions but rather of discursive structures that privilege certain ways of knowing over others.

40|$|The {{language}} barrier in many multilingual {{natural language processing}} (NLP) tasks can be overcome by mapping objects from different languages (“views”) into a common low-dimensional subspace. For example, the name transliteration task involves mapping bilingual names and word translation mining involves mapping bilingual words into a common low-dimensional subspace. Multi-view models learn such a low-dimensional subspace using a training corpus of paired objects, e. g., names written in different languages, represented as feature vectors. The central idea of my dissertation is to learn low-dimensional subspaces (<b>or</b> <b>interlingual</b> representations) that are effective for various multilingual and monolingual NLP tasks. First, I demonstrate the effectiveness of interlingual representations in mining bilingual word translations, and then proceed to developing models for diverse situations that often arise in NLP tasks. In particular, I design models for the following problem settings: 1) when {{there are more than}} two views but we only have training data from a single pivot view into each of the remaining views 2) when an object from one view is associated with a ranked list of objects from another view, and finally 3) when the underlying objects have rich structure, such as a tree. These problem settings arise often in real world applications. I choose a canonical task for each of the settings and compare my model with existing state-of-the-art baseline systems. I provide empirical evidence for the first two models on multilingual name transliteration and reranking for the part-of-speech tagging tasks, espectively. For the third problem setting, I experiment with the task of re-scoring target language word translations based on the source word's context. The model roposed for this problem builds on the ideas proposed in the previous models and, hence, leads to a natural conclusion...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{translation}} of Hamlet into Hungarian culture. In order to cover as wide a spectrum of translation as possible, the thesis employs Roman Jakobson's tripartite notion of translation: interlingual, intralingual and intersemiotic transfer. However, the thesis also challenges Jakobson's categories, {{especially with regard to}} the considerable degree of overlap that occurs. The first part of the thesis focuses on what is traditionally termed translation - translation 'proper' <b>or</b> <b>interlingual</b> translation. Nevertheless, {{in the context of the}} Hungarian Hamlets intralingual translation is also involved due to the central status of Janos Arany's 1867 translation. This translation influences the work of later translators, whether they approach the sacred text with the attitude of discipleship (that is to say, with reverence for Arany and with the intention of imitating or learning from Arany) or, less frequently, with the attitude of mastery (claiming equal or greater expertise). This process, which can be described as a Bloomian coming-to-terms with the father figure, is apparent when one looks at how famous Shakespearean-Aranyean fragments of Hamlet are 'retranslated' by subsequent translators. Apart from examples of the fragmentary afterlife of Arany's Hamlet, critical discourse also displays a certain taboo surrounding Arany's Hamlet. The second part of the thesis deals with interserniotic translation, providing a detailed case study of the 2003 Pécs performance based on a contemporary translation by Ádám Nádasdy. This instance of translation involves the transposition of a purely verbal text onto an art form that is not exclusively verbal. The third part of the thesis engages in the discussion of a spectrum of rewrites (or, in Jakobson's term, 'rewording') and follows a genre-based division: Hamletian ramifications in drama, fiction and poetry. The examination of these three interrelated areas of translation activity prompts the critic to envisage a complex Hungarian Hamlet palimpsest woven in the spirit of making Shakespeare and Hamlet 'our own'.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} many developments in using a communicative approach in language teaching, but Little {{has yet been}} mentioned about how to teach interpretation, which is an important skill for many Chinese students of English. Interpreting involves a variety of complex tasks, such as the acquiring of language proficiency, general knowledge, cultural knowledge, and specific interpreting skills, among which linguistic knowledge {{is a prerequisite for}} the study of interpreting, and cultural knowledge is of equal importance. The analysis of grammatical errors and cultural mistakes made by Chinese interpreters indicates that errors and mistakes are often recorded in areas where there is {{a significant difference between the}} languages and cultures of English and Chinese-speakers. Such analysis also demonstrates that many errors and mistakes are attributed to <b>interlingual</b> <b>or</b> intralingual transfer in addition to idiosyncrasy, and to using the culture of the source language community as the norm in linguistic and paralinguistic behaviour. The errors and mistakes made can be traced to a lack of both linguistic competence and communicative competence. As the interpreter is an intermediary in communication between an addresser and an addressee, the quality of his output has considerable impact on the rendering of the message. Therefore, in order to avoid possible errors and mistakes which might impede communication, it seems necessary to add to the existing curriculum of interpreting in China such courses as will enable future interpreters to acquire both linguistic competence and communicative competence. The study of culture, which used to be neglected in the interpreting curriculum in China, must be seen as an indispensable component in the curriculum. The understanding of some aspects of the culture of English speakers can be facilitated by a communicative approach to language teaching, by the use of a large amount of culture-based authentic materials, and by the introduction of specific techniques usually needed in interpreting...|$|R
40|$|All {{forms of}} communication, whether intralingual, <b>interlingual</b> <b>or</b> intersemiotic, involve using {{language}} {{for a purpose}} within a particular context and a specific culture. Successful communication takes place when {{the purpose of the}} message is encoded effectively and decoded appropriately both within a culture and across cultures. The rationale underlying Variations in English Discourse is that any communication event entails an act of translation and mediation. The interrelation between translation and communication may be said to underlie all approaches to discourse be they linguistic, semiotic, cultural, social or literary. The main aim of Variations in English Discourse is to sensitize readers to the way information is handled in discourse across languages and language varieties. Each chapter deals with a specific aspect of mediation from both a theoretical and a practical perspective. Chapter 1 and 2 introduce the pragmatic aspects of mediation and investigate how language forms and functions interact within and across language boundaries. The focus is on the appropriateness of the linguistic form to the function of the utterance in relation to the addresser's intentions and underlying communicative motivations. The importance of pragmatics to translation and communciation is further explored in Chapters 3 and 4, which stress the need to interpret the source text {{as an integral part of}} its socio-cultural context in terms of both the context of situation and the context of culture. Such variants of communication as participants, their shared background knowledge, and the relationship of meaning to the extralinguistic environment and its appropriateness to the speech situation are discussed in detail. Chapter 5 explores the role of figurative language in relation to stylistic effects and text-types while Chapter 6 delves into the intersemiotic variations of discourse with particular reference to film translation. The volume closes with two appendices which aim to show the relevance of genre to the rewriting of texts. The first explores the notion that translated texts constitute a genre of their own and that they are characterized by certain types of linguistic behaviour that is either unique or prevalent to mediated texts as compared to monolingual text production. The second investigates forms of rewriting with specific regard to the drafting of EU documents.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{attitudes towards}} {{and use of}} {{language}} in everyday communication in public places in Estonia. On the one hand, it focuses on language use “on the ground”, that is, the use/non-use of Estonian by staff {{in public and private}} organisations with customers who have Estonian as their dominant language of communication. On the other hand, it seeks to situate Estonian language use and policy within the emerging field of critical language policy and planning (CLPP) by investigating the discourses that frame linguistic behaviour. These are then related to the practices, or repeated activities, that maintain the activity uncovered by the investigation of everyday language use. The focus of the present critical language policy study is to uncover taken-for-granted categories framing social life, in particular those that maintain forms of inequality, and to investigate ways that these might be reshaped in order to bring about outcomes that take into account the everyday needs and realities of a greater proportion of Estonian society. Since Independence in 1991, Estonia has had language policy in place with the stated aim of reversing the language shift that occurred in the period of Soviet occupation (1940 - 1991). During that time, Russian became the language of prestige and mobility and the proportion of Estonian-speakers in the country dropped considerably. The normalisation and integration processes taking place in the post-Independence period present cases of significant theoretical and practical interest, particularly in terms of how the relationship between the different languages and ethnic groups in diverse societies can be managed. The poststructuralist perspective adopted in the thesis, furthermore, allows us to view operations of power not as the result of intergroup <b>or</b> <b>interlingual</b> tensions, but rather of discursive structures that privilege certain ways of knowing over others. This permits us to carry out critical analysis on how to promote more equitable outcomes, i. e., maintaining linguistic and cultural diversity while also working to minimise levels of social inequality. There were two main methods of data collection: language diaries and interviews. The aim of the language diary component was to obtain personal, naturalistic data about everyday language encounters. Participants were required to log, for a period of four weeks, details of their interactions with staff members in public and private organisations as they naturally occurred. The log had two central questions, one concerning the Estonian ability of the staff member, the other about the successfulness of the interaction, to which participants responded along a Likert-type scale. Participants also recorded numerous other variables related to the situation and the interlocutor. Interviews were conducted with various key ethnic Estonian and Russian-speaking figures in the field of language policy and planning (LPP), including representatives from the Ministry of Education, the Language Inspectorate, the Integration and Migration Foundation, and the Centre for Human Rights. The objective was to investigate the discourses framing these individuals’ views on LPP in Estonia and how these discourses relate to current as well as potential future linguistic practices in the country. Results indicate that Estonian enjoys “normalised” interethnic usage in the capital, Tallinn, but that Russian retains a relatively strong status in smaller towns in the capital region. There is also often little communication at all in interethnic transactions in public places. Integration and normalisation policies need to create social contexts that are conducive to practices of inclusion (i. e., mutual tolerance and meaningful interaction) between ethnic Estonians and Russian-speakers. This can be achieved through a rapprochement of discourses, by promoting a greater understanding of the attitudes, worldviews, and shared histories of the other group. At present, the discourses of many officials, ethnic Estonian and Russian-speaking alike, promote practices of exclusion (e. g., maintained separation of ethnic groups and lack of communication) rather than inclusion (e. g., integration and common language use). The findings afford us lessons for exploring more equitable and ethical outcomes for the future for all residents of Estonia. The particular critical, poststructuralist perspective employed in this research {{can be applied to the}} CLPP of any polity in order to evaluate this and propose modifications to bring about “preferred futures” (Pennycook, 2001) ...|$|E
