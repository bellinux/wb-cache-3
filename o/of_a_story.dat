5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off in the middle <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E

5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{apparently}} {{controlled the}} Kingdom of Lindsey, given the evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> told by Bede regarding the moving of Oswald's bones to a monastery there; Bede {{says that the}} monks rejected the bones initially because Oswald had ruled over them as a foreign king. To the north, {{it may have been}} Oswald who conquered the Gododdin. Irish annals record the siege of Edinburgh, thought to have been the royal stronghold of the Gododdin, in 638, and this seems to mark the end of the kingdom; that this siege was undertaken by Oswald is suggested by the apparent control of the area by his brother Oswiu in the 650s.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} created to not have direct {{connections}} to the first Shin Megami Tensei, {{to ensure that it}} was interesting independently; this led character designer Kazuma Kaneko to create the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> vaguely based on Shin Megami Tensei future. Reviewers enjoyed the gameplay and the lowered difficulty compared to the prior game; some appreciated the plot and themes, but some thought that certain themes, while fresh at the time of release, felt clichéd in retrospect.|$|E

5|$|Casino Royale {{takes place}} at the {{beginning}} of Bond's career as Agent 007, just as he is earning his licence to kill. The film's plot sees Bond becoming involved in an assignment to bankrupt terrorist financier Le Chiffre in a high-stakes poker game, after foiling an attack he arranged on a new aircraft being demonstrated at Miami International Airport; during the course of his assignment, Bond falls in love with Vesper Lynd, a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game. The film is part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> arc that continues in Quantum of Solace (2008), with explicit references to the characters and events being made in films set after the story, within Skyfall (2012) and Spectre (2015). Casting the film involved a widespread search for a new actor to portray James Bond, and significant controversy surrounded Craig when he was selected to succeed Pierce Brosnan in October 2005. Location filming took place in the Czech Republic, the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom with interior sets built at Barrandov Studios and Pinewood Studios; although part of the storyline is set in Montenegro, no filming took place there.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} on Why Don't You?, Davies oversaw the {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{that took place}} in Loch Ness. The story was the precursor for his first freelance children's project: Dark Season. The show, originally called The Adventuresome Three, would feature the Why Don't You? characters in a purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script {{to the head of the}} BBC's Children's department, Anna Home, and Granada Television. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished to produce it as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of Maid Marian and her Merry Men, which had been put on hiatus the year before.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's next Adventure of Tintin {{would be}} The Secret of the Unicorn, serialised in Le Soir from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had {{introduced}} many elements {{from the work}} of Jules Verne into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. The Secret of the Unicorn marked the first half <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> arc that was completed in Red Rackham's Treasure, serialised in Le Soir from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following Red Rackham's Treasure, Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled Dupont et Dupond, détectives ("Thomson and Thompson, Detectives"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.|$|E
