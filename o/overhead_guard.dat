5000|$|<b>Overhead</b> <b>guard</b> - is a metal roof {{supported}} by posts at each {{corner of the}} cab that helps protect the operator from any falling objects. On some forklifts, the <b>overhead</b> <b>guard</b> is an integrated part of the frame assembly.|$|E
5000|$|Truck frame - is {{the base}} of the machine to which the mast, axles, wheels, counterweight, <b>overhead</b> <b>guard</b> and power source are attached. The frame may have fuel and {{hydraulic}} fluid tanks constructed as part of the frame assembly.|$|E
5000|$|Cab - is {{the area}} that {{contains}} a seat for the operator along with the control pedals, steering wheel, levers, switches and a dashboard containing operator readouts. The cab area may be open air or enclosed but it is covered by the cage-like <b>overhead</b> <b>guard</b> assembly. When enclosed, the cab may also be equipped with a cab heater for cold climate countries along with a fan or air conditioning for hot weather.|$|E
60|$|There were <b>overhead</b> <b>guards</b> against hand-bombs which {{disposed}} me {{to believe}} him, but what convinced me most was a corporal urging us in whispers not to talk so loud. The men were at dinner, and a good smell of food filled the trench. This was the first smell I had encountered in my long travels uphill--a mixed, entirely wholesome flavour of stew, leather, earth, and rifle-oil.|$|R

50|$|The {{start of}} World War II, like World War I before, spurred {{the use of}} {{forklift}} trucks in the war effort. Following the war, more efficient methods for storing products in warehouses were being implemented. Warehouses needed more maneuverable forklift trucks that could reach greater heights and new forklift models were made that filled this need. For example, in 1954 a British company named Lansing Bagnall, now part of KION Group, developed what was {{claimed to be the}} first narrow aisle electric reach truck. The development changed the design of warehouses leading to narrower aisles and higher load stacking that increased storage capability. During the 1950s and 1960s operator safety became a concern due to the increasing lifting heights and capacities. Safety features such as load back rests and operator cages, called <b>overhead</b> <b>guards,</b> began to be added to forklifts produced in this era. In the late 1980s ergonomic design began to be incorporated in new forklift designs to improve operator comfort, reduce injuries and increase productivity. During the 1990s exhaust emissions from forklift operations began to be addressed which led to emission standards being implemented for forklift manufacturers in various countries. The introduction of AC power forklifts, along with fuel cell technology, are also refinements in continuing forklift development.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{forklift}} truck {{is one of}} important equipments of the modern logistics system. As the {{forklift truck}} is running, the driver seat and steering wheel of {{a certain type of}} fork-lift truck vibrate strongly, virtual prototyping technology and multi-body dynamics are used to make simulation of dynamic performance of fork-lift truck in this paper, and then the test result is compared with time course load that obtained from frame junction with the annex. We should repeatedly modify the simulation model based on test results, which is consistent with the actual results. Based on this model, so we put forward measures for improving design: Firstly, the axis of rotation of oval steering axle is implied; Secondly, the <b>overhead</b> <b>guard</b> is connected with the frame by the rubber cushion blocks at four different locations; Thirdly, the engine is fixed on the frame by the rubber cushion blocks (shock mount) in two different position. The improved simulation and experimental verification are carried out under the same conditions, and the results show that the fundamental frequency of seat of the improved fork-lift truck and vibration energy are lower. The result proves the practical value of this method in the research of the vibration characteristics of complete engineering machine...|$|E
30|$|Collaborative {{transmission}} utilizing coded orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiplex (COFDM) [2] {{was presented in}} [14], where a source sensor transmitted its data {{to a group of}} repeater sensors that re-transmitted the signal collaboratively to another receptor sensor, forming a virtual COFDM system transmitting the same information in all the carriers. This system also exploited the spatial diversity of the sensors; however, it was assumed that the time delay for transmission between the re-transmitters and the receptor sensor was greater than the largest channel delay. This condition implies the existence of large <b>overhead</b> (long <b>guard</b> time intervals) for extremely severe channel conditions. This study also assumes that all channels are flat fading.|$|R
6000|$|But {{they never}} got beyond Botley. For even as their train ran into the station, a mighty {{rumbling}} was heard, there was a shouting <b>overhead,</b> the <b>guard</b> stood astonished on the platform, and Phipps, thrusting {{his head out of}} the window, cried, [...] "There he goes!" [...] and sprang out of the carriage. Mrs. Milton, following in alarm, just saw it. From Widgery it was hidden. Botley station lies in a cutting, overhead was the roadway, and across the lemon yellows and flushed pinks of the sunset, there whirled a great black mass, a horse like a long-nosed chess knight, the upper works of a gig, and Dangle in transit from front to back. A monstrous shadow aped him across the cutting. It was the event of a second. Dangle seemed to jump, hang in the air momentarily, and vanish, and after a moment's pause came a heart-rending smash. Then two black heads running swiftly.|$|R
40|$|When {{making an}} {{engineering}} design decision, {{it is often}} necessary to consider its implications on both system performance and dependability. In this paper, we present a performability study that analyzes the guarded operation duration 4 for onboard software upgrading. In particular, we define a “performability index ” Y that quantifies {{the extent to which}} the guarded operation with a duration q 5 reduces the expected total performance degradation. In order to solve for Y, we propose an approach that translates a design-oriented model into an evaluation-oriented model that allows us to exploit efficient solution methods, successively closing the gap between the formulation of Y and its final solution. More specifically, we begin with constructing a design-oriented model that formulates Y and captures the collective effects on system performa-bility of both performance <b>overhead</b> of <b>guarded</b> operation and failure behavior of the software components. We then translate this design-oriented model, through analytic manipulation, into an evaluation-oriented form that is an aggregate of constituent measures conducive to reward model solutions. Finally, based on this reward-mapping-enabled intermediate model, we specify reward structures in the composite base model which is built on three stochastic activity net-work (SAN) reward models. We describe the successive model-translation approach and show its feasibility for design-oriented performability modeling...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis report examines {{the effect of}} including real property depreciation in the U. S. Coast <b>Guard's</b> <b>overhead</b> costs. The following accounting concepts are discussed as to the nature and appropriateness to the Yard's accounting: asset valuation, useful life determination, depreciation and asset capitalization criteria. Two methods of overhead allocation are presented and contrasted. The first method is currently used by the Yard {{and the second is}} a proposed replacement. A $ 1, 000. capitalization threshold is proposed to replace the current $ 200 threshold. The real property assets are depreciated {{on the basis of their}} historical cost and by the straight line method. Their depreciation costs are distributed to the appropriate cost centers. From there the costs are allocated to overhead by both allocation methods. The effect of a $ 1, 000 capitalization threshold is then added in to the calculations. A new rate structure is computed twice for both allocation methods: at the current capitalization threshold and at the $ 1, 000 capitalization threshold. The four concurring rates are applied to sample Yard projects to contrast their effects on overhead costs. This report concludes that information based on historical cost is irrelevant due to inflation. A recommendation is made to use current cost, which would produce more useful information to determine the current operating costs of the Coast Guard Yard. [URL] United States Coast Guar...|$|R
30|$|Different {{from other}} protocols, the {{detailed}} implementation description including frame structure, beacon frequency, and size {{was not given}} in STAR. Therefore, we use ‘God’ class in NS 2 to make the overall system variables and connectivity state known to each node in STAR. Accordingly, we just compared the RO performance of GPSR, CAR, CAIR, and JBR with PGS varying in Figure  12. The beacon interval of all the protocols is set to the same for comparisons as listed in Table  2. It can be noted that CAR has the lowest RO among all the protocols. In fact, CAR uses an adaptive beaconing mechanism, and the beaconing interval depends on the node's neighborhood. Thus, in low traffic density scenarios, the node beacons more frequently than in high traffic density ones. In other words, the routing overhead from beacon messages of CAR depends on the vehicular density only and is independent of traffic load. The other two parts contributing to the overhead in CAR, i.e., path discovery and guard maintenance, seem to show limited influence to the RO as shown in Figure  12. Actually, since only one path discovery is needed for per source/destination pair and <b>guard</b> <b>overhead</b> is piggybacked in beacon, the increase of PGS really has a little impact on the RO of CAR except some that occurred overhead for local optimum maintenance. Among the other three protocols, GPSR shows relatively lower RO, whereas JBR shows the highest. Our CAIR issues an RO in between GPSR and JBR. The reason behind this rank {{is the use of}} other management overhead other than the beacon message in CAIR, which is the only overhead in GPSR. For JBR, although the beacon size is nearly the same with others, its destination initiated flooding for position notification consumes a great many of bandwidth. Our CAIR uses the mechanism of on-the-fly density collection and delay estimation, both of which are piggybacked in data packets and add some limited overhead.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 139 - 140) This {{thesis is}} the story of the son of Italian immigrants to the United States. It tracks the significant aspects of his life beginning during the Great Depression. He lived the first part of his life being part of one of the poorest families in the wealthiest town in the United States. He began working outside the home, caddying at a country club, when he was nine years old. He quit school at fifteen, hitchhiked to parts of New England and then to the Southern part of the United States before joining the U. S. Air Force when he was seventeen years old. He was honorably discharged four years later and worked at various jobs, including short order cook, bartender, drill press operator and then became a semi-pro boxer. He eventually found his way to the university on the Korean Veterans GI Bill. While at the university he took part in the anti-McCarthy movement in the early 1950 s. Later he moved to San Francisco where he met some interesting people, including Kenneth Rexroth, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, and other poets, writers, and painters during the so-called "Beatnik" era. In 1963 he went to live in Europe for two years. When he returned to the states he got married and lived in Joplin, Missouri and in New York City. In New York he joined the newly organized National Teacher Corps and taught in Harlem for two years. When Martin Luther King was assassinated he was one of the representatives of the New York City Teachers Association selected to fly to Memphis, Tenn. for the Memorial March. He went to graduate school in Santa Barbara during the time the bank was burned to the ground; when military helicopters were flying <b>overhead</b> and National <b>Guard</b> soldiers were on the streets. The story also tells of his running a floating poker game, one step ahead of the police in Detroit. He also was a partner in a nightclub venture. He served in the U. S. Peace Corps, published a few poems, as well as an account of self-deception in a philosophy journal. He lived in England, Germany, Italy, Finland and Ukraine and has visited every continent except one. He was elected to his local school board and ran, unsuccessfully, for California State Assembly. This thesis will be for his fourth Masters Degre...|$|R
