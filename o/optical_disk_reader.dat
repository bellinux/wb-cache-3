40|$|Direct {{measurement}} of optical phase {{is used in}} a high-density <b>optical</b> <b>disk</b> <b>reader.</b> The increased density is achieved by introducing multiple pit depths to replace the single pit depths of a traditional compact disk. Having four independent pit depths can double the storage capacity of a disk. The multi-level pits are read by direct {{measurement of}} the phase difference between two laser spots focused onto the disk surface. Extraction of phase information utilizes the equations of phase shifting interferometry with four shifted fringe patterns created simultaneously by a compact optical head. The system speed is therefore limited by the readout electronics instead of by slow mechanical phase shifters. The resulting system can identify four independent levels {{as well as the}} direction of transition from one level to another. The system also has low sensitivity to vibrations and to changes in the fringe contrast and beam intensity...|$|E

Electrical modulation of the index of refraction creates focusing behavior. The modulation is induced by a set of electrodes whose individual voltages are arranged to provide a cylindrical exit wave front for a uniform plane-wave input. Two such cells with orthogonal electrodes arranged in cascade create spherical lens performance. Experimental evidence using a lens with {{a relatively small number of}} electrodes is presented. Applications for such structures, once improved, would include real-time focus adjustment for <b>optical</b> <b>disk</b> <b>readers</b> and hand-held photographic equipment as well as aberration compensation for long path-length optical systems...|$|R

Servers made of clusters of PC's connected to jukeboxes may represent an interesting alternative compared with servers made of arrays of magnetic disks.

In the present contribution, we analyze the benefits and limitations of striping files across multiple <b>optical</b> <b>disks</b> in order to speedup the retrieval of large pieces of information. We also show that server applications requiring both computer power and I/O bandwidth may be distributed over several processing nodes and access files striped over multiple <b>optical</b> <b>disks.</b> For such applications, as long as disk exchanges are not necessary, a predictable speedup can be obtained by ensuring a high enough number of server computers, <b>optical</b> <b>disk</b> drive units, and enough communication bandwidth...|$|R
