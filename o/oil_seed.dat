5|$|In 2013, the {{government}} adopted a National Export Strategy to diversify the country’s exports. Production facilities {{are to be}} established {{for a wide range}} of products within the three selected clusters: <b>oil</b> <b>seed</b> products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi’s exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country’s Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.|$|E

40|$|Background. It {{seems that}} {{patients}} may ask general practitioners about natural cosmetics applied {{on the skin}} regarding their safety and suitability. Objectives. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze natural cold pressed oils as potential cosmetic products. Material and methods. Cold pressed oils obtained from selected seeds and fruit stones were analyzed, including: chokeberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> blackcurrant <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> elderberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> raspberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> apricot <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> tomato <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> strawberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> broccoli <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> Nigella sativa <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> hemp <b>oil,</b> safflower <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> Silybum marianum <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and coconut oil. 80 adult volunteers assessed the cosmetic properties of the analyzed oils. Each of the volunteers tested 2 to 4 different oils, by applying them on the skin. In addition, patch tests with all analyzed oils were performed on 23 individuals. Results. The majority of tested oils were positively evaluated by the participants: in the opinion of the participants, oil extracted from safflower had the best appearance (100 % positive opinions), coconut oil had the best smell (70 % positive opinions), while black currant <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> showed the best absorbency (85 % positive opinions). No irritation was observed within the analyzed product group, albeit one allergic reaction to apricot <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> was observed with patch testing. Conclusions. Based on the achieved results, it could be suggested that natural cold pressed oils can be applied to the skin as cosmetics. Our observations may be helpful for general practitioners when choosing natural cosmetics...|$|R

40|$|Biodiesel can be {{considered}} as the optimum alternative fuel for diesel fuel in Iran. Biodiesel is an environmentally friendly fuel and has the potential to provide comparable engine performance results. The biodiesel production potential from <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> such as canola, soybean, cotton, seasem, olive, sunflower, safflower, almond, corn, coconut, walnut and hazelnut in Iran is investigated in this paper. In Iran, <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> are not commonly used for energy application. This is because; more than 90 % of the edible oil for human consumption is being imported. To contribute to the fuel supply, renewable energies such as <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> to be an attractive resource for biodiesel production, this paper aims to cover several perspectives {{on the size of the}} biodiesel <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> resource in Iran. <b>Oil</b> <b>seeds</b> are harvested every year in Iran. Around 1 million ha of land from 20 states are estimated to be potential land for growing of <b>oil</b> <b>seeds.</b> There are approximately 3. 67 Â MT (million ton) of <b>oil</b> <b>seeds</b> crops in Iran that can potentially produce 721 Â ML (million liter) of biodiesel every year. Canola, cotton and soybean are the most favorable biodiesel production source. Based on the results, it can be concluded that production of biodiesel from the <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> can ideally replace about 2 % of total diesel fuel consumption in Iran. By managing this, an B 2 (2 % biodiesel and 98 % diesel) can be an optimum alternative fuel for compressed ignition engine since there is no major engine modification required to use biodiesel.

25|$|Pakistan is a net food exporter, {{except in}} {{occasional}} years when its harvest is {{adversely affected by}} droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest camel market, second-largest apricot and ghee market and third-largest cotton, onion and milk market. The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit. From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%.
