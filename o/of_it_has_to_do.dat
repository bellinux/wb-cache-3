2500|$|Another common term is [...] "Stud". A stud is a {{dominant}} lesbian, usually butch. They {{tend to be}} influenced by urban and hip-hop cultures and are often, but not always, Afro-American. In the New York City lesbian community a butch may identify herself as AG (aggressive) or as a stud. In 2005, filmmaker Daniel Peddle chronicled the lives of AGs in his documentary The Aggressives, following six women who went to lengths like binding their breasts to pass as men. But Peddle says that today, very young lesbians of color in New York are creating a new, insular scene that's largely cut {{off from the rest of}} the gay and lesbian community. [...] "A lot <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this kind of pressure to articulate and express your masculinity within the confines of the hip-hop paradigm..." [...] The AG culture has also been represented on film by Black lesbian filmmaker Dee Rees' 2011 work, Pariah.|$|E

Eventually, he found peace with most of his regrets in the 200th episode of the series [...] "Life Before His Eyes", where Gibbs learned that even if he had been present in their lives and thus prevented the sequence of events that ended in their deaths from ever coming to be, the path his life would have taken would have instead led to his own demise.|$|E
