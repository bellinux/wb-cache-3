5|$|Central America gained its {{independence}} along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence {{was signed in}} Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America.</b> The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.|$|E

5|$|The Weather Bureau {{first began}} cautioning areas <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> at 1600UTC on September26, advising people {{in areas of}} {{northeast}} Nicaragua and Honduras to take precautionary measures, along with all vessels and small craft in the Gulf of Honduras south to Cabo Gracias a Dios. After Janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest, advisories warned areas in British Honduras and Quintana Roo of hurricane-related impacts. Though no official warnings were issued for areas <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America,</b> advisories published by the Weather Bureau cautioned interests in the hurricane's path up until landfall. Evacuations took place in several coastal towns in Quintana Roo upon notification of the oncoming storm. People were evacuated to inland hillside shelters. After the hurricane moved through the Yucatán Peninsula and entered the Bay of Campeche, the Weather Bureau alerted areas in the storm's path {{on the western side}} of Mexico's Gulf Coast. At the time, Janet was expected to make landfall between Veracruz and Tuxpan. Areas were warned of the storm's potential flooding and coastal impacts. The Weather Bureau advised all small craft south of Port O'Connor, Texas to remain in port. Notifications of Janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfall.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance to Arlene brought significant rainfall {{to parts}} <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America,</b> killing three people and triggering widespread flooding and landslides. Throughout Mexico, prolonged rains from Arlene and subsequent flooding affected hundreds {{of homes and}} several roads, causing many residents to seek shelter. At {{the height of the}} storm, power was lost to 285,000homes. At least 22people in Mexico were killed by Arlene. Elsewhere, rainfall from the storm alleviated ongoing drought conditions in southern Texas and Florida.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Miriam {{hugged the}} coast <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> and {{reached its peak}} of 986millibars on October 24. Ordinarily, a {{pressure}} this low would indicate a Category1 hurricane, but due to its disorganized convection, Miriam was not upgraded to a hurricane. Land interaction and wind shear weakened Miriam to a tropical depression on October 26. Low-level winds carried the system out to sea, and its convection dissipated on October 28.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered}} the eastern Pacific Ocean on November 7. An area of convection along the wave tracked westward to the south <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> and Mexico, and became more concentrated on November 12 while located about 400miles (645km) south of Acapulco. Later that day, Dvorak classification began on the disturbance, and the convection continued to organize. Early on November 13, the National Hurricane Center indicated {{the possibility of the}} system developing into a tropical depression. Thunderstorm activity briefly decreased, though late on November 13 the system acquired enough circulation and organized convection for it to be designated Tropical Depression Twenty-One-E while located about 460miles (740km) south of Manzanillo, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not upgraded until eleven hours later.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} body {{of water}} in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed.

The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women to be wary of handsome strangers.|$|E

5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory, as {{the lower level}} center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America</b> and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered into the Pacific Ocean within a few days. Although {{the depression}} never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean {{and contributed to the}} development of Hurricane Juliette on September21.|$|E

At the time, Honduras itself was a part of Spain's Kingdom of Guatemala, and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America.</b> Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island, but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, a {{tropical}} depression formed {{off the coast}} <b>of</b> <b>Central</b> <b>America.</b> It moved west-northwest, passing southwest of the Revillagigedo Islands.

The tropical storm made landfall near San Pedro, California early on September 25 with winds of severe gale strength. It dissipated later that day. The strongest reported wind was of Force 11, reported by a ship, making this system a minimal hurricane. The lowest pressure was reported by the same ship and was 28.67inHg (971mb).|$|E
