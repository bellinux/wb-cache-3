5|$|In Poland, the {{earliest}} archeological sites considered Slavic include {{a limited number}} of 6th-century settlements and a few isolated burial sites. The material obtained there consists mostly of simple, manually formed ceramics, typical of the entire early Slavic area.

The largest of {{the earliest}} Slavic (Prague culture) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to systematic research is located in Bachórz, Rzeszów County, and dates to the second half of 5th through 7th centuries. It consisted of 12 nearly square, partially dug-out houses, each covering the area of 6.2 to 19.8 (14.0 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>average)</b> square meters. A stone furnace was usually placed in a corner, which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period, but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found. 45 newer dwellings of a different type from the 7th/8th to 9th/10th centuries have also been discovered in the vicinity.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{physical}} meaning of averaged amplitudes and intensities in parametric instabilities driven by a stochastic pump is addressed. The physical meaning of an averaged quantity is understood as its ability to yield a good estimate of the median of this quantity. In the limit of a purely temporal problem with a Gaussian white noise pump, rigorous results can be obtained which show that no physical meaning can be bestowed a priori either <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>averaged</b> amplitudes or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>averaged</b> intensities. A conjecture is proposed which enlarges this result to the general case. The statistics of the wave amplitudes is obtained by constructing a tractable weak solution to the parametric problem...|$|R

From its start, it runs east along the northern end of Torch Lake. M-88 zig-zags south and east along Scenic Highway to the community of Central Lake. In Central Lake it runs south along Main Street, following the western shore of Intermediate Lake. South of Intermediate Lake, M-88 crosses the Intermediate River on a historic designation-eligible Depression-era bridge along Bridge Street in Bellaire. This section of M-88 is just west of the Antrim County Airport before the highway turns east on Cayuga Street in downtown and south on Division Street. The Bellaire section of the trunkline is the location of the highest traffic levels along the highway.
