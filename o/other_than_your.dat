500|$|Steven Moffat {{left his}} job as an English teacher at Cowdenknowes High in Greenock to write the BAFTA-award winning show Press Gang. However, its high cost {{and changes in the}} {{executive}} structure at Central Independent Television meant that the show might not be recommissioned after its second series. As the writer wondered what to do next and was worried about future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Inspired by his experience in education (in addition to his own former career, his father was a headteacher), the writer's initial proposal was similar to what would become Chalk. However, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking more passionately at the meeting at the Groucho Club about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead. That idea became Joking Apart, which received low audience figures but a high rating on the Appreciation Index. In an interview with The Herald, Moffat reflected on the nature of writing from experience: [...] "I don't think you have an alternative to writing about what you know. You've no life experience to go on <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own. Even if you're writing something you think is entirely remote from you - Star Trek, for instance - you'll find the finished result is actually very close to your own experience. That's not a conscious decision a writer makes - it's an inevitability." ...|$|E

Apple told All Things Digital that the app violated {{two of its}} developer agreement clauses, including [...] "Apps that display Apps <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own for purchase or promotion {{in a manner similar}} to or confusing with the App Store will be rejected" [...] and [...] "Apps cannot use Push Notifications to send advertising, promotions, or direct marketing of any kind". Apple did, however, tell the developers they were [...] "welcome to resubmit" [...] after changing the app, though there was [...] "not much hope that it could survive in anything like its current incarnation".|$|E

6000|$|Before Richard {{could speak}} for them, {{the two boys}} came in, eager and breathless. [...] "Father!" [...] cried Humfrey, [...] "who think you is at Hull? Why, none <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> old friend and shipmate, Captain Frobisher!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The purser will fetch your husband, madame," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "In fact, that officer {{has already been}} {{notified}} that you are entertaining a man <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> husband behind the locked door of your cabin." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You want no <b>other</b> {{recommendation}} <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own acts--your courage, your fidelity. All {{that you}} do and say, Pathfinder, my reason approves, and the heart will, nay, it shall follow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Father," [...] she said, [...] "what means this? Have you {{forgotten}} the confidence in Heaven {{which you are}} wont to recommend, that you bear <b>other</b> arms <b>than</b> <b>your</b> order assigns to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arthur, Arthur!" [...] exclaimed {{the other}} wildly; [...] "you say I am your dearest friend--Let me be more. Oh, can't {{you see that}} the angelic being I love--the purest, the best of women--is no <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> dear, dear angel of a--mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No formalities," [...] he said. [...] "We must {{forget that}} I am aught <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> slave. If all {{has been as}} {{carefully}} carried out {{as it has been}} planned, we have no time to waste. Instead we should be upon our way to the slave market. Are you ready?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The grave {{features}} of the commander-in-chief relaxed in a smile. [...] "You are more happy than most of your sex in turning a verbal compliment to practical account. For know then, dear young lady, that in honor of your visit to the headquarters, the password to-night through this encampment was none <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own pretty patronymic,--'Thankful Blossom.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{may well}} be ashamed to confess it," [...] he said; [...] "you may well feel that you dare not {{look me in the}} face as you {{pronounce}} the words. I would have believed it, Clara, from no <b>other</b> mouth <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{held out}} his hand to Uncle Ben. [...] "Let me congratulate you," [...] he said heartily, [...] "and forgive me if your story really sounded so {{wonderful}} I couldn't quite grasp it. Now {{let me ask you something}} more. Have you had any reason for keeping this a secret, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> fear of confessing that you violated a few bigoted and idiotic mining rules--which, after all, are binding only upon sentiment--and which your success has proved to be utterly impractical?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Her mother woke {{with a loud}} wail. [...] "My bairn! My bairn!" [...] {{snatching}} him to her arms. [...] "This is none <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> Dutchman's doings, girl. Have him to the dungeon! Where are the stocks? Oh, my pretty boy! He breathed, he is living. Give me the wine!" [...] Then {{as there}} was no opening of the pale lips, she fell into another tempest of tears, during which Grisell rushed to the stair, where on the lowest step she met Lambert and Ridley.|$|E
6000|$|... "It cuts me to {{the heart}} to see you so grieved," [...] said he. [...] "But pray {{let me assure you}} that your father's {{interests}} shall not be sacrificed if it be possible for me to protect them. I will tell the bishop openly what are the facts. I will explain to him that he has hardly the right to appoint any <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> father, and will show him that if he does so he will be guilty of great injustice--and you, Mrs. Bold, you will have the charity at any rate to believe this of me, that I am truly anxious for your father's welfare--for his and for your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then two {{men have}} lied," [...] she {{asserted}} without heat. [...] "I have not spoken to Baron von Schoenvorts <b>other</b> <b>than</b> in <b>your</b> presence when first we came aboard the U-33. And please, when you address me, remember that to <b>others</b> <b>than</b> my intimates I am Miss La Rue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} a horse," [...] she said, [...] "and that will insure an early visit from you, for, of course, {{you will not}} trust the animal to <b>other</b> hands <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own. I would ask you to stay, but {{that would not be}} {{treating}} the captain kindly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are soon rid of, Sir Damian," [...] {{said the}} man; [...] "and I pray {{you to take}} some patience, when you {{remember}} that ten minutes since you had little right to think these bracelets would have been removed for any <b>other</b> purpose <b>than</b> <b>your</b> progress to the scaffold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{will leave}} me here,' she continued, 'mistress of your house; and if God spares me, here {{you will find}} me. They can't move me from this. Your father says so. They may call me what they will, but they cannot move me. There is the Lord above us, and before Him they cannot make me <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> wife,--your wife,--your wife.' As she {{repeated}} the name, she put the boy out to him, {{and when he had}} taken the child, she stretched out her hands upwards, and falling on her knees at his feet, prayed to God for his deliverance. 'Let him come back to us, O my God. Deliver him from his enemies, and let him come back to us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the heart}} of the jungle, dear," [...] she said, [...] "with no other form of right or justice to appeal to <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own mighty muscles, you would be {{warranted}} in executing upon this man the sentence he deserves; but with the strong arm of a civilized government at your disposal it would be murder to kill him now. Even your friends would have to submit to your arrest, or if you resisted it would plunge us all into misery and unhappiness again. I cannot bear to lose you again, my Tarzan. Promise me that you will but turn him over to Captain Dufranne, and let the law take its course--the beast is not worth risking our happiness for." ...|$|E
6000|$|Here Harry Smith became uneasy in his chair, {{lifted the}} flagon, set it down, and at length exclaimed: [...] "The devil take the young Highland whelp and his whole kindred! What has Catharine {{to do to}} {{instruct}} such a fellow as he? He will be just like the wolf cub that I was fool enough to train to the offices of a dog, and every one thought him reclaimed, till, in an ill hour, I went {{to walk on the}} hill of Moncrieff, when he broke loose on the laird's flock, and made a havoc that I might well have rued, had the laird not wanted a harness at the time. And I marvel that you, being a sensible man, father Glover, will keep this Highland young fellow--a likely one, I promise you--so nigh to Catharine, as if there were no <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> daughter to serve him for a schoolmistress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so. You left Ticonderoga as guide, and {{it would}} not be seemly in me, who am a {{stranger}} here as well as a lad unaccustomed to this sort of warfare which is now being conducted, to do <b>other</b> <b>than</b> follow <b>your</b> lead; but----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{would you}} like," [...] said the editor, {{after a short}} reflection, [...] "to allow us to publish the stories you have {{recently}} written under some <b>other</b> name <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own? That would satisfy us and the public, would put money in your pocket, and would not interfere with your reputation." ...|$|R
50|$|Napkins {{should be}} placed on the lap and not tucked into clothing.

6000|$|... "Well, go along, Malchus, {{do not let}} us keep you, and don't {{get into}} {{mischief}} and remember, my boy," [...] his mother added, [...] "that Carthage {{is a place where}} it is well that no one should make more enemies than he can help. A secret foe in the council or among the judges is enough to ruin the strongest. You know how many have been crucified or pressed to death without a shadow of pretext, save that they had foes. I would not see you <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> father's son; you will belong, of course, to the Barcine party, but there is no occasion to draw enmity and hate upon yourself before you {{are in a position to}} do real service to the cause. And now ride off with you; I know all our words are falling on deaf ears, and that willful lads will go their own way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{dodged the}} dentist! That was wrong." [...] As Brant made a slight {{movement}} of deprecation the President continued: [...] "I understand! Not from fear of giving pain to yourself but to others. I don't know that THAT is right, either. A {{certain amount of}} pain must be suffered in this world--even by one's enemies. Well, I have looked into your case, General Brant." [...] He took {{up a piece of}} paper from his desk, scrawled with two or three notes in pencil. [...] "I think {{this is the way it}} stands. You were commanding a position at Gray Oaks when information was received by the department that, either through neglect or complicity, spies were passing through your lines. There was no attempt to prove your neglect; your orders, the facts of your personal care and precaution, were all before the department. But it was also shown that your wife, from whom you were only temporarily separated, was a notorious secessionist; that, before the war, you yourself were suspected, and that, therefore, you were quite capable of evading your own orders, which you may have only given as a blind. On this information you were relieved by the department of your command. Later on it was discovered that the spy was none <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> own wife, disguised as a mulatto; that, after her arrest by your own soldiers, you connived at her escape--and this was considered conclusive proof of--well, let us say--your treachery." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{people of}} Granada were a versatile, {{unsteady}} race, and exceedingly given {{to make and}} unmake kings. They had {{for a long time}} vacillated between old Muley Abul Hassan and his son, Boabdil el Chico, sometimes setting up the one, sometimes the other, and sometimes both at once, according to the pinch and pressure of external evils. They found, however, that the evils still went on increasing in defiance of every change, and were at their wits' end to devise some new combination or arrangement by which an efficient government might be wrought out of two bad kings. When the tidings arrived of the fall of Ronda, and the consequent ruin of the frontier, a tumultuous assemblage took place in one of the public squares. As usual, the people attributed the misfortunes of the country to the faults of their rulers, for the populace never imagine that any part of their miseries can originate with themselves. A crafty alfaqui, named Alyme Mazer, who had watched the current of their discontents, rose and harangued them. [...] "You have been choosing and changing," [...] said he, [...] "between two monarchs; and who and what are they? Muley Abul Hassan for one, a man worn out by age and infirmities, unable to sally forth against the foe, even when ravaging to the very gates of the city; and Boabdil el Chico for the other, an apostate, a traitor, a deserter from his throne, a fugitive among the enemies of his nation, a man fated to misfortune, and proverbially named 'the Unlucky.' In a time of overwhelming war like the present he only is fit to sway a sceptre who can wield a sword. Would you seek such a man? You need not look far. Allah has sent such a one in this time of distress to retrieve the fortunes of Granada. You already know whom I mean. You know that it can be no <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> general, the invincible Abdallah, whose surname of El Zagal has become a watchword in battle rousing the courage of the faithful and striking terror into the unbelievers." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kool Moe Dee {{suggests}} {{the change in}} how the term is used happened somewhere {{in the mid to}} late 1980s, saying, [...] "until 1986, all freestyles were written," [...] and [...] "before the 1990s it was about how hard you could come with a written rhyme with no particular subject matter and no real purpose <b>other</b> <b>than</b> showing <b>your</b> lyrical prowess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{and what}} did you lose when you showed {{yourself}} not only a traitor to the Cause, but a cur, gaining the confidence of your comrades only that you might betray them to a British prison?
