50|$|Type 343 is a 2-D air {{search radar}} with MTBF of 40 hours, and in {{addition}} to control guns, it is also used for anti-ship missile fire control. As a 2-D air search radar, Type 343 can only provide bearing and range, and to provide altitude information on the target, a large <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> set is needed, which requires an operator. Therefore, an operator’s cupola is attached to the radar, immediately behind the antenna. An improved version Type 343-Gai (改), has the operator cupola deleted and the bulky complex <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> set replaced by a compact, but far more capable electro-optical sensor (EO) that is only a tiny fraction size of the original equipment it replaced. As more advanced radars available, Type 343 has been phased from active service in Chinese navy.|$|E

50|$|As {{mounted on}} the AML-90, the D921 has an {{elevation}} of +15° and a depression of −8°. It is provided with a co-axial 7.62mm machine gun {{to the left of}} the main armament. The turret is traversed by rotating the gunner's handwheels, which are not power assisted. Cranking the turret through a full 360° takes approximately twenty-five seconds. A total of 20 90mm shells and 2,400 rounds of machine gun ammunition are carried. The 90mm high-explosive anti-tank round possesses a muzzle velocity of 750 m/s and will penetrate 320mm of armour at an incidence of 0°, or 120mm of armour at 60°. The high-explosive round has a muzzle velocity of 650 m/s. These rather low velocity performances, although suitable for close combat, make hit probability poor at extended ranges and proved to be a serious handicap when fighting tanks. Combat experience during the South African Border War and the Six Day War proved that the AML was decisively outranged by both the T-34/85 and the M48 Patton, respectively. Its rather austere fire control, with <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> based on the crew commander's estimates, was also problematic. The vehicle is unable to fire on the move, since its transmission cannot absorb the recoil of such a large gun while in forward motion and suffers excessive wear as a result. Nevertheless, during at least three conflicts the AML proved capable of knocking out main battle tanks, often by attacking from the flank or rear. The heaviest armour destroyed by an AML-90 was likely a Libyan T-62 during the Toyota War, in March 1988.|$|E

30|$|For {{efficiency}} consideration, {{there is}} no need of two separated systems. And the integrated system of <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> and communication features the following advantages: (1) cooperative safety application becomes possible, and (2) the physical position of each node can be used to optimize networking. Nevertheless, a limited number of publications considered to combine the <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> and communication together. Mizui et al. proposed a vehicle-to-vehicle communication and ranging system by multiplying the bit information to the spread spectrum (SS) code and measuring the phase shift of the SS code [9]. However, this system can only measure distance instead of acquiring the location information. In addition, it can operate with one target only. In order to get both the distance and location information, at least two receivers are needed [10]. In [11], a multi-user ranging and communication scheme was proposed, which makes this system be operated between multiple vehicles simultaneously. Techniques like frequency hopping and code hopping are also developed to reduce the SS code collision probability [12, 13].|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, {{there has}} been a trend that more and more {{automobile}} manufacturers are using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the light source due to their high efficiency, low cost, and fancy styling. This provides potential to emit ranging and communication signal with these LEDs. A lot of work has been done separately in LED <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> or communication for vehicular applications. In [3], the distance was calculated from the geometrical transformation of the position of LED markers mounted on the vehicle with an imaging-based technique. A low-cost LED ranging sensor for collision avoidance was designed in [4], which measures the time of flight of an optical pulse to determine the distance. Also, another time-of-flight <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> system was proposed in [5], using a two-dimension imaging sensor to offer better lateral resolution. For vehicular optical communication, Cui et al. proposed an outdoor line-of-sight (LOS) visible light communication (VLC) path loss model and validated it by measurements [6]. In [7], the VLC channel models for intelligent transportation system application reflecting practical conditions were simulated. The effects of sunlight and other active VLC transmitters were also examined in [8].|$|E
40|$|Delay {{tracking}} of spread-spectrum signals {{is widely used}} for ranging in radio frequency based navigation. Its use in non-coherent <b>optical</b> <b>ranging,</b> however, has not been extensively studied since optical channels are less subject to narrowband interference situations where these techniques become more useful. In this work, an early-late delay-locked loop adapted to indoor <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> is presented and analyzed. The specific constraints of free-space infrared channels in this context substantially differ from those typically considered in radio frequency applications. The tracking stage {{is part of an}} infrared differential range measuring system with application to mobile target indoor localization. Spread-spectrum signals are used in this context to provide accurate ranging while reducing the effect of multipath interferences. The performance of the stage regarding noise and dynamic errors is analyzed and validated, providing expressions that allow an adequate selection of the design parameters depending on the expected input signal characteristics. The behavior of the stage in a general multipath scenario is also addressed to estimate the multipath error bounds. The results, evaluated under realistic conditions corresponding to an 870 nm link with 25 MHz chip-rate, built with low-cost up-to-date devices, show that an overall error below 6 % of a chip time can be achieved...|$|E

30|$|Even {{though the}} imaging-based method can greatly reduce the {{interference}} between {{users in the}} LOS communication link, there still exists {{the possibility that the}} backscattered signal could interrupt another user. Also, the signal could be corrupted by the noise. The spread spectrum (SS) code is robust against multiuser and noise. Employing the pulsed SS waveform as the ranging signal can reach a high peak power, which will bring a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and provide a longer operation distance, while maintaining a relative low average power. Low average power is crucial to eye safety which is usually the limit of the <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> system. And the optical communication system will also benefit from the SS code on rejecting the multiuser interference. There are several SS codes we could use in our system, and the performance may vary depending on different applications [17].|$|E
40|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is an <b>optical</b> <b>ranging</b> technique {{analogous to}} radar — detection of back-scattered light produces {{a signal that}} is temporally localized at times-of-flight corresponding {{to the location of}} scatterers in the ob-ject. However the interferometric collection technique used in OCT allows, in principle, the coherent collection of data, i. e. amplitude and phase information can be extracted. Interfer-ometric Synthetic Aperture Microscopy (ISAM) adds phase-stable data collection to OCT instrumentation and employs physics-based processing analogous to that used in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). That is, the complex nature of the co-herent data is exploited to give gains in image quality. Specif-ically, diffraction-limited resolution is achieved throughout the sample, not just within focal volume of the illuminating field. Simulated and experimental verifications of this effect are presented.

40|$|The {{study of}} stellar populations in early-type galaxies in {{different}} environments {{is a powerful}} tool for constraining their star formation histories. This study has been traditionally restricted to the <b>optical</b> <b>range,</b> where dwarfs around the turn-off and stars {{at the base of the}} red giant branch dominate the integrated light at all ages. The near-infrared spectral range is especially interesting since in the presence of an intermediate-age population, asymptotic giant branch stars are the main contributors. In this Letter, we measure the near-infrared indices Na I and D(CO) for a sample of 12 early-type galaxies in low-density environments and compare them with the Fornax galaxy sample presented by Silva et al [...] The analysis of these indices in combination with Lick/IDS indices in the <b>optical</b> <b>range</b> reveals that (1) the Na I index is a metallicity indicator as good as C 4668 in the <b>optical</b> <b>range,</b> and (2) D(CO) is a tracer of intermediate-age stellar populations.
