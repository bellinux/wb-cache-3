5|$|In the 19th century, recessions {{frequently}} {{coincided with}} financial crises. Determining {{the occurrence of}} pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers <b>or</b> <b>business</b> ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the economic system such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.|$|E
5|$|Segments of {{the road}} were {{upgraded}} in 1956 between Coopersville and Marne, Portland and Eagle, and Brighton and Farmington.

Segments of the old highway were retained in the state highway system under different numbers. Sections through Portland, Lansing, Howell, Farmington and Detroit were given Business Loop (BL) <b>or</b> <b>Business</b> Spur (BS) I-96 designations. The section between Lansing and Webberville became part of an extended M-43. Other sections in the Detroit area became parts of M-102, M-5, or unsigned state highway.|$|E
