5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> the foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.|$|E
5|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> iron's {{symbolic}} role may {{be found}} in the German Campaign of 1813. Frederick William III commissioned then the first Iron Cross as military decoration. Berlin iron jewellery reached its peak production between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian royal family urged citizens to donate gold and silver jewellery for military funding. The inscription Gold gab ich für Eisen (I gave gold for iron) was used as well in later war efforts.|$|E
5|$|Aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> causal structure, Roger Penrose {{and others}} {{developed}} {{what is known}} as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.|$|E

5|$|Bryant's career did not recover.

5|$|In the 1970s Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} punctuated equilibrium which holds that stasis is the most prominent feature of the fossil record, and that most evolutionary changes occur rapidly over relatively short periods of time.

Also in the early 1980s, statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine organisms published by Jack Sepkoski and David M.

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} silver {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 107Ag and 109Ag, with 107Ag being slightly more abundant (51.839% natural abundance). This almost equal abundance is rare in the periodic table. The atomic weight is 107.8682(2) u; this value is very important because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> silver compounds, particularly halides, in gravimetric analysis. Both isotopes of silver are produced in stars via the s-process (slow neutron capture), {{as well as in}} supernovas via the r-process (rapid neutron capture).|$|E

Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on October 1, 1890. The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite high country.|$|E

40|$|How {{might we}} measure <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> a web site?

Suppose x 1,x 2, [...] .,xn are <b>the</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> all n <b>of</b> <b>the</b> web sites in the world. We want <b>the</b> <b>importance</b> <b>of</b> each web site to be proportional to <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sites that link to it. That’s a system of equations that might look like this-x 1 = K(x 14 + x 97 + x 541) x 2 = K(x 1003 + x 3224 + x 9773 + x 10029) in which K is <b>the</b> constant <b>of</b> proportionality, and on <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> each equation is <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sites that link to {{the one on the}} left.
