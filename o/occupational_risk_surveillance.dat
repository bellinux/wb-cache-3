40|$|DXA {{measurement}} of areal bone mineral density [aBMD,g/cm 2] {{is required by}} NASA for assessing skeletal integrity in astronauts. Due to the abundance of population-based data that correlate hip and spine BMDs to fragility fractures, BMD is widely applied {{as a predictor of}} fractures in the general aging population. In contrast, QCT is primarily a research technology that measures three-dimensional, volumetric BMD (vBMD,mg/cm 3) of bone and is therefore capable of differentiating between cortical and trabecular components. Additionally, when combined with Finite Element Modeling [FEM], a computational tool, QCT data can be used to estimate the whole bone strength of the hip [FE strength] for a specific load vector. A recent report demonstrated that aBMD failed to correlate with incurred changes in FE strength (for fall and stance loading) by astronauts over typical 180 -day ISS (International Space Station) missions. While there are no current guidelines for using QCT data in clinical practice, QCT increases the understanding of how bone structure and mineral content are affected by spaceflight and recovery on Earth. In order to understand/promote/consider the use of QCT, NASA convened a panel of clinicians specializing in osteoporosis. After reviewing the available, albeit limited, medical and research information from long-duration astronauts (e. g., data from DXA, QCT, FEM, biochemistry analyses, medical records and in-flight exercise performance) the panelists were charged with recommending how current and future research data and analyses could inform clinical and operational decisions. The Panel recommended that clinical bone tests on astronauts should include QCT (hip and lumbar spine) for <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> <b>surveillance</b> and for the estimation of whole hip bone strength as derived by FEM. FE strength will provide an improved index that NASA could use to select astronauts of optimal bone health for extended duration missions, for repeat missions or for specific mission operations...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present {{paper is}} divided into three major areas: the {{analysis}} of <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> implications at national and international level, the European priorities in terms of <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> and the existing cloud computing services. Since human resource is present within each organization, it is required a comprehensive and actual assessment of the processes in which they participate. Like in any daily activity, processes and people contribute to the emergence of risks. If each organization creates healthy and safe workplaces that means that it contributes to the sustainable development of the area in which it operates. It can be said that <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> assessment and <b>occupational</b> health and safety is the foundation for optimal functioning of the enterprise, thus aiding in reaching the enterprise objectives. The combination of these key concepts, <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> and <b>occupational</b> health and safety with technological developments contribute to an innovative approach to risk.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Physiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. In the South African Mining Industry the Legislator has {{recognised}} {{the need}} to identify health hazards associated with any workplace or process and to assess,the associated risks (Leon, 1994). Neither the Mine Health and Safety Act (29 / 1996) and its Regulations, nor the Occupational Health and Safety Act (85 / 1993) and its Regulations, prescribe a specific format for the systematic and holistic approach to conduct <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments, but do prescribe some critical matters that should be addressed within an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment. The need for a systematic, holistic approach for conducting an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment is discussed by Smith (1999) in his article, Mine Occupational Health and Safety - towards a holistic solution. The article highlighted that a core concept arising from the Mine Health and Safety Act is {{the need to}} address occupational health issues from a systematic perspective that encompasses all aspects of the interaction of employees with the work environment. Guidelines for conducting <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments, as per legal requirement are limited in the mining industry. The absence of any specific model or guide usually results in the non-adherence or ignoring of the principles of occupational health, and that the principles of the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process are not explained to those developing their own approaches. The mining industry is also not aware of or focused on the key ingredients of an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment and some of the potential pitfalls. The objective {{of the study was to}} research the principles of the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process. To develop and evaluate a holistic <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment model for the South African Mining Industry, based on the basic principles of occupational health and the legislative requirement for <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments. This will not only guide persons through conducting an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment, but will also simplify the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process. However, still delivering scientifically sound assessment records to ensure an adequate A set of key elements (minimum components) for a comprehensive <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process were identified. With the set of key elements identified, an audit protocol to evaluate current <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment processes (including procedures, systems and strategies) within the South African Mining Industry were developed. Audits were conducted and trends analysed to identify shortcomings in current applied <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment processes. Results from the study indicate that at present, <b>occupational</b> health <b>risks</b> are not properly quantified. A number of potential health hazards such as vibration, radiation (ionising and non-ionising radiation), ergonomics, psychological and biological stressors are in general excluded from current <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment scopes. <b>Occupational</b> hygiene measurement results and results from medical surveillance (when available) are seldom considered or used as information for the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment or as part of the review of <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments. Sources of health hazards and risks are not properly identified, controlled and communicated to employers and employees. Interaction with employee representatives via the Health and Safety Committees or Representatives during the planning and conductance phases of the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process is limited. More than often the conductance of <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments is the responsibility of a single person without the use of "assessment teams". Consultation with the Health and Safety Committee I Representative before measures are determined to address identified health risks is absent in most cases. The outcome of <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments is not used to compile area risk profiles, man-job specifications or as a basis for occupational hygiene monitoring strategies, <b>risk</b> based medical <b>surveillance</b> or training on health hazards present in the workplace. These form the basis for the development of an occupational health programme and the absence of these could result in improper risk management and would negatively impact on the health status of the employees. The findings of the study confirm the central theoretical statement of the research project, i. e. that a need exists in the South African Mining Industry for a model, based on the requirements of the Mine Health and Safety Act (2911996) and other best practices, to guide employers through the fundamentals of a suitable and sufficient assessment of health risks. Although a large amount of risk assessment models are available of which some were analysed as part of the study, only a few of these models are occupational health specific, of which even fewer are mining specific or prescribe a specific format for a systematic and holistic approach to conduct <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments, in line with the requirements set by the Mine Health and Safety Act (29 / 1996) for the conductance and contents of an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment. An <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment model, guidelines and templates were developed and tested through comprehensive <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments conducted at base for the development of all other occupational health systems and programmes. The focus of the study was the Mine Health and Safety Act (29 / 1996) and it's Regulations, with specific focus on Regulation 9 of the Act. The requirements set by this piece of legislation for conducting an <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment were studied in detail. Similar requirements for the South African Industry (other than mining) by the Occupational Health and Safety Act (85 / 1993), and specifically by the Hazardous Chemical Substances Regulations, Asbestos Regulations and Lead Regulations of the Act, were also studied. A comparison was drawn between the requirements of all these Regulations. International legislation and best practices on conducting <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessments were also researched and compared to South African legislation and best practices. three different workplaces. The holistic model for the <b>occupational</b> health <b>risk</b> assessment process was evaluated against the requirements of the Mine Health and Safety Act (29 / 1996) and the ability of the model to guide employers through suitable and sufficient assessments of the health risks.

High strain was strongly associated with two occupational categories: midwives (2. 33 OR; CI 1. 41 - 3. 85), full-time employment (1. 65 OR; CI 1. 24 - 2. 19), hypnotics and sedatives use (1. 41 OR; CI 1. 11 - 1. 79), analgesics use (1. 37 OR; CI 1. 13 - 1. 66). CONCLUSION: Moroccan HCWs, physicians included, perceive their job as high strain. Moroccan HCWs use of hypnotics, sedatives and analgesics is high. Risk prevention plan implementation is highly recommended. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Objectives: A {{cross-sectional}} study {{to evaluate the}} <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> for Helicobacter pylori infection, on top of other risk factors, in staff members of institutions for people with intellectual disability. In these institutions, the residents had a documented high prevalence of H pylori infection (86 % presenting antibodies). As a control group, the study used administrative workers from other companies. Methods: All participants completed a questionnaire concerning sociodemographic characteristics, medical history and employment data and they underwent a serology test. Results: 671 staff members of the institutions and 439 subjects {{in the control group}} participated in the study. Prevalence of H pylori antibodies was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (40. 6 % vs 29. 2 %; p < 0. 001). Crude odds ratio for <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> was 1. 68; adjusting for the confounding effect of age, gender, body mass index, smoking, tropical journeys and number of household members during childhood resulted in an even higher (adjusted) OR of 1. 98 (95 % CI 1. 42 to 2. 69). In multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for variables shown to be confounders, faecal contact continued to be significantly associated with H pylori infection. Attributable risk was 49. 5 %. Conclusions: H pylori infection is an <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> in healthcare workers working in institutions for people with intellectual disability. We identified faecal contact as an independent <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> factor for H pylori infection...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The aim was {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between exposure to <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> factors during working life and physical disability after retirement. DESIGN [...] The study was a cross sectional epidemiological survey of a representative sample of retired subjects belonging to a supplementary pension fund in the Paris area. SETTING [...] The study took place in the general community. PATIENTS [...] 307 men and 320 women (63. 1 % of those approached) answered a questionnaire during home interviews. Their average age was 69 (SD 4) years at the beginning of the survey. Whether or not subjects had been exposed to <b>occupational</b> <b>risks</b> was determined from their statements concerning the presence or absence of eight harmful environmental conditions while at work. Physical disability was defined as difficulty in carrying out seven basic activities of daily life. MAIN RESULTS [...] The results of univariate analyses showed significant relationships between exposure during working life to <b>occupational</b> <b>risks</b> including noise, heat, dust, carrying heavy loads, and awkward postures on the one hand, and the presence of a physical disability after retirement on the other. Multivariate analysis based on logistic regression models that took account of age, sex, and health impairments revealed a specific link between exposure to carrying heavy loads and physical disability after retirement. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results suggest that <b>occupational</b> <b>risk</b> factors might be important in determining such disability in retired people...|$|R
