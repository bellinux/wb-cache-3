She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with Tall Story, in which she recreated one of her Broadway roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by Anthony Perkins. Period of Adjustment and Walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> followed in 1962.

5|$|Gay {{characters}} {{also were}} often killed {{off at the}} end, such as the death of Sandy Dennis' character {{at the end of}} The Fox in 1968. If not victims, lesbians were depicted as villains or morally corrupt, such as portrayals of brothel madames by Barbara Stanwyck in Walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> from 1962 and Shelley Winters in The Balcony in 1963. Lesbians as predators were presented in Rebecca (1940), women's prison films like Caged (1950), or in the character Rosa Klebb in From Russia with Love (1963). Lesbian vampire themes have reappeared in Dracula's Daughter (1936), Blood and Roses (1960), Vampyros Lesbos (1971), and The Hunger (1983). Basic Instinct (1992) featured a bisexual murderer played by Sharon Stone; it was one of several films that set off a storm of protests about the depiction of gays as predators.|$|E
25|$|Bass once {{described}} his main goal for his title sequences as being to ‘’try {{to reach for}} a simple, visual phrase that tells you what the picture is all about and evokes {{the essence of the}} story”. Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as “making the ordinary extraordinary” can be seen in Walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape. In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the dreadful}} {{confusion}} and {{din of the}} storming of the city, Croesus himself had a very narrow escape from death. He was saved by the miraculous speaking of his deaf and dumb son--at least such is the story. Cyrus had given positive orders to his soldiers, both before <b>the</b> great battle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> plain and during the siege, that, though they might slay whomever else they pleased, they must not harm Croesus, but must take him alive. During {{the time of the}} storming of the town, when the streets were filled with infuriated soldiers, those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> one <b>side</b> <b>wild</b> with <b>the</b> excitement of triumph, and those <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other maddened with rage and despair, a party, rushing along, overtook Croesus and his helpless son, whom the unhappy father, it seems, was making a desperate effort to save. The Persian soldiers were about to transfix Croesus with their spears, when the son, who had never spoken before, called out, [...] "It is Croesus; do not kill him." [...] The soldiers were arrested by the words, and saved the monarch's life. They made him prisoner, and bore him away to Cyrus.|$|R
25|$|In 1955, Elaine Makatura came to {{work with}} Bass in his Los Angeles office. By 1960, with the opening to Spartacus, she was {{directing}} and producing title sequences, and in 1961 the two married, beginning more than 40 years of close collaboration. After {{the birth of their}} children, Jennifer in 1964 and Jeffrey in 1967, they concentrated on their family, film directing, and title sequences. Saul and Elaine designed title sequences for more than 40 years, continuously experimenting with a variety of innovative techniques and effects, from Bunraku-style maneuvers in Spartacus (1960), live-action sequences in Walk <b>On</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> (1962), to time-lapse photography in The Age of Innocence (1993), and even chopped liver in Mr. Saturday Night (1992). Their live-action opening title sequences often served as prologues to their films and transitioned seamlessly into their opening scenes. These “time before” title sequences either compress or expand time with startling results. The title sequence to Grand Prix (1966) portrays the moments before the opening race in Monte Carlo, the title sequence to The Big Country (1958) depicts the days it takes a stage coach to travel to a remote Western town, and the opening montage title sequence to The Victors (1963) chronicles the twenty-seven years between World War I and the middle of World War II, where the film begins.|$|E

Fonda was not {{positive}} about the experience of working with him: [...] "There are actors and actors – {{and then there are}} the Laurence Harveys. With them, it's like acting by yourself." [...] The same year, he recorded an album of spoken excerpts from the book This Is My Beloved by Walter Benton, accompanied by original music by Herbie Mann. It was released on the Atlantic label.|$|E
2500|$|In one {{chapter of}} his book <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> (1992), Martin Gardner {{discusses}} the Hollow Earth model articulated by Abdelkader. According to Gardner, this hypothesis posits that light rays travel in circular paths, and slow as they approach {{the center of the}} spherical star-filled cavern. No energy can reach the center of the cavern, which corresponds to no point a finite distance away from Earth in the widely accepted scientific cosmology. A drill, Gardner says, would lengthen as it traveled away from the cavern and eventually pass through the [...] "point at infinity" [...] corresponding {{to the center of the}} Earth in the widely accepted scientific cosmology. Supposedly no experiment can distinguish between the two cosmologies.|$|E

2500|$|Renato Castellani won the Grand Prix at the Venice Film Festival for his 1954 film of Romeo and Juliet. His film {{contains}} interpolated scenes {{intended to}} establish the class system and Catholicism of Renaissance Verona, {{and the nature of}} the feud. Some of Castellani's changes have been criticised as ineffective: interpolated dialogue is often banal, and the Prince's appearances are reimagined as formal hearings: undermining the spontaneity of Benvolio's defence of Romeo's behaviour in the duel scene. The major supporting roles are vastly reduced, including that of the nurse; Mercutio becomes (in the words of Daniel Rosenthal) [...] "the tiniest of cameos" [...] and Friar Laurence [...] "an irritating ditherer", although Pauline Kael, who loved the film, called this Friar Laurence [...] "a radiantly silly little man". Castellani's most prominent changes related to Romeo's character, cutting back or removing scenes involving his parents, Benvolio and Mercutio in order to highlight Romeo's isolation, and inserting a parting scene in which Montague coldly pulls his banished son out of Lady Montague's farewell embrace. Another criticism made by film scholar Patricia Tatspaugh is that the realism of the settings, so carefully established throughout the film, [...] "goes seriously off the rails when it come to the Capulets' vault". Castellani uses competing visual images in relation to the central characters: ominous grilles (and their shadows) contrasted with frequent optimistic shots of blue sky. A well-known stage Romeo, John Gielgud, played Castellani's chorus (and would reprise the role in the 1978 BBC Shakespeare version). Laurence Harvey, as Romeo, was already an experienced screen actor, who would shortly take over roles intended for the late James Dean in Walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>Side</b> and Summer and Smoke. By contrast, Susan Shentall, as Juliet, was a secretarial student who was discovered by the director in a London pub, and was cast for her [...] "pale sweet skin and honey-blonde hair". She failed to rise to the demands of the role, and would marry shortly after the shoot, never returning to screen acting. Other parts were played by inexperienced actors, also: Mercutio was played by an architect, Montague by a gondolier from Venice, and the Prince by a novelist. Critics responded to the film as a piece of cinema (its visuals were especially admired in Italy, where it was filmed) but not as a performance of Shakespeare's play: Robert Hatch in The Nation said [...] "We had come to see a play... perhaps we should not complain that we were shown a sumptuous travelogue", and Time's reviewer added that [...] "Castellani's Romeo and Juliet is a fine film poem... Unfortunately it is not Shakespeare's poem!" ...|$|E
