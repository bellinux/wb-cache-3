5|$|After battle, a {{currency}} called Grade is awarded or subtracted based on specific criteria that are fulfilled in battle. It {{is used to}} purchase bonuses during New Game Plus. Players are also prompted to cook food after battles {{if they have the}} materials. Cooking recipes determine the benefits received such as health recovery.

5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the first}} argument, power in excess of {{immediate}} demand is exported to neighbouring countries at lower prices.

25|$|The {{provision}} of a lighthouse {{is a standard}} example of a public good, since {{it is difficult to}} exclude ships from using its services. No ship's use detracts from that of others, but since most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of a lighthouse accrues to ships using particular ports, lighthouse maintenance can be profitably bundled with port fees (Ronald Coase, The Lighthouse in Economics 1974). This has been sufficient to fund actual lighthouses.|$|E
25|$|In 1867 both Cardinal Cullen and Woodlock {{travelled}} to Dundalk for the consecration of Michael Kiernan as Archbishop of Armagh. While there, {{they visited}} the Marist College {{and believed that}} Marist administration would be beneficial to the Catholic University School. Subsequently, Cullenbrought the offer to the General Council of the Marist Fathers in Lyons in France.

25|$|This {{strategy}} {{can have}} two advantages. Firstly, the intermediate {{may be more}} easily extracted, and in higher yield, than the ultimate desired product. An {{example of this is}} paclitaxel, which can be manufactured by extracting 10-deacetylbaccatin III from T. brevifolia needles, then carrying out a four-step synthesis. Secondly, the route designed between semisynthetic starting material and ultimate product may permit analogues of the final product to be synthesized. The newer generation semisynthetic penicillins are an illustration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of this approach.|$|E

25|$|Scientific {{management}} lowered worker {{morale and}} exacerbated existing conflicts between labor and management. As a consequence, the method inadvertently strengthened {{labor unions and}} their bargaining power in labor disputes, thereby neutralizing most or all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of any productivity gains it had achieved. Thus its net benefit to owners and management ended up as small or negative. It took new efforts, borrowing some ideas from scientific management but mixing them with others, to produce more productive formulas.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, CBO {{estimated}} {{that more than}} half of the combined benefits of 10 major tax expenditures would apply to households in the top 20% income group, and that 17% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> would go to the top 1% households. The top 20% of income earners pay about 70% of federal income taxes, excluding payroll taxes. For scale, 50% of the $1.5 trillion in tax expenditures in 2016 was $750 billion, while the U.S. budget deficit was approximately $600 billion. In other words, eliminating the tax expenditures for the top 20% might balance the budget over the short-term, depending on economic feedback effects.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the nests}} {{located near the}} {{periphery}} {{are more likely to}} be attacked than the ones in the center which are usually completely surrounded by other nests. This is an example of the selfish herd theory and demonstrates how individuals may cluster together for protection against predators, but the ones in the middle tend to be safer than those on the outside. However, each colony is more prone to attack if the colony next to it is attacked. This is an example of the attacked neighbor risk and reduces some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> gained by participating in selfish herd tactics.|$|E

The following year, King wrote the introduction to Batman No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman.|$|E
25|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{the single}} most important form of disability insurance is that provided by the national government for all citizens. For example, the UK's version is part of National Insurance; the U.S.'s version is Social Security (SS)—specifically, several parts of SS including Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These programs provide a floor beneath all other disability insurance. In other words, they are the safety net that catches everyone who was otherwise (a) uninsured or (b) underinsured. As such, they are large programs with many beneficiaries. The general theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> formula is that the benefit is enough to prevent abject poverty.|$|E

25|$|Three {{different}} approaches {{are commonly used}} in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach. Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining {{the value of a}} business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the net present value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the First chicago method which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.|$|E
25|$|As some {{carotenoids}} can {{be converted}} into vitamin A, {{attempts have been made}} to determine how much of them in the diet is equivalent to a particular amount of retinol, so that comparisons can be made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of different foods. The situation can be confusing because the accepted equivalences have changed. For many years, a system of equivalencies in which an international unit (IU) was equal to 0.3 μg of retinol, 0.6 μg of β-carotene, or 1.2 μg of other provitamin-A carotenoids was used. Later, a unit called retinol equivalent (RE) was introduced. Prior to 2001, one RE corresponded to 1 μg retinol, 2 μg β-carotene dissolved in oil (it is only partly dissolved in most supplement pills, due to very poor solubility in any medium), 6 μg β-carotene in normal food (because it is not absorbed as well as when in oils), and 12 μg of either α-carotene, γ-carotene, or β-cryptoxanthin in food.|$|E
