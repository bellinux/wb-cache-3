There is equally no doubt from <b>our</b> <b>perspective</b> that Roberto Micheletti's assumption of power was illegitimate.

500|$|In the Solar System, {{the planets}} and the Sun lie roughly {{within the same}} flat plane, known as {{the plane of the}} {{ecliptic}}. From <b>our</b> <b>perspective</b> on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky {{over the course of the}} year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called [...] "precession", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).|$|E

Hantke and Spoerer also say that their findings show [...] "that even under quite rigorous assumptions the net economic burden of the Treaty of Versailles was much less heavy than has been hitherto thought, in particular if we confine <b>our</b> <b>perspective</b> to the Reich's budget".

More broadly he is concerned that [...] "a globalization of indifference has developed; ... the culture of prosperity deadens us; ... those lives stunted for lack of opportunity seem a mere spectacle; they fail to move us" [...] (EG 54).He suggests that we should find Jesus in others, in their faces, voices, pleas – redoubling our efforts to live in fraternity (EG 90). Lay ministries must go beyond serving our own community and show real commitment to transform every aspect of life in society with Jesus' values (EG 94).

2500|$|Six {{million years}} ago {{at the close of the}} Miocene era, the earth's climate was {{gradually}} cooling and this would lead to the glaciations of the Pliocene and the Pleistocene (the Ice Age). In many areas the forests and savannahs were being replaced with steppe or grasslands and only those creatures that could adapt would survive. On opposite sides of the planet, two very different lineages would adapt to these changes and their evolution would produce two species that would become the most widely distributed of mammals. In southern North America, small woodland foxes were growing bigger and becoming more adapted to running, and by the late Miocene the first of the genus Canis had arisen, the ancestors of coyotes, wolves and the domestic dog. In eastern Africa, a split was occurring among the large primates. Some would remain in the trees, while others would move out of the trees, learn to walk upright, develop enlarged brains, and learn to avoid predators while becoming a predator themselves in the more open country. The two lineages would ultimately meet on the Eurasian continent.
