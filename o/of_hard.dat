5|$|Early in Truman's second term, {{his former}} Secretary of Defense Forrestal died soon after retiring. Forrestal had become {{exhausted}} through years <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> labor {{during and after}} the war, and had begun to suffer depression. He retired in March 1949; soon after, he was hospitalized but committed suicide in May.|$|E
5|$|Edward Grant, a {{historian}} of science, {{has provided evidence}} that medieval scholastic philosophers generally considered the celestial spheres to be solid {{in the sense of}} three-dimensional or continuous, but most did not consider them solid in the sense <b>of</b> <b>hard.</b> The consensus was that the celestial spheres were made of some kind of continuous fluid.|$|E
5|$|Mouthpieces are {{generally}} made <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> rubber, although some inexpensive mouthpieces {{may be made}} of plastic.

Other materials include wire, wire mesh, plastic, naugahyde, string, or leather.|$|E

5|$|According to Diane Dimond <b>of</b> <b>Hard</b> Copy, Torbiner's {{records show}} that Robinul and Vistarol was {{administered}} instead of sodium amytal. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was investigating Torbiner's administration of drugs in house calls, where he mostly gave patients morphine and Demerol. His credentials with the Board of Dental Examiners indicated that he was restricted by law to administering drugs solely for dental-related procedures, {{but he had not}} adhered to those restrictions. For instance, he had given general anesthetic to Barry Rothman during hair-transplant procedures. Torbiner had introduced Chandler and Rothman in 1991, when Rothman needed dental work.|$|E

5|$|After {{considering}} {{pursuing a}} master's degree {{on the topic}} <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> science fiction novels as fascist literature, Gibson discontinued writing in the year that followed graduation and, as one critic put it, expanded his collection of punk records. During this period he worked at various jobs, including a three-year stint as teaching assistant on a film history course at his alma mater. Impatient at {{much of what he}} saw at a science fiction convention in Vancouver in 1980 or 1981, Gibson found a kindred spirit in fellow panelist, punk musician and author John Shirley. The two became immediate and lifelong friends. Shirley persuaded Gibson to sell his early short stories and to take writing seriously.|$|E
5|$|Although the Japanese {{continued}} {{to try to}} secure more territory, and the U.S. did not move from a state of naval parity to one of supremacy until after several more months <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> combat, Midway allowed the Allies to switch to the strategic initiative, {{paving the way for}} the landings on Guadalcanal and the prolonged attrition of the Solomon Islands campaign. Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942. The Guadalcanal Campaign is also regarded by some as {{a turning point in the}} Pacific War.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} third lane {{was added}} {{in each direction}} in 1966 using the land reserved within the central reservation, without the need to modify existing bridges. Despite the relative ease in this work, the lack <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> shoulders at the bridges meant the number of available lanes during engineering works was inadequate {{to cope with the}} traffic volumes of the time, estimated to be have been in the region of 140,000 vehicles daily. Construction of the M61 motorway in 1969â€“1970 to carry Manchester traffic northbound had its northern terminus connect to a new junction on the by-pass at Bamber Bridge, requiring the construction of Blacow Bridge to carry the north-bound M61 traffic over the M6.|$|E

5|$|Beetles have {{mouthparts}} {{like those}} of grasshoppers. The mandibles appear as large pincers {{on the front of}} some beetles. The mandibles are a pair <b>of</b> <b>hard,</b> often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see defence, below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those of the males enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|But {{the event}} could not mask the {{economic}} crisis into which Poland was drifting, exacerbated by Soviet demands for more military spending. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused further economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 (just before Christmas), the regime suddenly announced massive increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, the government's main source <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> currency when exported. The new measures were incomprehensible to many urban workers, and their provocative timing (the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately GomuÅ‚ka's fall from power.|$|E
