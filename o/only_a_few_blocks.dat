40|$|A fast {{elliptic}} solver for separable elliptic equations on rectangular domains is considered.

This marked the deadliest day for U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks.

25|$|Also, the Catalogue of Ships {{mentions}} a {{great variety}} of cities, some of which, including Athens, were inhabited both in the Bronze Age and in Homer's time, and some of which, such as Pylos, were not rebuilt after the Bronze Age. This suggests that the names of no-longer-existing towns were remembered from an older time, because it is unlikely that Homer would have managed to name successfully a diverse list of important Bronze Age cities that were, in his time, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>blocks</b> of rubble on the surface, often without even names. Furthermore, the cities enumerated in the Catalogue are given in geographical clusters, this revealing a sound knowledge of Aegean topography. Some evidence is mixed, though: locating the Bronze Age palace of Sparta, the traditional home of Menelaus, under the modern city has been challenging.|$|E
25|$|The {{increase}} in fMRI signal {{in response to}} a stimulus is additive. This means that the amplitude of the hemodynamic response (HDR) increases when multiple stimuli are presented in rapid succession. When each block is alternated with a rest condition in which the HDR has enough time to return to baseline, a maximum amount of variability is introduced in the signal. As such, we conclude that block designs offer considerable statistical power. There are however severe drawbacks to this method, as the signal is very sensitive to signal drift, such as head motion, especially when <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>blocks</b> are used. Another limiting factor is a poor choice of baseline, as it may prevent meaningful conclusions from being drawn. There are also problems with many tasks lacking the ability to be repeated. Since within each block only one condition is presented, randomization of stimulus types is not possible within a block. This makes the type of stimulus within each block very predictable. As a consequence, participants may become aware of the order of the events.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Rock fall hazard {{assessment}} and hazard map-ping {{are essential for}} the risk management of vulnerable ar-eas. This paper analyses some issues concerning fragmen-tal rock fall hazard mapping methodologies. Two Swiss ap-proaches based on rock fall trajectory simulations results are presented. An application to a site in Switzerland emphasises {{the differences in the}} results, uncertainties related to hazard zoning procedures and the influence of some factors on the mapping process. In particular, the influence of a change in the temporal rock fall frequency, of the longer propagation along the slope of <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> computed <b>blocks</b> (defined in this sense as “extreme blocks”) and of the number of runs performed in trajectory modelling have been studied. Results are discussed with the purpose of achieving a more reliable and objective hazard analysis.
