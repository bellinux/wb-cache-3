The equations are written in a (non-uniformly) rotating <b>observation</b> <b>frame</b> and are thus appropriate for description of over-end unwinding of yarn from stationary packages. We comment on physical significance of virtual forces that appear in a non-inertial frame and we devote particular attention to a lesser known force, that only appears in non-uniformly rotating frames. We show that this force {{should be taken into}} account when the unwinding point is near the edges of the package, when the quasi-stationary approximation is not valid because the angular velocity is changing with time. The additional force has an influence on the yarn dynamics in this transient regime where the movement of yarn becomes complex and can lead to yarn slipping and even breaking...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{concepts}} of Maxwell, Fitzgerald, Larmor, Hertz, Heaviside, and others concerning {{the propagation of}} electromagnetic (EM) waves in the "luminiferous ether" hidden in the vacuum (Whittaker 1954) have been vindicated through recent experiments. The experiment of Penzias and Wilson demonstrates {{that the universe is}} filled with a uniform and isotropic (at large) 2. 7 K microwave background (Penzias and Wilson 1965). Measuring this background EM radiation (excitation of vacuum substratum) makes the verification of an absolute reference frame S S (its origin and directions of coordinate axes can be chosen arbitrarily) possible everywhere in the universe. If in an <b>observation</b> <b>frame</b> the cosmic microwave radiation is found to be isotropic in intensity, then this frame is an absolute space frame S S. In inertial frames S S which move relative to S S with a constant velocity u, the observed microwave radiation is anisotropic, as first shown by Conklin (1969) and Henry (1971), i. e...|$|E

30|$|In short, small {{differences}} between criteria exist {{with respect to}} the penalty applied for the number of parameters and <b>observations</b> (<b>frames).</b> AIC, AICC, SC, and MSC all include an extra penalty term for the number of parameters, trying to account for the possibility of over-fitting the model. The penalty used in AICC seems to be stronger than that used in SC and MSC when compared to AIC. AIC becomes strongly biased when the ratio of model parameters to <b>observations</b> (acquisition <b>frames)</b> increases, for which AICC tries to correct. When the number of observations increases, AICC converges to AIC. Due to the stronger penalty, AICC seems to prefer the models with less parameters when the ratio is bigger. For [11 C]FMZ and [11 C]PHT, both with <[*] 20 observations, AICC indeed preferred the model with less parameters slightly more frequently compared with the other criteria. For [11 C]PHT, this was reflected in a regional disagreement between AIC and AICC of 16 % of the TACs. For FMZ, this resulted in AICC identifying a different kinetic model when examining all VOIs across all subjects as illustrated in Fig.  1. However, this difference in model preference was mainly driven by a single subject where AICC disagreed strongly with the other model selection criteria, which was confirmed by the F-test. For the remaining four subjects, AICC and F-test preferred the same model for FMZ as did the other criteria.|$|R

40|$|A {{determination}} {{is made of}} {{the radiation}} emitted by a linearly uniformly accelerated uncharged dipole transmitter. It is found that, first of all, the radiation rate is given by the familiar Larmor formula, but it is augmented by an amount which becomes dominant for sufficiently high acceleration. For an accelerated dipole oscillator, the criterion is that the center of mass motion become relativistic within one oscillation period. The augmented formula and the measurements which it summarizes presuppose an expanding inertial <b>observation</b> <b>frame.</b> A static inertial reference frame will not do. Secondly, {{it is found that}} the radiation measured in the expanding inertial frame is received with 100 % fidelity. There is no blueshift or redshift due to the accelerative motion of the transmitter. Finally, it is found that a pair of coherently radiating oscillators accelerating (into opposite directions) in their respective causally disjoint Rindler-coordinatized sectors produces an interference pattern in the expanding inertial frame. Like the pattern of a Young double slit interferometer, this Rindler interferometer pattern has a fringe spacing which is inversely proportional to the proper separation and the proper frequency of the accelerated sources. The interferometer, as well as the augmented Larmor formula, provide a unifying perspective. It joins adjacent Rindler-coordinatized neighborhoods into a single spacetime arena for scattering and radiation from accelerated bodies. Comment: 29 pages, 1 figure, Revte...|$|E

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{for video}} resolution enhancement is presented. The approach borrows from previous methods for still-image superresolution, introducing modifications {{better suited for}} the characteristics specific to video domain problems. Each high-resolution (HR) frame is determined {{through a series of}} MMSE spatial interpolations based on the local features (statistics) of the frame. Cross-frame registration is estimated externally and the reconstruction algorithm does not limit the form of the motion model, unlike previous data-fusion/deconvolution approaches which have required motion models that do not alter the point-spread function (i. e., motion/blur commutability). This feature is made possible using a reverse motion model mapping the locations of desired HR pixels onto their corresponding locations in the <b>observation</b> <b>frames.</b> Anticipating the existence of registration error found in typical video sequences, the algorithm also provides an internal validation of the observation pixels, helping to reduce significant mis-registration artifacts. An arbitrary enhancement factor can be used, allowing an output at any desired resolution. Interpolation and deblurring are incorporated as a single MMSE filtering operation, providing a non-iterative one-step reconstruction process. Experimental results demonstrating the capabilities of the algorithm are made available. Index Terms — Image modelling, super-resolution, video. 1...|$|R

40|$|Image registration, as {{a special}} form of signal warping, is an {{important}} task in image processing. Given the many current developments in algorithms and techniques in image registration, it is desirable to have fundamental performance criteria to compare the overall optimality of different estimators. This report presents an observation model for image registration that accounts for image noise more realistically than most formulations, and describes performance analysis based on Cramér-Rao Bound and its related variant MCRB. I. MODEL- THE IDEAL V. S. COMMONLY USED In a general setting, image registration methods aim to find the motion in an image sequence. Let zi denote the ith <b>observation</b> (<b>frame)</b> of an underlying image. In reality, only sampled observations are available, with spatial sample spacing ∆. Therefore, it is natural to use a discrete spatial index {{to refer to the}} sampled location. Without loss of generality, we take zi[n] = z c i (n∆) where zc notates the underlying continuous intensity map. Accounting for additive observation noise, we formulate the generative model as: zi[n] = f(n + τi(n)) + ǫi[n], (1) where it is standard to assume ǫi are normally distributed I. I. D noise. In principle, the task of registratering the observation sequence is to find the deformation sequence of continuous maps {τi} for all i.
