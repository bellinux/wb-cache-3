25|$|The siege {{began in}} June, after Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) forces {{advanced}} <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> positions in Northern Iraq. They attacked the town, {{but failed to}} capture it after townspeople armed with AK-47s put up resistance. However, ISIS had more powerful weapons compared to the local militia, prompting fears that {{they would try to}} storm the town. ISIS forces continued to fire mortars and rockets into the town and launched raids against it. 20,000 citizens in Amirli were in danger from being killed by ISIS, dying from thirst or hunger.|$|E
25|$|Because Saddam Hussein rarely left Iraq, Tariq Aziz, one of Saddam's aides, {{traveled}} abroad extensively {{and represented}} Iraq at many diplomatic meetings. In foreign affairs, Saddam sought to have Iraq play {{a leading role}} in the Middle East. Iraq signed an aid pact with the Soviet Union in 1972, and arms were sent along with several thousand advisers. However, the 1978 crackdown <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Communists and a shift of trade toward the West strained Iraqi relations with the Soviet Union; Iraq then took on a more Western orientation until the Gulf War in 1991.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{imposition}} and {{passing of the}} Resolution 660, Resolution 661, and the Resolution 665, Sharif sided with the United Nations <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> invasion of Kuwait. A major international incident {{took place in the}} Middle East with Iraq invading the Kuwait which dismayed the world. Sharif's government criticised Iraq for invading the fellow Muslim country, which strained Pakistan's relationships with Iraq. The relationships continued to be strained as Pakistan seek to tighten its relations with Iran, and his foreign policy continued by Benazir Bhutto, Pervez Musharraf until the removal of Saddam Hussein in 2003.|$|E

25|$|After {{the success}} of the Israeli Air Force's air strike <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> nuclear power plant in Osirak in 1981, Pakistan Armed Forces had been alerted since then. According to memoirs of nuclear {{strategist}} and theorist Munir Ahmad Khan, the hectic discussion took place every day between ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs, in an amid fears that India might attack Pakistan who was en route to become subsequent nuclear power. Since 1981, the commanders of the Pakistan's unified armed forces were given the standing orders to mobilize their forces at once, from all directions, as quick as it can to divert such attacks.|$|E
25|$|Over all, between April 2003 {{and late}} December 2004 {{there were an}} {{estimated}} 123 attacks <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> energy infrastructures, including the country's 7,000km-long pipeline system. In response to these attacks, which cost Iraq billions of US dollars in lost oil-export revenues and repair costs, the US military set up the Task Force Shield to guard Iraq's energy infrastructure and the Kirkuk-Ceyhan Oil Pipeline in particular. In {{spite of the fact}} that little damage was done to Iraq's oil fields during the war itself, looting and sabotage after the war ended was highly destructive and accounted for perhaps eighty percent of the total damage.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Canada {{committed}} 26 CF-18s to the Gulf War, {{based in}} Qatar. These aircraft primarily provided Combat Air Patrol duties, although, {{late in the}} air war, began to perform air strikes <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> ground targets. On 30 January 1991, two CF-18s on CAP detected and attacked an Iraqi TNC-45 patrol boat. The vessel was repeatedly strafed and damaged by 20mm cannon fire, but an attempt to sink the ship with an air-to-air missile failed. The ship was subsequently sunk by American aircraft, but the Canadian CF-18s received partial credit for its destruction. In June 1999, 18 CF-18s were deployed to Aviano AB, Italy, where they participated in both the air-to-ground and air-to-air roles in the former Yugoslavia.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S. and UK {{had been}} engaged in {{low-level}} attacks <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> air defenses which targeted them while enforcing Iraqi no-fly zones. These zones, and the attacks to enforce them, were described as illegal by the former UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine. Other countries, notably Russia and China, also condemned the zones {{as a violation of}} Iraqi sovereignty. In mid-2002, the U.S. began more carefully selecting targets {{in the southern part of}} the country to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq. A change in enforcement tactics was acknowledged at the time, but it was not made public that this was part of a plan known as Operation Southern Focus.|$|E
25|$|F-15Es of the 391st Fighter Squadron, 492d Fighter Squadron, and 494th Fighter Squadron {{regularly}} {{deployed to}} Turkey throughout the 1990s. In January 1993, Iraqi targets in {{breach of the}} ceasefire agreement below the 32nd parallel north were attacked; 10 F-15Es conducted a punitive strike days later. Most missions were of a defensive nature, the Strike Eagles carried a flexible range of weapons on a typical mission. AWACS aircraft were {{in close contact with}} F-15E crews, who would receive new taskings while airborne and thus could fly unplanned attacks <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> targets. After 1993, violations of the no-fly zones were minimal as Iraq staged a minor withdrawal; in 1997 Turkey approved the creation of Operation Northern Watch (ONW) and permitted US forces to use the Incirlik air base.|$|E
25|$|While {{the exact}} number of Iraqi combat {{casualties}} has yet to be firmly determined, sources agree that the losses were substantial. Immediate estimates said up to 100,000 Iraqis were killed. More recent estimates indicate that Iraq probably sustained between 20,000 and 35,000 fatalities, though other figures still maintain fatalities could have been as high as 200,000. A report commissioned by the U.S. Air Force, estimated 10,000-12,000 Iraqi combat deaths in the air campaign and as many as 10,000 casualties in the ground war. This analysis is based <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> prisoner of war reports. It is known that between 20,000 and 200,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed. According to the Project on Defense Alternatives study, 3,664 Iraqi civilians and between 20,000 and 26,000 military personnel were killed in the conflict. 75,000 Iraqi soldiers were wounded in the fighting.|$|E

25|$|As {{a sign of}} his {{consolidation}} of power, Saddam's personality cult pervaded Iraqi society. He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could {{be seen on the}} sides of office buildings, schools, airports, and shops, as well as <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> currency. Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the Bedouin, the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even Kurdish clothing, but also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout Muslim, wearing full headdress and robe, praying toward Mecca.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} {{ordnance}} dropped <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> positions by Coalition aircraft in 2001 and 2002 {{was less than}} in 1999 and 2000 which was during the Clinton administration. This information {{has been used to}} attempt to refute the theory that the Bush administration had already decided to go to war against Iraq before coming to office and that the bombing during 2001 and 2002 was laying the groundwork for the eventual invasion in 2003. However, information obtained by the UK Liberal Democrats showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq {{in the second half of}} 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6tons in September – before Congress' 11 October authorization of the invasion.|$|E
25|$|Between 1980 and 1988, the {{conflict}} intensified as the Iran–Iraq War commenced. One {{of the groups}} targeted in particular by Iraqi authorities were the Feyli Kurds, a community of Shi'ite Kurds settled in the southern area of the Zagros Mountains near Iraq's border with Iran. Saddam Hussein considered the group as 'Iranians' and began a campaign to drive the settlers {{out of the area}} as a part of his 'Arabization' policy in 1980., Saddam Hussein was severely critical of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) as they aligned forces with Iran in {{the conflict}}. In 1983, to avenge this liaison, he ordered the Army to abduct as many as 8,000 men and boys from Arbil province, where the clan of Barzani Kurds was based. Massoud Barzani, the leader of the clan and the KDP, himself lost 37 members of his family to the Iraqi troops. They were reported to having been sent to Nugra Salman prison in the southern deserts of Iraq, where they were tortured. Subsequently, the remains of 512 Barzani men were discovered in a mass grave. On March 16, 1988, Iraqi troops began shelling the Kurdish town of Halabja, in retaliation for an attack <b>on</b> <b>Iraqi</b> positions carried out by Iranian Revolutionary Guards and the aligned Peshmerga fighters. Subsequently, the town was attacked with a mix of chemical substances such as VX (nerve agent), sarin and mustard gas (see Halabja chemical attack). Over 5,000 people are believed to {{have been killed in the}} attack, which was considered to be a part of the Al-Anfal Campaign, directed against Kurds by the government under the command of Ali Hassan al-Majid, head of the Northern Bureau of the Ba'ath Party.|$|E
