His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{disorders}} {{that may}} develop after TBI include tremor, ataxia (uncoordinated muscle movements), myoclonus (shock-like contractions of muscles), and loss <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> range and control (in particular {{with a loss}} <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> repertoire). The risk of post-traumatic seizures increases with severity of trauma (image at right) and is particularly elevated with certain types of brain trauma such as cerebral contusions or hematomas.

5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness <b>of</b> <b>movement)</b> {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities {{at the same time}} and can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E

5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense <b>of</b> <b>movement</b> that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E
5|$|During the Nara period, from 710 to 794, the {{government}} established and supported workshops called zōbussho, {{the most prominent}} of which was located in the capital Nara at Tōdai-ji, which produced Buddhist statuary.

Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a greater sense <b>of</b> <b>movement.</b> Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the Four Heavenly Kings at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at Kōfuku-ji.|$|E
