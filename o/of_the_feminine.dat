25|$|Kierski's {{research}} {{claimed that}} men do acknowledge that male fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> can have a strong influence on both hetero- and homosexual men. The research has also indicated that {{there appears to be}} a link between fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> and men's negative views about counseling and psychotherapy. In addition, this research has identified four possible groups of experiences that lead to male fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminine,</b> which relate to internal and external triggers. These are: Experiencing vulnerability and uncertainty; women who are strong and competent; women who are angry or aggressive; women who are like their mothers.|$|E

25|$|When men {{experience}} vulnerable {{feelings and}} other feelings {{that are associated}} with women, men can become frightened. According to Kierski (2007), the fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> then acts in two ways: a) Like an internal monitor to ensure that men stay within the boundaries of what is regarded as masculine, i.e. being action orientated, self-reliant, guarded, and seemingly independent; b) if a man fails to experience this and feels out of control, vulnerable or dependent, the fear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> can act like a defence, leading to splitting off, repressing, or projecting those feelings.|$|E

25|$|The Amnesty International {{movement}} {{was one that}} gained much support from feminists, evident in the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Feminine</b> Movement for Amnesty of the 1970s. At the same time, feminist movements have attempted to maintain balance between their specific goals and wider political demands. Despite {{the influence of the}} human rights movement upon women's movements in Brazil, women's rights were not internationally recognized as human rights until the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights, held by the United Nations in Vienna.|$|E
25|$|It is {{necessary}} to know that Bourguiba always worshipped his mother, who died prematurely, according to the chief of state, in 1913. In several of his speeches, memory of her returned and the exhaustion born of the double function of the spouse and the mother contributed to his denunciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>feminine</b> condition in traditional Tunisian society. Although his declaration can be considered sincere—other expositions indeed demonstrate a certain hostility to the period's domestic tradition—it is to be recalled that his mother's memory played no fundamental role in his political positions concerning the feminine condition during the French protectorate.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} feminists of the twentieth century, Friedan (in addition to many others) opposed equating feminism with lesbianism. As early as 1964, very early in the movement, and only a year after the publication <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Feminine</b> Mystique, Friedan appeared on television to address the fact the media was, at that point, trying to dismiss the movement as a joke and centering argument and debate around whether or not to wear bras and other issues considered ridiculous. In 1982, during the second wave, she wrote a book for the post-feminist 1980s called The Second Stage, about family life, premised on women having conquered social and legal obstacles.|$|E
