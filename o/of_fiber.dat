The woody parts of cacti, such as Cereus repandus and Echinopsis atacamensis, are used in buildings and in furniture. The frames of wattle and daub houses built by the Seri people of Mexico may use parts of Carnegiea gigantea.

5|$|The {{first two}} print runs used Thayer and Company lithographers, with one litho stone for {{the color and}} the other for {{printing}} black on the white paper stock.

The first print run copied the Laurie and Whittles game. Laurie and Whittles used gold ink. Thayer mixed his ink to look gold but it really was a goldish brown.

5|$|In May, {{costs for}} {{construction}} of the station were again increased to $4.1 million. The increased costs were primarily associated with the relocation <b>of</b> <b>fiber</b> optic lines during {{the construction of the}} pedestrian tunnel. To reduce overall costs, village officials asked for architects to remove the tunnel and replace it with an elevated walkway over the tracks. In October 2004, the village board gave final approval to the revised station plan with a pedestrian bridge. The $3.2 million estimated cost of the station was to be financed through a pair of federal transportation grants in addition to the village borrowing against its tax incremental financing district from the adjacent industrial park.|$|E

The USS Saratoga, the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS Reliant model from The Wrath of Khan. The Bird-of-Prey model from The Search for Spock was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for The Voyage Homes action sequences. The {{inside of the}} Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than The Search for Spock, but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, {{rather than relying on}} ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large Spacedock model created for The Search for Spock, the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles <b>of</b> <b>fiber</b> optic lighting. When The Voyage Home called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.|$|E

In {{the current}} study, Laboratory {{uniaxial}} compression tests {{are carried out}} {{in order to determine}} the strength and mechanical behavior of silty sand reinforced with randomly distributed short resinous Polypropylene (PP) fibers. The stress-strain behavior of composite materials is investigated through varying the number and length <b>of</b> PP <b>fibers.</b> In order to study the effects of the length and weight percent <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> on the results of the uniaxial compressive strength, tests were accomplished on specimens with three different lengths and weight percentages <b>of</b> <b>fibers.</b> The results demonstrate increasing weight percent <b>of</b> <b>fibers,</b> in a constant length, leads to increase the maximum strength. Meanwhile, increasing the length <b>of</b> <b>fibers,</b> in a constant weight percent, reduces the maximum strength. Moisture absorbency <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> which was about 120 % at first, however, could be reduced to just 9 % by using the epoxy polyamide resin. Moreover, the resin causes more interaction between sand aggregates and fibers leading to a higher internal friction angle...|$|R

Half of the animals were also exposed to cigarette smoke. Animals were sacrificed at 1 week and 1 month, and numbers <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> in airway walls were counted in histologic sections. In both smoke-exposed and nonexposed groups, numbers <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> per square millimeter of airway wall increased from 1 week to 1 month in the respiratory bronchioles. At each time period, smoke-exposed animals had significantly higher numbers <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> in the airway walls, compared with nonexposed animals. It is concluded that 1) continued transport <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> into interstitial tissues may be the reason that asbestosis can progress after cessation of exposure; 2) cigarette smoke increases the penetration <b>of</b> <b>fibers</b> into airway walls. This effect {{may play a role}} in the increased incidence of disease seen in smoking, compared with nonsmoking, asbestos workers...|$|R
