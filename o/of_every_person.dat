5|$|The World Bank {{considered}} the cyclone {{as having a}} significant effect on Andhra Pradesh's economy. Andhra Pradesh's chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu estimated that the state would take as long as 30years to recover from the storm. The government provided RS$1,500 (US$420) to every family whose hut collapsed during the storm, and RS$100,000 (US$2,857) to the family <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> killed by the storm. However, there were also reports of people stealing bodies to receive the payment. The federal government provided about US$12million to the state, as well as tax deductions for monetary donations. Former Union Minister Rangaiah Naidu opined that the state government overinflated the damage estimates to qualify for additional aid, in part due to the government spending annual disaster subsidies for salaries. The World Bank credited the government's experience with disasters as saving lives, although the response to the disaster was largely in repairing damage, rather than mitigating against future storms. The storm also demonstrated the region's outdated infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|New star-shaped Christmas tree {{lights were}} used in 1935, but some were stolen the week after Christmas. To {{discourage}} future thefts, a temporary low octagonal fence was constructed around the 1936 tree. The method of lighting the tree also changed. The National Park Service history of the tree claims that in 1936 or 1937, the button used since 1925 {{was replaced by a}} switchbox. The Washington Post, however, indicates that the button was still used in 1936. The box was definitely in use by 1937. It was constructed and donated by the Electric Institute of Washington, and was engraved with the name <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> who had lit the tree since 1923. In 1938, the Electric Institute of Washington donated mercury-vapor floodlights to the federal government, which were used to help illuminate the tree.|$|E
25|$|Fiction {{literature}} {{also has}} an increased role in shaping people's attitude towards same-sex marriages. An original idea appears in Rafael Grugman dystopian fiction book Nontraditional Love (2008). He describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified {{in order to support}} the ideology of the homosexual world (in this world same-sex love is a traditional love). At the heart of the novel is a love story {{between a man and a}} woman who unfortunately were born as heterosexuals in a homosexual world and they forced to hide their feelings and their sexual orientation. For a homosexual society love between man and women is a non-traditional love. The author paints a grotesque situation, but underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> to be themselves. It is unusual approach that supports human rights of all people and same-sex marriages.|$|E
25|$|The green pale in {{the flag}} symbolises Irish republicanism {{dating back to}} the Society of United Irishmen in the 1790s. The orange {{represents}} the minority who were supporters of King William III, who was of the House of Orange and originally the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, who had defeated King James II and his predominantly Irish Catholic army at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. His title came from the Principality of Orange in the south of France that had been a Protestant bastion from the 16th century. It was included in the Irish flag in an attempt to reconcile the Orange Order in Ireland with the Irish independence movement. The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between the two cultures and a living together in peace. The flag, as a whole, is intended to symbolise the inclusion and hoped-for union of the people of different traditions on the island of Ireland, which is expressed in the Constitution as the entitlement <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> born in Ireland {{to be part of the}} independent Irish nation, regardless of ethnic origin, religion or political conviction.|$|E

25|$|His term as rector was brief, though, for on June 9, 1982, he was {{appointed}} coadjutor bishop to the then controversial and prophetic Bishop Francisco Claver, of Diocese of Malaybalay, Bukidnon. In this moment of difficulty, Rosales recalled that a stampita (holy picture) dropped from his breviary (liturgy of the hours). It was from Mother (now Blessed) Teresa of Calcutta. When he picked it up, he saw the writing at the back. It read: “Allow God to use you without first consulting you.” These words brought peace to his soul. On September 14, 1984, Rosales succeeded the Bishop of Malaybalay taking complete authority over the diocese. He started his ministry in Malaybalay by forming with his people, especially the priest and religious there, {{a vision of the}} diocese: that of the total development <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>person</b> and all persons, brought about by Jesus Christ. In that difficult assignment, he was able to bring about the unity of the clergy as they struggled especially for justice, peace and environmental protection. He often looks back to his days there as the golden moments of his ministry.|$|E
25|$|Seeking {{refuge from}} the waswās means that the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the evil lest it should whisper some evil {{suggestion}} into his own heart. The second meaning is that the caller to truth seeks God's {{refuge from the}} evil {{of the one who}} whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It is not in his own power to approach all the people in whose hearts evil suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the misunderstandings <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>person.</b> It is also not right and proper for him that he should give up his mission of inviting others to God and should devote all his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop to the level of his opponents. Therefore, God has instructed the caller to truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for him to deal with them but for God, who is Sustainer of men, King of men, God of men.|$|E

This, according to Aesthetic Realism, is the deepest desire <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>person,</b> but it is opposed by the desire for contempt—the false notion that one adds to self by lessening the value of other things. [...] Koppelman’s art is permeated with his understanding of this conflict. His works are often allegories which point to the discrepancy between, {{and the need to}} integrate, opposites such as pride and humility, generosity and selfishness, idealism and cynicism. [...] “That art could be a vehicle for understanding individual behavior seems always to have inspired Koppeman’s creative process” wrote John B.

It makes explicit the cost borne by society. It operates outside the market.
