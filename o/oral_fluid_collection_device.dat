40|$|The study {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} influence of sample collection for two different collection methods on THC concentrations and to compare THC concentrations collected by both methods. A total of 136 pairs of oral fluid samples from subjects who had recently smoked Cannabis were obtained by the non-acidic Statsure <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> and by ordinary spit tubes. Oral fluid was analysed for THC by LC–MS/MS. Bland–Altman plots were used for the quantitative analysis of repeatability, whereas Cohen's kappa was used for qualitative analysis to determine the consistency of the results with regard to the Belgian legal limit. Repeatability of both sampling methods was very low. The Statsure device had a better rate of agreement when compared with the Belgian legal limit than the spitting method. THC concentrations of samples collected by spit tubes were on average a factor 5. 9 higher than the corresponding concentrations in samples collected by the Statsure device. The repeatability of both the Statsure collection method and the ordinary spit tubes was low when applied to subjects who had consumed Cannabis very recently.

40|$|International audienceIdiopathic {{peripheral}} {{facial nerve}} palsy {{has been associated}} with the reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) or varicella zoster virus (VZV). In recent studies, detection rates were found to vary strongly which may be caused by the use of different <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> in combination with molecular assays lacking standardization. In this single-center pilot study, liquid phase-based and absorption based <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> was compared. Samples were collected with both systems from 10 patients with acute idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy, 10 with herpes labialis or with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, and 10 healthy controls. Commercially available IVD/CE labeled molecular assays based on fully automated DNA extraction and real-time PCR were employed. With the liquid phase-based <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> system, 3 patients with idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy tested positive for HSV- 1 DNA and another 2 tested positive for VZV DNA. All patients with herpes labialis tested positive for HSV- 1 DNA and all patients with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome tested positive for VZV DNA. With the absorption based <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> system, detections rates and viral loads were found to be significantly lower when compared to those obtained with the liquid phase-based collection system. <b>Collection</b> of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> with a liquid phase-based system and the use of automated and standardized molecular methods allow early and reliable detection of HSV- 1 and VZV DNAs in patients with acute idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy and may provide a valuable decision support regarding start of antiviral treatment at the first clinical visit...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare {{and other}} front-line workers are at {{particular}} {{risk of infection}} with Ebola virus (EBOV). Despite the large-scale deployment of international responders, few cases of Ebola virus disease have been diagnosed in this group. Since asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infection has been described, it is plausible that infections have occurred in healthcare workers but have escaped being diagnosed. We aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infection, and of exposure events, among returned responders to the West African Ebola epidemic 2014 - 2016. We used snowball sampling to identify responders who {{had returned to the}} UK or Ireland, and used an online consent and questionnaire to determine their exposure to EBOV and their experience of illness. <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> were sent and returned by post, and samples were tested using an EBOV IgG capture assay that detects IgG to Ebola glycoprotein. Blood was collected from returnees with reactive samples for further testing. Unexposed UK controls were also recruited. In all, 300 individuals consented, of whom 268 (89. 3 %) returned an <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> sample (OFS). The majority had worked in Sierra Leone in clinical, laboratory, research, and other roles. Fifty-three UK controls consented and provided samples using the same method. Of the returnees, 47 (17. 5 %) reported that they had had a possible EBOV exposure. Based on their free-text descriptions, using a published risk assessment method, we classified 43 (16 %) as having had incidents with risk of Ebola transmission, including five intermediate-risk and one high-risk exposure. Of the returnees, 57 (21 %) reported a febrile or diarrhoeal illness in West Africa or within 1 mo of return, of whom 40 (70 %) were not tested at the time for EBOV infection. Of the 268 OFSs, 266 were unreactive. Two returnees, who did not experience an illness in West Africa or on return, had OFSs that were reactive on the EBOV IgG capture assay, with similar results on plasma. One individual had no further positive test results; the other had a positive result on a double-antigen bridging assay but not on a competitive assay or on an indirect EBOV IgG ELISA. All 53 controls had non-reactive OFSs. While the participants were not a random sample of returnees, the number participating was high. This is the first study, to our knowledge, of the prevalence of EBOV infection in international responders. More than 99 % had clear negative results. Sera from two individuals had discordant results on the different assays; both were negative on the competitive assay, suggesting that prior infection was unlikely. The finding that a significant proportion experienced "near miss" exposure events, and that most of those who experienced symptoms did not get tested for EBOV at the time, suggests a need to review and standardise protocols for the management of possible exposure to EBOV, and for the management of illness, across organisations that deploy staff to outbreaks...|$|R

Multi-analyte controls were prepared for the drugs of abuse screen and diluted with Quantisal buffer prior to analysis to match the dilution in the Quantisal <b>Oral</b> <b>Fluid</b> <b>Collection</b> <b>Device</b> {{that was used to}} collect the samples. These samples were analysed over time to evaluate stability and case samples were analysed to evaluate sensitivity and specificity. Alcohol calibrators and controls were evaluated for linearity and stability before being applied to case samples to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the method. The amphetamine assay was found to be highly sensitive and specific. The methamphetamine assay was found to be highly specific but no positive samples were analysed so the sensitivity could not be evaluated. The multi-analyte controls were found to be stable over a fourteen month period. The Immunalysis ELISA assays were found to be suitable for screening oral fluid samples. The alcohol assay was found to be linear over the 0 – 300 mg/dL range and the calibrators and controls were found to be stable over time. The assay was found to be highly sensitive and specific and best suited to high throughput laboratories expecting mainly negative samples. However, it would not be cost effective for smaller laboratories or those expecting a high number of positives, where going straight to confirmation by head-space gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection would be recommended...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{strategy}} {{adopted by}} different countries {{to reduce the}} number of new cases of hepatitis A is the vaccination. However, the mosaic of the epidemiological profile in developing countries has hampered the establishment of a unified nationwide vaccination program. To determinate national vaccination policies, the results of epidemiological studies need to be carefully considered. For this monitoring, the use of oral fluid is very important due to the painless and non invasive collection characteristics. There are few studies investigating which <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> is optimal to detect low antibody levels and its use in selecting individuals for vaccination. So, the present study aimed to evaluate different oral fluid collection devices to detect humoral immune response against hepatitis A virus and its application in epidemiological studies. Therefore, 90 matched serum and oral fluid samples were collected from volunteers with different immune status, under ideal conditions of collection (optimization panel); and 224 matched samples in difficult-to-access areas (epidemiological study). Serum was collected by venipuncture and the oral fluid was obtained using three commercial devices: Salivette®, OraSure® and ChemBio®. Serum and oral fluid were submitted to a commercial immunoblot to detect total anti-HAV antibodies. The optimization panel demonstrated that ChemBio® device had the best performance (100 % agreement), followed by OraSure® (95. 4 %) and Salivette® (90. 8 %). The optimal collection device (ChemBio®), tested in a difficult-to-access area and evaluated under precarious conditions of collection, showed similar prevalence of total anti-HAV between serum and oral fluid, 80. 8 % and 79 %, respectively. A follow-up was performed to evaluate the stability of oral fluid and it was observed that 210 days after the collection it was possible to detect anti-HAV antibodies. Oral fluid can be used to detect low levels of specific-antibody, being important to select age groups to be vaccinated. Therewith, the choice of proper collection device is essential to evaluate HAV antibodies in the epidemiological scenario...|$|E

40|$|Swine disease {{surveillance}} is {{of great}} importance to the swine industry {{in order to raise}} and provide healthy animal populations. In order to insure timely disease intervention for optimal animal health, surveillance methods and sampling options need to be readily available. Many of our diagnostic sample collections are based on individual animal samples, i. e. serum, blood swabs, nasal swabs, etc. These individual sample diagnostics are then commonly used to infer information on the population level. In order to understand population status from a collection of individual samples, diagnostic and sampling methods require evaluation. As reviewed in Chapter 1, the pooling of individual samples is commonly place in various fields of veterinary medicine. In order to properly utilize this diagnostic strategy all the factors that affect pooling results need to be understood. Pooled diagnostics are influenced by the type of analyte, stage of infection, sample dilution, matrix components, the prevalence of disease, and laboratory differences. In order to attain accurate diagnostics and to properly pooling interpret results, these factors must be accounted for. In continuation of the study of disease surveillance methods, the objective of the first research paper (Chapter 2) was to evaluate different sample collection techniques for the early detection Porcine Respiratory and Reproductive Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) in a boar stud population based in individual sampling techniques. Diagnostic specimens analyzed in this study included serum, <b>oral</b> <b>fluid,</b> blood swabs, frothy saliva, and semen. Semen samples were centrifuged and the seminal supernatant and cell fractions were tested separately. All samples were randomly ordered and tested for PRRSV by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and PRRSV antibody ELISA. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} serum, blood swabs, and <b>oral</b> <b>fluids</b> in the onset of detection but numerical differences did exist. The objective of the second study (Chapter 3) was to evaluate if the <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> training and <b>collection</b> methods used for the boars in Chapter 2 could be applied to individually housed commercial sows. This study also analyzed the diagnostic reproducibility of PCR and ELISA results from the same animals. To achieve this, <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> sample <b>collection</b> was attempted on 513 individually housed; mixed parity sows naive to <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection.</b> <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> was attempted for each animal on two successive days under the same collection conditions.

40|$|Biological <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> to {{identify}} and analyze different disease markers is a routine and normal procedure in health care settings. Body fluids are as varied as urine, blood, mucus, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), tears, semen, etc. The volumes of the collected fluids range from micro liters (e. g., tears, CSF) to tens and hundreds of milliliters (blood, urine, etc.). In some manifestations, a disease marker (particularly protein markers) can occur in trace amounts, yet the fluids collected are in large volumes. To identify these trace markers, cumbersome methods, expensive instruments, and trained personnel are required. We developed an easy method to rapidly capture, concentrate, and identify protein markers in large volumes of test fluids. This method involves the utilization of two antibodies recognizing two different epitopes of the protein biomarker. Antibody- 1 helps to capture and concentrate the biomarker and Antibody- 2 adsorbed or conjugated to nanogold beads will detect the biomarker. This method was validated in capturing and detecting lipocalin type prostaglandin-D 2 synthase, a marker in urine that implicates diabetic nephropathy. A one-step collection, concentration, and detection device was designed based on this method. This device can replace many of the normal body <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> such as tubes and containers.

Methods: Anonymous, self-complete questionnaires and Orasure™ <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> kits were distributed to men visiting the commercial gay scenes in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Results: 1508 men completed questionnaires (70. 5 % response rate) and 1277 provided <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples (59. 7 % response rate). Overall, 1405 men were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. 16. 6 % reported having been circumcised. HIV prevalence was similar among circumcised and uncircumcised men (4. 2 % and 4. 6 %, respectively). Although biologically, circumcision is most likely to protect against HIV for men practicing unprotected insertive anal intercourse (UIAI), only 7. 8 % (91 / 1172) of uncircumcised men reported exclusive UIAI in the past 12 months. Relatively few men reported being willing to participate in a research study on circumcision and HIV prevention (13. 9 %), and only 11. 3 % of uncircumcised men did so. Conclusion: The lack of association between circumcision and HIV status, low levels of exclusive IUAI, and low levels of willingness to take part in circumcision research studies suggest circumcision is unlikely to be a feasible HIV prevention strategy for MSM in the UK.

Recent HIV testing increased from 33. 2 % in 2005 to 48. 3 % in 2008 (p< 0. 001). HIV prevalence was comparable in 2005 and 2008 (4. 4 % and 4. 6 % respectively). Among HIV-positive men, there was a reduction in undiagnosed infection between 2005 and 2008 from 41. 7 % to 26. 3 % (p= 0. 08). Undiagnosed HIV did not differ between men who were and were not tested in the past year. In 2008, only 4 (26. 7 %) HIV-positive men tested in the past 6 months were undiagnosed, compared with 11 (42. 3 %) HIV-positive men who had not (p= 0. 03). Conclusion: There was a substantial increase in recent HIV testing between 2005 and 2008. Although there was a concurrent (non-significant) reduction in undiagnosed HIV, {{there was no difference in}} undiagnosed infection between men who had and had not tested recently. However, lower levels of undiagnosed infection among the most recent HIV-positive testers suggest frequent testing could have a role in reducing undiagnosed HIV and should remain central to HIV prevention efforts...|$|R

Samples were tested for antibodies to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) and total IgG as a marker of sample quality. <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were received from 11883 (81. 3 %) cohort children, over 98 % of which were suitable for assay testing. Children whose mothers were of Black Caribbean ethnicity or who lived in non-English speaking households were less likely to provide a sample. Mothers reporting a history of asthma were more likely to return a sample from their child. The estimated prevalence of EBV in the UK was 21. 5 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI) : 20. 4 - 22. 5). Risk factors for early acquisition were maternal Black African, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Other or Indian ethnic group, with decreased acquisition amongst children with mothers aged over 40 years. The prevalence of VZV in children in the UK was estimated using <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> assay and maternal report of varicella history, with prevalence estimates of 47. 3 % (95 % CI: 46. 1 - 48. 6) and 46. 1 % (95 % CI: 44. 8 - 47. 4) respectively. The level of concordance between measures was 70 % with Positive Predictive Value (PPV) 68. 0 % and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) 70. 6 %. <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> sample quality was evaluated by measurement of total IgG concentration with median 2. 19 mg/L (IQ range: 0. 99 - 4. 4). High total IgG was associated with children whose mothers were of Bangladeshi ethnicity or with shorter duration of postal transit time. <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> is a highly acceptable and feasible biological sample for collection in a large-scale child cohort study, although formal interpreter support may increase participation. Ethnic, social and demographic patterns of acquisition may be mediated by cultural, behavioural or biological factors. These findings form the basis for informing future studies of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection,</b> and together with further work regarding <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> sample quality will give the most recent prevalence estimates for EBV and VZV in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to explore {{preparedness}} for the HIV self-test among men who have sex with men (MSM) and those involved in HIV prevention and care. Methods: A mixed methods exploratory research design was employed, detailing awareness and willingness to use the self-test and the perceived barriers and facilitators to implementation. Quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis were completed in parallel. Descriptive and inferential analysis of cross-sectional bar-based survey data collected from MSM through a self-completed questionnaire and <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimen <b>collection</b> (n = 999) was combined with qualitative, thematic, analysis of data collected through 12 expert focus groups (n = 55) consisting of gay men, National Health Service (NHS) staff, community organizations, entrepreneurs and activists. Findings were subsequently combined and assessed for synergies. Results: Among MSM, self-test awareness was moderate (55...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) remain the group most at risk of {{acquiring}} HIV in the UK and new HIV prevention strategies are needed. In this paper, we examine what contact MSM currently have with HIV prevention activities and assess the extent to which these could be utilised further. Methods Anonymous, self-complete questionnaires and Orasure™ <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>collection</b> kits were distributed to men visiting the commercial gay scenes in Glasgow and Edinburgh in April/May 2008. 1508 men completed questionnaires (70. 5 % response rate) and 1277 provided <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples (59. 7 % response rate); 1318 men were eligible for inclusion in the analyses. Results 82. 5 % reported some contact with HIV prevention activities in the past 12 months, 73. 1 % obtained free condoms from a gay venue or the Internet, 51. 1 % reported accessing sexual health information (from either leaflets in gay venues or via the Internet), 13. 5 % reported talking to an outreach worker and 8. 0 % reported participating in counselling on sexual health or HIV prevention. Contact with HIV prevention activities was associated with frequency of gay scene use and either HIV or other STI testing in the past 12 months, but not with sexual risk behaviours. Utilising counselling was also more likely among men who reported having had an STI in the past 12 months and HIV-positive men. Conclusions Men at highest risk, and those likely to be in contact with sexual health services, are those who report most contact with a range of current HIV prevention activities. Offering combination prevention, including outreach by peer health workers, increased uptake of sexual health services delivering behavioural and biomedical interventions, and supported by social marketing to ensure continued community engagement and support, could be the way forward. Focused investment in the needs of those at highest risk, including those diagnosed HIV-positive, may generate a prevention dividend in the long term. </p...|$|R
40|$|Currently viral antigens and {{antibodies}} are {{detected by}} traditional serological tests. However, {{the introduction of}} <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> as an alternative medium would allow other alternatives. The <b>collection</b> of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> is, in comparison with venepuncture, less invasive, less painful, less expensive (i. e., no trained personal required), and safe (prevention of needle stick injuries). Also large numbers of samples can be collected easily for epidemiological purposes. Forty-three HBsAg positive and seventy-three HBsAg negative paired serum/oral fluid samples were tested. They were collected from patients attending university hospitals. The <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were collected using the Oracol <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> and they were subjected to an IgG quantification assay to ensure their quality and quantity. The detection of HBsAg in <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> was carried out using a modified ETI-MAK- 4 ELISA. The validation of this <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> test gave a sensitivity and specificity of 90. 7 % and 100 %, respectively. The modified ETI-MAK- 4 ELISA is a suitable test for <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples collected by the Oracol <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> for epidemiological purposes...|$|R
40|$|Surveillance for swine {{pathogens}} {{and health}} related biomarkers {{is of great}} importance to the financial success of the swine industry {{and the health of}} animal and human populations worldwide. Research has shown that the use of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens in diagnostics and surveillance provides many advantages over serum. To discover the full potential of this technology many aspects of its use must be evaluated e. g. sample collection and handling techniques, assay performance parameters and detection limits of pen-based samples. As reviewed in Chapter 1, the detection of many analytes in human and animal <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples has been reported. In the process of these discoveries, it was been identified that <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> sample <b>collection</b> material, post-collection processing and sample storage can affect testing results of human and animal <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples. Though little data was found in the literature regarding these effects on animal samples, limited reports suggest they may similarly affect veterinary testing of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens. As more diagnostic tests for human and animal <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples become available, it will be important to consider if and how these external factors affect testing results. Pursuant to the concerns identified in Chapter 1, the objective of the first research project (Chapter 2) was to evaluate the effect of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> sampling material and post-collection processing on the results produced by antibody- and polymerase chain reaction-based assays. <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were collected from 104 pens of commercial wean-to-finish pigs using 3 types of rope. Processed (centrifuged and filtered) and unprocessed <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were tested using commercial ELISAs for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) antibodies and total IgM, IgA, and IgG. Only unprocessed samples were tested for PRRSV nucleic acid and processed samples for PRRSV neutralizing antibodies. It was found that all three factors could affect results, but statistically significant effects were non-uniform and assay-dependent. The objective of the second study (Chapter 3) was to evaluate the detection limits of assays detecting PRRSV antibodies and PRRS virus in pen-based <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples from commercial swine. Five successive <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples were collected from 25 pens of commercial swine of known PRRSV prevalence (0 %, 4 %, 12 %, 20 % and 36 %) with five pens per prevalence level. PRRSV prevalence was established by vaccinating commercial swine with an intramuscular modified live PRRSV vaccine 14 days prior to the trial. The vaccinated pigs were then introduced at the designated prevalence levels into pens of otherwise PRRSV negative pigs one day prior to sample collection. Serum was collected from each pig in each pen to confirm expected PRRSV prevalence. <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> and vaccinated pig serum was tested using RT-PCR and ELISA by six laboratories. Intra-laboratory agreement was measured and predicted probability of PRRSV detection in pen-based <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples was estimated for each assay...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> has {{established}} {{itself as a}} robust testing matrix for monitoring drug use or misuse.

40|$|Background. Patients {{who have}} refused to provide blood samples has meant {{that there have been}} {{significant}} delays in confirming outbreaks of Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever (EVHF). During the 2 EVHF outbreaks in the Republic of Congo in 2003, we assessed the use of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens versus serum samples for laboratory confirmation of cases of EVHF. Methods. Serum and <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens were obtained from 24 patients with suspected Ebola and 10 healthy control subjects. Specimens were analyzed for immunoglobulin G antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and for Ebola virus by antigen detection ELISA and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens were collected with a commercially available <b>collection</b> <b>device.</b> Results. We failed to detect antibodies against Ebola in the <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens obtained from patients whose serum samples were seropositive. All patients with positive serum RT-PCR results also had positive results for their <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens. Conclusions. This study demonstrates the usefulness of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples for the investigation of Ebola outbreaks, but further development in antibodies and antigen detection in <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> specimens is needed before these samples are used for filovirus surveillance activities in Africa...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Oral</b> <b>fluid</b> is an {{alternative}} matrix with potential applications in road-side drug screening, work-place testing, drug treatment programs, and epi-demiological surveys. Development of methods for ex-tensive drug screening in <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> is warranted. Methods: We developed a liquid chromatography– tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for drug screening of preserved <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> collected with the Intercept ® <b>collection</b> <b>device.</b> Samples were prepared by liquid–liquid extraction with ethylacetate/heptane (4 : 1). LC-separation was achieved with an Atlantis dC 18 -column (2. 1 50 mm, 3 m particle). Mass detection was performed by positive ion mode electrospray LC-MS/MS and included the following drugs/metabolites: morphine, 6 -monoacetylmorphine, codeine, buprenorphine, metha-done, amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3, 4 -methylene...|$|R
40|$|Saliva is of {{continuing}} interest in detecting {{the influence of}} drugs while driving. Commercial tests are currently available where cannabis detectability is a major challenge. The present study aids {{in the understanding of}} tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) pharmacokinetics in <b>oral</b> <b>fluid.</b> The <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> analyses exhibited no significant differences between 12 occasional users and 12 chronic users smoking a standardized cannabis joint, except for the maximum concentrations in the first samples (occasional users, 397 - 6438 ng/g; chronic users 387 - 71, 747 ng/g). THC was detectable in all samples with medians in the last samples (8 h) of 6. 3 and 11. 3 ng/g in occasional and chronic users, respectively. The elimination half-life in both groups was 1. 6 +/- 0. 4 h. A series of samples was obtained over a period of 8 h without actual drug use representing a later elimination phase. Of these <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> samples, only 4. 3 % were negative for THC despite positive serum, and 24. 1 % of serum samples were negative despite positive <b>oral</b> <b>fluid.</b> This confirms that THC is detectable for longer in <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> than in serum. The oral fluid-to-serum ratios were 0. 3 to 425 (median 16. 5) with no difference between chronic and occasional users. The large inter- and intraindividual variability observed precludes a reliable estimation of THC serum concentrations from <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> data using this <b>collection</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R

In parallel, <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> was collected with the Intercept DOA Oral Specimen <b>Collection</b> <b>device</b> and tested by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) after methylation of THC (limit of quantitation 1 ng/mL). The Drugwipe device identified 1 exposed driver, but with GC-MS, 18 drivers tested positive. THC concentrations in the Intercept buffer ranged from 2.1 to 205.1 ng/mL. These concentrations represent about 1/2 to 1/3 the authentic THC concentrations in <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> because of the dilution by the blue liquid of the device. Two main limitations of <b>oral</b> <b>fluid</b> were 1. the amount of matrix collected is smaller when compared to urine and 2. the levels of drugs in urine are higher than in <b>oral</b> <b>fluid.</b> A current limitation of the use of this specimen for roadside testing is the absence of a suitable immunoassay that detects the parent compound in sufficiently low concentrations." ...|$|R
