50|$|Like the {{penicillins}} and cephalosporins, {{they are}} members of the beta lactam class of antibiotics, which kill bacteria by binding to penicillin-binding proteins and inhibiting cell wall synthesis.

However, the co-administration of tazobactam does not confer activity against MRSA, as penicillins (and most <b>other</b> beta <b>lactams)</b> do not avidly bind to the penicillin-binding proteins of this pathogen.|$|R

Many antibiotics, including <b>other</b> beta <b>lactams,</b> macrolides, and clindamycin are also effective against streptococci and {{have the potential to}} shorten the duration of therapy. The present review was conducted with the objective of evaluating the efficacy of short course (2 to 6 days) of oral antibiotics in treating children with acute streptococcal pharyngitis, compared with a 10 -day course of oral penicillin, on duration of symptoms (fever and sore throat), eradication of the organism, and, recurrence and complication rates (acut...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis consists of â€œsynthesis and bioactivity evaluation of amoxicillin derivativesâ€� which includes the synthesis, optimization, applications and bioactivity evaluation of new metallic derivatives (silver and gold nanoparticles) of amoxicillin and some <b>other</b> beta <b>lactam</b> antibiotics. For a wide spread resistive strains of pathogenic bacteria, {{there is a need}} for some new antibacterial agents to treat the patients, infected with such resistive pathogenic bacteria. Here we synthesized new gold and silver derivatives of amoxicillin and some <b>other</b> beta <b>lactam</b> antibiotics like cefuraxime, cephradine, ceftriaxone etc belonging to beta lactam antibiotics family some of them were penicillins while others are cephalosporins. We synthesized metallic derivatives of amoxicillin in the form of gold and silver nanoparticles and their nano alloys using NaBH 4 and TMA as reducing agents. Reducing agents of different nature (organic and inorganic), NaBH 4 and trimethylamine were used for the synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles to study their effect on sizes and shapes of nanoparticles as well as to avoid the sodium salt formation of amoxicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics using TMA. It was found that nanoparticles synthesized with NaBH 4 were of small size compared to nanoparticles synthesized with TMA. Gold nanoparticles stabilized with amoxicillin were prepared using NaBH 4 and TMA as reducing agents. The applications for metallic sensing like Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, Pb, Cd, and Hg etc were studied. Gold nanoparticles stabilized with amoxicillin were fluorescent and were used for the detection of Cu 2 +ions in water solution. Amoxicillin and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) stabilized with amoxicillin were screened for enzymes inhibition studies as well antiglycation and results were compared. These AuNPs showed very nice inhibition for urease, carbonic anhydrase and xanthine oxidase enzymes and were found very potent inhibitor for xanthine oxidase enzyme with inhibition of 90...|$|R
40|$|Susceptibility of Haemophilus influenzae {{clinical}} isolates to ampicillin {{reported by}} 23 laboratories, {{using a variety}} of methods, was compared with results obtained following retesting at The London Hospital Medical College. Beta lactamase production was not detected on initial isolation in 25 of 157 isolates (16 %) found to be positive on retest. One hundred beta lactamase negative isolates, which gave reduced zone diameters (less than 20 mm) around 2 micrograms discs and required 1 - 64 mg/l ampicillin for inhibition, were detected at The London Hospital. Eighty five of these had been reported as sensitive to ampicillin by the laboratories of origin. Many of these 100 isolates showed reduced susceptibility to <b>other</b> beta <b>lactam</b> antibiotics. Accurate detection of non-enzymic reduced susceptibility to ampicillin may emerge as an important guide to the likely sensitivity of H influenzae isolates to the enzyme stable beta lactams...|$|R
50|$|Reported {{side effects}} include {{injection}} site reactions, rash, and rarely toxic epidermal necrolysis. Gastrointestinal side effects generally include diarrhea and nausea and vomiting. There may be drug-induced eosinophilia. Because of the unfused beta-lactam ring unique to aztreonam, there is somewhat lower cross-reactivity between aztreonam {{and many other}} beta-lactam antibiotics, {{and it may be}} safe to administer aztreonam to many patients with hypersensitivity (allergies) to penicillins and nearly all cephalosporins. However, like <b>other</b> beta <b>lactams,</b> there is a risk of very serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. The aztreonam label directs physicians {{to be aware of the}} possibility of these severe adverse reactions. This is more likely if the patient is allergic to a certain cephalosporin known as ceftazidime. Azetreonam exhibits cross-reactivity with this cephalosporin due to a similar side chain. Physicians should evaluate prior allergy history when prescribing this medicine.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the trend of}} mupirocin resistance in MRSA, isolated at the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: A total of 200 MRSA strains recovered over a 2 year period from various body sites were tested using the 5 and 200 microg discs of mupirocin to detect its resistance. RESULTS: High level and low level mupirocin resistance were detected in zero and 1 % of MRSA strains, respectively. Resistance to <b>other</b> non beta <b>lactam</b> antibiotics was also high. No MRSA strains {{were found to be}} resistant to vancomycin and tegicycline. CONCLUSION: Mupirocin resistance was found to be very low among local clinical isolates of MRSA. Its judicious use to decolonize nasal carriers should be promoted among hospitalized patients to avoid further transmission and infections due to prevalent endemic MRSA strains in any health care setting. Concomitantly, regular surveillance and effective infection control initiatives are desirable to reduce the incidence of health care associated infections due to MRSA and also of mupirocin resistance...|$|R
40|$|Background: Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) is {{the major}} cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Increased methicillin-resistant strains have {{attracted}} a global concern. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) SSTIs in dermatologic settings and evaluate their susceptibility results. Methods: A retrospective chart analysis of patients diagnosed with SSTIs in the Department of Dermatology, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in Hualien, Taiwan from November 2003 to July 2007 was conducted. Wound or pus bacterial culture results from a wound site were collected. The epidemiology, microbiology, and antibiotic susceptibility were assessed. Minocycline treatment experience in 15 MRSA SSTIs inpatients was presented. Results: Of the 443 SSTI episodes included, 59. 6 % were males and 40. 4 % were females. S aureus was the leading cause (53. 3 %), and among them 53. 0 % were MRSA. Minocycline (94. 4 %), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (95. 2 %), levofloxacin (95. 7 %), and fusidic acid (98. 9 %) were the major susceptible antimicrobial agents to MRSA. Only 14. 4 % was susceptible to clindamycin. In the MRSA infected inpatients, 75. 6 % were community-associated. In our clinical experience, 15 inpatients with poor clinical response to beta-lactam empirical antimicrobial therapy received minocycline as combination therapy based on the susceptibility results, all of which obtained satisfied clinical remission. Conclusions: S aureus is still the leading causative bacterial organism for SSTIs in the dermatologic settings in eastern Taiwan. Methicillin-resistant strains are increasing and among which most are community-associated in eastern Taiwan. MRSA strains are still susceptible to <b>other</b> non-beta <b>lactam</b> antibiotics, such as minocycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, levofloxacin, and fusidic acid in dermatological settings, of which minocycline is an alternative choice in our clinical experience...|$|R
40|$|N. m. r., i. r. {{and optical}} spectra of model {{compounds}} were recorded. These were {{to help in}} elucidating the structures of the phenylazo derivatives of bilirubin conjugates isolated from human bile. Model compounds included commercial and human bile bilirubin, mesobilirubin, bilirubin dimethyl ester, dimethoxybilirubin dimethyl ester and the corresponding phenylazo derivatives. The phenylazo derivative of vinylneoxanthobilirubinic acid was also investigated. All compounds were of the type IXα, and no other isomer could be detected with the spectroscopic methods employed. The compounds crystallize as the lactams, except for dimethoxybilirubin dimethyl ester and its phenylazo derivative, which are held in the lactim ether configuration. With all other compounds no tautomeric forms <b>other</b> than the <b>lactams</b> could be detected, although small proportions of bilirubin must exist as the lactim. Bilirubin does not form a betaine, a structure that has been proposed by von Dobeneck & Brunner (1965) to explain the bathochromic shift of its optical spectrum {{as compared with the}} expected position of the absorption maximum at 420 nm. However, this shift to 453 nm can be explained on the basis of internal hydrogen bonds occurring between the carboxylic protons and the pyrrole rings of bilirubin, as proposed by Fog & Jellum (1963), and new evidence for such a bonding has been accumulated. The bilirubin sulphate described by Watson (1958), which is formed by treatment of bilirubin with concentrated sulphuric acid and acetic anhydride, was also investigated. The main product of this reaction was isolated as its phenylazo derivative, and was shown to be 3, 18 -di(ethylidene sulphate) - 2, 7, 13, 17 -tetramethylbiladiene-ac- 8, 12 -dipropionic acid. The reaction leading to this compound is an addition of sulphuric acid to the vinyl side chains of bilirubin according to Markownikoff's rule...|$|R
40|$|The SPRY-domain of the SOCS box protein 2 (SPSB 2) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the proteasomal degradation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). SPSB 2 knockout mice show prolonged expression of iNOS and enhanced killing of persistent pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Leishmania major, suggesting that inhibitors of the SPSB 2 -iNOS interaction represent a potential novel class of anti-infectives. In this study, attempts to discover small molecule inhibitors of SPSB 2 -iNOS interaction were performed using in silico guided fragment-based drug design (FBDD) approach. The best fragment hit STK 441224, however, was found to bind promiscuously to SPSB 2 by saturation transfer difference spectroscopy (STD), Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG), ¹⁹ F and [¹ H,¹⁵N]-HSQC NMR experiments, with an estimated KD of 1. 8 mM by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Further predictions by SiteMap and FTMap revealed that the iNOS binding site of SPSB 2 is less druggable, explaining the poor outcome from the current FBDD campaign. Thus, other approaches to discover potent and specific inhibitors of the SPSB 2 -iNOS interaction were explored. Utilising an in silico structure-based drug design approach, a disulphide-bridged cyclic peptide Ac-c[CVDINNNC]-NH 2 was designed and synthesised. It was found to bind to the iNOS binding site on SPSB 2 with a KD of 4. 4 nM, as shown by SPR, [¹H,¹⁵N]-HSQC and ¹⁹F NMR experiments, with approximately 70 -fold improvement in affinity, compared to the linear peptide DINNN (KD ≈ 318 nM). An in vitro assay on macrophage cell lysates further showed a complete inhibition of SPSB 2 -iNOS interactions by the cyclic peptide. In addition, the solution structure of the cyclic peptide was found to closely match that of the crystal structure of SPSB 2 -bound linear peptide DINNN with a backbone RMSD of 1. 21 Å. The designed peptide was also found to be stable against pepsin, trypsin and α-chymotrypsin, and in human plasma. The disulphide-bridged cyclic peptide, however, is reductively labile. To generate redox-stable inhibitors of SPSB 2 -iNOS interaction that would retain activity in the cell cytoplasm, two cyclic peptide analogues, one containing a thioether bridge (CP 1) and the <b>other</b> a <b>lactam</b> bridge (CP 2), as well as four cyclic peptidomimetics (M 1 -M 4), incorporating organic moieties as cyclisation linkers, were generated. All analogues were able to bind to the iNOS binding site of SPSB 2, with five of the six analogues binding with stronger affinities (3 - 15 fold) than the linear peptide DINNN (CP 1, KD 31 nM; CP 2, KD 21 nM; M 1, KD 29 nM; M 2, KD 99 nM; M 3, KD 54 nM; M 4, KD 465 nM), as determined by 19 F NMR and SPR, respectively. All analogues were able to compete with full-length iNOS for binding to SPSB 2 in macrophage cell lysates. As CP 2 is the most potent redox-stable analogue, with more sites for derivatisation and is easier to synthesise compared to other analogues, CP 2 is being used as the template to generate analogues for macrophage-targeted delivery studies. Binding studies by SPR and 19 F NMR revealed an approximately 5 -fold improvement in binding affinity of rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC) -conjugated cyclic peptide analogue CP 4 to the iNOS binding site of SPSB 2 (KD ≈ 4 nM), while the oligohistidine-conjugated analogues CP 5 and CP 6 showed a modest 1 - 2 fold drop in their binding affinities to SPSB 2 compared to CP 2 (KD ≈ 33 - 51 nM). Imaging studies of mannose or GalNAc glycopolymer-conjugated analogues of CP 4 (i. e. CP 7 and CP 8, respectively) by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that both analogues were taken up by bone marrow-derived macrophages but not HEK 293 cells. On the other hand, oligohistidine-conjugated analogue CP 6 showed signs of endosomal escape after 9 h of incubation, although coincident signs of cell necrosis or apoptosis were observed in some of these macrophages. In summary, several potent and stable cyclic peptide and peptidomimetic inhibitors of SPSB 2 -iNOS interactions were identified in this study. One of these analogues was able to be derivatised for macrophage-targeted delivery studies without negatively affecting their binding to SPSB 2. This study also showed that both mannose and GalNAc glycopolymers are viable choices for macrophage-targeted delivery although more work to improve the endosomal escape of this new class of cyclic peptide inhibitors of SPSB 2 -iNOS interaction to the cytoplasm of macrophages without causing cell injury is needed...|$|R
