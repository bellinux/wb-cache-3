5|$|The Government is {{responsible}} to the Croatian Parliament; the parliament may recall the Government as a whole or {{any member of the}} Government in particular by an absolute majority vote (majority of all MPs) following a request for a confidence vote by one fifth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> members or by the prime minister. The prime minister {{and other members of the}} Government are jointly responsible for decisions passed by the Government and individually responsible for their respective portfolios (areas of responsibility). The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> to signify this. Appointments of members of the Government are done by the prime minister with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament).</b> The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the Government must be published in Narodne Novine—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.|$|E

5|$|From 1921 to 1976, {{the meeting}} place <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parliament</b> of Malta {{had been the}} Tapestry Chamber of the Grandmaster's Palace, also in Valletta.

5|$|From {{the reign}} of King James I, the {{beginnings}} of a legal profession began to develop and the administration of criminal and civil justice was centralised. The growing activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> and the centralisation of administration in Scotland called for the better dissemination of Acts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parliament</b> to the courts and other enforcers of the law. Throughout the late fifteenth century, unsuccessful attempts were made to form commissions of experts to codify, update or define Scots law. The legal uncertainty that this situation created prompted increased reliance on the common law found in Canon law, {{and there are a number}} of examples of statutes from this period that clearly drew from Roman law. The general practice during this period, as evidenced from records of cases, seems to have been to defer to specific Scottish laws on a matter when available and to fill in any gaps with provisions from the common law embodied in Civil and Canon law, which had the advantage of being written.|$|E
