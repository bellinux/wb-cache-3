40|$|Abstract Background Genotyping may {{be carried}} out by a number of {{different}} methods including direct sequencing and polymorphism analysis. For a number of reasons, PCR-based polymorphism analysis may be desirable, owing to the fact that only small amounts of genetic material are required, and that the costs are low. One popular and cheap method for detecting polymorphisms is by using cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence, or CAPS, molecular markers. These are also known as PCR-RFLP markers. Results We have developed a program, called CapsID, that identifies snip-SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms that alter restriction endonuclease cut sites) within a set or sets of reference sequences, designs PCR primers around these, and then suggests the most parsimonious combination of markers for genotyping any individual who is {{not a member of the}} reference set.

Consequently, {{there will be a}} high demand of bioinformatics tools to cope with the several gigabytes of sequence data generated in each single deep-sequencing experiment. Given this scene, we developed miRanalyzer, a web server tool for the analysis of deep-sequencing experiments for small RNAs. The web server tool requires a simple input file containing a list of unique reads and its copy numbers (expression levels). Using these data, miRanalyzer (i) detects all known microRNA sequences annotated in miRBase, (ii) finds all perfect matches against other libraries of transcribed sequences and (iii) predicts new microRNAs. The prediction of new microRNAs is an especially important point as there are many species with very few known microRNAs. Therefore, we implemented a highly accurate machine learning algorithm for the prediction of new microRNAs that reaches AUC values of 97. 9 % and recall values of up to 75 % on unseen data. The web tool summarizes all the described steps in a single <b>output</b> <b>page,</b> which provides a comprehensive overview of the analysis, adding links to more detailed output pages for each analysis module. miRanalyzer is available at [URL]...|$|E

It {{is a combination of}} previous Spritz with two novel orthogonal systems developed by our group (Punch and ESpritz). Punch is based on sequence and structural templates trained with support vector machines. ESpritz is an efficient single sequence method based on bidirectional recursive neural networks. Spritz was extended to filter predictions based on structural homologues. After extensive testing, predictions are combined by averaging their probabilities. The CSpritz website can elaborate single or multiple predictions for either short or long disorder.

40|$|We {{present a}} multiresolutional {{algorithm}} that segments a compound document {{and uses the}} results of the segmentation for document enhancement in copier applications. The document is initially segmented into halftone and non-halftone areas. Based on this segmentation the location of the edges due to text, graphics, and images (and not due to halftone dots) are detected on halftone as well as on non-halftone portions. We further detect constant-tone regions within non-halftone areas for subsequent bleed-through removal applications. Edge enhancement on detected edges and descreening on detected halftones are carried out. The algorithm can detect general halftones over regions of arbitrary sizes and shapes, and it can be straightforwardly adjusted for operation at various dpi resolutions. We obtain high detection probabilities on compound multilingual documents containing halftones and fine text. The proposed enhancement stage is tolerant of segmentation errors providing robust performance for the remaining problem cases. Our main contribution is the accomplishment of these tasks with a single pass algorithm that is computationally very simple and that requires less than 1 % of full page memory, with active memory requirements less than. 02 % of full page memory.
