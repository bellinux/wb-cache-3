5|$|As {{a prelude}} to his planned {{campaign}} in Greece, Philip went on campaign {{in the winter of}} 339 BC, against the Scythians living south of the Danube, near the river's mouth (in Dobruja). He defeated them in battle, taking many captive, and built a statue of Heracles to commemorate his victory. He then marched through the territory of the Triballi in a demonstration of force, which probably lay upstream along the course of the Danube. During a skirmish, he was severely wounded in the leg when a spear passed through it and killed the horse he was riding. Recovering from this wound may have delayed Philip's campaign in Greece, since he did not set <b>off</b> <b>until</b> the autumn of 339 BC.|$|E
5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, {{about a half a}} mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense.

The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through the crowd of men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E

5|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day is an action-platform {{game where}} the player {{controls}} Conker the Squirrel {{through a series}} of three-dimensional levels. The game features an overworld where players can transition from one level to another, although many are initially blocked <b>off</b> <b>until</b> Conker earns a certain amount of cash. Each level is an enclosed area in which the player can freely explore to find tasks to do. The gameplay mostly relies on figuring out a way to help other characters by completing a linear sequence of challenges. These challenges may include defeating a boss, solving puzzles, gathering objects, and racing opponents, among others. The result is always a cash reward, which aids access to other areas in the overworld.|$|E
5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put <b>off</b> <b>until</b> 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{the owner}} of the Point, Augustus Cholmondeley Gough-Calthorpe, 6th Baron Calthorpe, leased the land to University College London (UCL), who also {{purchased}} the Old Lifeboat House {{at the end of the}} spit. When the baron died later that year, his heirs put Blakeney Point up for sale, raising the possibility of development. In 1912, a public appeal initiated by Charles Rothschild and organised by UCL Professor Francis Wall Oliver and Dr Sidney Long enabled the purchase of Blakeney Point from the Calthorpe estate, and the land was then donated to the National Trust. UCL established a research centre at the Old Lifeboat House in 1913, where Oliver and his college pioneered the scientific study of Blakeney Point. The building is still used by students, and also acts as an information centre. Despite formal protection, the tern colony was not fenced <b>off</b> <b>until</b> the 1960s.|$|E

Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. Prayers were offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. The candle remained lit for three days before being shut <b>off</b> <b>until</b> the official lighting event.|$|E

Aside from Slash, the band consisted of Teddy Andreadis, guitarist Bobby Schneck, bassist Johnny Griparic, saxophonist Dave McClarem and drummer Alvino Bennett. The band toured on and <b>off</b> <b>until</b> 1998, which included a headline slot at a jazz festival in Budapest. They covered various artists and bands such as B.B.

5|$|The first {{excavations}} at Volubilis {{were carried}} out by the French archaeologist Henri de la Martinière between 1887 and 1892. In 1915 Hubert Lyautey, the military governor of French Morocco, commissioned the French archaeologists Marcel and Jane Dieulafoy to carry out excavations in Volubilis. Although Jane's ill-health meant that they were unable to carry out the programme of work that they drew up for Lyautey, the work went ahead anyway under Louis Chatelain. The French archaeologists were assisted by thousands of German prisoners of war who had been captured during First World War and loaned to the excavators by Lyautey. The excavations continued on and <b>off</b> <b>until</b> 1941, when the Second World War forced a halt.|$|E

5|$|Arha and Kossil have {{a public}} falling out in which Kossil says that nobody {{believes}} in the Nameless Ones anymore. In response Arha curses her {{in the name of}} the Nameless Ones. Realizing that Kossil will now be determined to kill her, she heads underground to the labyrinth, and sees Kossil uncovering the false grave. Evading her, Arha goes to the treasury and confesses everything to Ged, who has found the other half of Erreth-Akbe's ring in the treasury. He tells Arha that she must either kill him or escape with him, and says that the Nameless Ones demand her service but give nothing and create nothing in return. He tells her his true name, Ged, in return for the trust she has shown him. They escape together, though Manan, who has come looking for Arha, falls into a pit in the labyrinth and is killed. The tombs begin to collapse in on themselves; Ged holds them <b>off</b> <b>until</b> they leave. Arha reverts to calling herself Tenar as she and Ged travel to the coast where his boat is hidden. While waiting for the tide she has an urge to kill Ged for destroying her life, but realizes while gazing at him that she has no anger left. Ged and Tenar return to Havnor, where they are received in triumph.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above. Some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Keen can also grab onto the edge of platforms and pull himself up. There are giant switches which must be jumped up into or dropped onto to flip which have effects on the gameworld, such as retracting and extending gates or initiate moving platforms. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though the player can save their game at any point. Between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed, while portions of the map are gated <b>off</b> <b>until</b> specific levels are completed.|$|E
5|$|In April 1869, the U.S. Senate {{overwhelmingly}} {{rejected a}} proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war. Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress; publicly denounced Queen Victoria; demanded a huge reparation; {{and opened the}} possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment. The speech angered the British government, and talks {{had to be put}} <b>off</b> <b>until</b> matters cooled down. Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish. A joint high commission was created on February 9, 1871 in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers. Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8, 1871; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24, 1871.|$|E
