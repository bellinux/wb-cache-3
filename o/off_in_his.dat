5|$|Bieksa {{was known}} as a two-way defenceman with the Canucks, capable of playing in all situations. Throughout his NHL career, he has been placed on {{shutdown}} pairing with such defensive partners as Willie Mitchell and Dan Hamhuis. Offensively, he regularly jumps into the rush and has led the Canucks in defensive scoring in 2006–07 and 2008–09. His play is characterized by aggressive and competitive components. He also earned a reputation as a fighter early in his career in the AHL. However, Bieksa's scoring dropped <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> first season with the Ducks.He has been praised throughout his career for his leadership qualities.|$|E

Parsons stabbed Ernest to death and drove <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> blue Dodge Omni.|$|E

5|$|Blomqvist joined Enköpings SK as a {{coach in}} 2008 {{and went on to}} make a playing return in the Superettan, the second tier of Swedish football. Ironically, a {{shortage}} of players at the club due to injury forced Blomqvist's playing return. The player shortage was highlighted when Blomqvist was sent <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> second game for the club. This resulted in a suspension for Blomqvist, and Enköping only having fifteen players available for the following match. On 15 September 2008, he scored his first professional goal in five years in a 1–0 win against IK Sirius. In total, he made 10 Superettan appearances, but was unable to save Enköping from relegation to Division 1 for the 2009 season. He left Enköping after the season and later signed a contract with newly relegated Hammarby IF as assistant manager to Michael Borgqvist.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of Victor Peirce in episode eight {{is portrayed as}} taking place in his car {{at the front of}} his home, but Peirce was shot dead while parked opposite a supermarket in Bay Street, Port Melbourne. The murder of alleged drug dealer Willie Thompson was portrayed in episode ten as Thompson being shot after leaving a martial arts class in broad daylight. However, Thompson was shot dead at around 9:30 pm, and the murder occurred on Waverley Road in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone, as he began to drive <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car, directly outside the entrance to the martial arts centre. Another fiction portrayed was the murder of Nik Radev by both Victor Brincat and Andrew Veniamin in the late hours of the night when Radev was in fact ambushed on a residential street in Coburg in the company of two bodyguards in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Frank {{tires of}} Roo being mean to Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn) and they split up. Alf sends Roo to {{boarding}} school in the city. Frank decides that he misses her and tracks her down. He gets into a fight with Roo's new boyfriend, Brett. Roo returns to Summer Bay, hiding {{the fact that she}} is pregnant. Roo schemes to get Frank to sleep with her and Alf to catch them in bed together. Alf sacks Frank, but Ailsa employs him instead. Roo later announces that she is pregnant by Frank, and Alf believes her as he caught them having sex. Frank then agrees to marry Roo.

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of March 12, elements of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division were dropped off at designated landing zones around Phuoc An. Initially about 100 South Vietnamese helicopters participated in the operation, and 81 fighter-bombers were deployed to strike at North Vietnamese positions to cover the landings. At 3:10pm, Phu took <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Cessna U-17 to direct the operation over the skies of Ban Me Thuot. As he approached the battlefield, Phu phoned the South Vietnamese units at Hoa Binh airfield to notify them that an operation was underway, and he encouraged the soldiers {{to hold on to}} their positions. On the morning of March 13, another 145 helicopters were used to complete {{the first phase of the}} operation with the entire 44th Infantry Regiment, the last soldiers of the 45th Infantry Regiment, and the 232nd Artillery Battalion dropped off at various points in Nong Trai, Phuoc An and along Highway 21. At the completion of the landing operation, Phu returned to Pleiku to have a meeting with Thieu, during which they discussed the sudden appearance of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division.|$|E

25|$|As Beethoven, in {{his last}} quartets, went <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own direction, Franz Schubert carried on and {{established}} the emerging romantic style. In his 31 years, Schubert devoted {{much of his life}} to chamber music, composing 15 string quartets, two piano trios, string trios, a piano quintet commonly known as the Trout Quintet, an octet for strings and winds, and his famous quintet for two violins, viola, and two cellos.|$|E
25|$|His {{economical}} {{action was}} notable for his close {{approach to the}} wicket at the bowler's end (to {{the point where he}} occasionally knocked the bails <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> approach), a line which meant he was able to trap many batsmen leg before wicket. He broke the Test-wicket taking record with his 374th wicket on 12 November 1988 in Bangalore, India. His 400th Test wicket was claimed on 4 February 1990, and with his last Test delivery, on 9 July 1990, he dismissed Devon Malcolm for a duck.|$|E

25|$|The Toronto Blue Jays took {{a chance}} by signing Burnett to a five-year deal despite his being prone to injuries, and the 2006 season began with him going on the {{disabled}} list when a piece of scar tissue—remnants of his Tommy John surgery—broke <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pitching arm. However, some baseball commentators like RotoWorld and Tim Dierkes still considered the signing worthwhile, since many of the other free agent pitchers that year, like Matt Morris and Paul Byrd had less impressive career stats, even though they had fewer health risks.|$|E
25|$|Mallory's {{unbroken}} snow-goggles {{were found}} in his pocket, suggesting that he and Irvine had made a push for the summit and were descending after sunset. On his attempt a few days earlier, Norton had suffered serious snow-blindness {{because he did not}} wear his goggles, so Mallory would be unlikely to have dispensed with them in daylight, and given their known departure time and movements, had they not attempted the summit pyramid it is unlikely that they would have still been out by nightfall. An alternative scenario is that Mallory may have carried an extra pair and the pair he was wearing were torn <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> fall.|$|E
25|$|Although Gacy {{remained}} gregarious and civic-minded, several neighbors {{became aware}} of erratic changes in his behavior between his divorce in March 1976 and subsequent arrest in December 1978. This behavior included hearing his car arrive and depart {{in the early hours}} of the morning; noting lights switching on and <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> home at odd hours; and his keeping company with young males. One neighbor would later recollect that, for several years, she and her son had repeatedly been awoken by the repeated sounds of muffled screaming, shouting, and crying in the early morning hours, which she and her son had identified as emanating from a house adjacent to theirs on Summerdale Avenue.|$|E

Passengers in the Burnelli scrambled {{to the other side of}} the cabin to tilt the wing back up. Schneider sent his plane diving just as the Burnelli's wing scraped his plane's wing. A crash was averted by his dip. The officials said his quick action in dipping his plane close to the ground and then pulling clear of the grandstand had probably averted the most serious accident in the races.|$|E

Bennett and Lang drove into the parking lot a few hours later and he walked her to her convertible. As she started the engine, turned on the headlights and prepared to drive away, Lang leaned on the car, with both hands raised to his shoulders, and talked to her.|$|E
25|$|The Bangladeshi bowlers bowled patiently, but {{the poor}} start had cost them badly, {{and it went}} {{from bad to worse}} when Nazmul limped <b>off</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> seventh over.

Neither could contain the Sri Lankans, though, as the captain Marvan Atapattu and wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara took Sri Lanka past 200 with 11 overs to go. Sangakkara eventually fell to Rafique, and in the next over Syed Rasel got rid of pinch hitter Dilhara Lokuhettige for 2, only to see Mahela Jayawardene, the man of the last match, come in to partner Atapattu. The pair added 43 from the last 26 balls, Atapattu recording a whirlwind 53 while Jayawardene closed on 23.|$|E
