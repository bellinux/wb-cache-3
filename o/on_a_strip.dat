25|$|A Turing {{machine is}} a {{mathematical}} model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>strip</b> of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, {{but rather as a}} thought experiment representing a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.|$|E

500|$|The video premiered on October 22, 2008. It is set by a pool, {{as well as}} in a mansion.

He added that, [...] "thanks to Pinto's wattage, [...] "Gorilla" [...] goes to heights — and depths — Mars has never visited before".

Carl Williot of the website's Idolator thought that the new video maintained the [...] "sweaty nightclub vibe" [...] style from the previous video [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". Additionally, she felt there is a story centered on Isabella, the new dancer, and Mars, which obviously upset [...] "the club’s veteran strippers". The Times of India newspaper considered the video {{one of the most controversial}} of 2013 because of [...] "Freida Pinto strip act". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly opined that [...] "Bruno Mars is getting real" [...] since the video was set <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>strip</b> club and featured Freida Pinto striping, licking guitars and getting intimate with Mars. Lauren Kreisler of Official Charts Company praised the video concept and concluded that it was [...] "racy as you might have expected".
