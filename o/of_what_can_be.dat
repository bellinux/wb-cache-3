In {{his work}} of sums of four squares, partitions, pentagonal numbers, {{and the distribution}} of prime numbers, Euler pioneered the use <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen as analysis (in particular, infinite series) in number theory. Since he lived before the development of complex analysis, most of his work is restricted to the formal manipulation of power series. He did, however, do some very notable (though not fully rigorous) early work on what would later be called the Riemann zeta function.|$|E
25|$|The castle {{may have}} been built by the Banu Numayr tribe in the 11th century. Historical sources mention that the castle was given by Malik Shah I to {{descendants}} of the Uqaylid dynasty in 1086. They held the castle almost continuously until the late 12th century, except for a brief occupation by Crusaders in 1102. In 1146, Zengi besieged the castle, but he was murdered there {{by one of his}} own slaves. In 1168, Qal'at Ja'bar passed into the hands of Zengi's son Nur ad-Din, who undertook major construction works at the castle. Most <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen today dates to this period. The castle was heavily damaged during the Mongol invasions of Syria. Restoration works were carried out in the 14th century.|$|E
25|$|Interactivity can be {{considered}} a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable different degrees of interactivity, and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman considers digital satellite television {{as an example of a}} new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{normally}} distributed data, the three sigma rule means that roughly 1 in 22 observations will differ by twice the standard deviation or more from the mean, and 1 in 370 will deviate by three times the standard deviation. In a sample of 1000 observations, the presence of up to five observations deviating from the mean by {{more than three times}} the standard deviation is within the range <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> expected, being less than twice the expected number and hence within 1 standard deviation of the expected number – see Poisson distribution – and not indicate an anomaly.

500|$|Writing for AllGame, Shawn Sackenheim {{considered}} the [...] "highly technical" [...] control scheme of 1080° Snowboarding {{one of the}} game's strengths despite its initial difficulty. Alex Constantides of Computer and Video Games positively reviewed the control scheme, but disagreed on its difficulty, noting [...] "the controls have been implemented so brilliantly that you're able to play perfectly well with just {{one hand on the}} stick and Z button." [...] GameSpot called the game's control [...] "thoroughly involving" [...] and said that [...] "he crouch move alone– which makes for supertight turns– makes this fun to play." [...] The music was also generally praised, with Matt Casamassina of IGN calling it [...] "a shining example <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> achieved on the format" [...] and Sackenheim calling it [...] "one of the best N64 soundtracks to date". Sackenheim also praised the game's sound effects.|$|E

[...] Several critics noted Jackson lip synced portions of the show, {{in a similar fashion}} to her contemporaries. Jon Pareles commented, [...] "most lip-synched shows are done by video-era pop performers whose audiences are young and television trained. They fill arenas to enjoy a spectacle like what they saw on television—the dancing... the stage effects and incidentally the songs." [...] Michael MacCambridge considered it a [...] "moot point" [...] stating, [...] "Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles." ...|$|E

Matt Patches of Esquire added, [...] "The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench Daredevil in shadows and blood." [...] He compared Daredevil to [...] "a TV spinoff" [...] of Christopher Nolans Batman films, and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of Daredevil, in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, could be a problem for binge-watchers. Victoria McNally of MTV felt the early episodes' fight sequences were [...] "filmed beautifully" [...] and enjoyed that they featured little CGI, while also calling Henson [...] "perfectly cast and endlessly amusing" [...] as Nelson.|$|E
500|$|The writer Friedrich Schiller (four {{of whose}} plays were adapted as operas by Verdi) {{distinguished}} {{two types of}} artist in his 1795 essay On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin ranked Verdi in the 'naïve' category—"They are not...self-conscious. They do not...stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings....They are able...if they have genius, to embody their vision fully." [...] (The 'sentimentals' seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms—Berlin instances Wagner—"offering not peace, but a sword.") Verdi's operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory, or with a purpose to change the tastes of their audiences. In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that, whilst [...] "there was much to be admired in [...] Tannhäuser and Lohengrin...in his recent operas [...] seemed to be overstepping the bounds <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> expressed in [...] music. For him [...] "philosophical" [...] music was incomprehensible." [...] Although Verdi's works belong, as Rosselli admits [...] "to the most artificial of genres... ring emotionally true: truth and directness make them exciting, often hugely so." ...|$|E
500|$|Jet {{magazine}} reported [...] "Janet's innovative stage performances {{during her}} world tours have won her {{a reputation as}} a world-class performer." [...] Chris Willman of Los Angeles Times stated the [...] "enthralling" [...] choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour [...] "represents the pinnacle <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> done in the popping 'n' locking style—a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements." [...] When Jackson was asked [...] "do you understand it when people talk about [...] in terms of Broadway?", she responded, [...] "I'm crazy about Broadway ... That's what I grew up on." [...] Her [...] "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" [...] tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasn't always evident in stadiums... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered in 20-plus years." ...|$|E
