2500|$|Japan set up puppet {{regimes in}} Manchuria and China; they {{vanished}} {{at the end}} of the war. The Army operated ruthless governments in most of the conquered areas, but paid more favorable attention to the Dutch East Indies. The main goal was to obtain oil. The Dutch destroyed their oil wells but the Japanese reopened them. However most of the tankers taking oil to Japan were sunk by American submarines, so Japan's <b>oil</b> <b>shortage</b> became increasingly acute. Japan sponsored an Indonesian nationalist movement under Sukarno. [...] Sukarno finally came to power in the late 1940s after several years of battling the Dutch.|$|E

50|$|Although the M1935 {{was a very}} {{satisfactory}} vessel, it was {{complex and}} expensive to build and a simplified design was put into production in 1941. These ships had coal-fired boilers because of <b>oil</b> <b>shortages.</b> A total of 127 ships were built between 1941 and 1944, and 63 M1940 class ships were sunk during the war.|$|R
50|$|The diesel railcars, {{producing}} {{much less}} smoke than the gasoline-powered ones, were well {{received by the}} public and became quite popular. However, increasing <b>oil</b> <b>shortages</b> during the Pacific War led to their use being curtailed. Therefore, the engines were modified to use other fuels such as alcohol and benzene; experiments were conducted with wood gas, as well. However, these proved unsatisfactory, and the experiments ceased in 1944.|$|R

50|$|In 1981, the Korean State Railway took {{delivery}} of seven Francorail-MTE CSE26-21 diesel locomotives from France, followed by five more in 1985. Due to <b>oil</b> <b>shortages</b> {{in the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, {{it was decided to}} convert these locomotives to 3,000 V DC electric operation, by removing the diesel engines and installing pantographs and other necessary electrical equipment; this work was carried out by the Kim Chong-t'ae Electric Locomotive Works in P'yŏngyang. The result of this were the prototypes of the 5400-series Red Flag Co-Co locomotives.|$|R
25|$|The {{blockade}} against Germany affected Denmark too with unfortunate results. Since {{the country}} has virtually no natural resources of its own it was very vulnerable to these price shocks and shortages. The government had foreseen the possibility of coal and <b>oil</b> <b>shortages</b> and had stockpiled some before the war, which, combined with rationing, prevented {{some of the worst}} potential problems from coming to the country. The disruptions to the European trading network were also damaging to the economy, but all things considered, Denmark did quite well compared to other countries during the war.|$|R

USL went bankrupt in 1987. [...] McLean took very personally the criticism directed against him after the collapse of USL and the resulting loss of many jobs associated with and dependent on USL.|$|R
50|$|Ballantine's Richard's Bicycle Book, first {{published}} in 1972, appeared {{at a time when}} cycling was experiencing a resurgence in popularity {{due in part to the}} <b>oil</b> <b>shortages</b> of the world oil crisis and the appearance of lightweight road bicycles. The book was a cornucopia of cycling-related information; it not only contained an overview of the history of the bicycle, explanations of differing bicycle designs and types and various bicycle accessories, guides to basic bicycle maintenance and fitting among others, but was heavily laced with the author's own views and humour to boot.|$|R
