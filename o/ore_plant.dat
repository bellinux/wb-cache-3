40|$|In 1959, {{approximately}} 20 km to the north-west of České Budějovice {{a construction}} of a chemical uranium <b>ore</b> <b>plant</b> MAPE began. The plant operation started in 1962 and finished in 1991. The premises of the former chemical plant MAPE Mydlovary consisted of a plant in which uranium ore was manufactured and the manufactured material from uranium mines was stored in adjacent sludge lagoons. Uranium ore has never been mined in this area, neither in its surroundings. It has always been imported from uranium mines. Uranium was made from the ores by either acid or alkali leaching. Although this former uranium <b>ore</b> <b>plant</b> MAPE Mydlovary hasn´t been economically active anymore, it is nowadays {{one of the biggest}} environmental burden which results from ore mining and it's processing in the Czech Republic. Therefore, it is important to carry out remediation and recultivation works which are currently provided by the state enterprise DIAMO. DIAMO company, in fact, is also the owner of the former plant MAPE Mydlovary. During the operation of the former <b>ore</b> <b>plant</b> MAPE Mydlovary, about 1, 100 employees took turns in the company. During the uranium ore treating and its consequent waste store in the lunge lagoons, employees of the plant were exposed to the effect of radionuclides. For this reason, my diploma thesis deals with the effect of radiation on employees of the former chemical plant MAPE Mydlovary and aims at the doses which the employees received while working in the plant. The data were gathered from October 2013 to April 2014 and contain figures for a period of 1963 - 1996. These figures were gained from personal dosimetrical files of the employees and these files were provided by the state enterprise DIAMO. The first aim of the thesis was to monitor the rate of radiation and to compare the gained values among individual employees of the plant MAPE Mydlovary. The monitoring of the effect of radiation was carried out from personal files of the employees and the measured values were put into tables of Excel programme. The values were then compared and I also used descriptive figures statistics. The doses at the employees were found not to exceed any dose limits. The second aim of the thesis was to evaluate the measured values at several groups of employees according to the type of the work they do. The division into individual groups was carried out according to the scale of received doses. It deals with a group of employees who worked at least for 6 months with dustiness, another group working in a sludge lagoon, another group of workers who were responsible for the main manufacture but weren´t exposed to any dustiness (according to the type of work, these people were then divided either into the first or the second sub-group) and also a group of other employees who had their own dosimeter- this group served as a comparative reference in a statistic research. The measures values were evaluated by a statistic research. For this type of research, we used a parametric testing and a so-called Fischer´s F-test, which was applied thanks the Statistics function in a table processor MS Excel 2010. For this test, we used the level of significance = 0, 05. Through the statistic research, we have found out that the highest measured values appeared at the employees who were working in the main manufacture but without any dustiness. This group of people was ranked as the first group. The lowest amount of received doses appeared at the employees who worked in the main manufacture, without any dustiness and were put into the second sub-group. The hypothesis that the doses of the MAPE Mydlovary employees are different within the groups has been confirmed. The hypothesis that the doses at the MAPE Mydlovary staff didn´t exceed any dose limits for the staff has been confirmed as well. The hypothesis that the doses at the MAPE Mydlovary staff were different in certain groups was confirmed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{transient}} flotation {{model for}} the purpose of flotation control has been proposed in this paper, which describes the operation from one steady state to other steady state when influential process variable (such as reagent addition, air flow rate, level etc.) change during operation. The proposed model assumes first order kinetics of floating species under specified process conditions. During transition, the material with rate constant Kb (before condition) and volumetric solids hold-up mh,b will start depleting in the system and a material with rate constant Ka (after condition) and volumetric solids hold-up mh,a starts building up till all the material with rate constant Kb is completely depleted. This will influence the change in the grade and recovery of the process. In order to verify the model, detailed plant campaigns were done under steady state on a lead zinc <b>ore</b> <b>plant,</b> components assays were analyzed for various streams (% Pb, % Zn and % Fe), mass balance performed. Regression relations were built from partial campaign data by relating local influential operating variables with their solid flow split, water flow split and Pb flow split. These relations were linked to flotation model to simulate the effect of operating variables on grade and recovery of the plant. The framework presented in this paper is equally applicable to phosphate mineral flotation...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} {{deals with}} {{an evaluation of}} atmospheric deposition monitoring in 2001 – 2009 which was realised {{in the vicinity of}} siderite mining and processing works. Besides of gaseous emissions the works also produced the solid compounds of iron oxides and other heavy metals. The iron <b>ore</b> <b>plant</b> worked up to August 2008. The atmospheric deposition (wet and dry) was determined by the modified bulk deposition methodology. The samples were collected from seventeen monitoring sites, which are located maximally up to 8 km from the main pollution source. Together with the deposition fluxes of heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Pb, Cu,Cr, Cd, As), the mineralogical composition, dispersion and size characteristics of solid particles were studied in selected samples. The volume content of respirable solid particles with the diameter under 5 µm was from 6. 7 to 13. 2 %. Nanoparticles with the average hydrodynamic diameter in the interval of 242 – 558 nm were found. High values of the deposition (median) of iron- 4111 mg. m- 2. year- 1, manganese- 236. 6 mg. m- 2. year- 1 and especially toxic arsenic- 8. 05 mg. m- 2. year- 1 were measured in the area of Nižná Slaná in the years 2001 – 2008 and compared with other areas. A correlation between emissions of solid pollutants in particular years and the deposition for these metals was observed. In 2009, after shutdown of the works, a decrease of values at the most contaminated sites of deposition by arsenic, manganese and iron about 90 % was recorded. Such a significant change was not recorded for other studied metals...|$|E

The {{focus of this}} case is the strategy {{of the most successful}} steel-maker in the United States as of 2008 / 2009. It has a difficulty level of five. Secondary issues include Porter’s Five-Forces Framework of industry analysis and the effects of the global economic slowdown {{in the last quarter of}} 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 on Nucor’s business. The case is designed to be taught in a single 75 -minute class and is expected to require two to three hours of outside preparation by students. In order to facilitate students ’ understanding of the economics of accounting figures, we have rearranged the balance sheet so that “earning assets ” equal “permanent funding sources. ” For real wealth to be created, the average return on earning assets must equal or exceed the weighted average cost of capital demanded by permanent funding sources.

40|$|In South Bohemia, {{near the}} Czech town of České Budějovice, in close {{vicinity}} of municipalities of Mydlovary, Nákří, Olešník, Zahájí and Dívčice, there are 286 ha of uranium tailings impoundments, {{along with the}} former uranium ore processing plant known as MAPE Mydlovary. Althought this company terminated its operation in 1991, significant tailings impoundments contaminants, such as dust, radon emissions and gamma radiation are being found here. Nevertheless, radon emissions still represent a risk to {{the population in the}} neighborhood and airborne radon poses a risk also to other areas. Therefore, residents in a wide neighbourhood have long been loaded with increased doses of radiation. The thesis deals with negative consequences of the former uranium ore processing plant MAPE Mydlovary on human health and also describes the process of clearing works in progress in the locality. In this thesis, the level of awareness of Mydlovary residents, their opinions and attitudes to the damaged area are also mentioned. The theoretical part of the thesis is focused first on a brief description and history of the former uranium <b>ore</b> <b>plant,</b> the consequences of the MAPE Mydlovary activities and associated risks (e. g. higher doses of radon), which put inhabitants of nearby villages under threat. The next section provides information on the residents´ attitudes to decontamination works performed at the site and associated problems. The practical part of this thesis is devoted to the research, the aim was to determine if and to what extent Mydlovary residents are aware of the potential damage to land, water, air, and a possible negative impact on their health. The research also provides information on the residents´ attitudes to decontamination works at the site and about the preferred usage of the damaged area after decontamination is completed. The research was conducted by addressing 73 residents of Mydlovary in the period from January to March 2010. The results prove a relatively high awareness of Mydlovary residents about negative effects of radioactive substances and hazardous contaminants on their health, and also point to a lack of the respondents´ awareness about decontamination works and outline the current worries of Mydlovary residents...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to improve energy {{efficiency}} of industrial crushing and grinding operations (comminution). Mathematical models of the comminution process {{are being used to}} study methods for optimizing the product size distribution, so that the amount of excessively fine material produced can be minimized. The goal is to save energy by reducing the amount of material that is ground below the target size, while simultaneously reducing the quantity of materials wasted as ''slimes'' that are too fine to be useful. This will be accomplished by: (1) modeling alternative circuit arrangements to determine methods for minimizing overgrinding, and (2) determining whether new technologies, such as high-pressure roll crushing, can be used to alter particle breakage behavior to minimize fines production. During this quarter, work was focused on three areas: (1) The mathematical relationship developed for predicting plant throughput was improved, based on ore work index and equipment parameters measured in the plant over an extended period. It was determined that the model would need to fit two distinct regimes of grinding circuit operation, depending on the work index of the feed ore. (2) Plans for a proposed change in the circuit configuration at an iron <b>ore</b> <b>plant</b> are being made, to test predictions based on the work done to date in the project. After determining the desired circuit change, which would require screening a portion of the grinding slurry, samples were sent to an industrial screen manufacturer for pilot plant scale testing. These tests indicated that the screening could be carried out economically, and plans are proceeding to conduct trials of the proposed circuit alteration. (2) The mathematical model used for hydrocyclone simulations was found to be unable to fully predict the ''fish-hook'' behavior that is seen in the plant samples. The model was therefore improved by including empirically-determined terms so that it would be able to account for the observed phenomenon. A more advanced model is currently under development that will take account of measured slurry viscosity, in order to more accurately model the behavior of hydrocyclones with concentrated slurries of very fine particles...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentration}} and mobility {{spatial distribution of}} heavy metals (lead, zinc, cadmium and chromium) including potential ecological risk have been evaluated for the polluted surface soil from mining activities in Upper Klity village, Thailand. Soil samples were collected from the residential and agricultural areas and the area of <b>ore</b> dressing <b>plant.</b> Heavy metals content presented higher in the <b>ore</b> dressing <b>plant</b> area than those found in residential and agricultural areas. Lead was the predominant polluted metal with two hot spots surrounding the <b>ore</b> dressing <b>plant</b> and open pit mine. Mobility distribution of these metals was followed closely with their concentration. Vertical soil profiles proved that mobility factors were only high at the top soil layer and became lower at deeper soil layers for all metals, and the quantities of lead, zinc, cadmium and chromium in both soil profiles can be ordered from large to small as: Reducible, Residual, Oxidizable, Acid extraction and Exchangeable fractions. These {{results indicated that the}} contamination was caused by anthropogenic mining activities. Potential Ecological Risk (PER) exhibited a low potential ecological risk with the averages of 3. 79 and 81. 3 in agricultural and <b>ore</b> dressing <b>plant</b> areas, respectively. However, most individual potential ecological risk values were small and classified as low for all heavy metals. This study recommends that heavy metals were unlikely to cause additional adverse health risk effects in residential and agricultural area.
