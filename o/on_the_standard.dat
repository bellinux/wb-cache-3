5|$|A {{group of}} seven {{companies}} began the development of USB in 1994: Compaq, DEC, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, NEC, and Nortel. The goal was to make it fundamentally easier to connect external devices to PCs by replacing the multitude of connectors {{at the back of}} PCs, addressing the usability issues of existing interfaces, and simplifying software configuration of all devices connected to USB, as well as permitting greater data rates for external devices. A team including Ajay Bhatt worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> at Intel; the first integrated circuits supporting USB were produced by Intel in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> {{arthropod}} {{model of a}} pair of nerve cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E

The Marquess of Queensberry was charged with libel against Oscar Wilde here in 1895. There was also a court house in the 18th and early 19th century.

In preparation to the show, the band sent a list of their songs to the featured performers {{and asked them to}} choose the song that better fit their own repertoire. The band performed twenty songs during the show, releasing only twelve <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> edition of the album, and thirteen on the deluxe version.|$|E
5|$|Mayfair is {{the most}} {{expensive}} property <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> British Monopoly board at £400, and is part of the dark blue set with Park Lane. It commands the highest rents out of all properties; landing on Mayfair with a hotel costs £2,000. The price is a reference to the property values in the area, which have remained consistently high, with real-life rent as much as £36,000 per week. At the time the board was being designed in the 1930s, Mayfair still had a significant upper-class residential population.|$|E

Oil tankers have been involved in a number of damaging and high-profile oil spills. As a result, they are subject to stringent design and operational regulations.|$|E

Further, the AUA, AUC, and AUU codons are all allowable start codons.|$|E
5|$|During the eight-month period, Beyoncé {{recorded}} over seventy {{songs and}} decided during the editing process {{that she did}} not want to reconcile the two approaches into one disc. If a song was meaningless to her, she cut them off during the process of elimination for the final track listing. After a process of elimination, twelve tracks were selected to be placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> edition of the album, while five additional tracks were chosen to make the final cut for the deluxe edition of the album. Beyoncé later revealed that songs from established producers like The Neptunes and Danja were not able to make the final cut.|$|E

5|$|On December 4, 2008, Illinois State Representative Robert S.

Burke hired the newly retired Molaro for $12,000 for one month to write a 19-page white paper about Chicago's perennially under-funded pensions. When Molaro officially retired on January 1, 2009, his pensionable salary was annualized as $144,000, nearly doubling his pension. On August 16, 2012 Illinois Governor Pat Quinn signed a bill which limited the state's liability when former state legislators bolster their state pensions with short-term jobs with cities, counties and other local governments.|$|E
5|$|Several of the General Motors Theatre plays, {{including}} Hailey's Flight into Danger, {{were purchased}} for screening by the BBC in the United Kingdom. The productions impressed Howard Thomas, {{who was the}} managing director of Associated British Corporation (ABC), the franchise holder for the rival ITV network in the English Midlands and the North at weekends. Thomas offered Newman a job with ABC as a producer of his own Saturday night thriller series, which Newman accepted, moving to Britain in 1958. In 1975 the Head of Drama at the CBC, John Hirsch, noted that the tendency of so many writers and directors having followed Newman to the UK in the 1950s and never having returned to work in Canada had a detrimental impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> of subsequent Canadian television drama.|$|E

No. 46245 was the first, in December 1957; a further fifteen examples followed between May and November 1958. The style of lining varied: the first six repaints into maroon (including No. 46245) were lined out in the LMS style; the last ten received the BR style of lining as used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> green livery; No. 46247, originally lined in the LMS style, was given the BR style in July 1959; and by November 1961 those with the BR lining were repainted to match No. 46245.|$|E

5|$|Vettel {{became the}} {{youngest}} driver {{in the history of}} Formula One to take pole position, with a time of 1:37.555 in very wet conditions. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Kovalainen. Mark Webber qualified third after his final lap pushed Sébastien Bourdais into fourthposition. Massa took sixthposition behind Rosberg. Trulli, Fernando Alonso, Glock and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten. Kubica qualified 11th, blaming late rain in the second qualifying session for his position. Fisichella qualified 12th to give Force India its best grid position of the season. Both Räikkönen and Hamilton blamed a late entry into the second session for their poor qualifying times, which saw them eliminated in 14th and 15th positions, respectively. Hamilton originally ran <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> wet-weather tyres, {{and by the time he}} had changed to extreme wet-weather tyres the rain had intensified.
