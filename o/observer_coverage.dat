This paper reviews the most recent rates of seabird bycatch reported for industrial longline fisheries within the IATTC area. There are significant gaps in the available seabird bycatch data, notably from CPCs such as Japan, Ecuador and Peru. However, the levels of <b>observer</b> <b>coverage,</b> and hence bycatch information, in other CPCs remains largely inadequate when faced with the task of estimating incidental seabirds bycatch. Currently, <b>observer</b> <b>coverage</b> within IATTC industrial longline fisheries is very low (typically < 1 % of effort, with the exception of Hawaii pelagic longline fisheries). Combined with the non-random distribution of observer effort throughout the area, this leads to severe restrictions in the ability to make estimates of overall seabird bycatch. An improvement in the level and spread of <b>observer</b> <b>coverage</b> would greatly enhance the ability of IATTC to estimate seabird mortality in its fisheries, and to reduce effectively seabird bycatch. Models combining fishing effort data, available bycatch rates and seabird distributions have been used to determine overall seabird bycatch within ICCA...|$|E

To address the problem, we have developed an automatic test abstraction tool, called Abstra, to extract high level object-state-transition information from unittest executions, without requiring a priori specifications. Given a class and a set of its generated test inputs, our tool extracts object state machines (OSM) : a state in an OSM represents an object state of the class and a transition in an OSM represents method calls of the class.

40|$|Abstract only. The US Magnuson-Stevens Act authorizes {{the use of}} onboard {{observers}} to monitor commercial fisheries catch and bycatch (PFMC 2003). A question of concern in implementing an observer program {{is that of the}} appropriate level of <b>observer</b> <b>coverage.</b> Current practice varies by fishery; for example, the California-Oregon drift gillnet fishery for swordfish and thresher shark has employed an <b>observer</b> <b>coverage</b> level near 20 percent of effort since the programs inception in 1990, while the Hawaii shallow-set longline fishery currently requires a 100 percent coverage level to implement a sea turtle quota with shut-down provision which requires in-season fishing effort to end once either sixteen leatherback turtle or seventeen loggerhead turtle gear interactions have been observed. We propose an economic approach to examining the question of what percent <b>observer</b> <b>coverage</b> level is optimal. Following Segerson (2007), we assume that bycatch occurs as a stochastic process whose mean level is conditionally dependent on the nominal level of fishing effort. We further assume a regulatory constraint to limit protected species bycatch through a quota with a stochastic shut-down provision which ends in-season fishing effort once the quota is reached with a specified predictive probability. Assuming a fixed cost per observed set of fishing effort, we develop and illustrate an efficiency criterion for determining the best level of <b>observer</b> <b>coverage</b> to balance the costs of a higher coverage level against the benefit of increased certainty that a protected species interaction quota has not been exceeded.
