5|$|Article8 {{recognises}} {{the right}} of workers to form <b>or</b> <b>join</b> trade unions and protects the right to strike. It allows these rights to be restricted {{for members of the}} armed forces, police, or government administrators. Several parties have placed reservations on this clause, allowing it to be interpreted {{in a manner consistent with}} their constitutions (e.g.,China, Mexico), or extending the restriction of union rights to groups such as firefighters (e.g.,Japan).|$|E
5|$|France outlawed {{the most}} radical {{political}} party, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), on 13 July 1955.

5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. Johnson {{did not attempt to}} form <b>or</b> <b>join</b> one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began to take over the daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} {{have both}} migratory and sedentary populations. In the Ngorongoro most animals are sedentary and males maintain {{a network of}} territories throughout the year, even though breeding is seasonal in nature. Females and young form groups of about ten individuals <b>or</b> <b>join</b> together in larger aggregations, and non-territorial males form bachelor groups. In the Serengeti and Tarangire ecosystems, populations are mostly migratory, with herds consisting of both sexes frequently moving, but resident subpopulations also exist. During the rutting season, the males may form temporary territories {{for a few hours}} or a day or so, and attempt to gather together a few females with which to mate, but soon they have to move on, often moving ahead to set up another temporary territory.|$|E

5|$|In 1949 Sweden {{chose not}} to join NATO and {{declared}} a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war. A modified version now qualifies non-alignment in peace for possible neutrality in war. This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however {{there has been an}} active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the post–Cold War world. These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes <b>or</b> <b>join</b> NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force. Sweden have been active participants in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches forage along {{tree trunks}} and {{branches}} and {{are members of}} the same feeding guild as woodpeckers. Unlike woodpeckers and treecreepers, however, they do not use their tails for additional support, relying instead on their strong legs and feet to progress in jerky hops. They are able to descend head-first and hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches. Krüper's nuthatch can even stretch downward from an upside-down position to drink water from leaves without touching the ground. Rock nuthatches forage with a similar technique to the woodland species, but seek food on rock faces and sometimes buildings. When breeding, a pair of nuthatches will only feed within their territory, but at other times will associate with passing tits <b>or</b> <b>join</b> mixed-species feeding flocks.|$|E
5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would go for a walk <b>or</b> <b>join</b> in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British Homeopathy Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E

5|$|The free-for-all {{and team}} {{versions}} of Shootout mode both follow a traditional deathmatch scenario where players or teams must accumulate the most kills. Many capture the flag variants are also available. Hold Your Own {{is a traditional}} mode where each team has to defend their bag of gold from the enemy team whilst capturing the other. Grab The Bag has both teams attacking one bag placed in {{a section of the}} map. Gold Rush is a free-for-all variant, trying to grab and keep as many bags as possible. The multiplayer portion Red Dead Redemption also features open world gameplay. All players in the server can form <b>or</b> <b>join</b> a group of other players, known as a posse, of up to eight players and take part in activities such as hunting or attacking computer-controlled gang hideouts or another player's posse. In some game modes, players are unable to kill other players.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos quickly began {{regrouping}} {{his forces}} {{and sent the}} general Theodore Krateros to Ancyra. Krateros found the city completely deserted, and was ordered to reinforce the garrison of Amorium instead. Theophilos himself was soon forced to return to Constantinople, where rumours of his death at Anzen had led to plots to declare a new emperor. At the same time, the Khurramites, gathered around Sinope, revolted and declared their reluctant commander Theophobos emperor. Luckily for the Empire, Theophobos maintained a passive stance and {{made no move to}} confront Theophilos <b>or</b> <b>join</b> Mu'tasim. The caliph's vanguard under Ashinas reached Ancyra on 26 July. The inhabitants, who had sought refuge in some mines nearby, were discovered and taken captive after a brief struggle by an Arab detachment under Malik ibn Kaydar al-Safadi. The Byzantines, some of whom were soldiers who had fled from Anzen, informed the Arabs of Afshin's victory, after which Malik allowed all of them to go free. The other Arab forces arrived at Ancyra over the next days, and after plundering the deserted city, the united Arab army turned south towards Amorium.|$|E
