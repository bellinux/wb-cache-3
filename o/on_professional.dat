5|$|After {{graduating from}} Harvard and {{serving in the}} Army during World War I, Tunis began his writing career freelancing for American sports {{magazines}} while playing tennis in the Rivera. For {{the next two decades}} he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire. Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that the emphasis <b>on</b> <b>professional</b> sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E

Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work <b>on</b> <b>professional</b> income.

The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} empirical {{evidence on the}} impact of the introduction of a quasi-market in healthcare in the UK <b>on</b> <b>professionals,</b> especially doctors. Data are drawn from two longitudinal studies occurring between 1990 and 1994, of aspects of the changes to the health system. Data collection involved a range of methods, including observation, interviews, questionnaires and archival material. The findings show that a unilateral analysis {{of the impact of the}} quasimarket <b>on</b> <b>professionals</b> is inadequate to understand the situation. The responses of the professionals to change have had a major influence <b>on</b> the outcomes. <b>Professionals</b> have not uniformly lost power, some have gained considerably. Explanations of the variance of impact and the substantial power shifts have to take account of a range of contextual factors. The market has not had a major impact on the technical autonomy of the doctors. Consequential structural changes have produced a new category of professional managers who are actively managing their colleagues' performance...|$|R

The matches take place in ten {{different}} detailed 3D locations from Springfield, such as the Simpsons' house, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, the Kwik-E-Mart, and Moe's Tavern. Letters float around in the wrestling ring, and if a wrestler collects enough of them, they can taunt and temporarily become invincible.
