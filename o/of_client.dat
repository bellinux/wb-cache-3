Demand for crisis accommodation remains high and a fifth <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> have an unmet need Sixty per cent <b>of</b> all <b>clients</b> needed accommodation in 2011 ‒ 12, with 40 % needing short-term or emergency accommodation.

Homeless males more likely to be sleeping without shelter compared to females Males who were homeless when they began receiving support were twice as likely to be sleeping without shelter (19 %) compared to homeless females (9 %). Females made up a greater proportion <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> at risk and in remote areas Roughly equal numbers of males and females were homeless when they began receiving support, but females represented 68 % of those at risk.

40|$|From data {{provided}} by a national census of treatment for alcohol problems in 1996, this paper reports findings on differences between types of treatment agencies in England and Wales. The overall response rate was 44 % but {{no significant differences were}} found between responding and non-responding agencies in size and composition of staff. The highest mean number <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> per day was seen in NHS trust services and charitable organizations. Private (for profit) agencies showed both the highest mean age <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> and the highest proportion of men among agency types, while NHS trusts saw the highest proportion of women. Charities and voluntary organizations reported higher than average proportions <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> living in insecure accommodation. Private (for profit) agencies showed both the lowest proportion <b>of</b> unemployed <b>clients</b> and the highest proportion of those on sickness or invalidity benefits. Seventy-three per cent <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> attending NHS trust services were seen by nurses, medical or non-medical professionals; only 8 % <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> attending private (for profit) agencies were seen by these professional groups. Worries about physical health were far more common among clients attending private (for profit) agencies and legal/financial problems occurred much more often among those attending voluntary/statutory partnerships. The highest proportion <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> in residential treatment was shown in private (for profit) agencies and the lowest in voluntary/statutory partnerships and NHS trusts. Nearly all (90 %) treatment carried out by voluntary/statutory partnerships was in the form of 'counselling', while approximately half the clients seen by charities and independent (non-profit) organizations were in day or residential treatment. While in the overall sample, the mean percentage <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> also attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was 9 %, this rose to 23 % <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> attending independent (non-profit) agencies. The highest proportions <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> with reported illicit drug use was in voluntary/statutory partnerships and the lowest in independent (non-profit) agencies.

40|$|Background: In {{this paper}} I want to {{investigate}} if text messages reminders {{have an effect}} on attendance in a psychiatric district centre in Oslo, Norway.

Method: The analyses are based on the data I collected during my internship and supplemented by other research done in this field. Three statistical tests are performed to see if my observations at Lovisenberg District Psychiatric Centre can support my thoughts of text message reminder effects on attendance and the differences in the group <b>of</b> <b>clients.</b> Results: My observations gave good support to my hypothesis about the text message reminder effects on attendance, even though they were not statistically significant.

25|$|Camel caravans, said to {{have first}} been used by Muhammad's great-grandfather, were {{a major part of}} Mecca's bustling economy. Alliances were struck between the merchants in Mecca and the local nomadic tribes, who would bring goods – leather, livestock, and metals mined in the local {{mountains}} – to Mecca to be loaded on the caravans and carried to cities in Syria and Iraq. Historical accounts also provide some indication that goods from other continents may also have flowed through Mecca. Goods from Africa and the Far East passed through en route to Syria including spices, leather, medicine, cloth, and slaves; in return Mecca received money, weapons, cereals and wine, which in turn were distributed throughout Arabia. The Meccans signed treaties with both the Byzantines and the Bedouins, and negotiated safe passages for caravans, giving them water and pasture rights. Mecca became the center of a loose confederation <b>of</b> <b>client</b> tribes, which included those of the Banu Tamim.

Countries did not differ in the numbers <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> seen per day or the gender balance <b>of</b> <b>clients.</b> Mean age <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> was highest in Scotland (44 years) and lowest in Northern Ireland (39 years). A higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> seen in Northern Ireland were friends or relatives of problem drinkers seeking help than in the other countries. English agencies reported much larger proportions <b>of</b> 'Irish' <b>clients</b> than those in Scotland. Northern Irish agencies showed the highest proportion <b>of</b> married <b>clients</b> and also the lowest proportion of those divorced, separated or widowed, the highest proportion of whom was found in Scotland.

Northern Irish agencies had the highest proportion <b>of</b> <b>clients</b> in employment and the lowest proportion on sickness or invalidity benefits.
