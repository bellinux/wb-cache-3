5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number <b>of</b> <b>offshore</b> islands of {{mainland}} Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), {{all of which are}} now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to a small island situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E

40|$|The rise <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> {{intermediate}} inputs raises important questions for commercial policy.

Does offshoring create new problems of global policy cooperation whose solutions require international agreements with novel features? In this paper we provide {{answers to these}} questions, and thereby initiate the study of trade agreements in the presence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring.</b> Our findings indicate that the rise <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> is likely to complicate the task of trade agreements for two reasons: first, the mechanism by which countries can shift the costs of intervention on to their trading partners is more complicated in the presence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> and extends to a wider set of policies than is the case when offshoring is not present, and this implies that the agreements themselves must extend to a wider set of policies as well; and second, the underlying problem that a trade agreement must address in the presence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> varies with the political preferences of member governments. As a consequence, the growing prevalence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> is likely to make it increasingly difficult for governments to rely on traditional GATT/WTO concepts and rules – such as market access, reciprocity and non-discrimination – to help them solve their trade-related problems...|$|R

The model is fitted to Swedish firm-level data between 2001 - 2011. We find positive effects <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> intensity on total factor productivity, particularly of small domestic firms and large foreign-owned firms, and on skill-biased technological change in production of firms with low offshoring intensity. Initiating offshoring results in skill-biased technological change in non-production activities of large domestic firms.

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} {{the idea that}} <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} and technical work {{should be regarded as}} a dynamic process that evolves over time. Firms gradually move from <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> simple, standardized activities towards <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> advanced activities when they accumulate experience with offshoring, and this type <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> comes with an entirely different set of characteristics compared to traditional, cost-seeking offshoring. Based on a unique survey among the total population of firms in the eastern region of Denmark, we analyze some of the dynamics of this process through a model that incorporates two different aspects of the process <b>of</b> <b>offshoring.</b> First, we approach the question <b>of</b> whether to <b>offshore</b> and establish a baseline that investigates the determinants of firms’ participation—or lack thereof—in offshoring. Secondly, we approach the question <b>of</b> what to <b>offshore</b> and the subsequent process <b>of</b> <b>offshoring,</b> as we analyze the determinants <b>of</b> the <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> advanced, highend technical, and service activities. The findings are consistent with the notion <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> as a dynamic process as they show how some (cost-related) determinants play a role when firms first engage in offshoring, while rather different determinants matter for the subsequent process <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> advanced activities. Although the model portrays a simplified expression <b>of</b> the <b>offshoring</b> process with two stages, the findings underpin our view that a process perspective on offshoring is a useful analytical framework.

Conclusions and implications. Organisations have vigorously pursued opportunities for profitability and growth through offshoring. Yet, research evidence on the performance benefits <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> activities has been contradictory. Moreover, the contradiction in outcomes {{can be traced to}} the complex nature <b>of</b> the <b>offshoring</b> process and the many aspects that may influence the relationship between offshoring and performance. This research develops and tests a comprehensive framework to explain the relationship between offshoring and performance improvement. Specifically, it addresses how the nature of tasks, antecedents <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> (i. e. characteristics <b>of</b> organisations which <b>offshore),</b> offshoring strategy (i. e. what drives organisations to offshore), offshoring governance modes (i. e. how to govern the offshoring process) and organisational absorptive capacity (i. e. how organisations’ can capitalise on new knowledge) affect the outcomes <b>of</b> <b>offshoring.</b> Using partial least squared structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) analysis, the empirical findings of 77 Australian small-to-medium organisations (SMOs) confirm that: (1) Implementing offshoring as a viable efficiency-enhancing and/or growth strategy has a significant direct positive effect on performance improvement; (2) However, the implementation <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> as a cost-reduction strategy has a negative effect on the {{relationship between the}} degree <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> high-value added tasks and long- term performance improvement; (3) Using a captive governance mode is more effective in offshoring high value-added tasks, while third party offshoring is more effective in offshoring standardized tasks; (4) An organisation’s absorptive capacity or the same organisation’s ability to capitalise on knowledge gained has a positive influence on the relationship between the degree <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> in high-value-added tasks and performance improvement. These results suggest that managers and policy makers need to rethink the level <b>of</b> their <b>offshoring</b> engagement, strategic choices, knowledge absorptive capacity and governance modes in order to successfully implement <b>offshoring.</b> Mode <b>of</b> access: World wide web 1 online resource (330 leaves) diagrams, table...|$|R
40|$|The rise <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> {{intermediate}} inputs raises important questions for commercial policy. Do the distinguishing features <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> introduce novel reasons for trade policy intervention? Does offshoring create new problems of global policy cooperation whose solutions require international agreements with novel features? Can trade agreements {{that are designed}} to address problems that arise when trade predominantly takes the form of the exchange of final goods be expected to perform in a world where offshoring is prevalent? In this paper we provide answers to these questions, and thereby initiate the study of trade agreements in the presence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring.</b> We do so by deriving the Nash and internationally efficient trade policy choices of governments in an environment in which some trade flows involve the exchange of customized inputs, contracts governing these transactions are incomplete, and the matching between final-good producers and input suppliers may involve search frictions. By characterizing the differences between Nash and internationally efficient policies in this environment, and by comparing these differences to those that would arise in the absence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> customized inputs, we seek to understand the implications <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> for the role of trade agreements. Our findings indicate that the rise <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> is likely to complicate the task of trade agreements, because in the presence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring,</b> (i) the mechanism by which countries can shift the costs of intervention on to their trading partners is more complicated and extends to a wider set of policies than is the case when offshoring is not present, and (ii) because the underlying problem that a trade agreement must address in the presence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> varies with the political preferences of member governments. As a consequence, the increasing prevalence <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> is likely to make it increasingly difficult for governments to rely on simple and general rules - such as reciprocity and non-discrimination - to help them solve their trade-related problems. incomplete contracts; inefficiency; matching; offshoring; trade agreements...|$|R

Martin proposed an eight-year deal that the province would keep 100 percent <b>of</b> <b>offshore</b> oil revenues, but with an expenditure a cap to keep the province from surpassing the per capita tax revenue of Ontario. Williams, supported by the other provincial leaders, walked out of talks with Martin, saying that cap would cost the provincial government billions of dollars in lost revenue over the life of its three oil fields. Williams along with Nova Scotia Premier John Hamm, who also wanted the same deal as Newfoundland and Labrador, met with the Prime Minister on several occasions but a deal between Ottawa and the two provinces could not be reached. Williams raised the temperature on December 23, 2004, when he ordered the removal of all Canadian flags from provincial government buildings. On January 10, 2005, Canadian flags started flying once again in the province, and several weeks later Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia reached a deal with Ottawa.

5|$|Because Allied {{air superiority}} meant {{it would be}} {{difficult}} for the Germans to move up their reserves, Rommel believed that their best chance was to stop the invasion at the shore. The scope of the invasion meant that once these coastal defences were defeated and the troops scattered, it was difficult to defend territory inland or launch counter-attacks. At 22:33, Kraiss ordered the 352nd Division to create a defensive line north of Bayeux but this proved impossible, as most of the territory involved was already in British hands and all the defending units had taken serious losses. The Luftwaffe played only a minor role on D-Day. At Gold, several small groups of bombers that arrived at sunset caused Allied casualties at Le Hamel and damaged a road near Ver-sur-Mer.

5|$|Throughout Linfa's {{passage of}} Japan, the storm brought heavy {{rainfall}} {{across a wide}} swath of the country, resulting in extensive and damaging flooding. Damage was primarily concentrated on Kyushu Island. Precipitation peaked at 727mm (28.62in) at a station in Nakagoya, Miyazaki Prefecture. However, a station in Owase, Mie observed 497mm (19.56in) of rain in 24hours, greater than any other location for that period of time. Despite making landfall on Ehime Prefecture, Linfa did not cause as much damage there relative to other provinces, particularly those bordering Ehime. Nonetheless, nearly 300homes lost power during the storm there. Linfa's worst impacts occurred in Kōchi Prefecture, where severe flooding inundated several buildings and triggered numerous landslides. Damage there totaled ¥1.28billion (US$10.7million). Similar effects took place in Tokushima Prefecture, in addition to widespread evacuations from impacted areas. Damage accrued by Linfa in Tokushima Prefecture reached ¥1.22billion (US$10.3million). Located near the coast, high seas generated by Linfa were reported in Wakayama Prefecture, resulting in cancellations <b>of</b> <b>offshore</b> activities and transportation. However, much of the damage in Wakayama Prefecture was caused by torrential precipitation, damaging roads in seven locations, amounting to ¥197.45million (US$1.65million). Severe flooding in Mie Prefecture resulted from heavy, prolonged rainfall, which peaked prefecture-wide at 497mm (19.57in) in Owase. Precipitation in Mie caused widespread power outages. As many as 65buildings were flooded, and approximately 87ha (215ac) of arable land was inundated by rainwater. In addition to surface inundation, the rains caused twenty landslides, blocking roads the traffic and suspending some rail operations. Power outages were also widespread in Hyōgo Prefecture, including a localized outage stripping electricity from 900homes in the Kita-ku ward in Kobe; similar impacts occurred in Osaka Prefecture. Rising floodwater in Kanagawa Prefecture engulfed the first floors of several office buildings and residences. The rain also deluged roads in Yokohama, Fujisawa, Chigasaki and Odawara.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to examine how nations address the {{problems}} and opportunities <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> through policy. For each of the nations studied in this chapter, we consider such topics as the policy issues <b>of</b> <b>offshoring,</b> how they fit into other national policies and political issues, the principal political players, and positions they take. We do not recommend policies that an individual nation should hold.

As from 2012 the coastline of Wales has 43 Blue Flag beaches and five Blue Flag marinas. Despite its heritage and award winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with the Irish and Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies/south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. On the night of 25 October 1859, over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales when a hurricane blew in from the Atlantic. More than 800 lives were lost across Britain because of the storm, but the greatest tragedy was the sinking of the Royal Charter off the coast of Anglesey in which 459 people died. The number of shipwrecks around the coast of Wales reached a peak in the 19th century with over 100 vessels lost and an average loss of life of about 78 sailors per year.

40|$|Offshoring can {{be defined}} as the {{relocation}} of organizational tasks and services to foreign locations. Increasingly, firms experience that unforeseen costs and difficulties <b>of</b> managing <b>offshoring</b> undercut anticipated benefits; that unexpected challenges <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> jeopardize and eventually undermine initial objectives. Guided by the research question—what are the organizational consequences of offshoring?—the purpose of this thesis is to investigate why some firms fail when offshoring and other do not. The thesis consists of four research papers using various datasets and methodologies that investigate offshoring in an organizational context. The first paper investigates how the complexity <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> leads to ‘hidden costs’ <b>of</b> implementing <b>offshoring</b> activities. The second paper looks at how these hidden reconfiguration costs influence the process performance <b>of</b> the <b>offshored</b> activity and how this relationship is moderated by the modularity of that activity. The third paper investigates the effect of the organizational reconfiguration <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> on firms’ strategies. The final paper studies different strategies <b>of</b> adaptation in <b>offshoring.</b> Taken together, this thesis argues that whether firms relocate activities with the purpose of accessing resources or as a response to political pressures, the process <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> presents firms with the challenge of coordinating and integrating offshoring activities in a global organization. The complexities and uncertainties of an organization consisting of a number <b>of</b> <b>offshored</b> activities (in contrast to an organization with only co-located activities) require firms to invest additional resources in coordination mechanisms so that an efficient reintegration can be achieved...|$|R

Based on 876 offshoring projects from 226 companies obtained by means of surveys conducted in the USA and Europe, we examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> strategy on factors influencing firms' views <b>of</b> <b>offshoring,</b> and the effect <b>of</b> <b>offshoring</b> strategy on offshoring performance. Separate analyses were conducted for US and European companies in order to explore any regional heterogeneity in offshoring. A comparative analysis between companies with and without an offshoring strategy reveals that when making offshoring decisions, the former consider {{a broader range of}} factors (drivers, risks and locations) as important compared to companies without an offshoring strategy, suggesting association between offshoring strategy and managerial attention. The results also indicate that the adoption <b>of</b> a corporate <b>offshoring</b> strategy has a significant positive effect on cost savings achieved from offshore implementations, and that innovation activities have a significant negative impact on cost savings, but only for European companies. <b>Offshoring,</b> <b>offshoring</b> <b>of</b> business services, <b>offshoring</b> strategy, offshoring performance, attention-based view,...|$|R
