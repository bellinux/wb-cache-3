5000|$|Wink Start - {{when the}} {{originator}} goes off hook, {{the other end}} transmits a short (140-290ms) <b>off-hook</b> <b>signal</b> and returns to on-hook. The originator detects the wink and then sends the dialed digits. The other end goes permanently off-hook (seized) when the call is answered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{key to the}} {{new system}} was {{two-stage}} multi-frequency pulsing. The outgoing sender sent its Class 4 toll center an <b>off-hook</b> <b>signal</b> as usual, received a wink as usual as a [...] "proceed to send" [...] signal, and outpulsed only a special 3-digit (later 6-digit) access code. The toll center picked a trunk through the long distance network to the gateway office, which sent a second wink to the originating office, which then sent the whole dialed number. Thus the toll switching system needed no modification except at the gateway. The international trunks used Signaling System No. 5, a [...] "North Atlantic" [...] version of the North American multi-frequency signaling system, with minor modifications including slightly higher digit rate. European MF systems of the time used compelled signalling, which would slow down too much on a long transoceanic connection.|$|E
5000|$|On a trunk, on-hook and <b>off-hook</b> <b>signals</b> {{must pass}} in both directions. In a one-way trunk, the {{originating}} or A board sends a short for off-hook, {{and an open}} for on-hook, while the terminating or B board sends normal polarity or reverse polarity. This [...] "reverse battery" [...] signaling was carried over to later automatic exchanges.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977, Douglas G. Talley and L Duane Gregory {{were granted}} [...] for a duplex voice {{communication}} link including controls therefore as provided between a base station connected {{directly to a}} telephone line of a telephone exchange and a mobile unit consisting of a small, compact cordless telephone instrument containing transmitter, receiver and control circuits powered by a rechargeable battery pack. A single logic tone is transmitted and detected for all logical control for ring <b>signals,</b> on-hook and <b>off-hook</b> <b>signals</b> and dial pulses.|$|R
50|$|Line {{signaling}} is a {{class of}} telecommunications signaling protocols. Line signaling is responsible for <b>off-hook,</b> ringing <b>signal,</b> answer, ground start, on-hook unidirectional supervision messaging in each direction from calling party to called party and vice versa. After an <b>off-hook,</b> line <b>signaling</b> initiates register signaling to accomplish the exchange of telephone numbers of called party and in more modern line-signaling protocols, the calling party as well. While register signaling occurs, line signaling remains quiescent unless the calling party goes on-hook or an abnormal cessation of the call occurs, such as due to equipment malfunction or shutdown or due to network outage upstream in that call-attempt's series of spanned trunks.|$|R
