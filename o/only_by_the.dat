These qualities were in-line with the nascent government's need to use literature, as the most developed of the new national culture, for nation-building; in 1969, Atheis received a literary award from the government of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|An {{argument}} has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox.
