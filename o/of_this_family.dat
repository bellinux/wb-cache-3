5|$|The members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>family</b> {{are small}} {{passerine}} birds {{native to the}} Old World tropics.

5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a huge range in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>family</b> were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation.

5|$|In 1917, the Japanese {{astronomer}} Kiyotsugu Hirayama {{began to}} study asteroid motions. By plotting the mean orbital motion, inclination and eccentricity {{of a set of}} asteroids, he discovered several distinct groupings. In a later paper he reported a group of three asteroids associated with Pallas, which became named the Pallas family, after the largest member of the group. Since 1994 more than 10 members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>family</b> have been identified, and these have semi-major axes between 2.50–2.82AU and inclinations of 33–38°. The validity of this grouping was confirmed in 2002 by a comparison of their spectra.|$|E
