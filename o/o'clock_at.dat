A Japanese Christian captain led the charge, rallying his fellow coreligionists with the reasoning that if the carrack was not destroyed or captured, Ieyasu would turn his wrath onto the Christian community and the churches would be destroyed. A few Japanese succeeded in boarding the ship but were promptly cut down (Pessoa himself apparently killed two) or were forced to jump into the water.|$|E

25|$|The chase lasted all day, until 11 <b>o'clock</b> <b>at</b> {{night when}} Pique {{was able to}} range {{alongside}} Seine and fire a broadside. The two exchanged fire for several hours, with the lighter Pique suffering considerable damage to her masts and rigging. Jason then ranged up and Captain Stirling called upon Milne to anchor, but Milne did not hear and was determined to see Seine captured, and pressed on. Before the battle could be resumed Pique ran suddenly aground. Jason too ran aground before she could swing way, while Seine was observed to have grounded, and lost all her masts in the process. As the tide rose Seine was able to swing into a position to rake the two British ships. With difficulty the sailors of Jason dragged several guns to the bow in order to exchange fire, while Pique {{was able to bring}} her foremost guns to bear. Under fire from both British ships, the appearance on the scene of Mermaid convinced the French to surrender. Jason had lost seven killed and 12 wounded, while Pique sustained casualties of two killed and six wounded. Seine however had 170 killed and 100 wounded.|$|E

Jamal reproaches Salim, who then pleads for forgiveness, and offers {{him to stay}} in his luxurious apartment. Jamal later bluffs his way into Javed's residence to reunite with Latika but as he professes his love for her, Latika asks him to forget about her. Jamal nevertheless promises to wait for her every day at five <b>o'clock</b> <b>at</b> the VT station.

500|$|From {{this point}} on, combat {{centered}} on the village of Unterhausen, [...] west-south-west of Neuburg center. A few French platoons drove the Austrians from the forest located between the village and the Danube with a bayonet charge by the grenadiers of the 109th. As French reserves arrived, the Austrians counterattacked and retook the woods, the heights at Oberhausen, and the village. [...] According to Lecourbe's account, the Austrians, [...] "embolden by this first success, soon covered all the surrounding heights, on which they planted about twenty-five or thirty pieces of cannon." [...] At eight <b>o'clock</b> <b>at</b> night, after twelve hours of battle, companies of the 14th and 46th Regiments (French) moved along a small road {{on the right of}} the village, and another group proceeded on the left, enveloping the village. [...] The subsequent simultaneous French attack at both flanks and the center convinced the Austrians that, despite the defensive barrages laid by their artillery in Oberhausen, the French had been massively reinforced. The attack on the village, executed without firing a shot, involved fierce hand-to-hand fighting in which the commander of the 46th Regiment and the First Grenadier of France, Latour D'Auvergne, were both killed.|$|E

Milton travelled each day between school and home, and his path took him by St Paul's. It is possible that he listened to the sermons put on during this time by John Donne.
