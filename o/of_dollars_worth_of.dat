5|$|Support for {{bimetallism}} {{grew in the}} 1870s, {{and resulted}} in {{the passage of the}} Bland–Allison Act of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This legislation required the Treasury to purchase millions <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>worth</b> <b>of</b> silver bullion each month, and coin it into silver dollars—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring the Treasury to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from the Treasury, and amid another depression President Grover Cleveland secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.|$|E

5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a reloadable card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>worth</b> <b>of</b> Easy Cards by credit card without entering a PIN or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a discounted rate for cash.

50|$|Following Richard Pratt’s {{death in}} April, 2009, Anthony Pratt {{returned}} to Australia {{to assume the}} added responsibility of Global Executive Chairman of Visy Industries. This was in addition to him continuing in his long-time position as Chairman of Pratt Industries USA. Just two years after he assumed leadership of the company, Visy jumped from 43rd to 3rd in the AMR Corporate Citizenship Index, part of an annual {{survey of more than}} 60,000 Australians. Under Anthony Pratt’s leadership the company has also expanded its Asian presence and participation. Earnings from its Asian operations have increased by $100 million a year. This was achieved in several ways. Firstly, Visy established Build Run Repair, an engineering services company headquartered in Singapore to design and build sustainable pulp and paper mills and clean energy plants, leveraging the company’s experience gained from building its own 15 paper mills and 4 clean energy plants. Its internal team of more than 40 engineers is also charged with maintaining Visy’s worldwide portfolio of factories as well as source equipment and products from China, Vietnam, Malaysia other Asian countries. In addition, the Singapore operation houses a trading company. Its mission is to buy hundreds <b>of</b> millions <b>of</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>worth</b> <b>of</b> goods and services for both Visy and external customers.

30|$|A key {{difference}} between this study and the macroeconomic studies of remittances and financial development is that aggregate measures of financial development and remittances do not account for differences between households and/or between local communities. First, other sources of household income matter. If households are primarily dependent on remittance income, then a majority of this income would be dedicated toward satisfying basic consumption needs. However, households with other sources of income {{may be able to}} set aside remittance income for other purposes such as saving or investment. Hence households with more working household members should be less reliant on remittance income for satisfying basic consumption needs. Conditional on the number of workers, however, larger households need to devote more remittance income to consumption. Thus, larger households or households with children {{would be less likely to}} use remittances for investment or savings purposes, other things equal. Second, the size of the remittances matter. Since a dollar saved or invested comes at the expense <b>of</b> a <b>dollar’s</b> <b>worth</b> <b>of</b> consumption, households receiving larger remittances should be more likely to invest and/or save as the marginal utility of consumption <b>of</b> a remitted <b>dollar</b> declines. By focusing on the household level, I can control for such variables, thus allowing me to examine the influence of the development of the financial sector on households’ use of remittance income.|$|R
