40|$|This study investigates an {{application}} of active machine learning to a protein dataset developed to identify the source of mutations which give rise to mitochondrial disease. The dataset is labeled according to the protein 2 ̆ 7 s location of origin in the cell; whether in the mitochondria or not, or a specific target location in the mitochondria 2 ̆ 7 s outer or inner membrane, its matrix, or its ribosomes. This dataset forms a labeling hierarchy. A new machine learning approach is investigated to learn the high-level classifier, i. e., whether the protein is a mitochondrion, by separately learning finer-grained target compartment concepts and combining the results. This approach is termed active <b>over-labeling.</b> In experiments on the protein dataset it is shown that active <b>over-labeling</b> improves area under the precision-recall curve compared to standard passive or active learning. Because finer-grained labels are more costly to obtain, alternative strategies exploring using fixed proportions of a given budget to buy fine vs. coarse labels at various costs are compared and presented. Finally, we present a cost-sensitive active learner that uses a multi-armed bandit approach to dynamically choose the label granularity to purchase, and show that the bandit-based learner is robust to variations in both labeling cost and budget...|$|E
40|$|Many {{classification}} tasks target high-level {{concepts that}} can be decomposed into a hierarchy of finer-grained subconcepts. For example, some string entities that are Locations are also Attractions, some Attractions are Museums, etc. Such hierarchies are common in named entity recognition (NER), document classification, and biological sequence analysis. We present a new approach for learning hierarchically decomposable concepts. The approach learns a high-level classifier (e. g., location vs. non-location) by seperately learning multiple finer-grained classifiers (e. g., museum vs. non-museum), and then combining the results. Soliciting labels at a finer level of granularity {{than that of the}} target concept is a new approach to active learning, which we term active <b>over-labeling.</b> In experiments in NER and document classification tasks, we show that active overlabeling substantially improves area under the precision-recall curve when compared with standard passive or active learning. Finally, because finer-grained labels may be more expensive to obtain, we also present a cost-sensitive active learner that uses a multi-armed bandit approach to dynamically choose the label granularity to target, and show that the bandit-based learner is robust to differences in label cost and labeling budget...|$|E
40|$|USP Reference Standard {{units with}} old or new label formats, {{as well as}} with old or new logos. Select units will have new wrap labels placed over the {{original}} vial labels. These items will include a statement on the label indicating that they are intentionally <b>over-labeled</b> for GHS compliance. USP Reference Standards that have been <b>over-labeled</b> for GHS compliance are suitable for use in their USP compendial applications. If you receive a product with any of the new or existing labeling or packaging examples pictured here, rest assured that you have received an official USP Reference Standard...|$|R
5000|$|British {{police are}} {{hesitant}} to categorize Yardie gangs as organized crime, since {{there appears to be}} no real structure or central leadership; gang affiliations can be described as loose at best. Neither have Yardies made any attempts at setting up fronts for their illegal activities, nor any serious attempts to corrupt and infiltrate law enforcement organisations. Academics have noted a tendency to <b>over-label</b> black British crime as [...] "Yardie"-related due to stereotype and social narrative.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{immunoassay}} {{is described}} that applies a thiol-reactive ruthenium metal–ligand complex as the donor dye in a luminescence energy transfer (LET) detection scheme. Unlike amine-reactive labels, the LET with a thiol label allows improved specificity and better reproducibility of labelling positions on proteins, {{because the number}} of reactive thiol groups of proteins is distinctly smaller. This helps {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>over-labelling</b> and self-quenching of the fluorophore. The synthesis of the thiol label was significantly improved, resulting in almost quantitative yields of pure product. The absorption and emission maxima of the ruthenium donor dye are at 460 nm and 600 nm, respectively, and a Stokes' shift of 140 nm warrants distinct separation of excitation and emission wavelengths even in turbid samples. A cyanine dye with an absorption maximum at 642 nm was chosen as the acceptor label because it has good overlap with the emission spectrum of the donor label. The emission of the acceptor peaks at 660 nm, thus further increasing the Stokes' shift (to an overall 200 nm). The quantification of anti-HSA with the LET immunoassay is possible with this new approach at concentrations as low as 220 pmol[*]L− 1...|$|R
