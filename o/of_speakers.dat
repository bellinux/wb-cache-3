5|$|A Leslie speaker {{consists}} {{of a number of}} individual components. The audio signal enters the amplifier from the instrument. Once amplified, the signal travels to an audio crossover, which splits it into separate frequency bands that can be individually routed to each loudspeaker. Different models have different combinations <b>of</b> <b>speakers,</b> but the most common model, the 122, {{consists of}} a single woofer for bass and a single compression driver and acoustic horn for treble. The audio emitted by the speakers is isolated inside an enclosure, aside from a number of outlets that lead towards either a rotating horn or drum. An electric motor rotates both horn and drum at a constant speed.|$|E

5|$|According to a rough estimation, as of 2010 {{there were}} up to 300,000 Swedish-speakers living outside Sweden and Finland. The largest populations were in the United States (up to 100,000), the UK, Spain and Germany (c. 30,000 each) and a large {{proportion}} of the remaining 100,000 in the Scandinavian countries, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia. A considerable majority of Swedish residents born outside Sweden (c. 1.5 million) speak Swedish and according to the ELDIA Project, there were c. 2,390,000 second-language speakers in Finland. According to a survey by the European Commission, 44% of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough in Swedish to hold a conversation, for a total of about 5 million second-language speakers. The total number of native speakers could be up to 8.6 million with an additional 4–5 million second language speakers in Sweden and Finland. Due to the close relation between the Scandinavian languages, a considerable proportion <b>of</b> <b>speakers</b> of Danish and especially Norwegian are highly fluent in Swedish for a total number <b>of</b> <b>speakers</b> that could be as high as 15 million.|$|E
5|$|Few {{vocabulary}} {{items are}} considered unique to Ottawa. The influx <b>of</b> <b>speakers</b> of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that vocabulary spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular vocabulary item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the vocabulary items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E

A comparative analysis was conducted for the following comparisons: (a) compare the TAKS reading scores <b>of</b> native <b>speaker</b> <b>of</b> Spanish in a Two Way Dual Language program to native <b>speaker</b> <b>of</b> Spanish in a Bilingual Transitional program (b) compare the English TAKS reading scores <b>of</b> native <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> Spanish (NSOS) in a Two Way Dual Language program to native <b>speakers</b> <b>of</b> English (NSOE) in an English-only program (c) compare the English TAKS reading scores <b>of</b> native <b>speaker</b> <b>of</b> English in a Two Way Dual Language program to native <b>speaker</b> <b>of</b> English in an English-only program (d) compare English TAKS reading scores <b>of</b> native <b>speaker</b> <b>of</b> English to the native <b>speaker</b> <b>of</b> Spanish in a Two Way Dual Language program.
