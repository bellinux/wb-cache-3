5|$|At {{first the}} moth {{was thought to}} be from China or Bengal, but was later found to be endemic to Madagascar. It is found {{throughout}} the year {{in most parts of the}} island, with peak populations between March and August, and smallest numbers between October and December. Females lay about 80 eggs under the leaves of Omphalea spp. The caterpillars are whitish-yellow with black spots and red feet and are covered in club-ended black setae. Silk spun from the mouth helps the caterpillars hold on to smooth leaves and climb back to the plant when they fall. After completing four instars, the caterpillars spin an <b>open</b> <b>network</b> cocoon. The pupal stage lasts from 17 to 23 days.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an <b>open</b> <b>network</b> cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E

In expanded polystyrene there are interstitial gaps between the expanded closed-cell pellets that form an <b>open</b> <b>network</b> of channels between the bonded pellets, and this network of gaps can become filled with liquid water. If the water freezes into ice, it expands and can cause polystyrene pellets to break off from the foam. Extruded polystyrene is also permeable by water molecules {{and can not be}} considered a vapor barrier.|$|E

25|$|The Sansa Connect is a Wi-Fi-enabled {{player that}} allows the user to connect to any <b>open</b> <b>network</b> in the area. The Mono/Linux-based device has a 2.2-inch TFT LCD screen, but unlike SanDisk's {{previous}} player, the e200 series, the Sansa Connect {{does not have the}} ability to connect via USB mass storage or tune to FM radio yet. The player was developed by ZING Systems in collaboration with SanDisk and Yahoo!, which provides music streaming via LAUNCHcast radio and a subscription download service. Viewing pictures from Flickr is also possible with the device. The Sansa Connect is currently only available in the United States in capacities of 4GB. The storage capacity is expandable with microSD cards, currently giving the player up to an extra 2GB of storage. At the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show, the Sansa Connect won the Best of Show award. A new firmware update allows the player to support microSDHC cards up to a capacity of 8GB and the playback of digital video.|$|E

The trust radius of the focal firm, that is the focal firmâ€™s preference between in-group trust and out-group trust, has an important mediating effect.

2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{determine}} the porosity of aerogel: the three main methods are gas adsorption, mercury porosimetry, and scattering method. In gas adsorption, nitrogen at its boiling point is adsorbed into the aerogel sample. The gas being adsorbed is dependent {{on the size of the}} pores within the sample and on the partial pressure of the gas relative to its saturation pressure. [...] The volume of the gas adsorbed is measured by using the Brunauer, Emmit and Teller formula (BET), which gives the specific surface area of the sample. [...] At high partial pressure in the adsorption/desorption the Kelvin equation gives the pore size distribution of the sample. [...] In mercury porosimetry, the mercury is forced into the aerogel porous system to determine the pores' size, but this method is highly inefficient since the solid frame of aerogel will collapse from the high compressive force. [...] The scattering method involves the angle-dependent deflection of radiation within the aerogel sample. [...] The sample can be solid particles or pores. [...] The radiation goes into the material and determines the fractal geometry of the aerogel pore network. [...] The best radiation wavelengths to use are X-rays and neutrons. [...] Aerogel is also an open porous network: the difference between an open porous network and a closed porous network is that in the <b>open</b> <b>network,</b> gases can enter and leave the substance without any limitation, while a closed porous network traps the gases within the material forcing them to stay within the pores. The high porosity and surface area of silica aerogels allow them to be used in a variety of environmental filtration applications.|$|E
60|$|Soon, also, was {{suggested}} the idea that, instead of laboriously withdrawing threads from stout linen, {{it would be}} more convenient to introduce a needle-made pattern into an <b>open</b> <b>network</b> ground, which was called a lacis. Of this kind of embroidery many specimens are extant. The Cluny Museum possesses a linen cap said to have belonged to Charles V.; and an alb of linen drawn-thread work, supposed to have been made by Anne of Bohemia (1527), is preserved in the cathedral at Prague. Catherine de Medicis had a bed draped with squares of reseuil, or lacis, and it is recorded that 'the girls and servants of her household consumed much time in making squares of reseuil.' The interesting pattern-books for open-ground embroidery, of which the first was published in 1527 by Pierre Quinty, of Cologne, supply us with the means of tracing the stages in the transition from white thread embroidery to needle-point lace. We meet in them with a style of needle-work which differs from embroidery in not being wrought upon a stuff foundation. It is, in fact, true lace, done, as it were, 'in the air,' both ground and pattern being entirely produced by the lace-maker.|$|E

60|$|Look on {{the soft}} muddy bottom. You see numberless bits of stick. Watch awhile, and those sticks are alive, {{crawling}} and tumbling over each other. The weed, too, is full of smaller ones. Those live sticks are the larva-cases of the Caperers--Phryganeae--of which one family nearly two hundred species have been already found in Great Britain. Fish up one, and you find, amid sticks and pebbles, a comfortable silk case, tenanted by a goodly grub. Six legs he has, like all insects, and tufts of white horns on each ring of his abdomen, which are his gills. A goodly pair of jaws he has too, and does good service with them: for he is the great water scavenger. Decaying vegetable matter is his food, and with those jaws he will bark a dead stick as neatly as you will with a penknife. But he does not refuse animal matter. A dead brother (his, not yours) makes a savoury meal for him; and a party of those Vorticellae would stand a poor chance if he came across them. You may count these caddis baits by hundreds of thousands; whether the trout eat them case and all, is a question in these streams. In some rivers the trout do so; and what is curious, during the spring, have a regular gizzard, a temporary thickening of the coats of the stomach, {{to enable them to}} grind the pebbly cases of the caddises. See! here is one whose house is closed at both ends--'grille,' as Pictet calls it, in his unrivalled monograph of the Genevese Phryganeae, on which he spent four years of untiring labour. The grub has stopped the mouth of his case by an <b>open</b> <b>network</b> of silk, defended by small pebbles, through which the water may pass freely, while he changes into his nymph state. Open the case; you find within not a grub, but a strange bird-beaked creature, with long legs and horns laid flat by its sides, and miniature wings on its back. Observe that the sides of the tail, and one pair of legs, are fringed with dark hairs. After a fortnight's rest in this prison this 'nymph' will gnaw her way out and swim through the water on her back, by means of that fringed tail and paddles, till she reaches the bank and the upper air. There, under the genial light of day, her skin will burst, and a four-winged fly emerge, to buzz over the water as a fawn-coloured Caperer-- deadliest of trout flies; if she be not snapped up beforehand under water by some spotted monarch in search of supper.|$|E

We develop a simple algebra around these elements and describe how {{it can be used to}} compute measures of authenticity. 1 Introduction For the distribution of public keys in <b>open</b> <b>networks</b> it is not conceivable to have a single global authority that is trusted for key generation and distribution because there will always be different administrative domains which typically will have conflicting economical and political interests.

50|$|Public key {{cryptography}} {{is often}} used to secure electronic communication over an <b>open</b> <b>networked</b> environment such as the Internet, without relying on a hidden or covert channel, even for key exchange. <b>Open</b> <b>networked</b> environments are susceptible to a variety of communication security problems, such as man-in-the-middle attacks and spoofs. Communication security typically includes requirements that the communication must not be readable during transit (preserving confidentiality), the communication must not be modified during transit (preserving the integrity of the communication), the communication must originate from an identified party (sender authenticity), and the recipient must not be able to repudiate or deny receiving the communication. Combining public key cryptography with an Enveloped Public Key Encryption (EPKE) method, allows for the secure sending of a communication over an <b>open</b> <b>networked</b> environment. In other words, even if an adversary listens to an entire conversation including the key exchange, the adversary {{would not be able to}} interpret the conversation.|$|R

With an increasing growth of e-commerce and e-government, one can expect that biometric-based authentication systems are possibly deployed over the <b>open</b> <b>networks</b> in the near future. However, due to its openness, the Internet poses a great challenge to the security and privacy of biometric authentication. Biometric data cannot be revoked, so it is of paramount importance that biometric data should be handled in a secure way. In this paper we present a scheme achieving privacy-preserving fingerprint authentication between two parties, in which fingerprint minutiae matching algorithm is completed in the encrypted domain. To improve the efficiency, we exploit homomorphic encryption as well as garbled circuits to design the protocol. Our goal is to provide protection for the security of template in storage and data privacy of two parties in transaction. The experimental results show that the proposed authentication protocol runs efficiently. Therefore, the protocol can run over <b>open</b> <b>networks</b> and help to alleviate the concerns on security and privacy of biometric applications over the <b>open</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
