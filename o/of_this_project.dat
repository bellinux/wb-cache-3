The exhaust problem was never adequately resolved, and smoke continued to beat down onto the casing while moving, obscuring the driver's vision.

5|$|This was {{followed}} in late 1993 by {{a project to}} link Mohawk Road and Golf Links Road along with an interchange to connect the two with Highway403 at the former Mohawk Road interchange, which would become the connection point for the future expressway.

5|$|A {{gristmill}} {{built at}} the mouth of the creek was one of the first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large sawmill was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The sawmill was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total cost <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> was $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was practiced in the area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E
5|$|A$330million {{expansion}} programme for Terminal 2 {{was announced}} in 2007 and was completed in 2012. The objectives <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> include new lounges and retail facilities, a new satellite terminal, increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new satellite terminal features floor-to-ceiling windows offers views of the North-South runway. The new concourse includes three double-decker aerobridges which are gates 16, 18 and 20, each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. The baggage handling capacity will be increased, and two new baggage carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic. Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011 but was opened in 2012.|$|E

5|$|As {{chair of}} Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led {{an effort to}} improve {{deteriorated}} housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts like those <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> ameliorated conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area {{did not return to}} prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city as a whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in financial institutions and other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E
5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point was to build a runway in the sea and again, the high cost <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during {{the whole of the}} 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Harding {{had urged}} {{regulation}} of radio broadcasting in his April 1921 speech to Congress. Commerce Secretary Hoover took charge <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project,</b> and convened {{a conference of}} radio broadcasters in 1922, {{which led to a}} voluntary agreement for licensing of radio frequencies through the Commerce Department. Both Harding and Hoover realized something more than an agreement was needed, but Congress was slow to act, not imposing radio regulation until 1927.|$|E
5|$|Houses of the Holy topped charts worldwide, and the band's {{subsequent}} concert tour of North America in 1973 broke {{records for}} attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in Florida, they played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record {{set by the}} Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing $309,000. Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the theatrical release <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's performance, $180,000 of the band's money from gate receipts {{was stolen from a}} safe deposit box at the Drake Hotel.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) {{announced}} a proposal, which {{became known as}} the Northern Heights project, to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to both the Northern line at East Finchley and to the Northern City line at Finsbury Park. The construction of the first phase <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> involved extending tube train services from the Northern line's existing terminus at Archway station (then also called Highgate), through a new section of paired tunnels under Highgate station to emerge south of East Finchley station, where track connections to the LNER line were made.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 and 2007, a {{team from}} the University of West Bohemia, {{together}} with Salahaddin University in Arbil, carried out an extensive survey and evaluation of the entire citadel. As part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project,</b> geodetic measurements of the citadel were taken and these were combined with satellite imagery, regular photographic imagery and aerial photographs to create a map and digital 3D model of the citadel mound and the houses on top of it. Geophysical prospection {{was carried out in}} some areas of the citadel to detect traces of older architecture buried under the present houses. Archaeological investigations included an archaeological survey on the western slope of the citadel mound, and the excavation of a small test trench {{in the eastern part of}} the citadel.|$|E
5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population as a result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project,</b> they questioned its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area {{would be a waste}} of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the job would begin as early as 1963.|$|E
5|$|SR40 was {{assigned}} to the Folkston–St. Marys highway in the early 1920s. The highway was first improved in the mid-1920s and paved in the mid-1930s from Kingsland to St. Marys. SR40 was paved from Folkston east to the Charlton–Camden county line in the late 1930s and from the county line to Kingsland in the early 1940s. The highway was extensively relocated between Folkston and Kingsland in the mid-1960s. SR40 was expanded to four lanes, much of it divided highway, east of Kingsland in the 1980s. The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) has long-term plans to expand the state highway to a four-lane divided highway from Folkston to Kingsland. The first portion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> was completed east of Folkston in the mid-2000s.|$|E

The Air Historical Branch, originally established in 1919 to provide a record of air activity during the First World War, was also relocated to RAF Northolt from RAF Bentley Priory in 2008 as part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project.</b> As a result, the station has been extensively redeveloped with new facilities to support these operations.|$|E
5|$|The TRACERx {{project is}} looking at how NSCLC {{develops}} and evolves, and how these tumors become resistant to treatment. The project will look at tumor samples from 850 NSCLC patients at various stages including diagnosis, after first treatment, post-treatment, and relapse. By studying samples at different points of tumor development, the researchers hope to identify the changes that drive tumor growth and resistance to treatment. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> will help scientists and doctors {{gain a better understanding}} of NSCLC and potentially lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the band were raised in Bayonne, a city on the south west coast of France (Pyrénées-Atlantiques/French Basque Country).
