5|$|The Simpsons Movie is a 2007 American {{animated}} comedy film {{based on}} the Fox television series The Simpsons. The film was directed by David Silverman, and stars the regular television cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell and Russi Taylor, along with Tom Hanks, Green Day and Albert Brooks. The film follows Homer Simpson, whose irresponsibility gets the better of him when he pollutes the lake in Springfield after the town has cleaned it up following receipt of a warning from the Environmental Protection Agency. As the townspeople exile him and eventually his family abandons him, Homer works to redeem his folly by stopping Russ Cargill, the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA,</b> when he intends to destroy Springfield.|$|E

On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous suits against the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. Christine Todd Whitman, administrator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe.

40|$|This {{project will}} focus on the Economic Partnership Agreement (<b>EPA)</b> between <b>the</b> European union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states (ACP), and the {{difficulties}} surrounding the EPA-negotiations. The project aims to determine <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problematic implementations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPAs.</b> To do so, we will be looking at the background and context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPAs,</b> and explain <b>the</b> ground principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement, as well as the negotiation process, with a special focus on the Sub-Saharan countries. This report will then analyse <b>the</b> theoretical foundation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPAs,</b> {{in order to determine the}} theoretical approach to the goals and means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement. Furthermore, we will analyse <b>the</b> criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> raised by a number of internal sources, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a number <b>of</b> ministers from <b>the</b> Sub-Saharan ACP countries, and external sources, in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> International NGO’s, in order to determine the reasons behind this criticism. This will lead to a brief assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coherence between the criticisms, made respectively by the internal and external sources connected to the EPA-negotiations. This study will conclude that the differences between <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> and its supporters on one side, and <b>the</b> critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPAs</b> on <b>the</b> other, can be explained by fundamentally different theoretical views on how to best secure <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ACP-countries. Furthermore, a lack of resources and assistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ACP-countries has hindered <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPAs.</b> This leads to the conclusion, that it is not a reluctance to engage in a trade agreement between the EU and ACP that has made <b>the</b> implementations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA’s</b> so difficult, but instead it is the different theoretical views on how to best secure <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ACP-countries, as well as the technical difficulties surrounding corporation between two unequal partners, that has hampered <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPAs...</b>|$|R

Following the United Nations Climate Treaty, signed by 200 nations in 2015, Trump's actions are a distinct step backwards from phasing out fossil fuels. Most notably, on March 28, 2017, Trump signed the Energy Independence Executive Order designed {{to get rid of}} the Clean Power Plan initiated by President Obama. As a result, any previous action and steps taken to stop climate change will not be sustained. Trump has also promised to bring back the coal industry despite most greenhouse gases coming from coal-based power plants.|$|E

25|$|Reagan's {{support for}} an {{increased}} defense budget {{at the height of}} the Cold War was supported by Congressional Democrats and Republicans. However, Congress was reluctant to follow Reagan's proposed cuts in domestic programs. In accordance with Reagan's less-government intervention views, many domestic government programs were cut or experienced periods of reduced funding during his presidency. These included Social Security, Medicaid, Food Stamps, and federal education programs. Though Reagan protected entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicare, in one of the most widely criticized actions of the administration, the administration attempted to purge tens of thousands of allegedly disabled people from the Social Security disability roles, who the administration alleged were not truly disabled. Funding for government organizations, including the Environmental Protection Agency, were also reduced. He cut the EPA's budget by 22%, and his director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA,</b> Anne M. Burford, resigned over alleged mismanagement of funds. Tax breaks and increased military spending created a larger budget deficit, which led Reagan to approve two tax increases, aiming to preserve funding for Social Security.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to attribution of recent climate change, the City of Melbourne, in 2002, set a target to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2020 and Moreland City Council established the Zero Moreland program, {{however not all}} metropolitan municipalities have followed, with the City of Glen Eira notably deciding in 2009 not to become carbon neutral. Melbourne {{has one of the}} largest urban footprints in the world due to its low density housing, resulting in a vast suburban sprawl, {{with a high level of}} car dependence and minimal public transport outside of inner areas. Much of the vegetation within the city are non-native species, most of European origin, and in many cases plays host to invasive species and noxious weeds. Significant introduced urban pests include the common myna, feral pigeon, brown rat, European wasp, common starling and red fox. Many outlying suburbs, particularly towards the Yarra Valley and the hills to the north-east and east, have gone for extended periods without regenerative fires leading to a lack of saplings and undergrowth in urbanised native bushland. The Department of Sustainability and Environment partially addresses this problem by regularly burning off. Several national parks have been designated around the urban area of Melbourne, including the Mornington Peninsula National Park, Port Phillip Heads Marine National Park and Point Nepean National Park in the south east, Organ Pipes National Park to the north and Dandenong Ranges National Park to the east. There are also a number of significant state parks just outside Melbourne. Responsibility for regulating pollution falls under the jurisdiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> Victoria and several local councils. Air pollution, by world standards, is classified as being good. Summer and autumn are the worst times of year for atmospheric haze in the urban area.|$|E

50|$|From <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1974 SDWA, <b>EPA</b> {{declined}} to require Class II UIC permits for hydraulic fracturing. The agency maintained {{that it was}} not required to do so, because underground injection was not <b>the</b> “principal function” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wells. <b>The</b> <b>EPA</b> also cited <b>the</b> “endangerment clause” in SWDA section 1421(b)(2), which directs <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> to establish regulations which: “… are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by such injection.” The agency stated that it did not consider hydraulic fracturing to be an endangerment to underground drinking water sources.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{has known}} {{impacts on the}} environment and potential unknown direct or indirect impacts {{on the environment and}} human health.

This has raised concerns about <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> permit issuance control. In addition to this mission, <b>the</b> <b>EPA</b> works with states to provide safe disposal of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing, has partnerships with other administrations and companies to reduce the air emissions from hydraulic fracturing, particularly from methane employed in the process, and tries to ensure both compliance to regulatory standards and transparency for all stakeholders implied in <b>the</b> implementation process <b>of</b> hydraulic fracturing.|$|R
