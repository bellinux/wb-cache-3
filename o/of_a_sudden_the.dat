25|$|Durham were a {{prime example}} of how the lack of three men can change a team. Three months earlier, Michael Hussey, Paul Collingwood and Steve Harmison had been firing for the Durham lads as they beat Leicestershire by an innings and 216 runs, the highest margin of victory in the County Championship so far this season - before this match. Without these three, and only with Nathan Astle and Ashley Noffke by way of replacement, they {{collapsed}} to 167 against the bowling of Glen Chapple and Gary Keedy, before Mal Loye made a double ton and Dominic Cork an unbeaten ton to give Lancashire a 363-run lead on first innings. Then, Chapple took four for 18, as Durham rolled over yet again for 135 - and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>the</b> league leaders were transformed into laughing stocks.|$|E
25|$|In 1999 Deuteronomium {{entered the}} studio again and {{recorded}} new material. They first released a single called To Die and Gain. During that period they also changed their old extreme metal logo {{to a more}} simplified version. All <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>the</b> band {{received a phone call}} from club Lutakko inquiring whether Deuteronomium could open for the rock metal band Sentenced – a well-known Finnish group – on February 6. It was Deuteronomium's biggest gig at that point of their career. According to Deuteronomium, they were well received by the audience who had come to see Sentenced although many were surprised that Deuternomium is a Christian band when the band told about their faith. The members of Sentenced were divided in two when they heard who their support act was. Others didn't even greet them while others came to talk to Deuteronomium members during the pauses.|$|E

Kozyrev observed {{an apparent}} half-hour [...] "eruption" [...] {{that took place}} on the central peak of Alphonsus crater using a 48-inch (122-cm) reflector telescope equipped with a spectrometer. During this time, the obtained spectra showed evidence for bright gaseous emission bands due to the molecules C2 and C3. While exposing his second spectrogram, he noticed [...] "a marked increase in the brightness of the central region and an unusual white colour." [...] Then, [...] "all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>the</b> brightness started to decrease" [...] and the resulting spectrum was normal.|$|E

500|$|Randle {{described}} the feeling {{after the game}} as, [...] "It's like driving down a street and getting every green light {{for the next ten}} miles, and you're just cruising along, and it's just smooth. And all of a sudden, you're getting there, you're almost there, and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>the</b> fucking light turns red, and you get sideswiped." [...] Randle further laments the loss due to the background of many of his teammates, whom he described as [...] "misfits, guys who just got their second chance." [...] Beyond Moss's legal troubles, Carter had been released by the Philadelphia Eagles early in his career for substance abuse issues, and Cunningham was released by the Eagles and remained unsigned to a team two seasons prior. Randle himself was considered undersized coming out of college and was not heavily pursued by NFL teams.|$|E
500|$|Fichtner {{said that}} his role on Prison Break ended up being [...] "a lot longer" [...] than he had {{originally}} thought. He was signed on to appear for a further two seasons, after being convinced by Olmstead to appear in a fourth (and final) one. The series' move from Dallas to Los Angeles for filming was also an inducement for Fichtner, who previously had to leave his family for filming. When Olmstead asked Fichtner to return for the fourth season, his only request was to make it challenging by making his character's journey difficult. Fichtner believes that in Mahone's journey, [...] "All <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>the</b> blinders went up... And little by little, he's trying {{to make his way}} back." [...] He thinks that his character's journey should end with [...] "something really out of the blue": [...] "What if he totally loses it?" ...|$|E

Continuing their investigation, Max and Chloe obtain clues leading them to an abandoned barn owned by the influential Prescott family. They discover a hidden bunker containing pictures of Kate and Rachel tied up and intoxicated, with Rachel being buried at Chloe's secret hideout. They hurry back to the scrapyard and find Rachel's grave, much to Chloe's despair. Max follows Chloe at the school party to confront Nathan, believing he will target fellow student Victoria Chase (Dani Knights). They receive a text from Nathan threatening to destroy the evidence, returning them to the scrapyard. All <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>the</b> two are ambushed by Jefferson, who anaesthetises Max and kills Chloe with a shot to the head. Max is kidnapped and held captive in the [...] "Dark Room", a place Jefferson has been drugging and photographing young girls to capture their innocence. Max escapes into a photograph and emerges back at the beginning in Jefferson's class. She alerts David, getting Jefferson arrested.|$|E

500|$|Arnold {{wanted a}} theme song marrying the [...] "classic Bond sound" [...] with the electronica that would {{influence}} {{most of his}} score. An orchestra would be required as audiences expect traditional elements in a Bond film, and without them The World Is Not Enough {{would be seen as}} a generic action movie. Getting the balance right might be a [...] "poisoned chalice", since the results could sound {{too much or too little}} like a Bond theme. Arnold collaborated with lyricist Don Black on the song. Black, with 30 years of experience writing Bond themes, wrote the lyrics to Tom Jones's [...] "Thunderball", Shirley Bassey's [...] "Diamonds Are Forever", Lulu's [...] "The Man with the Golden Gun" [...] and k.d. lang's closing credits theme, [...] "Surrender", from Tomorrow Never Dies. Arnold and Black met several times to discuss lyrics for [...] "The World Is Not Enough", also collaborating by phone, fax and email. According to Arnold, he [...] "strung some la-las together, and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>the</b> [...] came to life". By the end of 1998 he and Black finished the music and lyrics, except for the bridge (a contrasting section of about eight bars).|$|E
500|$|In Cowboys & Aliens, Director Jon Favreau sought [...] a {{plausible}} approach to how humans {{from the late}} 19th century could confront extraterrestrial beings armed with advanced weaponry. He said, [...] "It was very well laid out, well planned, {{and there were a}} lot of discussions with a lot of actors who called me to task on things that seemed too convenient, so we made sure we earned each step." [...] The director also sought to maintain a Western tone as aliens appeared in the film, saying, [...] "It's very easy to just cut the string and then all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>the</b> action starts and you're in Independence Day." [...] Favreau cited the works of John Ford and Sergio Leone as sources of inspiration as well as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Favreau also wanted the science-fiction element to stand on its own, referencing Alien, Predator, and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. He said of both genres, [...] "It's about finding the intersection of those two genres [...] [...] [...] If you do it right, it honors both, and it becomes interesting and clever and a reinvention of two things that people understand the conventions of, instead of just a retread or remake or sequel or reboot of a film you've seen before." ...|$|E
500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And then all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>the</b> flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

500|$|... "Come Running" [...] was {{described}} by Morrison as [...] "a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song." [...] By contrast, Hinton found the song's sentiments tender and lustful in the vein of the 1967 Bob Dylan song [...] "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight". He argued that [...] "Come Running" [...] juxtaposed images of unstoppable nature—wind and rain, a passing train—against [...] "which human life and death play out their little games", which the narrator and his lover dream will not end [...] "while knowing of course it will". According to the writer, [...] "These Dreams of You" [...] manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and [...] "his angel from above" [...] cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him. Morrison said he was inspired to write [...] "Brand New Day" [...] after hearing The Band on the radio playing either [...] "The Weight" [...] or [...] "I Shall Be Released": [...] "I {{looked up at the}} sky and the sun started to shine and all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>the</b> song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'." [...] Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that [...] "Brand New Day" [...] was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.|$|E
500|$|However, the Georgia Tech {{incident}} left Ward {{angry and}} disillusioned. He recalled that it sapped his competitive spirit. Ward considered quitting football, even {{writing a letter}} to Coach Kipke about his intentions of leaving the team. He recalled later that the refusal to let him play against Georgia Tech destroyed his will. [...] "It {{was the fact that}} I couldn't play in the Georgia Tech game. That all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>the</b> practice that you just did because it was the thing to do that was good—a tremendous amount of burnt up energy—all of a sudden becomes drudgery." [...] His one sports highlight in 1935 was beating Jesse Owens at Yost Fieldhouse in the 60-yard dash and 65 high hurdles. Ward's times were neck-and-neck with Owens' up until the NCAA track and field championship. [...] He took part in the Olympic trials in 1936, but having lost his competitive drive, Ward, in his own words, did not train to his peak and failed to make the U.S. team. [...] "They were urging me to go out in '36," [...] Ward recalled. [...] "But that Georgia Tech game killed me. I frankly felt they would not let black athletes compete. Having gone through the Tech experience, it seemed an easy thing for them to say 'Well, we just won't run 'em if Hitler insists.'" [...] Interviewed about the incident in 1976, Ward said: “It was like any bad experience—you can’t forget it, but you don’t talk about it. It hurts.” ...|$|E

With the song getting airplay across the South and Southwest, Perkins was booked to appear along with Elvis Presley at theaters in Marianna and West Memphis, Arkansas. Commenting on the audience reaction to both Presley and himself, Perkins said, [...] "When I'd jump around they'd scream some, {{but they were}} gettin' ready for him.

[...] Minnesota first baseman Justin Morneau describes the effect: [...] "If you’ve never seen it, it's definitely something pretty funny. It's hard to explain, the effect it has on everyone.
