The vapor released by the arcing consists of hydrogen gas.Mineral oil has better insulating property than air. Whenever there is a separation of current carrying contacts in the oil, the arc in circuit breaker is initialized at the moment of separation of contacts, and due to this arc the oil is vaporized and decomposed in mostly hydrogen gas and ultimately creates a hydrogen bubble around the electric arc. This highly compressed gas bubble around the arc prevents re-striking of the arc after current reaches zero crossing of the cycle.

In this article, a model is presented that makes it possible to predict temperature distributions in high-speed thrust ball bearings. It is found that the prediction or measurement of global power loss cannot discriminate between several combinations of traction and drag forces. On the other hand, the predicted temperature distributions appear as very sensitive to the relative importance given to hydrodynamic rolling tractions or drag losses.

40|$|Modifications to {{the coolant}} and <b>oil</b> <b>circuits</b> {{of a modern}} {{production}} 2. 4 l diesel engine {{have been made in}} an attempt to promote oil warm-up to reduce fuel consumption. The new system used oil to cool exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) gases and incorporates a number of coolant flow control valves to reduce heat loss during warm-up. The engine was run over cold-start New European Drive Cycles with various flow strategies as a screening exercise to understand the behaviour of the system. Fuel consumption benefits of up to 4 per cent were observed, but these were accompanied by 3 per cent increases in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. Detailed analysis of the coolant flows and temperatures showed that, when throttling the flow, the mass of coolant in the degas bottle and radiator could be isolated from the system during warm-up, essentially reducing the thermal inertia. Heat transfer directly to the oil from the EGR gases rather than via the coolant allowed more heat to be put into the oil, with engine oil supply temperatures up to 6 C hotter; however, {{it was not possible to}} verify that the oil was hotter at the bearings, valve train, and cylinder liner. The engine strategy was seen to react to the faster warm-up and to retard injection timing, reducing NOx but also compromising overall fuel consumption benefits. Further tests were conducted with various injection timings to establish a NOx-fuel consumption trade-off to demonstrate further benefits when the engine strategy is included in the operation of novel thermal management systems...|$|R
