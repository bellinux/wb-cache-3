This left atrial pressure is transmitted to the pulmonary vasculature and causes pulmonary hypertension.

The filtration pressure decreases along the capillary loops from afferent to efferent end. Water and solute flows are thus given by a system of two differential equations. The sieving coefficient of the macromolecules is the ratio of solute to water flow. In the program described the differential equations are solved by the Runge-Kutta method (fourth order). Rosenbrock's method of minimization is used to adjust the theoretical to the experimental sieving coefficients.

The differential diagnosis of a transudate is relatively limited and usually easily discernible from the clinical presentation.

We have previously shown that rats with congenital, unilateral hydronephrosis exhibit {{a reduction in}} GFR that returns to normal when either the renin angiotensin system or thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) is blocked. The current study defines the single nephron defect in congenital, unilateral hydronephrosis and evaluates the roles of angiotensin II (Ang II) and TxA 2 in this renal derangement. Renal micropuncture experiments were performed on the right kidney of rats from an inbred colony with unilateral right-sided hydronephrosis (HYDRO), or non-affected litter mates (CONTROL). In addition, four separate groups of hydronephrotic animals were treated with either the TxA 2 receptor antagonist SQ- 29548 (SQ), one of two Ang II receptor antagonists [saralasin (SAR) or DuP- 753 (DUP) ], or combined treatment with DuP- 753 and SQ- 29, 548 (S&D). SNGFR was significantly reduced (P 0. 05) in hydrostatic or <b>oncotic</b> <b>pressures</b> across the glomerular capillary between any of the groups studied. The observation that Kf increases above CONTROL with combined blockade of TxA 2 and Ang II suggests that these regulatory hormones decrease Kf via independent mechanisms.

Secretin was infused at 75 mU/kg per min into the aorta above the left renal artery. Efferent plasma flow increased from 125 +/- 28 to 230 +/- 40 nl/min with secretin infusion. Single nephron filtration rate (44 +/- 6 vs. 44 +/- 7 nl/min) and absolute proximal reabsorption (21 +/- 5 vs. 21 +/- 4 nl/min) were not significantly changed. Peritubular capillary and interstitial hydrostatic pressures increased with secretin infusions (from 9 +/- 0. 4 to 15 +/- 0. 7 mmHg and from 3 +/- 0. 2 to 4 +/- 0. 2 mmHg, respectively). Both peritubular capillary and interstitial <b>oncotic</b> <b>pressures</b> decreased (from 25 +/- 2 to 20 +/- 2 mmHg and from 10 +/- 1 to 4 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively) during secretin infusion. The net reabsorption pressure for peritubular capillary uptake significantly decreased from 9 +/- 2 to 5 +/- 2 mmHg and the coefficient of reabsorption increased from 3 +/- 1 to 6 +/- 2 nl/min per mmHg. We conclude that although secretin causes a vasodilation and decreases net reabsorption pressure, absolute proximal reabsorption is unchanged.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hematocrit}} on renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion were studied in anesthetized dogs during both hydropenia and volume expansion. The hematocrit was decreased by isovolemic exchange with the animal's own previously harvested plasma and increased by isovolemic exchange with fresh, washed red blood cells. Renal perfusion pressure was maintained constant throughout the experiments by the adjustment of a suprarenal aortic clamp. During hydropenia, {{a decrease in}} hematocrit was associated {{with an increase in}} sodium and potassium excretion and solutefree water reabsorption. These changes were accompained by an increase in renal plasma flow and renal blood flow and a decrease in renal vascular resistance. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged and filtration fraction was significantly decreased as hematocrit was lowered. Increasing hematocrit during hydropenia had the opposite effects on electrolyte excretion, solute-free water reabsorption, and renal hemodynamics. In another group of animals, hematocrit was lowered during volume expansion with either saline or plasma, then returned to the control level by isovolemic exchange with washed red blood cells. This increase in hematocrit during volume expansion had a similar effect on electrolyte excretion, solute-free water reabsorption, and renal hemodynamics as during hydropenia. These results therefore suggest that acute changes in hematocrit may significantly affect sodium excretion and renal hemodynamics during both hydropenia and volume expansion. The changes in solute-free water reabsorption and potassium excretion suggest that the alterations in hematocrit may affect primarily the reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule. The concommitant effects of hematocrit on renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction may mediate this change in sodium reabsorption by altering hydrostatic and <b>oncotic</b> <b>pressures</b> in the peritubular circulation...|$|R

Both afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances increased and rpf fell from 221 +/- 25 to 90 +/- 9 nl/min per g kidney wt (P less than 0. 001) but the hydrostatic pressure gradient across the glomerular membrane deltaP = PG - Pt) increased from 37 +/- 1 to 50 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0. 001). The increase in deltaP and a numerical decrease in piA both acted to maintain sngfr after AGBM Ab and effectively nullified the influence of decreased rpf upon sngfr.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized, comparative trial. PATIENTS: Thirty ASA 1 - 2 patients, scheduled for lumbar intervertebral disc surgery were randomly allocated to three groups receiving either 2, 000 mL of lactated Ringer's solution (RL, n = 10), 750 mL of hydroxyethylstarch 6 % (HEA, n = 10) or 2, 000 mL of normal saline (NaCl, n = 10). METHODS: Baseline osmolality, natraemia, glycaemia and protidaemia were measured before induction of anaesthesia (T 1), after the infusion of 375 mL of hydroxyethylstarch or 1, 000 mL of crystalloids (T 2) {{and at the end of}} the infusion (T 3). RESULTS: The three groups were identical for age, weight, initial plasma osmolality and natraemia. However, osmolality in the RL group was decreased at T 2 and T 3 compared to T 1 (respectively: 299 +/- 5 mOsm. kg- 1, 295 +/- 4 mOsm. kg- 1 and 292 +/- 5 mOsm. kg- 1. Osmolality at T 2 and T 3 was also lower in the RL group compared to the HEA and NaCl groups (respectively: 301 +/- 6 mOsm. kg- 1 and 304 +/- 13 mOsm. kg- 1 for T 2 and T 3 in the HEA group, and 299 +/- 5 mOsm. kg- 1 and 298 +/- 5 mOsm. kg- 1 in the NaCl group). In the HEA and NaCl groups, osmolality was unchanged at T 2 and T 3 compared to T 1.
