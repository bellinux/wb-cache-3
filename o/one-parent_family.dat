5000|$|Anna Naschatir (1861-1901) was the [...] "impoverished cousin" [...] of Siegfried Hoff's landlord. She {{had been}} born in Daugavpils which today is in Latvia but at that time would have been {{regarded}} as a prosperous city to the south of St. Petersburg {{in the western part of}} the Russian empire. Anna was at least sixteen years younger than Siegfried. It is not clear whether they married out of love or from dynastic calculations. The marriage ceremony, conducted towards the end of 1878 in St. Petersburg, was a lavish affair. The couple's only child, Adelaide [...] "Ida" [...] Hoff, was born a little over a year later. However, the marriage was a joyless one. Anna and Siegfried separated in the mid 1880s, although they were formally divorced only in 1890. It was possibly a reflection of the stigma surrounding divorce that later Ida would explain that she had grown up in a <b>one-parent</b> <b>family</b> in the context of her father's early death, which was not completely untrue. (Her father died in 1896.) Despite being a one parent family, it appears that the divorce settlement left Anna and her daughter well provided for financially.|$|E

40|$|Government means-tested {{assistance}} programs, such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), provide {{cash and}} noncash benefits to many low-income families. In 2009, 19. 0 percent of U. S. families, on average, participated {{in at least}} one major means-tested program per month. Participation rates were highest for <b>one-parent</b> <b>families</b> headed by women, 46. 3 percent, compared with 26. 5 percent for <b>one-parent</b> <b>families</b> headed by men and 12. 3 percent for married- couple families. This article uses data from the 2011 Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey to examine the spending patterns of families receiving benefits from one or more government means-tested assistance programs. Families with children under 18 are the focus of this research, because the poverty rate for children under 18 was highest for this group, at 21. 9 percent in 2011, compared with 13. 7 percent for people age 18 to 64 and 8. 7 percent for people age 65 and older. Findings show that: Average total expenditures of families receiving means-tested assistance were less than half those of families not receiving assistance. For families receiving assistance, food, housing, and transportation accounted for 77. 0 percent of the family budget, compared with 65. 5 percent of the budget of families not receiving assistance.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explored the}} effect of parenthood status on kinship relations. It was hypothesized that the <b>one-parent</b> <b>family</b> would have more contact with the consanguinal kin than affinal kin, in order to fill the place that was vacated by the spouse. It was assumed that increased contact would be necessary as the <b>one-parent</b> <b>family</b> would be in need of extra support systems. [...] A random sample of one-parent families and dual-parent families was chosen to ascertain who maintained the most contact with kin. A mail questionnaire was used and questions were asked about the frequency of visiting, telephoning, letter writing, and the receiving of financial assistance. These questions were asked in relation to consanguinal kin and affinal kin. [...] The data were analyzed by using the t-test for significance and the Pearson’s Product Moment correlation coefficient {{as a measure of}} association. It was shown through the findings that parenthood status does indeed affect kinship relations but the direction showed tat the dual-parent family has significantly more contact with kin that the <b>one-parent</b> <b>family.</b> [...] The findings of this research have opened up many new areas of investigation surrounding the dynamics of the <b>one-parent</b> <b>family.</b> The reasons why the <b>one-parent</b> <b>family</b> does not maintain contact should be researched to add to our understanding.

40|$|Magister Artium (Social Work) - MA(SW) The {{first year}} of {{university}} studies is usually accompanied by many new experiences, often stressful, and family members fulfil {{a significant role in}} helping to reduce students' stress and facilitate their adjustment. Research has indicated that the overall first year experience sets the tone for the subsequent well-being of students both academically and personally, and if this is negative then the university dropout rates are likely to remain high. This study seeks {{to determine the effects of}} family structure and parental autonomy-support on students' adjustment during the {{first year of}} university. The study employed a quantitative, cross-sectional correlational research design. Participants were selected by means of convenient sampling, and only consisted of first year university students between the ages of 18 and 25 years who were registered at the University of the Western Cape. Data was collected via an online survey consisting of three self-reported questionnaires, namely the perceived parental autonomy-support scale, the college adaptation questionnaire, and also demographic information. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Participants' right to privacy, confidentiality and anonymity was observed throughout the study. The results suggest that students from two-parent families are better adjusted than students from <b>one-parent</b> <b>families.</b> Furthermore, results of the total sample suggest a significant relationship between good adjustment and autonomy-supportive parenting, while a significant negative relationship exists between poor adjustment and autonomy-supportive parenting.
