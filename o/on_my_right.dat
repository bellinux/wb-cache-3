25|$|A {{line from}} Shakespeare has {{sometimes}} been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: Come <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, for this ear is deaf. No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he had turned his attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.|$|E
500|$|From {{the start}} of the war until early 1862, when {{responsibility}} was passed to the War Department, Seward was in charge of determining who should be detained without charges or trial. Approximately 800 men and a few women, believed to be Southern sympathizers or spies, were detained, usually at the initiation of local officials. [...] Once Seward was informed, he would often order that the prisoner be transferred to federal authorities. Seward was reported to have boasted to Lord Lyons that [...] "I can touch a bell <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand, and order the arrest of a citizen... and no power on earth, except that of the President, can release them.

500|$|Night at the Blood Beast was {{distributed}} by American International Pictures. It was test-screened for audiences in unadvertised sneak previews, in which audiences attending a different film were surprised with {{a screening of}} Blood Beast instead. Coincidentally, Martin Varno attended one of these sneak previews without any advance knowledge of what it was. The screening was also attended by Roger and Gene Corman, who were not pleased by Varno's presence. It {{was the first time}} the screenwriter had seen the completed film, which he did not enjoy, and he said of watching it: [...] "On my left side was sitting Forry Ackerman, and <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> side was sitting Jerry Bixby. And their main job was to keep my hands held down so I wouldn't cut my throat." [...] During its theatrical release, Night of the Blood Beast was a double feature co-billed with She Gods of Shark Reef.|$|E
500|$|Because of his damaged kidney, Hoffman was {{not allowed}} to play {{football}} or wrestle. Hoffman went to Savanna High School in Anaheim as had Glenn, which put pressure on Hoffman following his more talented older brother. Ed, who did not trust that coaches would protect Hoffman's arm, stopped allowing his son to pitch after he was 12 years old. Standing at just [...] and , Hoffman played shortstop at Savanna, but nobody offered him a scholarship out of high school. He grew three inches over the summer and continued playing at Cypress College, and later for the University of Arizona from 1988 through 1989. [...] Arizona was afraid of the liability if Hoffman's remaining kidney got hit by a baseball. [...] "I told them the one kidney I have is <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> side. That's not the side that faces the pitcher when I hit, so it was O.K. They bought it", said Hoffman. He led Arizona in hitting in 1988 with a [...]371 batting average, 35 points better than teammate J. T. Snow. Other notable teammates included Scott Erickson and Kevin Long. Hoffman exhibited a strong throwing arm playing shortstop.|$|E
500|$|Ciaran {{has stated}} that the Super Furry Animals were [...] "very hands-on" [...] during {{the making of the}} DVD. Initially the band were mainly {{concerned}} with the sound quality, describing the presentation of the album's tracks in surround sound as [...] "radical, like the change from mono to stereo". The group directed the surround sound mix themselves, instructing audio engineers to move instruments and vocal parts between speakers: [...] "We want that one bit of sound to travel from the centre, over our heads and finish <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> shoulder ... Let's have the main vocal in the middle, then each harmony in its own speaker." [...] They soon became equally as interested in the remixes, visuals and interactive elements however. Ciaran has described this process as [...] "not always a nice position to be in" [...] when, for example, they had to reject music videos they weren't happy with. The band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album Guerrilla themselves. According to singer Gruff Rhys the band [...] "tended to go for illustrators who could [...] cheaply using Flash ... and artists who like to work". The directors were asked to make the visuals as [...] "extreme as possible" [...] in an effort to avoid making videos that looked like just [...] "another pop promo ... like MTV" [...] and, according to Ciaran, had to [...] "work even harder at creating something interesting" [...] due to the limited budget available. Many of those who made videos for the DVD release had no previous experience of making films resulting in a [...] "really fresh ... kind of scruffy" [...] end product. According to Rhys the band made separate music videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional videos that were more like adverts for the songs. Rhys {{has stated that}} the Super Furry Animals felt that fans placed too much emphasis on the videos on Rings Around the World rather than concentrating on the music, as a result of which the band used [...] "really bland images" [...] on the DVD release of their next album Phantom Power.|$|E

2500|$|Dalkowski's {{claim to}} fame was the high {{velocity}} of his fastball. Accurate measurements {{at the time were}} difficult to make, but the consensus is that Dalkowski regularly threw well above 100 miles per hour. Dalkowski's raw speed was aided by his highly flexible left (pitching) arm, and by his unusual [...] "buggy-whip" [...] pitching motion, which ended in a cross-body arm swing. [...] "I hit my left elbow <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> knee so often, they finally made me a pad to wear", recalled Dalkowski.|$|E

It hurts to watch a little, but it was interesting, and when the boy comes back to the girl, the two cameras were again in classic 3D. So I showed it to Jean-Luc and he decided to use this for the film.|$|E

2500|$|Caster was optioned by the Athletics to the Portland Beavers for the 1936 season, {{which proved}} to be the best of Caster's career.

[...] He was the leader in the Pacific Coast League in 1936 in both wins and strikeouts (234). [...] In a front page profile, The Sporting News credited Caster's turnaround to overcoming his lack of control and adding a slow knuckleball to his blazing fastball and sharp-breaking curve. [...] Caster later wrote an article describing the role of his knuckler:"My knuckle ball is thrown with the fingertips of my index and second finger <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> hand in contact with the smooth surface of the ball – no seems touched...

One of her legs is out of her pants and flung {{over the side of the}} chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch.

2500|$|.....my {{ears were}} saluted with the {{agreeable}} {{sound of a}} fall of water and advancing a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a collumn of smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S. W. I did not however loose my direction to this point which soon began to make a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri. ... I hurryed down the hill which was about 200 feet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand specticle. ... immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about ninety or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smoth even sheet of water falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>right</b> formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the hight of the fall is the same of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in it's passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the hight of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after descending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they role and swell into half formed billows of great hight which rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock defends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is deversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower extremity of the bottom {{there is a very}} thick grove of the same kind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. ... from the reflection of the sun on the spray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull rainbow produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this majestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished for the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, that I might be enabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly magnifficent and sublimely grand object, which has from the commencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but this was fruitless and vain. I most sincerely regreted that I had not brought a crimee obscura with me by the assistance of which even I could have hoped to have done better but alas this was also out of my reach; I therefore with the assistance of my pen only indeavoured to traces some of the stronger features of this seen by the assistance of which and my recollection aided by some able pencil I hope still to give to the world some faint idea of an object which at this moment fills me with such pleasure and astonishment, and which of its kind I will venture to ascert is second to but one in the known world. ...|$|E
