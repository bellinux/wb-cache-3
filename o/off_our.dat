Then the ideas spread {{to the rest of the}} Neolithic Britain. This was the font for new thinking at the time.|$|E
500|$|Amanda Sebestyen {{wrote in}} The Women's Review of Books {{that at first}} glance the ideas in The Good Terrorist appear deceptively simple, and the plot predictable. But she added that Lessing's {{strength}} is her [...] "stoic narrat of the daily effort of living", which excels in describing day-to-day life in a squat. Sebestyen also praised the book's depiction of Alice, who [...] "speak to me most disquietingly about myself and my generation". In a review in <b>off</b> <b>our</b> backs, an American feminist publication, Vickie Leonard called The Good Terrorist a [...] "fascinating book" [...] that is [...] "extremely well written" [...] with characters that are [...] "exciting" [...] and [...] "realistic". Leonard added that even though Alice is not a feminist, the book illustrates the author's [...] "strong admiration for women and their accomplishments".|$|E
500|$|Millett {{wrote her}} autobiographical books Flying (1974) and Sita (1977) about coming out as gay, partly an {{important}} consciousness-raising activity. She realized beginning an open dialogue {{is important to}} break down the isolation and alienation that hiding in privacy can cause. She wrote in Flying what Alice Henry calls in her <b>off</b> <b>our</b> backs review of Sita an [...] "excruciating public and political 'coming out'" [...] and its effect on her personal, political, and artistic lives. While she discussed some of her love affairs in Flying, in Sita she provides insight into a lesbian love affair and her fears of being alone or inadequate. Henry writes, [...] "Kate's transparent vulnerability and attempts to get to the root of herself and grasp her lover are typical of many women who love women." ...|$|E

[...] "We went down there, took <b>off</b> <b>our</b> shoes, rolled up our jeans a little bit and walked right into the water—and stood there for 45 minutes while we got our picture taken.

500|$|He {{was elected}} {{as a member}} of the European Parliament for North West England in the 2009 European Elections. The BNP polled 943,598votes (6.2%), gaining two MEPs. Griffin and fellow MEP Andrew Brons were {{subsequently}} pelted with eggs as they attempted to stage a celebratory press conference outside the Houses of Parliament. A second venue– a public house near Manchester– was chosen the following day. A line of police blocked a large group of protesters, who chanted [...] "No platform for Nazi Nick" [...] and [...] "Nazi scum <b>off</b> <b>our</b> streets". Griffin viewed the election as an important victory, claiming that his party had been demonised and blocked from holding public meetings. [...] "In Oldham alone there have been hundreds of thousands of pounds spent on employing bogus community workers to keep us out.

500|$|Smetana's eight operas {{created the}} bedrock of the Czech opera repertory, but of these only The Bartered Bride is {{performed}} regularly outside the composer's homeland. After reaching Vienna in 1892, and London in 1895, it rapidly {{became part of the}} repertory of every major opera company worldwide. Newmarch argues that The Bartered Bride, while not a [...] "gem of the first order", is nevertheless [...] "a perfectly cut and polished stone of its kind." [...] Its trademark overture, which Newmarch says [...] "lifts us <b>off</b> <b>our</b> feet with its madcap vivacity", was composed in a piano version before Smetana received the draft libretto. Clapham believes that this has few precedents in the entire history of opera. Smetana himself was later inclined to disparage his achievement: [...] "The Bartered Bride was merely child's play, written straight off the reel". In the view of German critic William Ritter, Smetana's creative powers reached their zenith with his third opera, Dalibor.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{finishing}} in {{last place}} {{for the second year}} in a row, the Senators actually improved their attendance over the previous season. [...] Even with the increased gate, they barely survived the season. [...] After the season ended, it was announced by Auditorium president F. D. Burpee that the franchise would not return to Ottawa for the 1934–35 season due to losses of $60,000 over the previous two seasons. The losses were too great to be made up by the sale of players' contracts, and the club needed to be moved to [...] "some very large city which has a large rink, if we are to protect the Auditorium shareholders and pay <b>off</b> <b>our</b> debts." [...] The NHL franchise was moved to St. Louis, Missouri and operated as the St. Louis Eagles. The Eagles played only one season, finishing last again. [...] They suspended operations after the season, never to return. Flash Hollett was the last member of the Senators to play in the NHL, retiring with the Detroit Red Wings in 1946.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Gittings and Lahusen {{pushed the}} American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) to grant couple's {{membership}} to them, for a reduced price on health insurance.

On February 18, 2007, Gittings died in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania after a long battle with breast cancer. She is survived by her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and her sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor. In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: [...] "As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and {{what it meant to be}} gay. Now for 48 years I've had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots <b>off</b> <b>our</b> backs, to oil the closet door hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is good for us and for the rest of the world too.
