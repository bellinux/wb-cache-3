5|$|In 1984, Carlos Rodríguez Rodríguez {{was convicted}} on bank fraud charges {{and became an}} FBI {{informant}} {{in exchange for a}} lower sentence. However, due to the EPB's policies <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> most of the information was hampered by the use of codenames and useless for the investigation. During this time, there were internal issues between Segarra and group leaders Ojeda and Avelino González, with the first being considered inefficient by the others and general concern arising from his reputation as an unfaithful husband. On January 25, 1985, the EPB detonated a bomb in an empty United States Courthouse, later noting that it was a tribute to Juan Antonio Corretjer.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{introduce}} some modifications in Tor, in order to improve user’s anonymity and relay’s security. Thus, we introduced a system that will ensure anonymity for all users, while maintaining the ability to break the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> a sender in case of misconduct. The revocation <b>of</b> the <b>anonymity</b> will require the use of secret sharing schemes, since we assume that, the lifting <b>of</b> the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the dishonest user should not depend on a single entity, but on a consensus within the network. In addition to the revocation <b>of</b> the <b>anonymity,</b> we propose in this paper further improvements such as mixing Tor traffic with those of the major internet groups, using the camouflage, or introducing a honeypot in the network...|$|R

The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter One is introductory and deals with the history <b>of</b> the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> shareholders and their identification within the Czech territory. Chapter two is concerned with the problems that resulted from enacting the Bearer Share Abolition Act. Next two Chapters concentrate on current Czech legislation regulating the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> shareholders and conditions of their identification, represented in particular by the Business Corporation Act and other relevant statues. These chapters are subdivided into several parts which thematically deal with the anonymity based on the form of shares, information publicized in the Commercial Register or the conception of a trust; it also [...] ...|$|R

We provide a description of the k-anonymous graphs, both for the regular and the non-regular case. We also introduce the more flexible concept of (k,l) -anonymous graph. Our definition of (k,l) -anonymous graph is meant to replace a previous definition of (k, l) -anonymous graph, which we here prove to have severe weaknesses. Finally we provide a set of algorithms for k-anonymization of graphs...|$|R

This evidence was only made public after both enquiries were completed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Edges {{in social}} network graphs can model {{sensitive}} relationships. In this paper, {{we consider the}} problem <b>of</b> edges <b>anonymity</b> in graphs. We propose a probabilistic notion <b>of</b> edge <b>anonymity,</b> called graph confidence, which is general enough to capture the privacy breach made by an adversary {{who is able to}} pinpoint target persons in a graph partition based on any given set of topological features of vertexes. We then focus on a special type <b>of</b> edge <b>anonymity</b> problem which uses vertex degree to partition a graph. We analyze edge disclosure in real-world social networks and show that even if graphs are anonymized to prevent vertex disclosure, they still do not guarantee edge anonymity. We present three heuristic algorithms that protect edge anonymity using edge swap or edge deletion. Our experimental results, based on three real-world social networks and several utility measures, show that these algorithms can effectively protect edge anonymity and obtain anonymous graphs of acceptable utility.

25|$|The Twelve Traditions {{encourage}} {{members to}} practice the spiritual principle <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> in the public media and members are also asked to respect each others' confidentiality. This is a group norm, however, and not legally mandated; there are no legal consequences to discourage those attending twelve-step groups from revealing information disclosed during meetings. Statutes on group therapy do not encompass those associations that lack a professional therapist or clergyman to whom confidentiality and privilege might apply. Professionals and paraprofessionals who refer patients to these groups, to avoid both civil liability and licensure problems, have been advised that they should alert their patients that, at any time, their statements made in meetings may be disclosed.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{we believe}} that {{individuals}} like to view themselves as noble by offering help. This concept {{is related to the}} notion of self-awareness. If it is true that people focus on the impression they make on others, then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other. However, being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public self-awareness. In fact, in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous. According to Dr. van Bommel, by introducing an accountability cue, the aim is to eliminate feelings <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> and increase the likelihood of them offering help.|$|E

25|$|In February 2009, Selena Roberts and David Epstein of Sports Illustrated {{reported}} that Rodriguez had {{tested positive for}} two anabolic steroids, testosterone and Primobolan, during his 2003 season playing for the Texas Rangers, the same season in which he captured his first American League Most Valuable Player award, broke 300 career home runs (hitting 47 that year), and earned one of his ten Silver Slugger Awards. The information {{had been part of}} a government-sealed report detailing 104 major league players (out of 1200 players tested) who tested positive for performance enhancers during a 2003 drug survey. Approved by the players themselves with the promise <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> the survey was conducted by Major League Baseball to see whether a mandatory drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, {{as the result of a}} collectively bargained union agreement, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive test. Because more than 5% of the samples taken from players in 2003 came back positive, mandatory testing of major league baseball players began in 2004, with penalties for violations.|$|E
25|$|Many social {{networks}} provide an online environment {{for people to}} communicate and exchange personal information for dating purposes. Intentions can vary from looking for a one time date, short-term relationships, and long-term relationships. Most of these {{social networks}}, just like online dating services, require users to give out certain pieces of information. This usually includes a user's age, gender, location, interests, and perhaps a picture. Releasing very personal information is usually discouraged for safety reasons. This allows other users to search or be searched by some sort of criteria, {{but at the same}} time people can maintain a degree <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> similar to most online dating services. Online dating sites are similar to social networks in the sense that users create profiles to meet and communicate with others, but their activities on such sites are for the sole purpose of finding a person of interest to date. Social networks do not necessarily have to be for dating; many users simply use it for keeping in touch with friends, and colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Performers {{in these}} early {{productions}} were usually uncredited or used pseudonyms to avoid legal sanction and social disapprobation. The use of pseudonyms is the norm in the industry; pornographic film actors maintained a low profile, using pseudonyms to maintain a level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> while others performed uncredited. The use of pseudonyms has remained a tradition in the industry, and actors would perform under a number of pseudonyms, depending on the genre of film, or changed a pseudonym when the previous one {{ceased to be a}} draw card. Arguably the first pornstar to become a household name was Linda Lovelace (the pseudonym, of Linda Susan Boreman) from New York City, who starred in the 1972 feature Deep Throat. It was Casey Donovan who starred in the very first mainstream pornographic hit, Boys in the Sand, in 1971, nearly a year before Deep Throat. The success of Deep Throat, which grossed millions of dollars worldwide, that encouraged the ascension of more such stars and the production of more such films. Examples include Marilyn Chambers (Behind the Green Door), Gloria Leonard (The Opening of Misty Beethoven), Georgina Spelvin (The Devil in Miss Jones), and Bambi Woods (Debbie Does Dallas).|$|E
