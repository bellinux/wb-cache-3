5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were the bony cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> another to present a predator {{with an array of}} spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to the bony cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips.|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>to</b> move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E

25|$|The tower's tilt began during {{construction}} in the 12th century, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> properly support the structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
25|$|When open, doors admit people, animals, {{ventilation}} or light. The door is used {{to control}} the physical atmosphere within a space by enclosing the air drafts, so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled. When closed, a door normally impedes the transfer of air from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other. Similar structures that do allow air to be transferred through some form of a grillwork are called gates.|$|E
25|$|To begin {{making a}} rug, one needs a {{foundation}} consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which {{run through the}} length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other are called wefts. The warps {{on either side of the}} rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.|$|E

25|$|A funnel {{water slide}} {{requires}} riders {{to sit in}} a 2 or 4 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel out into the ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. The most common type of funnel is the ProSlide Tornado which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003. In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{feature in}} some stories {{is that the}} arms {{are said to be}} {{connected}} to each other through the torso and can slide from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other. While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. When they do, the plate can be covered with a metal cap for protection. In some versions of the legends, kappa spend spring and summer in the water, {{and the rest of the}} year in the mountains as Yama-no-Kami (山の神, “mountain gods”). Although they are reported to live throughout Japan, they are often said to be particular to Saga Prefecture.|$|E
25|$|Sweep rowers (one oar per person) and scullers (two oars, {{one in each}} hand) {{have similar}} stroke styles, with some {{differences}} to accommodate the number of oars held by the rower. The most notable {{difference is that the}} oar handles overlap in sculling at the midpoint of the drive, and again during the recovery. This requires the sculler to cross one hand over (left over right) and/or {{in front of the other}} hand to avoid the oar handles colliding. While sculling is a fully symmetrical movement (with exception of the handle overlap), sweep oar rowing is slightly asymmetrical and many rowers strongly prefer <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other.|$|E

25|$|The Joseph Harris House is {{a two-story}} Prairie-style house located at 615 Washington Avenue. The house was first owned by Joseph Harris, {{owner of the}} Harris Clothing Store in Iron River, which {{operated}} from about 1910 to about 1925. The house is the purest Prairie-style structure in the county. It has a hipped roof, attic dormers, and is {{laid out in the}} American foursquare style. However, the form is altered by the massive segmental-arch front porch which extends to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> form a porte cochere. The house has stucco walls, several leaded glass windows, wide porch eaves, and heavy pier supports with applied triglyph capitals.|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} {{took place in}} 1389–90, during the delta campaign. For months, Razadarit's forces could not {{overcome}} the well fortified cities of Myaungmya and Bassein (Pathein). The Hanthawaddy command then devised a plan to lure the Bassein navy out of their entrenched position to an area downstream at Pan-Hlaing. There, the Hanthawaddy navy had planted stakes {{across the river from}} <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> another with enough space that only small war boats of Hanthawaddy could pass through. The plan was to attack the larger Bassein boats as they rammed into the stakes. The task of luring the Bassein navy fell to Lagun Ein. The king himself selected Lagun Ein to lead the mission.|$|E
25|$|The {{inscriptions}} on the stele are badly preserved. They {{fill the}} negative {{spaces in the}} scenes and run continuously from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other. The text is written in Sumerian cuneiform script. From these inscriptions, {{it is known that}} the stele was commissioned by Eannatum, an ensi or ruler of Lagash around 2460 BC. On it, he describes a conflict with Umma over a tract of agricultural land located between the two city-states. The conflict ends in a battle in which Eannatum, described as the beloved of the god Ningirsu, triumphs over Umma. After the battle, the leader of Umma swears that he will not transgress into the territory of Lagash again upon penalty of divine punishment.|$|E

25|$|At {{the death}} of his father in 1909, he became the head of the Mikhailovichi branch of the Romanov family and {{inherited}} great wealth. He received all of the lands and houses of his father: Borjomi, his large rural estate in Georgia where he enjoyed living and preferred to work; Mikhailovskoe outside St Petersburg; an enormous palace on the Neva in St Petersburg, and the great estate Grushovka in southern Ukraine. His primary residence was the palace on the Neva, which was so large that his brother Grand Duke Sergei, who lived with him, used a bicycle to go from <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the other. Between his two residences in the capital region, he employed more than 400 servants.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause tidal locking, {{an important factor in}} habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the sidereal day is as long as the orbital period, causing <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> permanently face the host star and the other side to face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its bond albedo and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.|$|E
25|$|Negative {{reactions}} to Maya Lin's design created a controversy; a compromise was reached by commissioning Frederick Hart (who had placed {{third in the}} original design competition) to produce a bronze figurative sculpture in the heroic tradition. Opponents of Lin's design had hoped to place this sculpture of three soldiers {{at the apex of}} the wall's two sides. Lin objected strenuously to this, arguing that this would make the soldiers {{the focal point of the}} memorial, and her wall a mere backdrop. A compromise was reached, and the sculpture was placed off to <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> minimize the impact of the addition on Lin's design. On October 13, 1982, the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts approved the erection of a flagpole to be grouped with sculptures.|$|E
