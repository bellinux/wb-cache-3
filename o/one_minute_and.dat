5|$|Benjamin Enzema was {{the sole}} male athlete {{representing}} Equatorial Guinea at the Rio Games at age 27. He had previously competed at the 2012 Summer Games. Enzema qualified for the Games via a wildcard as his fastest time of <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 53.35 seconds, set at the 2015 African Games, was 7.55 seconds slower than the qualifying standard for his event, the men's 800 metres. He was drawn in the third heat on 12 August, finishing eighth out of nine athletes, {{with a time of}} <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 52.14 seconds.

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were scheduled to run before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. The first session was held on a wet track from earlier morning rain and lap times reduced as the 90-minute period progressed due to the track drying out. No incidents were reported. Timo Bernhard in the No. 1 Porsche led the practice session in its final minutes with a lap time of <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 42.182 seconds, eight-tenths of a second faster than Marc Lieb in the sister entry. LMP2 was led by René Rast in G-Drive Racing's No. 26 Oreca 05 Nissan with a fastest timed lap of <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 51.617 seconds set in the session's final 15 minutes.

5|$|Bird {{elected to}} {{not to make}} a pit stop and {{maintained}} the lead at the lap-21 restart, ahead of Félix da Costa. Piquet chose to make his pit stop immediately after racing resumed. Bird pulled away from Félix da Costa who was being held up by the delayed Vergne. He chose to remain on the circuit with a strategy to conserve his car's electrical energy usage which was being followed by both Jaguar drivers. Bird made his pit stop {{at the end of the}} 25th lap and it appeared that he would rejoin the race in the lead but technical problems with his second car caused him to search for different reset proceducres, lose <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 27 seconds and rejoin the circuit one lap down in 15th position. An electrical issue was discovered on Evans' second car during his pit stop and his team elected to retire him on the same lap to prevent further damage. Frijns led the field for one lap before making his pit stop on the 26th lap. Buemi took over the first position from Frijns with di Grassi in second place and Heidfeld third. Di Grassi closed to within less than two seconds behind Buemi with ten laps of the race left with the latter reacting by extending his advantage to 2.5 seconds. Rosenqvist set the race's fastest lap on lap 36, competing a circuit of <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 2.947 seconds, which earned him one championship point.|$|E

Hideki Mutoh recorded the fourth-fastest time; Dixon was fifth and Tracy sixth. Wilson was seventh-fastest, Kannan eighth, Marco Andretti ninth and Sato completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Several drivers had high-speed spins without damaging their cars which triggered the caution flags to be displayed. A stoppage was caused when Tracy and Alex Tagilani both spun in the first turn; the former narrowly avoided a collision with Baugette who was exiting the pit lane.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Hamilton set the fastest lap {{of the day}} at <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 35.078 seconds; Rosberg was second, and Bottas third. Button was fourth-fastest, ahead of Vettel and Räikkönen. Alonso, Magnussen, Kvyat and Ricciardo followed in the top ten. Some cars went off the track; Ricciardo disrupted the session for eight minutes when an oversteer sent him into the turn-18 barrier. Kobayashi {{lost control of the}} rear end of his Caterham at turn three, damaging his rear suspension and front wing, and Vergne stopped his car on the back straight after exiting the Spoon Curve with a fuel pump problem. Esteban Gutiérrez later lost control of his Sauber entering the Spoon Curve and crashed into the tyre barrier. Vergne stopped a second time with an electrical problem after exiting turn 14, which brought out a second red flag; the session ended early, due to limited time available. Rosberg recorded the fastest lap time of the third practice session at <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 33.228 seconds, ahead of Hamilton and Alonso. Massa was fourth-fastest; Bottas was fifth and Ricciardo sixth. Magnussen was seventh, Vergne eighth, Kvyat ninth and Button completed the top ten. Hamilton drove quickly into the first turn but ran wide onto the run-off area and collided with the tyre barrier, damaging the left front quarter of his car. Although Gutiérrez lost control of his car's rear end leaving turn 15, he avoided crashing into the wall.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in dry weather conditions for most of the 90-minute period and became wet when rain fell in the closing stages which prevented any drivers from improving on their fastest times, Brendon Hartley in Porsche's No. 1 car set an early lap time of <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 39.655 seconds which remained the fastest time {{for the remainder of the}} session. He was 1.6 seconds quicker than Romain Dumas in the team's No. 2 entry, who in turn, was two-tenths of a second faster than Loïc Duval in the No. 8 Audi. A LMGTE car impacted Dumas, causing him to spin into the turn seven gravel trap, and sustained damage to his car's right-rear tyre, causing the deployment of a full course yellow flag. He was extracted from the gravel trap and drove back to the pit lane for car repairs. Jonny Kane in the No. 36 Signatech Alpine was the fastest driver in LMP2 with a time of <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 49.632 seconds set in the session's closing minutes, nearly one-tenth of a second in front of Jakes. LMGTE Pro was led by James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari 488 GTE, while Carroll's Gulf Racing car was fastest in LMGTE Am, despite driving off the track in the session's closing minutes.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Nato, Haryanto and Binder went {{three abreast}} at the Casino hairpin which saw Haryanto squeezed wide at the corner's exit by Nato and {{was unable to}} leave the turn, causing a brief usage of the VSC to allow the three cars to be extracted from the circuit by a trackside crane. Nato was able to continue but made a pit stop for repairs and was issued with a ten-second time penalty because he was judged to have caused the collision. The race resumed on the second lap with Stanaway leading Maricello and Sirotkin. Stanaway pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Leal was overtaken for fourth place by Canamasas at Sainte Dévote on the seventh lap's start and narrowly made the corner. Stanaway led the field by three seconds at the race's mid-way point while Maricello was two seconds in front of Sirotkin. Stanaway's team cautioned him about the possibility of his tyres degrading if he continued to push hard. Few overtaking manoeuvres took place as the field spread out. Rossi and Vandoorne intentionally fell back from the leaders and both drivers started to record fastest lap times in an effort of earning the accolade of one point for setting the event's fastest lap. Vandoorne temporarily claimed the award with a lap time of <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 21.926 seconds, before Nato gained the accolade on the 30th lap with a time of <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> 21.886 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} 5.7(Mw) earthquake occurred inland {{near the}} southern coast of Mexico {{at a depth of}} 24km (14.9mi), with a duration of nearly <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> <b>and</b> an epicenter about 55km (34mi) west of Ometepec, Guerrero. In the region, the Cocos, North American, and Caribbean Plates converge and create a tectonic zone of continuous seismic activity. The quake struck near the eastern periphery of the Guerrero seismic gap, which extends from Acapulco to IxtapaZihuatanejo and contains enough seismic energy to generate an earthquake of up to magnitude 7.5, but it did not cause the gap to rupture. Initial estimates from the USGS placed its intensity at a magnitude of 5.8(Mw); the National Seismological Service registered the earthquake at magnitude 5.5(ML).|$|E
