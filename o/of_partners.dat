5|$|Born {{and raised}} in the Austrian Empire, Tesla {{received}} an advanced education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help <b>of</b> <b>partners</b> to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company would eventually market.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a conceptual model <b>of</b> construction <b>partnering.</b> This model aims at exploring the relationship between two types <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> (project and strategic) by studying the key factors that affect the partnering process stages. It also helps to determine the critical success factors (CSFs) of the two types <b>of</b> <b>partnering.</b> The paper commences by reviewing the literature on project and strategic partnering to develop the conceptual model. A survey was conducted to test the model. Results indicate that there are some critical factors (i. e. top management support, mutual trust, open communication, and effective co-ordination) affecting both types <b>of</b> <b>partnering,</b> while some are specific to project (i. e. facilitator) or strategic partnering (i. e. long-term commitment, continuous improvement, learning climate, and partnering experience).

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{applicability}} <b>of</b> construction <b>partnering</b> in Mainland China, and to provide useful suggestions and possible implications for decision-makers to adopt this collaborative approach to project procurement. Design/methodology/approach – Document analysis was first employed to identify the favourable conditions and potential difficulties in the application <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> in Mainland China. A series of face-to-face semi-structured interviews targeting academic experts and industrial practitioners was undertaken to solicit {{their perceptions of the}} benefits and difficulties <b>of</b> implementing <b>partnering</b> in Mainland China, coupled with their overall assessment of the applicability of, and suggestions for, the implementation <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> in the region. Findings – The results of document analysis indicated that the cultural roots of co-operation and mutual trust, together with the increasing need to improve the current state of project performance in Mainland China, underpin the application <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> in the construction market, although its application and generalisation still encounter some significant difficulties. The perceived benefits, potential barriers and effective strategies for partnering application in Mainland China were determined from the interviewees. The interview results further supported the applicability <b>of</b> construction <b>partnering</b> and provided constructive and practical suggestions for possible implementation in the Mainland Chinese construction industry. The partnering approach is evaluated as being practicable and appropriate in this study for the construction industry in Mainland China. Research limitations/implications – Although it is essential to base the analysis <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> applicability on a qualitative study, an empirical quantitative investigation of the benefits and difficulties <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> application could further reinforce the quality of analysis. Future research could look into the project-based assessment <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> application in terms of the perceived benefits and potential difficulties of, and success factors for, partnering implementation in Mainland China. Practical implications – Policy-makers aiming for the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>partnering</b> approach could be equipped with stronger confidence from favourable cultural environment and industrial needs. Restrictions to the application <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> underlying in the current working culture could be mitigated when appropriate strategies are taken by the initiators <b>of</b> the <b>partnering</b> approach. Originality/value – Increased worldwide attention on construction partnering has shed light on the construction industry in Mainland China to achieve better value for money in project procurement and management. This paper provides valuable reference for decision-makers to consider the adoption <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> based on the qualitative analysis of the applicability <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> in the construction industry in Mainland China. Restrictions to the application <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> underlying in the current working culture could be mitigated when appropriate strategies are taken by the initiators <b>of</b> the <b>partnering</b> approach.

5|$|During the tour, Tallon had few {{opportunities}} with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 9,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included {{the likes of}} Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable with the bat. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, including one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level. As Australia often won by an innings, and often declared in the first innings, Tallon only had 13 innings in his 14 first-class fixtures and was not out two times as he ran out <b>of</b> <b>partners.</b>|$|E

Here, Boycott again faced the West Indies' feared pace attack, but succeeded in scoring centuries off the likes of Holding, Roberts, Colin Croft and Joel Garner, despite having passed the age of 40 the {{previous}} year. Other batsmen, such as David Gower found the attack difficult to cope with, and the later England captain stated that Boycott often had no sympathy. Boycott was the third most successful batsman, behind Gooch and Gower, during a tour where England went down 2–0. He scored 70 in the opening match, the only England player to pass 50.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> in the {{construction}} industry stands for a collaborative way of working. Examples <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> projects can be found on every continent. As suggested in the title this thesis makes contributions to three areas <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> research: the definition <b>of</b> <b>partnering,</b> the theory behind partnering and how to evaluate the effects of the concept. The thesis consists of six papers with the following main results. A new definition of the concept is provided with the partnering flower in the first paper. This definition model is a concrete, flexible and structured way to define partnering. It forces people to concretise and pinpoint which components they include in partnering in a specific setting. The second paper uses contract theory to understand how partnering can be justified from an efficiency perspective. Partnering can either be seen as something that neutralises opportunism when there is an incomplete contract or something that reduces transaction costs for renegotiation of complete contracts when new information arises. Paper 3 is an empirical study <b>of</b> attitudes towards <b>partnering</b> in the Swedish construction industry, which complements the preceding studies. Among the results can be mentioned that support for the definition <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> presented in paper 1 is found and that most respondents do not see partnering just as a new fad - a result that is consistent from 2004 to 2006. With the theory and the definition settled, it remains to evaluate the effects <b>of</b> <b>partnering.</b> This is done in two steps. The first step (in paper 4) is through reviewing earlier evaluations and providing suggestions on how the assessments can be improved. One of these suggestions is applied in paper 5, with a quasi-experimental evaluation <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> comparing ten partnering projects to ten similar non-partnering projects. With improved data, mainly based on site meeting minutes, and a more well-founded method, no support can be found for the strong positive outcome <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> reported in earlier evaluations. The final paper makes a contribution to economic contract theory by questioning one of the essential assumptions in this literature, the distinction between observable and verifiable characteristics. This aspect surfaced during the study <b>of</b> <b>partnering</b> contracts and contract theory. QC 2010081...|$|R

5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association <b>of</b> <b>partners</b> with God, which would be idolatry.
