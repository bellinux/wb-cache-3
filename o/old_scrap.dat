60|$|There {{comes back}} to {{me out of the}} distant past an {{impression}} of the citizen soldier at once in his collective grouping and in his impaired, his more or less war-worn state, which was to serve me for long years as the most intimate vision of him that my span of life was likely to disclose. This was a limited affair indeed, I recognise as I try to recover it, but I mention it because I was to find at the end of time that I had kept it in reserve, left it lurking deep down in my sense of things, however shyly and dimly, however confusedly even, as a term of comparison, a glimpse of something by the loss of which I should have been the poorer; such a residuary possession of the spirit, in fine, as only needed darkness to close round it a little from without in order to give forth a vague phosphorescent light. It was early, it must have been very early, in our Civil War; yet not so early but {{that a large number of}} those who had answered President Lincoln's first call for an army had had time to put in their short period (the first term was so short then, as was likewise the first number,) and reappear again in camp, one of those of their small New England state, under what seemed to me at the hour, that of a splendid autumn afternoon, the thickest mantle of heroic history. If I speak of the impression as confused I certainly justify that mark of it by my failure to be clear at this moment as to how much they were in general the worse for wear--since they can't have been exhibited to me, through their waterside settlement of tents and improvised shanties, in anything like hospital conditions. However, I cherish the rich ambiguity, and have always cherished it, for the sake alone of the general note exhaled, the thing that has most kept remembrance unbroken. I carried away from the place the impression, the one that not only was never to fade, but was to show itself susceptible of extraordinary eventual enrichment. I may not pretend now to refer it to the more particular sources it drew upon at that summer's end of 1861, or to say why my repatriated warriors were, if not somehow definitely stricken, so largely either lying in apparent helplessness or moving about in confessed languor: it suffices me that I have always thought of them as expressing themselves at almost every point in the minor key, and that this has been the reason of their interest. What I call the note therefore is the characteristic the most of the essence and the most inspiring--inspiring I mean for consideration of the admirable sincerity that we thus catch in the act: the note of the quite abysmal softness, the exemplary genius for accommodation, that forms the alternative aspect, the passive as distinguished from the active, of the fighting man whose business is in the first instance formidably to bristle. This aspect has been produced, I of course recognise, amid the horrors that the German powers had, up to a twelvemonth ago, been for years conspiring to let loose upon the world by such appalling engines and agencies as mankind had never before dreamed of; but just that is the lively interest of the fact unfolded to us now on a scale beside which, and though save indeed for a single restriction, the whole previous illustration of history turns pale. Even if I catch but in a generalising blur that exhibition of the first American levies as a measure of experience had stamped and harrowed them, the signally attaching mark that I refer to is what I most recall; so that if I didn't fear, for the connection, to appear to compare the slighter things with the so much greater, the diminished shadow with the far-spread substance, I should speak of my small <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> of truth, miserably small in contrast with the immense evidence even then to have been gathered, but in respect to which latter occasion didn't come to me, as having contained possibilities of development that I must have languished well-nigh during a lifetime to crown it with.|$|E

40|$|Títol del pre-print: Global warming {{potential}} of the circular economy of aluminium: the role of <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> recyclingFor decades, aluminium recycling was a regional concern traditionally concentrated in the regions with high aluminium demand and a well-organized aluminium recycling industry. Today, however, aluminium scrap is a global raw material commodity. This change has increased the need to analyze the flows of aluminium scrap, {{as well as to}} determine the environmental consequences from aluminium recycling. The objective of this work is to determine the environmental consequences of the <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> aluminium collection for recycling, considering the market interactions. The study focused on Spain as a representative country for Europe. We integrate material flow analysis (MFA) with consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) {{in order to determine the}} most likely destination for the <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> and the most likely corresponding process affected. Based on this analysis, it is possible to project some scenarios and to quantify the environmental impacts (generated and avoided) associated with aluminium recycling within a global market. From the MFA results, we projected that the demand for aluminium products will be met mainly with an increase in primary aluminium imports, and the excess of <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> not used in Spain will be exported in future years, mainly to Asia. Depending on the marginal source of primary aluminium considered, the greenhouse gases (GHG) emission estimates varied between - 17, 088 kg of CO 2 eq. t- 1 of <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> collected to - 10, 305 of CO 2 eq. t- 1 of <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> collected for the global or local scenario, respectively. More GHG emissions are avoided with an increase in export flows, but the export of <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> should be considered as the loss of a key resource, and in the long term, it will also affect the semifinished products industry. Mapping the flows of raw materials and waste, as well as quantifying the environmental impacts derived from recycling, has become an essential prerequisite to consistent development from a linear towards a circular economy...|$|E

40|$|The {{recycling}} of metals is {{widely viewed as}} a fruitful sustainability strategy, but little information {{is available on the}} degree to which recycling is actually taking place. This article provides an overview on the current knowledge of recycling rates for 60 metals. We propose various recycling metrics, discuss relevant aspects of recycling processes, and present current estimates on global end-of-life recycling rates (EOL-RR; i. e., the percentage of a metal in discards that is actually recycled), recycled content (RC), and <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> ratios (OSRs; i. e., the share of <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> in the total scrap flow). Because of increases in metal use over time and long metal in-use lifetimes, many RC values are low and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Because of relatively low efficiencies in the collection and processing of most discarded products, inherent limitations in recycling processes, and the fact that primary material is often relatively abundant and low-cost (which thereby keeps down the price of scrap), many EOL-RRs are very low: Only for 18 metals (silver, aluminum, gold, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, manganese, niobium, nickel, lead, palladium, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, tin, titanium, and zinc) is the EOL-RR above 50 % at present. Only for niobium, lead, and ruthenium is the RC above 50 %, although 16 metals are in the 25 % to 50 % range. Thirteen metals have an OSR greater than 50 %. These estimates may be used in considerations of whether recycling efficiencies can be improved; which metric could best encourage improved effectiveness in recycling; and an improved understanding of the dependence of recycling on economics, technology, and other factors...|$|E
40|$|Recycling, {{substitution}} {{and product}} life extension {{are identified as}} significant factors contributing to {{an extension of the}} time to exhaustion of industrially Dnportant materials. A quantitative assessment of the significance of virtually all materials to the U. K. is made. Copper is identified {{as one of the most}} important materials deserving of further investigation into potential resource savings through increased recycling. The other factors listed above are accounted for in the modelling technique employed. United Kingdom copper flows are qualitatively and statistically described for the years 1949 - 1976. Less accurate statistics are developed for 1922 - 1948. Adaptive expectations type causal models of total, unalloyed, and alloyed copper demand are successfully constructed and are used to generate future scenarios. Evidence is demonstrated for a break in the historical link between U. K. copper demand and industrial production. Simple causal models of potential copper scrap supply are constructed and a comparison made with actual <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> withdrawals. Accurate adaptive expectations type models of total scrap demand are developed, but no conclusion is reached about the price elasticity of scrap demand. Various scenarios of copper goods demand are forecast and their effect on copper scrap demand. The potential to recover up to an extra 100. 000 tonnes/year of generally lower grade <b>old</b> <b>scrap</b> is identified. Policy options are examined and the following recommendations made: 1) A total investment of up to £ 67 million in secondary refining capacity by the year 2000 is needed. 2) The copper scrap content of copper bearing goods should be specified to aid recovery. 3) A U. K. copper scrap buffer stock scheme would be advantageous for the secondary copper industry. Finally the methodology used is summarised for potential application to other materials...|$|E
