5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{is concerned with}} evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the future}} play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E
5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest floor to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> three, and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E

5|$|Domesticated {{guinea pigs}} thrive {{in groups of}} two or more; groups of sows, <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> one or more sows and a {{neutered}} boar are common combinations. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and testing of boars shows their neuroendocrine stress response is significantly lowered {{in the presence of}} a bonded female when compared to the presence of unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. Domestic guinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts, and have longer periods of activity followed by short periods of sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly over the day; aside from avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.|$|E
5|$|Final {{adjudication}} of probate found a {{total of}} eight parties <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> relatives, {{most of whom were}} descended from Moana and her four husbands, as heirs to the Kanaʻina estate splitting {{a total of}} 9 shares, with 2 shares going to one party. The probate records include {{a great deal of information}} from the four years of litigation. A great number of people petitioned the courts to claim title as heirs after the initial 1878 judgement. In the final adjudication, Bernice Pauahi Bishop received two of the nine shares. The remaining seven of the nine shares were divided equally in 1/9th and distributed to Ruth Keelikōlani, Haalilio and Haalelea (namesakes of the historic figures), Kilinahe (Whose grandmother was the older sister of Kanaina's mother and 5 other parties. The first three trustees included John Mott-Smith and Sanford B. Dole.|$|E
5|$|Research at the Asummiut {{excavation}} site {{near the airport}} has uncovered the changing settlement pattern, exhibiting transition from the single-family dwellings to tiny villages of several families. The types of dwelling varied from tent rings made of the hides of hunted mammals, to stone hearths, with no evidence of communal living in larger structures. In contrast, there is evidence for reindeer hunting as a coordinated effort of either villagers <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> more loosely related individuals, with gathering places in proximity of the hunting grounds being found. Despite recent advances in DNA research based on hair samples from the ancient Saqqaq migrants (which gives insight into their origin), {{the reason for the}} decline and subsequent disappearance of the culture are not yet known.|$|E

The Center for Community, Workforce and Economic Development offers partnerships with local businesses and industries for on-demand performance- and quality-based training. The college {{is also home}} to the Ashland Area Innovation Center, a business accelerator that aids in the development of knowledge-based industries in eastern Kentucky, and the Entrepreneur Center, a small business incubator that provides assistance for about two to three years to individuals <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> individuals who have a desire to start a business. ACTC also offers a Ready to Work, and a similar Work to Learn program that assists low-income students and parents in northeastern Kentucky. The former provides paid work experience on and off campus, counseling and advising, job references and referrals, job readiness and life skills, while the latter provides basic adult education for those attempting to receive a GED.|$|E
5|$|The superb fairywren is a {{cooperative}} breeding species, with pairs <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> 3–5 birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. The group {{consists of a}} social pair {{with one or more}} male or female helper birds that were hatched in the territory, though they may not necessarily be the offspring of the main pair. These birds assist in defending the territory and feeding and rearing the young. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover as well as engaging in mutual preening.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual {{elements}} have become {{an important part of}} the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers <b>or</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
