5|$|Art Director Roger Christian used {{scrap metal}} and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a {{technique}} he employed {{while working on}} Star Wars. For example, some of the Nostromo corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used {{to create the illusion}} of longer corridors in the below-deck area. Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|By December, {{the bottom}} {{had dropped out}} of the {{commemorative}} coin market, and dealers who had purchased quantities found themselves unable to dispose of them at a profit. By 1940 the coin sets were selling for $15 per set. They thereafter recovered, and by the early 1960s had reached $100 a set, and by 1975 $550 per set of three. At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $2,250 a set. R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2015, lists the sets at between $875 and $2,700 depending on condition. Individual coins are cataloged at about a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> prices.|$|E
5|$|Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> {{began on}} December 5, 1994, on Paramount Stage 16. The set's {{construction}} pushed the episode's cost over its budget. This was considered normal {{for a new}} series and the next four episodes also exceeded their budgets. Despite {{the high cost of}} the manor set, the crew designed it for repeated use {{over the course of the}} series. This was more appealing than shooting several sequences of a covered wagon on location in the countryside. Curry took special care to merge the blue-screen effects with Kolbe's footage seamlessly to achieve the effect of the manor transforming back into the holodeck. Curry and Kolbe had worked together on previous projects that required similar special effects.|$|E

5|$|Green Grocer (set number: 10185) was {{the third}} of the Modular Buildings series. It was {{originally}} released in 2008.

Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> features include a blue and white awning, opening doors and windows, detailed interiors to each room, a roof terrace, a fire escape, access to a courtyard behind the building, and 4 minifigures. Advanced building techniques used in Green Grocer include using black skeleton legs and hammers to make railings, using black spear guns as railings for the fire escape, using a paddle for a pendulum in a grandfather clock, and using hinges to make a bay window.|$|E

5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes {{an element of the}} group and an element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> and returns an element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
5|$|Groups share a {{fundamental}} kinship {{with the notion}} of symmetry. For example, a symmetry group encodes symmetry features of a geometrical object: the group consists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> of transformations that leave the object unchanged and the operation of combining two such transformations by performing one after the other. Lie groups are the symmetry groups used in the Standard Model of particle physics; Poincaré groups, which are also Lie groups, can express the physical symmetry underlying special relativity; and point groups are used to help understand symmetry phenomena in molecular chemistry.|$|E

5|$|Issued {{nine years}} after Harrison's death, the limited-edition release coincided with {{celebrations}} for Shankar's 90th birthday and was overseen by Harrison's widow, Olivia. Among the lavish packaging for the compilation, each disc appears inside enlarged, 8½-inch sleeves, and each copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> is individually numbered. An accompanying book contains a foreword by American composer Philip Glass, rare photographs documenting Shankar and Harrison's 35-year friendship, and commentary from both artists on the projects {{featured in the}} box set.

5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare.

Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set to look like a natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom.
