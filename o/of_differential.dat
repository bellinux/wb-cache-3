It also left advanced mathematical economics with fewer applications <b>of</b> <b>differential</b> calculus. In particular, general equilibrium theorists used general topology, convex geometry, and optimization theory more than differential calculus, because the approach <b>of</b> <b>differential</b> calculus had failed to establish {{the existence of an}} equilibrium.|$|E

5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set <b>of</b> <b>differential</b> equations, and solve them.|$|E

Revision 1.3 increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4Gbit/s with the new HBR3 mode featuring 8.1Gbit/s per lane; it requires Dual-mode with mandatory HDMI 2.0 compatibility and HDCP 2.2.

5|$|Exponentiation {{occurs in}} many areas of {{mathematics}} and its inverse function {{is often referred to as}} the logarithm. For example, the logarithm of a matrix is the (multi-valued) inverse function of the matrix exponential. Another example is the p-adic logarithm, the inverse function of the p-adic exponential. Both are defined via Taylor series analogous to the real case. In the context <b>of</b> <b>differential</b> geometry, the exponential map maps the tangent space at a point of a manifold to a neighborhood of that point. Its inverse is also called the logarithmic (or log) map.|$|E

5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set <b>of</b> <b>differential</b> equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E

Our main tool is the complete module <b>of</b> <b>differentials,</b> that is a coherent sheaf whenever the map of formal schemes is of pseudo finite type. Among our results we show that these infinitesimal properties of a map of usual schemes carry over into the completion with respect to suitable closed subsets. We characterize unramifiedness by the vanishing of the module <b>of</b> <b>differentials.</b> Also we see that a smooth morphism of noetherian formal schemes is flat and its module <b>of</b> <b>differentials</b> is locally free.
