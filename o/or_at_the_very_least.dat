Contemporary {{observers}} were surprised to note that the crewmen, despite lacking white officers, had complete control of their warships and were able to stay in good formation as they circled around the bay. The rebels favored firing over the city or around government-controlled military targets rather than outright destruction, something that Zachary Morgan believes was motivated by either humanitarian concerns <b>or</b> (<b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least)</b> pragmatism—by limiting the actual damage, they could gain support among legislators, the press, and general population.

Evans also argues that Shakespeare's impenetrable text and Hamlet's 'unplayable' strings could be meant to reflect the deep anxieties that were felt {{in an era of}} philosophical, scientific and religious disorientation.

Confederate General Kirby Smith agreed, though he was forced to detach the infantry brigades originally detailed to Price's force and send them elsewhere, thus changing Price's proposed campaign from a full-scale invasion of Missouri to a large cavalry raid. Price amassed 12,000 horsemen for his army, and fourteen pieces of artillery.|$|E

When Britain and France demanded the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Principalities, Austria supported them; and, though it did not immediately declare war on Russia, it refused to guarantee its neutrality. When, in the summer of 1854, Austria made another demand for the withdrawal of troops, Russia (fearing that Austria would enter the war) complied.|$|E

Some have attempted to refute such connections and others have embraced them. Though the name Einstein was not yet a household word in 1912, {{there has been a}} rapprochement of the concept of multiplicity described above and the concept of relativity in the Einsteinian sense. While, as Einstein writes, the physicist can generally limit herself to one system of coordinates for the description of physical reality, the Cubist (particularly Gleizes and Metzinger) attempted to show the simultaneity of several such views, <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least,</b> they were unwilling to commit themselves to a single coordinate system.|$|E
25|$|Philip II {{spent much}} of his youth as a hostage at Thebes, where he studied under the renowned general Epaminondas, whose reforms formed the basis of Philip's later tactics. The {{equipment}} of the Macedonian phalangite {{is believed to have been}} influenced by the 'peltast' developed by the Athenian general Iphicrates. The Iphicratean peltast was not a skirmisher but a form of light hoplite, characterised by using a longer spear and smaller shield. However, the introduction of the sarissa pike in conjunction with a smaller shield seem to have been innovations devised by Philip himself, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>least</b> he produced the definitive synthesis of earlier developments.
