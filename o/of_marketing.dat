40|$|Traditionally, market {{imperfections}} {{are measured}} separately. In {{dealing with the}} impacts <b>of</b> <b>market</b> imperfections on a financial theory, financial researchers often modify the theory by incorporating one type <b>of</b> <b>market</b> imperfections into the theory, one by one, and then derive a new modified formula.

30|$|The tick {{value is}} the product of tick size and {{contract}} size. Contract size is equal to the product of the base Nifty price and the number <b>of</b> <b>market</b> lots traded.

This stage of estimation observed that trading prices and the number <b>of</b> <b>market</b> lots were positively related.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{tests the}} level <b>of</b> <b>market</b> {{integration}} between Malaysia and Singapore stock markets {{with the world}} market. Kalman Filter (KF) methodology is used on the International Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) and the pricing errors estimated {{within the framework of}} ICAPM are used as a measure <b>of</b> <b>market</b> integration or segmentation. The advantage of the KF technique is that it allows for time-varying coefficients in estimating ICAPM and hence able to capture the varying degree <b>of</b> <b>market</b> integration. Empirical results show clear evidence of varying degree <b>of</b> <b>market</b> integration for both case of Malaysia and Singapore. Furthermore, the results show that the changes in the level <b>of</b> <b>market</b> integration are found to coincide with certain economic events that have taken placed. The findings certainly provide evidence on the practicability of the KF technique to estimate stock markets integration. In the comparison between Malaysia and Singapore stock market, the result shows that the trends <b>of</b> the <b>market</b> integration indices for Malaysia and Singapore look similar through time but the magnitude is notably different with the Malaysia stock market showing greater degree <b>of</b> <b>market</b> integration. Finally, significant evidence of varying degree <b>of</b> <b>market</b> integration shows the inappropriate use of OLS in estimating the level <b>of</b> <b>market</b> integration.
