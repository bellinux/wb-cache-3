5|$|The Crown was at {{the centre}} of {{government}} in late medieval Scotland. The unification of the kingdom, the spread of Anglo-Norman custom, {{the development of a}} European trading economy and Robert I's success in achieving independence from England, all did much to build up the prestige of the institution. However, its authority within the kingdom was not unchallenged, not least from the many semi-independent lordships and it endured a series of crisis, particularly frequent minorities and resulting regencies. All of this, in addition to the relative poverty of the kingdom and the lack of a system of regular taxation, helped to limit the scale of central administration and government. Much more than the English monarchy, the Scottish court remained a largely itinerant institution, with the king moving between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but also holding judicial sessions throughout the kingdom, with Edinburgh <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III at the cost of considerable unpopularity. Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish Crown in the 15th century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and patronage of the arts.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{sought to}} erect a new {{building}} to address the increasingly cramped conditions of the original Boylston Street campus located near Copley Square, in the increasingly fashionable and crowded Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. Because the stipulations of the original land grant prevented MIT from covering more than two-ninths of its current lot, Walker announced his intention to build the industrial expansion on a lot directly across from the Trinity Church fully intending that expected opposition would lead to favorable terms for selling the proposed land and funding construction elsewhere. With the financial health of the Institute <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> to recover, Walker began construction on the partially-funded expansion, fully expecting the immediacy of the project to be a persuasive tool for raising its funds. The strategy was only partially successful, as the 1883 building had laboratory facilities that were second-to-none but also lacked the outward architectural grandeur of its sister building and was generally considered an eyesore on its surroundings. Mechanical shops were {{moved out of the}} original Rogers Building in the mid-1880s to accommodate other programs, and in 1892 the Institute began construction on another Copley Square building.|$|E
5|$|From the {{introduction}} of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) funding in 1965 until the mid-2000s, Wedgemere station remained essentially static. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required transit agencies to make certain stations handicapped accessible. A number of high-ridership stations on the MBTA Commuter Rail system were upgraded, but due to its relatively low ridership — less than 600 riders per day as of 2009 — Wedgemere was not chosen as a key station for upgrades. Wedgemere had older low-level platforms, and access from the street was via stairs <b>only.</b> <b>Beginning</b> in 2008, a local family lobbied the MBTA to make the station accessible; in July 2009, the Federal Transit Administration granted the MBTA permission to build mini-high platforms. (Full-length high level platforms {{would not have been}} possible because the Lowell Line is a designated freight corridor; full-length platforms cause operational difficulties with freight trains. Wedgemere does not have room for a dedicated freight passing track like Anderson RTC.) In February 2010, the MBTA announced that $2 million in federal stimulus funds had been allotted to the project, part of a grant that also funded construction of the John W. Olver Transit Center and repairs to the Red Line tunnels between Harvard and Alewife. The work was then intended to be finished by the end of 2010.|$|E

25|$|The lower {{increases}} in the shares of the intermediate and capital goods industries reflect the lesser priority attributed {{to them by the}} import substitution industrialization strategy.

There are also three pieces labelled fugues: only the first, BuxWV 174, is a real fugue. BuxWV 175 {{is more of a}} canzona (two sections, both fugal and on the same subject), while BuxWV 176 is more like a typical Buxtehude prelude, <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> with a fugue rather than an improvisatory section, and for manuals only.|$|E
25|$|In July 2002, Venables joined Leeds United as manager.

Despite this, by December of that year the side had crashed out of both the League Cup and the UEFA Cup and were languishing in {{the bottom half of the}} table.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} 1970s onwards the country’s water {{infrastructure}} was expanded significantly {{with the construction}} of the King Talal Dam completed in 1977 and the completion of the East Ghor Canal (renamed King Abdullah Canal) in 1987. The country’s first wastewater treatment plant at Ain Ghazal had been commissioned in 1968, but the construction of other wastewater treatment plants was addressed in <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> in the late 1970s. In 1985, the largest wastewater treatment plant in the country was commissioned in As-Samra, serving Greater Amman. The plant used the stabilization pond technology, a natural technology that needed no electricity.|$|E

The Angrezi Raj (formerly the British Empire), centered in its former colonies in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, is the most powerful nation on Earth. It stands alongside other surviving world powers, including France-outre-mer (a European-settled North Africa), the Caliphate of Damascus (a united Middle East), the Empire of Dai-Nippon (a Japanese-ruled China and Far East), and the Russian Empire (a remnant of the original, now located in central Asia).|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to New York, Canada {{did not need}} to purchase islands in order to protect them from further development. An agreement between the Mississaugas and the Dominion of Canada had kept the title of many St. Lawrence River islands in the hands of Canada, and <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> in the 1880s was the agreement modified to allow for sale of the islands to private individuals. In 1904, 11 islands were officially purchased by Canada to form the basis of the St. Lawrence National Park, known today as Thousand Islands National Park. The recreational facilities that were subsequently developed on the Canadian islands were similar to those found on the American side of the river.|$|E
25|$|By zero hour, {{some of the}} attacking battalions were in {{position}} and were met by massed machine-gun fire, when they advanced after a hurried bombardment. Disorganisation hampered {{the attack on the}} left, where the 166th Brigade was replacing the 164th Brigade. One battalion hugged the barrage and reached the German wire, where it had many casualties attempting to press on. The left-hand battalion was delayed, <b>only</b> <b>beginning</b> its advance after the British barrage had lifted; it was quickly forced under cover by German small-arms fire. Later in the day, an attack by the 165th Brigade, from the positions captured on 8 August also failed. To the north, the 2nd Division attacked again with a battalion of the 6th Brigade, south of the railway line, which was repulsed and an attack from Waterlot Farm also failed. The parties from the 55th Division, which had got into Guillemont either side of the quarry on 8 August and that of the 2nd Division, which had bombed its way along ZZ Trench, into {{the north end of the}} village amid much smoke and confusion, were quickly counter-attacked by German local reserves, until two more German battalions arrived and overwhelmed them. Isolated groups held out for a while at the quarry and more held out at the station, until overrun late on 9 August, being seen from the British lines moving towards Ginchy under German escort.|$|E
