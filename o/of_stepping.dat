5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House {{to inform}} him {{personally}} {{and ask him}} to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign <b>of</b> <b>stepping</b> down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} folk {{tales of the}} Tylwyth Teg, the fairy people who {{inhabited}} the area and an invisible land in Cardigan Bay. One tells of a farmer from Aberdaron {{who was in the}} habit <b>of</b> <b>stepping</b> outside his house before retiring to bed. One night he was spoken to by a stranger, who asked why the farmer was annoyed by him. The farmer, confused, asked what the stranger meant and was told to stand with one foot on the stranger's. This he did, and could see another house, just below his own, and that all the farm's slops went down the chimney of the invisible house. The stranger asked if the farmer would move his door {{to the other side of}} the house, which the farmer subsequently did, walling up the original door; from that day, the farmer's livestock flourished, and he became one of the most prosperous men in the area.|$|E

40|$|Striatal-enriched protein {{tyrosine}} phosphatase (STEP) is a CNS-enriched protein {{implicated in}} multiple neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. STEP regulates key signaling proteins required for synaptic strengthening {{as well as}} NMDA and AMPA receptor trafficking. Both high and low levels <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> disrupt synaptic function and contribute to learning and behavioral deficits. High levels <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> are present in human postmortem samples and animal models of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia and in animal models of fragile X syndrome. Low levels <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> activity are present in additional disorders that include ischemia, Huntington’s chorea, alcohol abuse, and stress disorders. Thus the current model <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> is that optimal levels are required for optimal synaptic function. Here {{we focus on the}} role <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> in Alzheimer’s disease and the mechanisms by which STEP activity is increased in this illness. Both genetic lowering <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> levels and pharmacological inhibition <b>of</b> <b>STEP</b> activity in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease reverse the biochemical and cognitive abnormalities that are present. These findings suggest that STEP is an important point for modulation of proteins required for synaptic plasticity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Stepped spillways are {{hydraulic}} structures that, {{because of}} their significant capacity in energy dissipation, {{have been widely used}} by designers. Flow mechanism over them is complex and many investigations have been performed to study that mechanism. The effect of some parameters such as the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> in energy dissipation has not been fully investigated. In this study the latest design criteria have been reviewed and then an algorithm has been developed to design the stepped spillways which are based on the effect <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>steps.</b> Results show that the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> affects the energy dissipation. With increasing the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> energy dissipation increases and then decreases. Thus for specific discharge and spillway slope, the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> can be optimized for maximum energy dissipation. By reducing design discharge the optimum number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> increases. Research work on this subject can be continued in the future and various aspects of the design parameters may be investigate...|$|R
40|$|This study explores how the {{interior}} {{layout of the}} workspace can affect employees’ number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> and face-to-face interactions. Eighteen participants were recruited for the study and {{the data was collected}} over ten business days.

A positive relationship was found between distance and the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> and interactions. A negative correlation was found between depth, a construct of the space syntax theory, and the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> and interactions. The findings further examined whether the results support a social ecological model with the relationships between distance, depth, the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> and interaction, and moderate variables (personal, environmental, and organizational factors). Findings indicated that the number <b>of</b> <b>steps,</b> as a function of human behavior, was affected by distance and depth (as environmental factors), age and years of working (as personal factors), and work hours (as an organizational factor) ...|$|R

500|$|The Rincons and {{the nearby}} Santa Catalinas (but not the shorter Tucson Mountains) are among about 40 {{mountain}} ranges known as the Madrean Sky Islands that are of special interest to biologists. These ranges, resembling a series <b>of</b> <b>stepping</b> stones between {{the southern end of}} the Rocky Mountains—specifically the Mogollon Rim of the Colorado Plateau—in the United States and the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, are continental [...] "islands" [...] separated from one another by [...] "seas" [...] of lower-elevation valleys that impede but do not completely block species migration from one sky island to another. Ecologist Peter Warshall lists several characteristics that make the Madrean complex unique among Earth's 20 or so sky-island complexes. Among these are its north–south orientation across eight degrees of latitude spanning zones from the temperate to the subtropical; the highly varied nature of its geologic origin and of its soils, the moderate to high relief of its terrain, [...] and its safe distance from the mass extinctions related to the northern glaciers of the most recent Ice Age. Influenced by these and other conditions, the Madrean Sky Islands support unusual biodiversity.|$|E
40|$|Background. Carrying out whole tasks {{is often}} too {{difficult}} for novice learners attempting to acquire complex skills. The common solution is to split up the tasks into a number <b>of</b> smaller <b>steps.</b> The number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> must be optimised for efficient and effective learning. Aim. The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the relation between the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> provided to learners and the quality of their learning of complex skills. It is hypothesized that students receiving an optimised number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> will learn better than those receiving either the whole task in only one step or those receiving a large number <b>of</b> <b>steps.</b> Sample. Thirty-five sophomore law students studying at Dutch universities, mean age = 22. 8 years (SD = 3. 5), with 63 per cent females. Method. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three computer-delivered versions of a multimedia program on how to prepare and carry out a law plea. The versions differed only in the number <b>of</b> learning <b>steps</b> provided. Videotaped plea-performance results were determined, various related learning measures were acquired and all computer-actions were logged and analysed. Results. Participants exposed to an intermediate (i. e., optimised) number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> outperformed all others on the compulsory learning task. No differences in performance on a transfer task were found. A high number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> proved to be less efficient for carrying out the learning task. Conclusions. An intermediate number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> is the most effective, proving that the number <b>of</b> <b>steps</b> can be optimised for improving learning...|$|R

500|$|Garland and VFX {{supervisor}} Jon Thum began {{developing the}} Slo-Mo concept sequences in 2009 during filming for Never Let Me Go. They experimented with an effect {{to replicate the}} visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs to see how long {{it could be used}} before it distracted the viewer from the story or action sequence. They continued to develop and modify the effect until the end of post-production, tweaking colours, colour saturation, image framing and camera motion. Slo-Mo scenes also feature a rainbow colour scheme and sparkle highlights to create an unreal and otherworldly effect. The filmmakers experimented with blood bags, prosthetics, shooting real bullets, and compressed air to see the effect of direct body hits in slow motion. In the finished film, compressed air was used to create impact ripples on flesh. Garland said the concept was inspired by nature documentaries that used high-speed photography to capture animals in slow motion. He said, [...] "You see a whale or a shark breach the water...then you'd stop thinking about the animal and you get transfixed by...how water droplets connect and touch against each other. Somehow like a real [...] trip, sort <b>of</b> <b>stepping</b> outside it but staying attached at the same time." [...] He questioned whether the technique could be used with violence to make it purely aesthetic. He said: [...] "Can it be so abstract that it becomes genuinely beautiful? ...really aesthetically beautiful even if someone is having their cheek blown out or their head crushing into concrete." [...] Comic artist Jock provided concept art for the film design.|$|E
