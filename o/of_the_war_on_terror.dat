5|$|On September 7, 2004 the {{monument}} closed for a $15 million renovation, which included numerous security upgrades and redesign of {{the monument}} grounds by landscape architect Laurie Olin. The renovations were due partly to security concerns following the September 11 attacks and the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b> The monument reopened April 1, 2005, while the surrounding grounds remained closed until the landscape was finished later that summer.|$|E

5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, only this time {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror</b> since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of centralized government, much {{of the legal system}} and most of the educational institutions and social services fell under the control of religious institutions, which often received significant funding and support from international charities. In 2005, some of these clerical organizations united to form the Islamic Courts Union, after the secular rebel leaders began to challenge the sharia-based judicial institutions. Wary of Islamist paramilitaries in the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror,</b> the CIA funneled {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to secular rebel leaders inside Somalia in 2006, intending thereby to neutralize the threat of suspected members of Al Qaeda they believed to be sheltered by the ICU. This was cited by experts as a factor in the resurgence of Islamic militias in the country, prompting the latter to engage in pre-emptive strikes which routed the rebel leaders and led to the seizure of Ford by the ICU. The ICU gained control of Mogadishu and its surrounding districts in June 2006, after the Second Battle of Mogadishu. The ICU was later overthrown by the Ethiopian military with the support of the United Nations, African Union, and the United States government. After the ICU forces were chased from Mogadishu, the leaders of the Transitional Federal Parliament entered Somalia declaring themselves the rightful governors of Somalia. As of October 2007, there was still widespread opposition within Somalia to the TFG, and the TFG's leaders and their allies were still attempting to suppress a strong insurgency. In January 2009 politician Abdirahman Ahmed was executed for alleged apostasy by a Sharia court.|$|E

25|$|The rulings of the US Supreme Court in the Korematsu and Hirabayashi cases, {{specifically}} in its expansive interpretation of government powers in wartime, {{have yet to}} be overturned.

The coram nobis cases totally undermined the factual underpinnings of the 1944 cases, leaving the original decisions without much logical basis. As these 1944 decisions prevail, a number of legal scholars have expressed the opinion that the original Korematsu and Hirabayashi decisions have taken on renewed relevance in the context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b>|$|E
500|$|The final part {{addresses}} the actual rise of al-Qaeda. Curtis argues that, after their failed revolutions, bin Laden and Zawahiri {{had little or}} no popular support, let alone a serious complex organisation of terrorists, and were dependent on independent operatives to carry out their new call for jihad. However, the film argues that in order to prosecute bin Laden in absentia for the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings, U.S. prosecutors had to prove that he is the head of a criminal organisation responsible for the bombings. They find a former associate of bin Laden, Jamal al-Fadl, and pay him to testify that bin Laden is the head of a massive terrorist organisation called [...] "al-Qaeda". With the September 11 attacks, neoconservatives in the new Republican administration of George W. Bush use this invented concept of an organisation to justify another crusade against a new enemy, culminating in the launch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>on</b> <b>Terror.</b>|$|E
