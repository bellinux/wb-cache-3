5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the backseat of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct a study <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5|$|During {{her time}} at Missouri, McClintock {{expanded}} her research <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was {{also able to}} show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in {{the cells of the}} endosperm. Over the course of mitosis, she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome replication. In the anaphase of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the interphase of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm. This breakage–rejoining–bridge cycle was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First, it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and second, it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in cancer research today.|$|E
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns unloaded and locked, is another preventative measure. Studies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|E

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new {{priority}} setting method for identifying critical information gaps in a multisector system.

The workshop identified two critical pathways, EVHA and EVHPA, which warrant better understanding.

5|$|In 1980, {{his team}} at NIMH {{admitted}} {{a patient with}} depression who had observed seasonal changes within himself and thought previous research regarding melatonin release at night {{may be able to}} help him. Rosenthal and his colleagues treated the patient with bright lights, which helped to successfully manage the depression. They conducted a formal follow-up study to confirm the success. The results were published in 1984, officially describing SAD and pioneering light therapy as an effective treatment method. The research on SAD and light therapy is inconclusive and in some ways controversial, as not all researchers agree with Rosenthal's conclusions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of light therapy and at what time of day the light should be administered.|$|E

In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare a report on the costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> of F-22 export sales on U.S. aerospace industry.|$|E

5|$|Erin Ryan and {{her colleagues}} {{performed}} a 2009 study <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> {{of the use of}} American Sign Language (ASL) in Blue's Clues episodes. They analyzed 16 episodes over two weeks for the content and frequency of the signs used and found a high incidence of ASL usage by various characters, but that it was inconsistent, especially in the connection between English words and their corresponding signs. The purpose of signed communication and its connection with ASL and the Deaf community was not clearly explained, either. The researchers speculated that hearing children with no previous ASL exposure would be familiarized with ASL and the deaf by these episodes, thus reducing the stigma attached to deafness and hard of hearing individuals. Based on other research about the positive effects of teaching ASL to hearing children, the researchers also speculated that it could lead to an increase of vocabulary skills and IQ, as well as improve interpersonal communication. They surmised that deaf children would feel more included and less isolated and be provided with the opportunity to view positive models of ASL and deaf people.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
