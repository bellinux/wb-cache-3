5|$|A {{prominent}} {{attribute of}} Toraja language {{is the notion}} of grief. The importance of death ceremony in Toraja culture has characterised their languages to express intricate degrees <b>of</b> <b>grief</b> <b>and</b> mourning. The Toraja language contains many terms referring to sadness, longing, depression, and mental pain. Giving a clear expression of the psychological and physical effect of loss is a catharsis and sometimes lessens the pain of grief itself.|$|E

5|$|Aspects of Jackson's {{personal}} life, {{including his}} changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, {{he was accused}} of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring <b>of</b> <b>grief,</b> <b>and</b> a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication.

25|$|Tito died on 4 May 1980 of {{complications}} from surgery. While it had been {{known for some time}} that the 87-year-old president's health had been failing, his death nonetheless came as a shock to the country.

His loss marked a significant alteration, and it was reported that many Yugoslavs openly mourned his death. In the Split soccer stadium, Serbs and Croats visited the coffin among other spontaneous outpourings <b>of</b> <b>grief,</b> <b>and</b> a funeral was organized by the League of Communists.|$|E

Over {{the next three weeks}} he gunned down four of Schultz’s men. In all, around 20 men were killed in the bloodletting; the exact figure is hard to pin down as New York was also {{in the midst of the}} vicious Castellammarese War at the same time. It was mayhem on the streets of Manhattan and the police often had difficulty in deciding which corpse belonged to which war.|$|E

25|$|In his autobiography, Cushing {{implies that}} he {{attempted}} suicide {{on the night}} of his wife's death by running up and down stairs in the vain hope that it would induce a heart attack. He later stated that this had simply been a hysterical response borne out <b>of</b> <b>grief,</b> <b>and</b> that he had not purposely attempted to end his life; a poem left by Helen had implored him not to die until he had lived his life to the full, and he had resolved that to commit suicide would have meant letting her down. Although not conventionally religious, Cushing maintained a belief both in God and an afterlife. Cushing's colleagues of that period commented on his deeply Christian faith and his conviction that his separation from his wife was only temporary.|$|E
25|$|Umbridge's {{tenure at}} Hogwarts is characterised by cruelty and abusive punishments against {{students}}; she forces Harry Potter, Lee Jordan {{and other students}} to whom she gave detention to write lines using a blood quill, which cuts the same words written into its victims as they write.

Umbridge is later rescued by Dumbledore, not visibly harmed but traumatised, and is eventually removed from Hogwarts due to the wizarding community pressuring Fudge for his resignation.

25|$|Within {{six months}} of their marriage, Gustavus Adolphus left to command the siege of Riga, leaving Maria Eleonora {{in the early stages}} of her first pregnancy. She lived {{exclusively}} in the company of her German ladies-in-waiting and had difficulty in adapting herself to the Swedish people, countryside and climate. She disliked the bad roads, sombre forests and wooded houses, roofed with turf. She also pined for her husband. A year after their wedding she had a miscarriage and became seriously ill. She was tempestuous, excessive, neurotic and jealous. She was often given to harsh language, and she did not spare her husband, even when strangers were present. Her emotional life lacked balance, and everything Maria Eleonora undertook on her own initiative needed careful watching. Soon Gustavus Adolphus' intimates knew that his married life was a source <b>of</b> <b>grief</b> <b>and</b> anxiety.|$|E
