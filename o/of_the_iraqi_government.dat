25|$|Though the ISF {{lacks the}} {{sophisticated}} casualty evacuation and medical treatment available to U.S. troops, their compassion toward wounded and injured non-combatants rallied civilians {{to the side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|Recommendation 41: The United States {{must make}} it clear to the Iraqi {{government}} that the United States could carry out its plans, including planned redeployments, even if Iraq does not implement its planned changes. America's other security needs and the future of our military cannot be made hostage to the actions or inactions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|In early 2014, ISIL drove Iraqi {{government}} forces out of key cities in its Anbar campaign, which {{was followed by}} the capture of Mosul and the Sinjar massacre. The loss of control almost caused a collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> and prompted a renewal of US military action in Iraq. In Syria, ISIL has conducted ground attacks on both the Syrian Arab Army and rebel factions.|$|E
50|$|As a {{response}} to the ISIL takeover, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government,</b> in coordination with American and Iranian forces, launched an international campaign against ISIL, which includes the Anbar offensive. At <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offensive, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>Government's</b> only foothold in <b>the</b> densely-populated part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province was in Ramadi, <b>the</b> capital <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anbar Province, while ISIL militants controlled <b>the</b> outskirts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, as well as <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region.|$|R
25|$|Prime Minister José María Aznar {{actively}} supported U.S. President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair in the War on Terrorism. Aznar {{met with}} Bush {{in a private}} meeting before 2003 invasion of Iraq to discuss <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> in <b>the</b> United Nations Security Council. The Spanish newspaper El País leaked a partial transcript <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meeting. Aznar actively encouraged and supported the Bush administration's foreign policy and <b>the</b> U.S. invasion <b>of</b> Iraq in 2003, defending it on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government's</b> nuclear proliferation. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish population, including some members of Aznar's Partido Popular, were against the war.|$|R
25|$|Additional {{justifications}} used {{at various}} times included Iraqi violation <b>of</b> UN resolutions, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government's</b> repression <b>of</b> its citizens, and <b>Iraqi</b> violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1991 cease-fire.|$|R
25|$|Three {{petitions}} {{were received}} by the Mandate Commission stressing the fears of the Assyrians regarding the termination of the Mandate; they were dated in September 1931, October 20, 1931 and October 23, 1931. One was rejected by Sir Francis Humphrys {{on the grounds that}} it was submitted by a person not qualified to represent the Assyrians. Humphrys still pledged the moral responsibility of Great Britain to the future attitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
25|$|Iraqi gunmen {{dressed in}} {{military}} uniforms kidnapped the second {{secretary of the}} Iranian embassy, Jalal Sharafi, on February 4, 2007 as he drove through central Baghdad. One official <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> stated that the abduction occurred {{at the hands of}} a special army unit that reports directly to the US military command, but this was denied by American military officials. Iran's Foreign Ministry has condemned the kidnapping and pinned the blame on the US.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1970s Al-Zahawi's art {{was a true}} {{juxtaposition}} between the populist fervor of Pan-Arabism, the decolonization of Africa, and rise of a new brand of nationalism, Ba’athism, in Iraq, contrasted with the influences of Western sculptors and painters including Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso. While Al-Zahawi had resided outside of the Middle East since 1952, he did {{have the opportunity to}} exhibit in Iraq in 1974 and again in 1977 at the behest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
50|$|Amid {{frequent}} {{allegations of}} abuse and other illegal activities, in <b>the</b> fall <b>of</b> 2006 <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> decided to reform and retrain all FP units. The FP transformation yielded a police organization capable of performing criminal investigations as well as tactical operations, and included a reorganization that resulted in <b>the</b> replacement <b>of</b> two division headquarters with a federal police headquarters.|$|R
50|$|He {{actively}} {{encouraged and}} supported the Bush administration's foreign policy and <b>the</b> US invasion <b>of</b> Iraq in 2003, defending it on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> secret intelligence allegedly containing evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government's</b> nuclear proliferation. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish population, including some PP members, were against the war. Spain's major cities were <b>the</b> scene <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest street demonstrations ever seen in {{the country as a}} result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government's participation in the invasion. Aznar lost some support from those who had voted for the PP in 2000. On a live TV interview aired on the public station while demonstrations were taking place on the streets, he asked the Spanish people to take his word assuring there were {{weapons of mass destruction in}} Iraq, of which he had evidence. This is now regarded as incorrect.|$|R
50|$|Between 13 and 18 December, ISIL recaptured seven neighborhoods, {{including}} <b>the</b> {{central part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, after <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> forces retreated, {{due to a}} lack of support and ammunition.|$|R
25|$|The {{primary role}} of the Special Forces Task Group was to secure an area of western Iraq from which it was feared that SCUD {{missiles}} could be launched. The SAS successfully entered Iraq by vehicle and United States helicopters and secured their area of responsibility {{after a week of}} fighting. Following this the SAS patrolled the highways in the area in order to block the escape of members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> and to prevent enemy foreign fighters from entering the country.|$|E
25|$|In August 2013, Cameron lost {{a motion}} {{in favour of}} bombing Syrian armed forces in {{response}} to the Ghouta chemical attack, becoming the first prime minister to suffer such a foreign-policy defeat since 1782. In September 2014, MPs passed a motion in favour of British planes joining, at the request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government,</b> a bombing campaign against Islamic State (IS) targets in Iraq; the motion explicitly expressed parliament's disapproval of UK military action in Syria. Cameron promised that, before expanding UK air strikes to include IS units in Syria, he would seek parliamentary approval.|$|E
25|$|Ahmed Barzani {{was later}} {{forced to flee}} to Turkey, where he was held in {{detention}} and then sent to exile {{in the south of}} Iraq. Although initially a tribal dispute, the involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> inadvertently led to the growth of Shaykh Ahmad and Mulla Mustafa Barzani as prominent Kurdish leaders. Throughout these early conflicts, the Barzanis consistently displayed their leadership and military prowess, providing steady opposition against the fledgling Iraqi military. It is speculated that exile in the major cities exposed the Barzanis to the ideas of urban Kurdish nationalism.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>of</b> March, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> {{announced that}} they would soon launch a military operation with the Kurdish Peshmerga and other allies to regain <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Mosul, which was under ISIL control since 10 June 2014. On 10 March, U.S.-led warplanes dropped scraps of paper in Mosul, advising residents to evacuate the city and stay away from ISIL locations, because of those imminent military operations.|$|R
2500|$|Blackwater guards {{claimed that}} the convoy was ambushed and that they fired at the attackers in defense <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convoy. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> and <b>Iraqi</b> police {{investigator}} Faris Saadi Abdul stated that the killings were unprovoked. The next day, Blackwater Worldwide's license to operate in Iraq was temporarily revoked. The U.S. State Department has said that [...] "innocent life was lost", {{and according to the}} Washington Post, a military report appeared to corroborate [...] "the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government's</b> contention that Blackwater was at fault". <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> vowed to punish Blackwater. The incident sparked at least five investigations, including one from <b>the</b> Federal Bureau <b>of</b> Investigation. <b>The</b> FBI investigation found that, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17 <b>Iraqis</b> killed by <b>the</b> guards, at least 14 were shot without cause.|$|R
25|$|On <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> November 19, it was {{reported}} that clashes between security forces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> and <b>the</b> KRG forces in Tigrit left 12 Iraqi soldiers and one civilian dead, according to Doğan news agency. The clash erupted when Iraqi soldiers attempted to enter northern Iraq; peshmargas tried to prevent <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> soldiers from entering the area upon Barzani’s instructions. There was no confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event.|$|R
25|$|On 12 December 1961, the Iraqi {{government}} enacted Law No. 80, which expropriated 99.5 {{per cent}} of the IPC group’s concession areas without compensation and put an immediate stop on oil exploration. One major difference between these negotiations and those of 1952, was the stance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b> Whereas it had been more willing to accommodate the IPC in 1952, the government's positions under Qasim were largely non-negotiable. However {{this should not be}} surprising because it was expected that Qasim would take advantage of growing Arab nationalism and a sense amongst many ordinary Iraqis that they were being exploited by the west.|$|E
25|$|This {{atmosphere}} did {{not continue}} to the negotiations held between the IPC and revolutionary governments that followed {{the overthrow of the}} Hashemite monarchy in 1958. Relations between the two can be examined on two major factors. First, oil was {{a vital part of the}} Iraqi economy. Because of this, the IPC had a huge impact on the amount of revenue that the government generated and thus had a certain amount of influence over the government. The second major factor was inability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> at that time to source the technical knowledge and skill necessary to take over oil operations in the country.|$|E
25|$|The {{invasion}} was swift, {{leading to}} the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> and the military of Iraq in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had set many oil wells on fire {{in an attempt to}} disguise troop movements and to distract Coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around Basra and the Al-Faw peninsula with explosives. Coalition troops launched an air and amphibious assault on the Al-Faw peninsula during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the Royal Navy, Polish Navy, and Royal Australian Navy.|$|E
25|$|The first {{election}} for the Kurdistan National Assembly (later Iraqi Kurdistan Parliament-IKP) {{was held in}} 1992. No elections were then held for the next 13years until the 2005 elections which coincided with <b>the</b> election <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Interim <b>Government</b> and election of governorate councils. Under Article 8 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kurdistan Electoral Law, elections must be held every four years and the last election was held in September 2013.|$|R
50|$|Elections for <b>the</b> National Assembly <b>of</b> Iraq {{were held}} on January 30, 2005 in Iraq. The 275-member National Assembly was a {{parliament}} created under the Transitional Law during <b>the</b> Occupation <b>of</b> Iraq. <b>The</b> newly elected transitional Assembly {{was given a}} mandate to write the new and permanent Constitution of Iraq and exercised legislative functions until the new Constitution came into effect, and resulted in <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Transitional <b>Government.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the war, al-Bazzaz {{was chosen}} as <b>the</b> dean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baghdad Law College. In 1956 he was forced out by the {{government}} for protesting against <b>the</b> invasion <b>of</b> Egypt by France, the UK and Israel. He signed a petition that was very critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government's</b> stand during <b>the</b> Suez crisis under <b>the</b> premiership <b>of</b> Nuri as-Said, a staunch opponent of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Al-Bazzaz returned to the Baghdad Law College as the dean after the revolution in 1958. Al-Bazzaz’s interest in the pan-Arab movement again put him in disagreement with <b>the</b> new government <b>of</b> Abd al-Karim Qasim (1958-1963), an Iraqi nationalist aligned with communist forces. In 1959 Colonel ‘Abd al-Wahhab al-Shawwaf, who was <b>the</b> Commander <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mosul Garrison, instigated a rebellion. After four days of fighting, he was killed and the uprising was crushed. Following <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shawwaf uprising, al-Bazzaz was arrested and tortured. After his release, al-Bazzaz went to Egypt, where he became <b>the</b> dean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Institute <b>of</b> Arab Studies at the Arab League.|$|R
25|$|The {{parliament}} of the Kurdistan Autonomous Region {{was established}} in Erbil in 1970 after negotiations between the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Mustafa Barzani, but was effectively controlled by Saddam Hussein until the Kurdish uprising {{at the end of}} the 1991 Gulf War. The legislature ceased to function effectively in the mid-1990s when fighting broke out between the two main Kurdish factions, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK). The city was captured by the KDP in 1996 with the assistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> of Saddam Hussein. The PUK then established an alternative Kurdish government in Sulaimaniyah. KDP claimed that on March 1996 PUK asked for Iran's help to fight KDP. Considering this as a foreign attack on Iraq's soil, the KDP asked the Iraqi government for help.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, 2004, insurgents fired 40 mortar rounds {{into the}} prison, killing 24 detainees and {{injuring}} 92. Commentators thought {{the attack was}} either an attempt to incite a riot or retribution for detainees' cooperating with the United States. In May 2004, the U.S.-led coalition embarked on a prisoner-release policy to reduce numbers to fewer than 2,000. The U.S. military released nearly 1,000 detainees at the prison during the week ending August 27, 2005, at the request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b> In a May 24, 2004 address at the U.S. Army War College, President George W. Bush announced that the prison would be demolished. On June 14 Iraqi interim President Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer said he opposed this decision; on June 21 U.S. military judge Col. James Pohl ruled the prison was a crime scene {{and could not be}} demolished until investigations and trials were completed.|$|E
500|$|Abu Nidal {{had carried}} out the {{operation}} without the permission of Fatah. Abu Iyad (Arafat's deputy) and Mahmoud Abbas (later President of the Palestinian Authority), flew to Iraq to reason with Abu Nidal that hostage-taking harmed the movement. Abu Iyad told Seale that an Iraqi official at the meeting said: [...] "Why are you attacking Abu Nidal? The operation was ours! We asked him to mount it for us." [...] Abbas was furious and left the meeting with the other PLO delegates. From that point on, Seale writes, the PLO regarded Abu Nidal as under the control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

25|$|In partial {{compliance}} with requests <b>of</b> <b>the</b> petition, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> {{set up a}} further land-finding committee. It discovered but little land both cultivable and available. In fact, they found malaria-ridden, swampy lands, and recommended expenditure on an irrigation scheme to produce more. Hundreds upon hundreds of Assyrians died with malaria in those lands.|$|R
500|$|In 1993, Kemp, Bennett, Kirkpatrick and {{financial}} backer Theodore Forstmann co-founded {{the free market}} advocacy group Empower America, which later merged with Citizens for a Sound Economy to form Freedom Works. [...] Empower America represented the populist wing of the party: while avoiding divisive issues such as abortion and gay rights, it promoted free markets and growth over balancing the budget and cutting the deficit. He resigned as Co-Chairman of Freedom Works in March 2005 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) questioned his ties to Samir Vincent, a Northern Virginia oil trader implicated in the U.N. Oil-for-food scandal who pleaded guilty to four criminal charges, including illegally acting as an unregistered lobbyist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>government</b> of Saddam Hussein. Testimony about Kemp became prominent in the trial. Also, FBI informant Richard Fino tied Kemp to James Cosentino just weeks before the 1996 election.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 March, the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshiyar Zebari, urged Iran {{to release}} the {{detained}} personnel, in a telephone call to his Iranian counterpart.
