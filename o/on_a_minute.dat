[...] In 2016, Crick (All About Soap) criticised the character for arresting his fiancée on their wedding day, saying [...] "We all know Mark Brennan can be a bit strait-laced when it comes to being a copper (has there ever been a man in Ramsay Street who takes the law so seriously?), but apprehending your own bride while she's practically waiting at the alter for you...

500|$|Stereogum {{journalist}} Tom Breihan described [...] "Rocket" [...] as [...] "a squelchy, Prince-ly old-school sex-ballad" [...] {{in which}} the singer seemingly [...] "melt into the track". He stated that despite [...] "nothing remotely innovative about it... I can't {{remember the last time}} I heard a ballad of this type so completely fleshed-out and fully realized". Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! noted that songs on the album, such as Rocket", effectively display genre diversity, Beyoncé's vocal range and [...] "a penchant of musical experimentation". Although describing it as a [...] "pitch-perfect rehash" [...] of [...] "Untitled" [...] and noting that it succeeded in turning Beyoncé's [...] "sex life into topography", Fact Chris Kelly felt [...] "Rocket" [...] was unnecessary on the album. Philip Cosores of Paste stated that the song was [...] "dragging <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two too long". Janice Llamoca from the website HipHopDX called it suitable for a bonus track on Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience (2013). Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph criticized the song as a [...] cut meant for The 20/20 Experience.

500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have to be when you work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E

The rings relieved the centering from the weight imposed, and the two layers of bricks carried the concrete till it had set.|$|E
