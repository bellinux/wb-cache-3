After filming of the scene was completed, the footage was sent to be developed for the post-production process at a processing plant in Germany. The wrong chemical was accidentally used in development, damaging the film and requiring the crew to seek permission from the government to re-shoot the scenes. Permission was granted and a spokesman for the film indicated the schedule and budget had not been affected.|$|E

50|$|However, {{this may}} be a folk {{etymology}} as there were other early temples in different centres with the same name. The monk Zhidun (or Chih Tun) (314-366), who was a famous propagator of Buddhism in the southern capital is recorded as having discussions with Fenghui at the Baima si (Pai ma) monastery in Jiankang (previously Jianye), the capital of the Eastern Jin (317-420). There was also a Baima si at Xiangyang where Daoan and his disciples stayed c. 365. To further complicate the search for the origin of the name, there were peoples known as the 'White Horse Qiang' and 'Di' who lived in the 'White Horse Valley' on {{the upper reaches of the}} Min River, which flows south from the Min Mountains near the town of Zhangla (Chang-la: 32.50° N, 103.40° E) and there are still people calling themselves the 'White Horse Di' living there.

5000|$|The Neotropic {{includes}} more tropical rainforest (tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests) {{than any other}} realm, extending from southern Mexico through Central America and northern South America to southern Brazil, including the vast Amazon Rainforest. These rainforest ecoregions {{are one of the}} most important reserves of biodiversity on Earth. These rainforests are also home to a diverse array of indigenous <b>peoples,</b> <b>who</b> to varying degrees persist in their autonomous and traditional cultures and subsistence within this environment. The number <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>peoples</b> <b>who</b> are as yet relatively untouched by external influences continues to decline significantly, however, along with the near-exponential expansion of urbanization, roads, pastoralism and forest industries which encroach on their customary lands and environment. Nevertheless, amidst these declining circumstances this vast [...] "reservoir" [...] of human diversity continues to survive, albeit much depleted. In South America alone, some 350-400 indigenous languages and dialects are still living (down from an estimated 1,500 at the time of first European contact), in about 37 distinct language families and a further number of unclassified and isolate languages. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> languages and their cultures are also endangered. Accordingly, conservation in the Neotropical realm is a hot political concern, and raises many arguments about development versus indigenous versus ecological rights and access to or ownership of natural resources.|$|R
