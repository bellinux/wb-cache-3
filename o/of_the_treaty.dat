5|$|One of {{the terms}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Versailles, which had been in place {{since the end of}} World War I, stated that Germany was not allowed to {{maintain}} an air force.

5|$|The {{actions of}} Định {{in the wake}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Saigon have long been a subject of conjecture.

5|$|After {{the signing}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Saigon, the Huế court {{attempted}} to regain {{what it had}} lost militarily through diplomacy. Vietnamese negotiators sought {{a reversal of the}} territorial cession, which they regarded as the most humiliating clause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty.</b> In late 1863, the Vietnamese proposed extensive financial, economic, and political concessions in exchange for the return of the three provinces. Tự Đức sent Gian to France to seek an audience with Napoleon III. There Gian behaved in a helpless manner in an attempt to gain pity from the French monarch. Gian promised that Vietnam would pay large indemnities for the military conflicts, grant further commercial concessions and a protectorate over all six southern provinces. Napoleon initially agreed, but the decision was reversed after lobbying from French officers.|$|E

5000|$|It was contended {{on behalf}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{plaintiff}} that any amendment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaties</b> establishing <b>the</b> Communities made after 1 January 1973, when Ireland joined those Communities {{would require a}} further amendment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution.

5|$|Coutances {{returned}} to Normandy, and in December 1195 attempted to secure {{compensation for the}} losses his archdiocese had sustained in the warfare between King Richard and King Phillip. He sought compensation from both kings but obtained no satisfaction, and felt so ill-treated by the kings that he abandoned his see. The English and the French kings had required clergymen to guarantee the January 1196 Treaty of Louviers that the two kings arranged for themselves, with Richard nominating Coutances as his surety, or guarantor that the conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty</b> would be fulfilled. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>treaty</b> laid out that if the archbishop laid an interdict or excommunicated anyone in the lands of King Philip or any subject of King Richard in the archdiocese of Rouen, then the archiepiscopal manor of Andeli should be forfeit to either king until after a special tribunal had determined if the archbishop's punishment was valid.|$|E

5|$|Early in the 20th century, New Zealand was {{involved}} in world affairs, fighting in the First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression. The depression led to {{the election of the}} First Labour Government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy. New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following the Second World War and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work. A Māori protest movement developed, which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Waitangi. In 1975, a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty,</b> and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985.

5|$|Japan was a {{signatory}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> of Versailles, which stipulated harsh repercussions for Germany.

Article 156 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Treaty</b> also transferred German concessions in Shandong to Japan rather than returning sovereign authority to China, an issue soon {{to be known as}} Shandong Problem. Chinese outrage over this provision led to demonstrations, and a cultural movement known as the May Fourth Movement influenced China not to sign the treaty. China declared the end of its war against Germany in September 1919 and signed a separate treaty with Germany in 1921. This fact greatly contributed to Germany relying on China, and not Japan, as its strategic partner in East Asia for the coming years.|$|E
