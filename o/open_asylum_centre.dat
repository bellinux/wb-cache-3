40|$|Abstract Background The {{length of}} stay in <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> is {{generally}} mentioned as a possible health risk to asylum seekers. Medical staff working with asylum seekers has claimed that long lengths of stay in <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> might cause or aggravate mental disorders. We used records from a large, multiethnic group of asylum seekers to study if the incidence of mental disorders increased with {{length of stay}}. Methods The study population was asylum seekers in Danish <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> run by the Danish Red Cross. General medical care was provided by Red Cross staff who could refer selected cases to medical specialists. If an asylum seeker needed more than three specialist consultations for mental illness or five consultations for physical illness the referrals had {{to be approved by}} The Danish Immigration Service. Between July 2001 – December 2002 the Red Cross prospectively registered health related data on all new applications (n = 4516) to the Immigration Service regarding referrals to medical specialists. We used these records to analyse the association between length of stay in the <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> and overall rate of referral for mental disorders. Data was analysed using weighted linear regression. Results We found that referrals for mental disorders increased with length of stay in <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> in a large, multiethnic population of asylum seekers. The association was found in all the categories of psychiatric illness studied and for a majority of the nationality groups studied. Conclusion Length of stay in <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> was associated with an increase in referrals for mental disorders in a large, multiethnic group of asylum seekers. The present study supports the view that prolonged length of stay in an <b>asylum</b> <b>centre</b> is a risk factor for mental health. The risk of psychiatric illness among asylum seekers should be addressed by political and humanitarian means, giving prevention of illness the highest priority. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{researched}} {{the form of}} <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> in the Netherlands from an urban design {{point of view and}} proposes a redesign of one of these centres. It provides a sophisticated overview of the functioning of current <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> and the influence of the form on the asylum seekers living there. A redesign of the <b>asylum</b> <b>centre</b> in Utrecht focuses on humanising the place by incorporating asylum seekers' desparate needs to become rooted again. A series of small interventions that redirect the private and collective spaces of the asylum towards public space makes this place into a 'place of becoming'.

25|$|On August 13, {{three days}} after the attack, the police were forced to break up an illegal {{demonstration}} outside the <b>asylum</b> <b>centre</b> where the two men linked to the murders had lived. A group of about ten men carrying symbols of an extreme-right wing youth organization held anti-immigration placards, shouted anti-Arab slogans and threw eggs at the building. Two days later, the <b>asylum</b> <b>centre</b> closed down after police found two bags of flammable liquid nearby.|$|R
50|$|In October 2016 Danish {{immigration}} minister Inger Støjberg authorities reported 50 {{cases of}} suspected radicalised asylum seekers at <b>asylum</b> <b>centres.</b> The reports encompassed everything from adult Islamic State sympathisers celebrating terror attacks to violent children who dress up as IS fighters decapitating teddy bears. Støjberg expressed her consternation at asylum seekers ostensibly fleeing war yet simultaneously supporting violence. <b>Asylum</b> <b>centres</b> having detected radicalisation routinely report their findings to police. The 50 incidents were reported between 17 November 2015 until 14 September 2016.|$|R

40|$|This article {{contributes}} to the critical literature on child participation discussing the positionings of young asylum seekers (aged 12 – 23) residing in a Dutch <b>asylum</b> <b>centre.</b> It queries participation as an institutional measure, outlining the informants’ perspectives {{on the creation of}} a youth council within the confines of an <b>asylum</b> <b>centre.</b> Contradictions and tensions in the wider societal context, in the <b>asylum</b> <b>centre,</b> and in the functioning of the youth council are identified. They demonstrate the gulf between theory and practice in the fulfilment of children's participation rights. The authors scrutinize concepts such as ‘methodological immaturity’, ‘voice’, and ‘recognition’ and argue for the integration of the perceptions and practices of young asylum seekers through dialogue. This can assist in creating an atmosphere conducive to an ethically responsible and meaningful collaboration with young asylum seekers and adapted policy interventions to enhance participation against an on-going backdrop of insecurity, exclusion, and forced inactivity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This is a paper studying, the {{negotiations}} and expectations, appearin through {{the exchange of}} ‘pocket money’, between the Danish state and the asylum seekers in Avnstrup <b>asylum</b> <b>Centre.</b> The paper presents, the practices that surround the ‘pocket money’ in Avnstrup <b>Asylum</b> <b>Centre</b> and how there are perceive. Furthermore it reflects upon the ‘pocket money’ {{as a tool of}} identification Finally it explores the reasons and rationalities for the states funding of the asylum seekers. The analysis is based on observations in Avnstrup <b>Asylum</b> <b>Centre</b> during the ‘pocket money’ day, and interviews with three asylum seekers, who collects their money in Avnstrup. The paper consider three theoretical perspectives as important tools to understand {{the negotiations}} and expectation appearing between the Danish state and the asylum seekers through the exchange of pocket money. The theoretical perspectives are respectively; Marcel Mauss and his theoretical framework on gift exchange in archaic societies, Michel Foucault’s ideas of ‘Governmentality’, and Erving Goffman’s conceptualizing of ‘the self’ The main conclusions found in the paper are that the inmates of Avnstrup are negotiating the states disciplining through the exchange of ‘pocket money’. The purpose of the ‘pocket money’ can be understood both as a space for establishing a ‘self’ and as a disciplining technique...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a study of}} three asylum-seeking men from Iran and Afghanistan. It aimed to explore how and if they experienced occupations as occupations in a Danish <b>asylum</b> <b>centre</b> and how their life experience shaped their choice and value of current occupations. In-depth narrative interviews explored the participants’ occupational history and its influence on their occupations in the <b>asylum</b> <b>centre.</b> A thematic analysis showed that the participants had been subjected to occupational disruption and deprivation by politically oppressive systems even before their flight. Their occupations in Denmark were {{to a certain extent}} influenced by their earlier occupations and the current occupational deprivation they all experienced was due to limited possibilities in the centre. Although they tried their best to fill their days and create structure, there was a loss of valued occupations and a profound sense of occupational deprivation. One of the participants had been subjected to torture and he experienced occupational deprivation to a greater extent. The findings suggest that further research should include exposure to torture as a key component when examining the occupational deprivation of asylum seekers...|$|R

50|$|By midday of 19 September, {{the country}} had {{registered}} around 1500 migrants, {{with all of them}} being accommodated in temporary reception camps or <b>asylum</b> <b>centres.</b> The largest traffic was seen at Obrežje border crossing, Dobova border crossing and Brežice. Prime Minister Miro Cerar visited the reception centre in Brežice on Saturday, stressing that Slovenia had the situation under control, while criticising the Croatian government for being uncooperative.There were also various humanitarian and non-governmental organisations aiding the migrants on the border, coming mostly from Slovenia, Croatia and Austria.|$|R
50|$|The {{contacts}} with the police had been initiated by Klassekampen journalist Finn Sjue, and Krømcke later confirmed {{in an interview with}} the same newspaper that he had joined the FMI with the single purpose of working against the organisation.

40|$|I {{tried to}} {{investigate}} the causes of conflicts that originated in a multicultural environment of <b>asylum</b> <b>centres</b> in the Czech Republic and I intended to find solutions that would prevent conflicts in the future. With the help of questionnaires and talking to and observing asylum seekers and social workers, I observed that the perception of conflicts and especially {{the perception of the}} motives for conflicts differ among participants. It is important to face each conflict as a unique situation and to consider the background of asylum seekers as well while solving tense situation. Some of the asylum seekers suggested solutions in their questionnaires that deserve further consideration. First, the refugees desire more interest and intervention of social workers in disputes among asylum seekers. Further, they would welcome informal meetings with opportunities to discuss the problems arising in asylum camps. It would also be an occasion to get to know other asylum seekers living in the same asylum camp. The survey further showed that the asylum seekers were disappointed with the poor language offerings at <b>asylum</b> <b>centres.</b> They would appreciate more opportunities to learn Czech and English to communicate with other refugees who speak different languages.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} asylum seekers' satisfaction with daily occupations and activity level while in a Danish <b>asylum</b> <b>centre,</b> and whether this changed over time. Another aim was to describe whether exposure to torture, self-rated health measures, and ADL ability were related to their satisfaction with daily occupations and activity level. Methods: A total of 43 asylum seekers at baseline and 17 at follow-up were included. The questionnaires Satisfaction with Daily Occupations, Major Depression Inventory, WHO- 5 Wellbeing, Pain Detect, a questionnaire covering torture, and basic social information were used as well as Assessment of Motor and Process Skills. Results: The results showed a low level of satisfaction with daily occupations at both baseline and follow-up. There was no statistically significant change in satisfaction or activity level between baseline and the follow-up. Associations between AMPS process skills -education, worst pain and activity level -were present at baseline, as was a relationship between AMPS process skills and satisfaction. At follow-up, associations between WHO- 5 and satisfaction and activity level and between MDI scores and activity level were found. Conclusion: Asylum seekers experience a low level of satisfaction with daily occupations, both at arrival and after 10 months in an <b>asylum</b> <b>centre.</b> There is a need for further research and development of occupation-focused rehabilitation methods for the asylum seeker population...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the change}} of {{ownership}} of Caythorpe Court {{at the end of}} 2002 there was conjecture that the property would be used as a permanent <b>asylum</b> <b>centre.</b> In December 2002 the Caythorpe Action Group was formed to fight the proposal and represent local concerns which were shared by the local Member of Parliament, Douglas Hogg, who advised the company that their planning application would be opposed by local people and suggesting that the firm should look elsewhere for a more appropriate site. Caythorpe Court was one of several properties which were being considered by the Home Office as suitable to house asylum seekers.|$|R
50|$|Myrdal {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the anti-immigration {{organisation}} Folkebevegelsen mot innvandring (FMI) in 1987, and went on to become well known for his activism and violent clashes in the late 1980s to early 1990s, initially as the leader of the organisation. In 1990, he was convicted to one year in prison for planning to bomb an <b>asylum</b> <b>centre.</b> He broke out of the FMI in 1991 to form his own more militant organisation, Norge mot innvandring (NMI).

40|$|This {{project has}} {{its focus on}} {{children}} (0 - 18) seeking asylum in Denmark. On {{the basis of the}} children’s own perspectives the study sheds light on what it entails to grow up in a Danish <b>asylum</b> <b>centre.</b> More specific the main purpose is to examine how children’s mental health is influenced when growing up in such a context. In the endeavours to get an understanding of this we ask what resources the children have at their disposal when trying to manage the challenges that they face as asylum seekers. Additionally we ask how the children can be said to experience a sense of coherence. These two questions are discussed in relation to the main purpose mentioned above. Our research is based on qualitative material {{in the form of an}} interview, two animated films and a mail correspondence, which takes its point of departure in a completed interview guide. To interpret this empirical knowledge the theorists Aaron Antonovsky and Pierre Bourdieu are included as the theoretical frame. The study finds that growing up in a Danish <b>asylum</b> <b>centre</b> can have a negative influence on the children’s mental health. This can be due to a lack of resources and due to the children not experiencing a sense of coherence. However it is important to keep in mind that the children at the same time can be said to have significant resources at their disposal. Resources, which might help the children, cope with their situation...|$|R
