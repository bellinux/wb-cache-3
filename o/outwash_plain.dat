50|$|The Upper Shiawassee River is {{bordered by}} {{alternating}} east-west trending moraines, glacial till, and <b>outwash</b> <b>plains.</b> The moraines and <b>outwash</b> <b>plains</b> contain {{sand and gravel}} deposits that are more permeable than the fine-grained glacial till and lake clays found in the downstream. The upper half of the watershed has variable (high) relief and is generally well-drained with numerous shallow aquifers that contribute groundwater flow to {{the headwaters of the}} Shiawassee River.|$|R
50|$|The Swan Coastal PlainThis {{is arguably}} the most damaged {{ecosystem}} in the state. This is a low-lying coastal plain, mainly covered with Tuart-Banksia woodlands. It is dominated by Banksia or Tuart on sandy soils, Allocasuarina obesa on <b>outwash</b> <b>plains,</b> and paperbark in numerous former swampy areas. In the east, the plain rises to duricrusted Mesozoic sediments dominated by Jarrah woodland. Three phases of marine sand dune development provide relief. The <b>outwash</b> <b>plains,</b> once dominated by Allocasuarina obesa-marri woodlands and Melaleuca shrublands, are extensive only {{in the southern part of}} the region.|$|R
40|$|Glaciofluvial landforms are {{frequent}} in the Liard Basin, an intermontane plain {{in the northern}} Yellowstone to Yukon (Y 2 Y) region straddling 60 º N in southeast Yukon-northeast British Columbia. They cover little area but are nevertheless critical components of the linear infrastructure of regional biodiversity, part of the surficial geological template that underlies patterns of rare plant species and community occurrence as well as patterns of movement and use by vertebrates. Two common glaciofluvial landforms are eskers and <b>outwash</b> <b>plains.</b> Eskers are linear and often wavy ridges of rapidly drained sand, gravel, and cobbles deposited by fast streams that flowed under the glacial ice. <b>Outwash</b> <b>plains</b> are broad, tabular landforms of similar materials deposited beyond rapidly melting glacier fronts. On occasion, <b>outwash</b> <b>plains</b> are pitted by kettle holes, depressions formed by melting remnant ice. In the largely forested landscapes of the Liard Basin, glaciofluvial deposits form among the driest habitats, often are lightly timbered or non-forested, and are good sites for regionally rare or uncommon plant species and communities. They are als...|$|R

In 2015, Monte Verde I was re-dated to around 18,500 to 14,500 BP. Charcoal remains, charred animal bone fragments and several lithic artefacts, about 34% of which was derived from non-local sources, were discovered.|$|E
25|$|In {{northwest}} Indiana {{there are}} various sand ridges and dunes, some reaching nearly 200 feet in height. These are located along the Lake Michigan shoreline and also inland to the Kankakee <b>Outwash</b> <b>Plain.</b> Southern Indiana is characterized by valleys and rugged, hilly terrain, contrasting from much of the state. Here, bedrock is exposed at the surface and isn't buried in glacial till like further north. Because of the prevalent Indiana limestone, there are numerous caves, caverns, and quarries in the area.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the region}} around the Kishwaukee was shaped by glaciation. Glaciers left moraines, {{subglacial}} channels, terraces, outwash fans, valley train deposits and bedrock highs throughout the watershed. End moraines mark the western boundary of the Wisconsinian glaciation. Several natural areas and a quarry also highlight the geology of the watershed. The Flora Prairie Nature Preserve in Boone County has dolomite outcroppings and the Harvard West Geologic Area in McHenry County has an example of pitted <b>outwash</b> <b>plain.</b> The Harvard East Geologic Area has {{an example of a}} moraine protruding down a valley.|$|E

25|$|Nantucket {{was formed}} by the {{outermost}} reach of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the recent Wisconsin Glaciation, shaped by the subsequent rise in sea level. The low ridge across the northern section of the island was deposited as glacial moraine {{during a period of}} glacial standstill, a period during which till continued to arrive and was deposited as the glacier melted at a stationary front. The southern part of the island is an <b>outwash</b> <b>plain,</b> sloping away from the arc of the moraine and shaped at its margins by the sorting actions and transport of longshore drift. Nantucket became an island when rising sea levels covered the connection with the mainland, about 5,000–6,000 years ago.|$|E
500|$|While {{living in}} South Bend, Lyon became close friends with Reverend Julius A. Nieuwland, CSC, a {{botanist}} and chemist at the University of Notre Dame. [...] They went on field trips and collected plant specimens [...] that {{were incorporated into}} Lyon's second herbarium, which he made {{in his spare time}} {{with the help of his}} wife, Nieuwland, and Austrian botanist Theodor Just. [...] Lyon was known for his love of nature, and in an obituary written by Just, he was noted as being an [...] "ardent conservationist" [...] later in his life. [...] Lyon criticized poorly managed conservation programs in his paper [...] "Conservation from the Naturalist's Point of View" [...] (1939), and in his final paper, [...] "The Kankakee Area—Its Past and Present", he envisioned life around the Kankakee <b>Outwash</b> <b>Plain</b> before human activities had changed it. [...] Lyon also gave up his cottage in the Indiana Dunes after the wildlife refuge was converted into a vacation destination.|$|E
2500|$|Long Island, {{as part of}} the Outer Lands region, {{is formed}} largely of two spines of glacial moraine, with a large, sandy <b>outwash</b> <b>plain</b> beyond. These moraines consist of gravel and loose rock left behind during the two most recent pulses of Wisconsin {{glaciation}} during the Ice Ages some 21,000 years ago (19,000 BC). The northern moraine, which directly abuts the North Shore of Long Island at points, is known as the Harbor Hill moraine. The more southerly moraine, known as the Ronkonkoma moraine, forms the [...] "backbone" [...] of Long Island; it runs primarily through the very center of Long Island, roughly coinciding with the length of the Long Island Expressway.|$|E

It still retains remnants of the moraine as low hills, but the southern half of the island consists of <b>outwash</b> <b>plains</b> (sandur) characterized by coastal heathland, a globally restricted and endangered plant community.|$|R
2500|$|The Taku Glacier {{provides}} {{a good example of}} this cycle. [...] It was at its maximum extent near 1750. [...] At this point it had closed off Taku Inlet. Subsequently, calving retreat commenced. By the time John Muir saw the glacier in 1890, it was near its minimum extent, at a location where the fjord narrowed, with deep water in front. About 1900, [...] its AAR of 90 led to the Taku Glacier onset of advance, {{at the same time that}} the remaining Juneau Icefield glaciers continued receding. [...] This advance continued at a rate of 88m⋅a−1, advancing5.3km from the 1900 minimum until 1948, all the while building and then riding up on a substantial <b>outwash</b> <b>plain</b> beneath its calving face. [...] After 1948, the now non-calving Taku Glacier, possessed an AAR only slightly reduced (86 and 63). This drove 1.5km of further advance at a reduced rate of 37m⋅a−1. [...] In 1990, the Taku Glacier’s AAR was 82 high enough, to prompt Pelto and Miller to conclude that the Taku Glacier would continue to advance for the remaining decade of the 20th century. From 1986 to 2005, the equilibrium line altitude on the glacier rose without a significant terminus shift causing the AAR to decline to about 72. [...] Pelto and Miller concluded that the current reduction in rate of advance is since 1970 is attributable to the laterally expanding terminal lobe as opposed to declining mass balance and that the primary force behind the Taku Glacier’s advance since about 1900 is due to positive mass balance. [...] The recent lack of positive mass balance will eventually slow the retreat if it persists.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 A {{study of}} the McKenzie River floodplains, {{terraces}} and glacial <b>outwash</b> <b>plains</b> was undertaken to classify and describe the vegetation and soils of a previously little studied synecological unit. During the summer of 1971, 54 analytic vegetation and soil plots (stands) were studied. Cover and frequency of all trees, shrubs, herbs and mosses were recorded {{as well as a}} soil description for each stand. Using Braun-Blanquet manual-visual association tables and computerized SIMORD analysis, four communities were identified. Further analysis of the four communities revealed two sequences of seral associes leading to the development of two basic habitat types: one a climatic climax and the other a topo-edaphic climax association. Succession on floodplains, terraces, and glacial <b>outwash</b> <b>plains</b> appears initially to follow a change from coarse, shallow soils to fine, deep soils. The climatic climax (Tsuga heterophylla/Acer circinatum/ Polystichum munitum- Oxalis oregana association) then develops on floodplains and terraces with deep, fine textured soils. The topoedaphic climax (Tsuga heterophylla/Berberis nervosa-Gaultheria shallon/Linnaea borealis association develops on terraces and glacial <b>outwash</b> <b>plains</b> with shallow, coarse textured soils that have large amounts of stones and cobbles in all horizons of the soil profile. Further modifications of sites by fire and flooding also create different plant communities which add to the total diversity of forest vegetation occurring on alluvial deposits of the McKenzie River, Oregon...|$|R
50|$|The Kankakee <b>Outwash</b> <b>Plain</b> is a flat plain {{interspersed}} with sand dunes in the Kankakee River valley in northwestern Indiana and northeastern Illinois of the United States. It is {{just south of}} the Valparaiso Moraine and was formed during the Wisconsin Glaciation. As the glacier, stopped at the Valparaiso Moraine, melted, the meltwater was carried away to the <b>outwash</b> <b>plain.</b> On {{the south side of the}} moraine, where the elevation drops, the meltwaters eroded away valleys, carrying sand and mud with them. As the muddy meltwater reached the valley where the slope lessened, the water slowed down, depositing the sand on the <b>outwash</b> <b>plain.</b> This created a smooth, flat, and sandy plain. Before its draining, the Kankakee Marsh, located on the <b>outwash</b> <b>plain,</b> was one of the largest freshwater marshes in the United States.|$|E
