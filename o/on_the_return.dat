40|$|This article {{examines}} the effect of family background <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> to schooling in Korea. In doing so, sample selection bias is controlled, as the probability of being employed {{is affected by the}} schooling of family members. The results of this study are different from previous studies, which did not consider sample selection bias. While the effect of family background <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> to schooling was obvious in previous studies, it is weakened with the control of sample selection bias. This phenomenon is particularly strong for the wife. Moreover, controlling sample selection bias increases the downward bias due to measurement error. Thus it is concluded from these findings that sample selection bias should be controlled to accurately estimate the effect of family background <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>returns</b> to schooling. ...|$|R

5|$|Admiral Graf Spee {{spent the}} first three months of her career {{conducting}} extensive sea trials to ready the ship for service. The ship's first commander was Kapitän zur See (KzS) Conrad Patzig; he was replaced in 1937 by KzS Walter Warzecha. After joining the fleet, Admiral Graf Spee became the flagship of the German Navy. In the summer of 1936, following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she deployed to the Atlantic to participate in non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. Between August 1936 and May 1937, the ship conducted three patrols off Spain. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>return</b> voyage from Spain, Admiral Graf Spee stopped in Great Britain to represent Germany in the Coronation Review at Spithead for King George VI on 20 May.|$|E

The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four König-class battleships remained in the III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including König Albert, were transferred to IV Squadron.

During October, Kaiser Wilhelm II conducted individual training and, in November, joined the rest of the I Squadron for a cruise in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December.
