25|$|After {{the fall}} of Doriath the Men of Brethil were nearly {{completely}} wiped out, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> had disappeared as a separate people. The last of them, including some Drúedain, escaped to the Mouths of Sirion and later to the Isle of Balar. After the ruin of Beleriand they either journeyed to Númenor or fled back to Eriador. Among the Númenóreans (in majority descendants of the Folk of Hador) communities of Bëorians and of Drúedain {{are known to have}} existed, but the descendants of the Men of Brethil are not mentioned.|$|E
25|$|The {{second group}} {{proposed}} {{that there were}} three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans {{did not intend to}} domesticate animals from, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified. Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they take place over much longer time frames.|$|E

25|$|The {{beginnings}} of animal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process with multiple stages along different pathways. It is proposed {{that there were}} three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The dog was the first domesticant, and was established across Eurasia {{before the end of}} the Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals. Humans did not intend to domesticate animals from, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified, leading eventually to a formalised animal husbandry. Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest that they took place over much longer time frames.|$|E
2500|$|The Sunflower, the [...] "hot" [...] Youth and the emotionally [...] "frozen" [...] Virgin, might, then, (assuming {{a reading}} {{contrary}} to the one of Bloom, Johnson and others), be finally free to love in Heaven or Eden. <b>Or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> <b>they</b> might be finally free of the shackles of natural law that afflict the world- and time-weary Sunflower and the Moral Law that afflicts the humans. (See: moral absolutism and religion). Blake regarded natural desire as [...] "vegetated", like the Sunflower - the word [...] "vegetated" [...] being used by Blake [...] "in other contexts to mean [...] "bound by natural law"". Such a reading would refer to Blake's possible notions of free love, breaking earthbound (both natural and societal) conventions (see: William Blake#Sexuality), and/or refer to ideas of generative, divine sex.|$|E
2500|$|The clinician-historian Joel Braslow {{argues that}} from malarial therapy onward to lobotomy, {{physical}} psychiatric therapies [...] "spiral {{closer and closer}} to the interior of the brain" [...] with this organ increasingly taking [...] "center stage as a source of disease and site of cure." [...] For Roy Porter, once the doyen of medical history, the often violent and invasive psychiatric interventions developed during the 1930s and 1940s are indicative of both the well-intentioned desire of psychiatrists to find some medical means of alleviating the suffering of the vast number of patients then in psychiatric hospitals and also the relative lack of social power of those same patients to resist the increasingly radical and even reckless interventions of asylum doctors. Many doctors, patients and family members of the period believed that despite potentially catastrophic consequences, the results of lobotomy were seemingly positive in many instances <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>they</b> were deemed as such when measured next to the apparent alternative of long-term institutionalisation. Lobotomy has always been controversial, but for a period of the medical mainstream, it was even feted and regarded as a legitimate if desperate remedy for categories of patients who were otherwise regarded as hopeless. Today, lobotomy has become a disparaged procedure, a byword for medical barbarism and an exemplary instance of the medical trampling of patients' rights.|$|E

50|$|At {{other times}} however, the {{argument}} invokes a moral ideal holding desert valuable {{for its own}} sake.
