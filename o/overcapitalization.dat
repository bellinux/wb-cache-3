It provides rich protein food, employment, income thus contribute to their livelihood. The fishery also contributes significantly to foreign earnings and revenue. Small-scale fisheries {{is by far the most}} important sector in coastal communities as it employs more than 177, 527 full time fishers and over 4 million people who were engaged in various fisheries related activities. Consequently, the demand for fishery resources for export and local consumption (food security) is growing, leading to further pressure on finfish and high value invertebrate fish resources, with the open access nature of the fishery and subject to little management control, resulted into increasingly problems of overexploitation and <b>overcapitalizations</b> which calls for management measures to rescue the situation. In most fishery, the great challenge of fisheries management is to choose the best management regime and strategies to achieve the objectives of managing fishery resources. Human and financial resources must be obtained in order to manage the resources in a sustainable manner. In the absence of human resources fishing communities can be used in fisheries-dependent monitoring because reliable and accurate information is crucial as only well informed decision makers can make good decisions in managing the fishery resources.

5000|$|Today, {{much of the}} world's major {{fisheries}} are overexploited; in 2002, the WWF estimate this {{at approximately}} 75%. Fishing subsidies include [...] "direct assistant to fishers; loan support programs; tax preferences and insurance support; capital and infrastructure programs; marketing and price support programs; and fisheries management, research, and conservation programs." [...] They promote the expansion of fishing fleets, the supply of larger and longer nets, larger yields and indiscriminate catch, as well as mitigating risks which encourages further investment into large-scale operations to the disfavour of the already struggling small-scale industry. Collectively, these result in the continued <b>overcapitalization</b> and overfishing of marine fisheries.|$|E
50|$|Efforts by the Mexican {{government}} to create conservation zones and nature reserves have been hampered {{by lack of}} enforcement resources, {{as well as a}} lack of a political consensus on this issue of conservation of the Gulf. This occurs even though significant areas are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The thousands of miles of coastline are remote and difficult to police, and the politically powerful commercial fishing industry has been slow to embrace even economically viable conservation measures, much less strict measures of conservation. Conservation of the Gulf's fisheries and coastlines is also complicated by a long history of <b>overcapitalization</b> in the sector, and the direct, often negative, impacts that conservation measures have on the livelihoods of Mexico's coastal inhabitants. At present, the Mexican government and business interests have promoted a macro-level, tourist development vision for the Gulf, the impacts of which on local ecology and society are uncertain.|$|E
50|$|Jeffry A. Frieden {{notes that}} {{during the period of}} European {{colonialism}} the colonial powers encouraged investment in production of raw materials while discouraging investment in industries that would use these materials as inputs in competition with the colonial power's home industries. During the same period, independent developing countries in Latin America and other areas pursued a policy of Import substitution industrialization which diverted capital from other enterprises where these countries had a comparative advantage. Although opposite in intent, both policies had the effect of creating <b>overcapitalization</b> in some sectors and undercapitalization in others. A contrary view comes from the economist Robert Solow, who was awarded the Nobel prize for his work on the ways in which labor, capital and technical progress contribute to overall economic growth. Among other insights, Solow showed that undercapitalization appears to have less impact on economic growth than would be predicted by earlier economic theories.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend the Averch-Johnson model of the {{regulated}} firm so as to allow for the endogenous selection of factor augmenting technical change. A simple model is developed which avoids the questions of timing, capitalization, and internalization of innovations and focuses on the incentives to a firm for innovational choice under cost minimizing conditions versus several formulations of the regulated setting. The results suggest that regulation can distort the innovational selections. Moreover, in the case of the profit maximizing firm subject to "fair" return on investment regulation, the innovational choices will reinforce the static <b>overcapitalization</b> tendencies. ...|$|E
40|$|Catch share {{programs}} {{implemented in}} U. S. fisheries provide {{an alternative to}} traditional fishing practices and a means to deter overfishing and <b>overcapitalization</b> in fisheries markets. Research suggests that catch share programs are responsible tools for sustainable fishing, {{but there are still}} open questions concerning their impact on fishing behavior. Catch share programs, more specifically Individual Fishing Quotas, give fishermen a greater window of opportunity in the season, as well as their own quota share of the total annual catch; this defeats the race to fish in the beginning of seasons that ultimately leads to <b>overcapitalization.</b> Fishermen may be less likely to oversaturate the market and less likely to freeze fish to sell at a later time. With more fresh fish in the market {{as a result of a}} catch share program implementation, it may be the case that market prices of fish increase as the pattern of landings become smoother and more consistent. This paper examines these hypotheses using data of landings and landings value from 10 U. S. catch share programs. This data is then analyzed as a time series using local polynomial smoothing and testing for structural breaks in the variance and the mean. The results of this study were not conclusive, as most species did not show a smoother time trend as a result of a catch share program introduction. The results do leave room for further analysis to better examine all the variables and underlying trends...|$|E
