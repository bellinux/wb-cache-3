Fans {{wondered}} why the show's staff were supporting Villanova over the North Carolina Tar Heels; one Internet writer hypothesized that it was a reference to the season 9 episode [...] "The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson", in which after one of his typical alcoholic binges, Barney Gumble can only recall [...] "giving a guest lecture at Villanova, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> was a street corner." ...|$|E
500|$|The hit single [...] "Basket Case", which {{appeared}} on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong's personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks {{and feelings of}} [...] "going crazy" [...] prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder. [...] In the third verse, [...] "Basket Case" [...] references soliciting a male prostitute; Armstrong noted that [...] "I wanted to challenge myself and whoever the listener might be. It's also {{looking at the world}} and saying, 'It's not as black and white as you think. This isn't your grandfather's prostitute – <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> was.'" [...] The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution. This is one of the band's most popular songs.|$|E
500|$|However, {{negative}} reviews, {{like the}} one from New York Times film critic, Janet Maslin, killed the publication of Honeycutt's piece. Maslin said of the final scene of the movie, [...] "Anything this moment reveals about Vietnam and about America, not to mention about dogs and merry-go-rounds, has been said better elsewhere." [...] Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey's character [...] "moronic", and referred to the film as [...] "twaddle." [...] Freeman said it was [...] "fraught with symbolism. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> is just fraught". He further said of the film, [...] "Actually, it's about David Carradine, of whom the less said the better". The Kokomo Tribune called the story [...] "pointless". When Carradine read the reviews, {{he went back to}} the hotel bathroom and threw up. It wasn't just that the critics didn't like the picture; they were angry at me for making it,' Carradine said. 'I'll never figure that out.|$|E

500|$|Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was {{negative}} in her review and dismissed the episode for feeling [...] "like a plateful of warmed-up leftovers." [...] Hodgman criticized the writers' decision to devoting {{too much of}} the episode to the Mary Alice storyline rather than focusing on the other characters. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: [...] "Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he'll make it." [...] Hodgman stated that her interest in the Gabrielle and Carlos storyline was ruined by John telling Carlos about the affair rather than Carlos discovering it himself. She also declared that the Lynette storyline was [...] "wrapped up almost as perfunctorily, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> only seems that way because it's long been so obvious that they were heading toward one of those folktales where the husband and wife switch places." [...] Hodgman concluded by saying the fates of Susan and Mike are predictable, as the characters are too important to be killed off. In 2009, TV Guide ranked the episode #55 on its list of [...] "100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time". The Futon Critic ranked the episode as the 19th best television episode of 2005, calling it [...] "note-perfect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dom Sinacola of Slant Magazine said, [...] "More than that, it furthers {{the general}} {{message of the}} whole album, which is that for all his posturing and charm, Glover may not have it in him to {{participate}} in the kind of bacchanalia required of his position as a young, burgeoning, multi-talented rap star. Halfway between throwaway wordplay and trenchant comment about fame, the lyric says a lot about where Glover's head is at: As a former sketch comedian, writer on 30 Rock, and star of the sitcom Community, he leans on his wit as his most formidable weapon." [...] Philip Cosores of Consequence of Sound stated, [...] "Yes, the dedication that Glover has seemingly displayed in the project is admirable. But he just doesn't seem to get music on this album. Maybe it's because of his taste, or because he is trying too hard to stand out, or because of his hubris, or because he has lost touch with reality, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> is because of the internet." [...] Phillip Mlynar of Spin said, [...] "The only reaction that Because the Internet elicits is the uncontrollable urge to skip to the next song, in hopes that things couldn't possibly get any sloppier. But they do, beginning with the cod-wailing that blights [...] "Crawl" [...] and volleying with the psychedelic muzak of [...] "The Worst Guys" [...] (co-starring Chance the Rapper) and [...] "Zealots of Stockholm (Free Information)," [...] which sounds like Glover has inadvertently locked himself in his practice space and is attempting to muster up a loud enough mess so that some kindly passerby will hear his cries for help. As the album collapses into itself with the closing cut, [...] "Life: The Biggest Troll (Andrew Auernheimer)," [...] we're resigned to existence as a gloopy mess of random thoughts. [...] "Where's the line between Donny G and Gambino?" [...] the rapper muses, but it's unclear whether this is meant as a genuine identity crisis or an all-knowing middle finger to critics. Maybe the entire album is a meme itself, a grand existential joke critiquing the all-conquering rise of Internet culture by parodying its overwhelming randomness. Whatever it is, though, it's a bad rap record." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes, {{a person}} wishes {{something}} good, but God doesn’t help him — maybe because the intention {{came from the}} devil and is not for our benefit; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>it</b> is beyond our strength as we have not attained the necessary spiritual level; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because <b>it</b> doesn’t correspond to our calling; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because the time is not right to initiate it; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because we don’t have the necessary knowledge or strength to accomplish it; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> because circumstances will not contribute to its success. Besides this, the devil contrives in every way to paint it as something good so that having inclined us toward it, he could upset our spiritual tranquility or inflict harm on us.

Other people, asked to use their influence with it, have talked to it like a father, and have begged it, for their sakes, to go to Kamskatka, or Timbuctoo, or Jericho, according as they have thought best for it; and then, finding that it takes no notice of them, have got wild with it, and have told it to go to still more distant places.|$|E
500|$|The kiss between Mulder and Scully {{caused a}} furor of opinions.

[...] Allan Johnson from the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "in a way, it's too bad Sunday's episode of Fox's The X-Files is getting more attention for what happens near the end than it does for its plot." [...] Kessenich praised the way the show worked in Mulder and Scully's kiss, noting that its lack of a [...] "steamy, rip your clothes off" [...] atmosphere made the sequence work [...] "so well". Handlen wrote that the scene, coupled with Black getting his daughter back, was [...] "the only scene which comes close to justifying the episode’s existence".

In this he was aided and abetted by a renegade Fijian. This lasted five years. Maybe he grew tired of being God, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>it</b> was because the Fijian decamped with the six thousand pounds in the royal treasury; but at any rate the Second Reformed Wesleyans got him, and his entire kingdom went Wesleyan. The pioneer Wesleyan missionary he actually made prime minister, and what he did to the trading crowd was a caution.

The only ornament in the room is, suspended above the fireplace, a funeral card, framed in beer corks.
