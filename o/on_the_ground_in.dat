5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies {{are found in}} wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow singly or in small groups <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs {{in the summer and}} autumn.|$|E
5|$|A small {{proportion}} of follicles open and release their seed spontaneously, but most remain closed until stimulated to open by bushfire. Bushfire kills the maternal plant, which has neither thick bark nor lignotubers, but the subsequent shedding of seed allows the population to regenerate. Seed predation continues after its release: in one study, B.brownii seeds were placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> both burnt and unburnt sides; almost all were eaten by parrots within four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Amanita onusta grows solitary or {{scattered}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> mixed oak, hickory and chestnut forests {{from southern}} New England to Texas.

5|$|Boletus subluridellus is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{and grows}} {{in association with}} deciduous trees, especially oak (genus Quercus). Fruit bodies grow scattered or in groups <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> deciduous or mixed forests, and appear from July to October. An eastern North American species, the mushroom is found from New England west to the Great Lakes, north to Quebec in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies grow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> woodlands, on moss, and peat, and on woodchips. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus, and causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|Gyroporus cyanescens, {{commonly}} known as the bluing bolete or the cornflower bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Gyroporaceae.

5|$|Hygrocybe appalachianensis, {{commonly}} known as the Appalachian waxy cap, is a gilled fungus of the waxcap family. It is found in the eastern United States, where it fruits singly, in groups, or clusters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> deciduous and mixed forests. The species, described in 1963 from collections made in the Appalachian Mountains, was originally classified in the related genus Hygrophorus. It was transferred to Hygrocybe in 1998, in which it has been proposed as the type species of section Pseudofirmae.|$|E

5|$|P.simplex inhabits open, usually humid {{tropical}} and subtropical lowlands.

Most specimens for which habitat data are known were caught <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> humid grassland, some in seasonally flooded areas; an Argentinean specimen was captured in dense swamp vegetation. It is terrestrial and semiaquatic, living on the ground but also spending time in the water.|$|E

A single collection has also been reported from Finland. The mushrooms contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and baeocystin, although at relatively low concentrations. Several mushroom species that are similar in appearance to P.pelliculosa can be distinguished by subtle differences {{in the form of the}} fruit body, or by microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the fate}} of Laos did not depend on a {{military}} solution in the air or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> Laos and could only {{be decided by the}} outcome in Vietnam, winning the war against the DRV in northern Laos was not the objective. Instead, maintaining access to the country was paramount and keeping the Royal Lao government in power became the primary objective.|$|E

Defensive back Reggie Smith also pulled down two interceptions, returning the first one 42yards for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aviation}} {{incident to}} result in more than 50 fatalities did not involve an airplane. On 21 December 1923, the Dixmude, a rigid airship of the French Navy, was reportedly struck by lightning and crashed into the Mediterranean Sea, off Sicily, Italy. All 52 crew and passengers were killed. Nearly 10 years later, the , also a rigid airship, encountered severe weather and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, off Barnegat Light, New Jersey, killing 73 of those on board. It was another 5 years before a fixed-wing aircraft incident claimed more than 50 fatalities. On 24 July 1938, A Curtiss Hawk II crashed into spectator stands in the Santa Ana air show disaster. 52 spectators were killed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> addition to the pilot of the airplane.
