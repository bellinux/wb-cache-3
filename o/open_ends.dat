The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have <b>open</b> <b>ends</b> rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E

For example, in Bergen, players score two points whenever they cause a configuration in which both <b>open</b> <b>ends</b> have the same value and three points if additionally one open end is formed by a double. In Muggins, players score by ensuring the total pip count of the <b>open</b> <b>ends</b> is a multiple of a certain number. In variants of Muggins, the line of play may branch due to spinners.|$|E

Players, in turn, must play a bone with an end that matches one of the <b>open</b> <b>ends</b> of the layouts.|$|E
500|$|Glass sponges {{present a}} {{distinctive}} variation on this basic plan. Their spicules, {{which are made}} of silica, form a scaffolding-like framework between whose rods the living tissue is suspended like a cobweb that contains most of the cell types. This tissue is a syncytium {{that in some ways}} behaves like many cells that share a single external membrane, and in others like a single cell with multiple nuclei. The mesohyl is absent or minimal. The syncytium's cytoplasm, the soupy fluid that fills the interiors of cells, is organized into [...] "rivers" [...] that transport nuclei, organelles ("organs" [...] within cells) and other substances. Instead of choanocytes, they have further syncytia, known as choanosyncytia, which form bell-shaped chambers where water enters via perforations. The insides of these chambers are lined with [...] "collar bodies", each consisting of a collar and flagellum but without a nucleus of its own. The motion of the flagella sucks water through passages in the [...] "cobweb" [...] and expels it via the <b>open</b> <b>ends</b> of the bell-shaped chambers.|$|E

500|$|Brangwyn Hall in Swansea {{was used}} as the museum. Haynes wanted the museum to feel [...] "massive and eerie", and coached Blackwood to [...] "live in the moment". The opening {{sequence}} featuring young Amelia is filmed from her height, and was inspired by Steven Spielberg films in which people would look at things in awe. During this scene Haynes played appropriate music to help Blackwood get into the mood, as he had done during similar scenes when directing [...] "The Pandorica Opens". The set was filled with things that would seem like typical exhibits in the daytime, but appeared spooky at night. The exhibits also included historical anomalies which were the result of history collapsing, such as penguins on the Nile. Though Blackwood appeared as the seven-year-old version of Amy in [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the episode marked the first time Gillan and Blackwood—who are actually cousins—acted together. Gillan initially found this [...] "weird", but she commented that they quickly got used to it. The two versions of Amy were purposely dressed in similar colours. The cold <b>open</b> <b>ends</b> with Amy telling her younger self [...] "Okay kid, this is where it gets complicated" [...] after she has been revealed in the Pandorica. Moffat, after viewing the rushes, ordered the sequence to be reshot as Gillan had said [...] "really complicated", which conveyed a different meaning. As they had run out of time filming in the museum, all of the shots looking into the Pandorica were filmed three weeks later in the Pandorica chamber set.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{variants}} of the mitrailleuse concept were developed, with common elements {{to all of}} their designs. They were characterized {{by a number of}} rifled barrels clustered together and mounted on a conventional artillery chassis or (in the case of one model) a tripod. The ammunition was secured in a single block and placed into the breech, behind the <b>open</b> <b>ends</b> of the barrels. All of the barrels were loaded simultaneously by a manual closing lever or large horizontal screw. A second lever could be worked rapidly (or in some models, a crank could be turned) to fire each barrel in succession. This earned the weapon its French nickname of moulin à café (coffee grinder). (A very similar name was earned by the hand-cranked, mechanically loaded, continuous-firing, [...] "coffee mill gun" [...] in America during the American Civil War.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The bogie {{carriages}} were {{distinctive and}} 'American' in style. The six were {{built by the}} 'Bristol Carriage and Wagon Works', two as [...] Third Class (one also being a thirdbrake) and four as [...] composites for 40 Third and 10 First Class passengers. The carriages were exceptionally wide compared with those used by major railway companies and this led to increased congestion for non-railway traffic when trains were at Bideford Quay. Entry was from either end by a metal fenced platform with steep steps. Later the <b>open</b> <b>ends</b> of these carriages were totally enclosed against the elements. Lighting was by acetylene gas, with ventilators above. Each carriage had its own clock. The seats could be turned around and the carriages had a central gangway. Third Class seats were upholstered with 'rep' and First Class with 'American' leather. They had a polished teak exterior {{with the name of}} the company in full beneath the windows, and the arms of Bideford as a medallion on the side. Buffer beams and shanks were bright red. Interiors were of polished oak, with teak mouldings and the ceilings of the First Class sections were covered in pale green Lincrusta, picked out with gold leaf. In August 1900 the carriages had been delivered, crossing Bideford Bridge with wheels and springs being taken over first and the bodies after.|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Journal of European Industrial Training [© Emerald]. The definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 0309 - 0590. htm. Purpose - This study examines participant’s response rate on dual style training course evaluation forms. These combine structured and <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> formats. Pencil and paper forms {{have a long history of}} use by trainers in business and commerce and more recently in education. Research methods texts tend to have neglected the issue of response rates with this type of form. Design/methodology/approach - Approximately 2000 course participants attending 28 courses completed evaluation forms. These were designed with a series of structured responses scales followed by a section for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> comments. Findings – It was found the completion rate for the <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections was low and thus validity was suspect. Various explanations were offered for this. Subsequently when a redesigned evaluation form was administered to a further 1641 course participants it was found response rates increased dramatically when <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections were placed earlier in the questionnaire. Practical implications – Indicates ways in which course evaluation forms can be redesigned to increase response rates for <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections and thus improve the validity of any findings. Originality/value – Provides information about response rates neglected by most methodology texts concerning the design of training evaluation questionnaires which include <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> sections...|$|R

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigated propagation {{characteristics of}} the shock wave driven by a gaseous detonation wave emerging from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of a cylindrical detonation tube. In the present study, we visualized the shock wave and exhaust flowfields using a shadowgraph optical system and we obtained peak overpressure in the tube axial direction and the continuous shape transformation of shock waves around the tube <b>open</b> <b>end.</b> We also obtained overpressure histories of the shock wave using piezo-pressure transducers within 201 m from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube. We normalized and classified these results by four regions using non-dimensional pressure and distance which are independent of variety of mixture and tube diameter. In {{the vicinity of the}} <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube, the shock wave is nearly planar and does not significantly attenuate, and the peak overpressure maintains approximately C–J pressure. Subsequently, the shock wave attenuates rapidly, transforming from quasi-spherical to spherical. Farther from the tube <b>open</b> <b>end,</b> the shock wave propagates with approximately sound characteristic so that the peak overpressure decreases proportional to 1 /r. Eventually, the shock wave begins to attenuate more rapidly than ideal sound attenuation, which {{may be due to the}} viscous effect...|$|R
