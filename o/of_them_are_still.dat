5|$|Because of {{the last}} years' massive urban development, in 2005 some areas of Cluj were named as districts (Sopor, Borhanci, Becaș, Făget, Zorilor South), but most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> {{construction}} sites. Beside these, {{there are some other}} building areas like Tineretului, Lombului or Oser, which are likely to become districts in the following years.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize that all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten off the plane. While driving to the hospital, {{they are involved in}} a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was never meant to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} main {{highways}} D1 to D4 and eight express ways R1 to R8. Most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> {{in the planning}} phase.|$|E

50|$|The Freikorps brutally cleared several {{buildings}} and executed the occupiers on the spot. Others soon surrendered, but some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> shot. The January revolt claimed 156 lives in Berlin.|$|R
25|$|Later, {{thousands}} of Buddhist temples were built at Bagan, the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite {{the seizure of}} the city by the Mongols in 1287.|$|E
25|$|Other {{languages}} {{spoken in}} the city are mainly among the Asian community: the Liberdade neighborhood {{is home to the}} largest Japanese population outside Japan.

Some people of Chinese and Korean descent are still able to speak their ancestral languages.|$|E
25|$|Transmission has {{remained}} almost exclusively under government control through both federal (Eletrobras) and state companies (mainly Sao-Paulo-CTEEP, Minas Gerais-Cemig, and Parana-Copel) until recently. However, {{under the new}} sector regulatory model, there are about 40 transmission concessions in Brazil.

25|$|These later, {{and much}} larger, {{compound}} Mallet locomotives were built by Ansaldo in Genova in 1938 to largely replace the earlier types, both the 440 Series and the unsuccessful 441 Series. The latter were simple locomotives (i.e., non-compound) and found liable {{to run out}} of steam on the heavy grades of the line. Four <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in existence of which three are in running order.|$|E
25|$|A minor {{modernization}} of Tu-154B-1. The airplane {{was designed to}} be converted from the 160 passenger version to a 180 passenger version by removing the galley. The procedure took about 2 1/2 hours. Some of the earlier Tu-154Bs were modified to that standard. Maximum takeoff weight increased to 98,000 kg (216,053 lb), later to 100,000 kg (220,462 lb). Some 311 aircraft were built, including VIP versions, a few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in use.|$|E
25|$|From 1980, {{with the}} opening of the Israeli and British archives, some Israeli historians have {{developed}} a different account of the period.

25|$|King Anawrahta (10441078); {{the founder}} of the Pagan Empire, unified the country and adopted the Theravādin Buddhist faith. This {{initiated}} the creation of thousands of Buddhist temples at Pagan, the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries. Around 2,200 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> standing. The power of the Burmese waned with the rise of the Thai, and with the seizure of the capital Pagan by the Mongols in 1287, but Theravāda Buddhism remained the main Burmese faith to this day.|$|E
25|$|Towers were an {{important}} feature of Romanesque churches and a great number <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> standing. They take a variety of forms: square, circular and octagonal, and are positioned differently {{in relation to the}} church building in different countries. In northern France, two large towers, such as those at Caen, were to {{become an integral part of}} the facade of any large abbey or cathedral. In central and southern France this is more variable and large churches may have one tower or a central tower. Large churches of Spain and Portugal usually have two towers.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of cities with synagogues include Warsaw, Kraków, Zamość, Tykocin, Rzeszów, Kielce, or Góra Kalwaria {{although}} not many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> active in their original religious role. Stara Synagoga ("Old Synagogue") in Kraków, which hosts a Jewish museum, {{was built in the}} early 15th century and is the oldest synagogue in Poland. Before the war, the Yeshiva Chachmei in Lublin was Europe's largest. In 2007 it was renovated, dedicated and reopened thanks to the efforts and endowments by Polish Jewry. Warsaw has an active synagogue, Beit Warszawa, affiliated with the Liberal-Progressive stream of Judaism.|$|E

50|$|China {{executed}} {{more than}} four times as many convicts {{as the rest of the}} world combined in 2005, Amnesty International estimated there were at least 1,770 executions in China that year, and most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> by firing squad.|$|R
50|$|Thirty-three {{of these}} {{locomotives}} were built by Robert Stephenson and Company, with Stephenson valve gear.

25|$|Historically, many {{military}} {{orders and}} other chivalric orders were founded {{in association with}} the Holy See. Most of them became extinct, were suppressed, or merged with contemporary chivalric orders. Some of them survived under the protection of the Holy See as in the list above. A few of them remained as patrimony of dynastic royal houses. Some of these dynastic orders of knighthood were recognised as Roman Catholic by Papal bulls of the Holy See, and although they are no more directly affiliated with or protected by the Holy See, some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> exclusively designated for Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Chandragupta Maurya embraced Jainism after retiring, when he renounced {{his throne}} and {{material}} possessions {{to join a}} wandering group of Jain monks. Chandragupta was a disciple of the Jain monk Bhadrabahu. It is said that in his last days, he observed the rigorous but self-purifying Jain ritual of santhara (fast unto death), at Shravana Belgola in Karnataka. However, his successor, Bindusara, was a follower of another ascetic movement, Ājīvika, and distanced himself from Jain and Buddhist movements. Samprati, the grandson of Ashoka, also embraced Jainism. Samprati {{was influenced by the}} teachings of Jain monks and he is known to have built 125,000 derasars across India. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> found in the towns of Ahmedabad, Viramgam, Ujjain, and Palitana. It is also said that just like Ashoka, Samprati sent messengers and preachers to Greece, Persia and the Middle East for the spread of Jainism, but, to date, no research has been done in this area.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{unofficial}} Spectrum clones were produced, {{especially in}} the former Eastern Bloc countries (e.g. in Russia, Romania and the Czech Republic) where several models were produced (such as the Tim-S, HC85, HC91, Cobra, Junior, CIP, CIP 3, Jet), some featuring CP/M and a 5.25"/3.5" [...] floppy disk. There were also clones produced in South America (e.g. Microdigital TK90X and TK95, made in Brazil). In the Soviet Union, ZX Spectrum clones were assembled by thousands of small start-ups and distributed through poster ads and street stalls. Over 50 such clone models existed. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> being produced, such as the Pentagon and ATM Turbo.|$|E
