5|$|Civilian {{return to}} the town was slow, with shops still {{shuttered}} on 16 December. Civilian casualty reports were conflicting: one resident claimed 15 dead bodies lay in a single street and another that his family were dead under rubble. The coalition rejected such claims, admitting <b>only</b> <b>that</b> two children had been injured, and possibly killed, when a car driving at high speeds towards ISAF troops during the battle overturned when the driver was shot dead.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} stage, the film underwent several name changes. Initially, the media {{reported that the}} film was titled Janam Janam Ka Saath Hamara Tumhara, shortened to Janam Janam Ka Saath, but later it became Teri Meri Kahaani. In November 2011, reports began that the film's name might be changed again to Muqtasar. At the time Kohli stated <b>only</b> <b>that</b> they had not yet decided {{the title of the}} film.

The success of The Deal prompted the production team to consider a new film—possibly surrounding Britain's commitment to the war in Iraq. In 2004, production was announced that the first follow-up would be produced for a theatrical film release in 2006, The Queen; that dramatises the weeks following the death of Princess Diana on 31 August 1997. Langan described the film as not being a direct sequel, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> it reunited the same creative team.|$|E

5|$|In 1865, Cancellor's {{death was}} used in a medical journal article {{discussing}} adult hydrocephalus. Despite Willis' statement that Cancellor had no pre-existing medical condition that would have caused or contributed to his death, author Samuel Wilks suggested not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> Cancellor had hydrocephalus, {{but that he was}} consequently more susceptible to physical injury as a result. He pointed to the autopsy finding of fluid in Cancellor's brain to support his assertions and argued that this effusion would have caused physical weakness.|$|E

40|$|Peleg (1986) and Tadenuma (1992) provide two {{well-known}} ax-iomatic {{characterizations of}} the core on the domain of balanced TU games. Peleg’s characterization says that the core is the <b>only</b> solution <b>that</b> satisfies non-emptiness, individual rationality, super-additivity, and a reduced game property introduced by Davis and Maschler (1965). Tadenuma’s characterization says that the core is the <b>only</b> solution <b>that</b> satisfies non-emptiness, individual rationality and a reduced game property introduced by Moulin (1985). In this note, we investigate {{what happens when the}} domain is restricted to the class of convex TU games. In particular, we show that (i) the core is not the <b>only</b> solution <b>that</b> satisfies Peleg’s four axioms and anonymity; (ii) the core is the <b>only</b> solution <b>that</b> satisfies Peleg’s four axioms, anonymity, and additional three axioms; and (iii) the core is not the <b>only</b> solution <b>that</b> satisfies Tadenuma’s three axioms and anonymity. ...|$|R
