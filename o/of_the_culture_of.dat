5|$|Annual Carnival {{celebrations}} are {{an important}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> all the Lesser Antillean islands. Carnival is celebrated at varying times of year, either pre-Lent, Christmastime or in July and August, and feature a wide variety of dances, songs and parades. Contests are common, especially Calypso King and Queen contests, which are held on most of the British Antillean islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as French Saint Martin and elsewhere. The British Antillean Carnivals are also mostly united by the J'ouvert tradition, which involves calypso and soca band parades and are the highlight of their celebrations.|$|E

It is practised in religious ceremonies in Hindu temples in Bali, but is now banned in many countries on grounds of cruelty.|$|E

5|$|Cockfighting {{is said to}} be the world's oldest spectator {{sport and}} may have {{originated}} in Persia 6,000 years ago. Two mature males (cocks or roosters) are set to fight each other, and will do so with great vigour until one is critically injured or killed. Breeds such as the Aseel were developed in the Indian subcontinent for their aggressive behaviour. The sport formed part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the ancient Indians, Chinese, Greeks, and Romans, and large sums were won or lost depending on the outcome of an encounter. Cockfighting has been banned in many countries during the last century on the grounds of cruelty to animals.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} an {{integral}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the state. Kerala {{is home to the}} largest domesticated population of elephants in India—about 700 Indian elephants, owned by temples as well as individuals. These elephants are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all around the state. More than 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated elephants during them. In Malayalam literature, elephants are referred to as the 'sons of the sahya. The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala.|$|E

5|$|Steel drums are a distinctively Trinidadian {{ensemble}} {{that evolved}} from improvised percussion instruments used in Carnival processions. By the late 1930s, bamboo tubes, a traditional instrumental, were supplemented by {{pieces of metal}} used percussively; over time, these metal percussion instruments were pitched to produce as many as twenty-some tones. Steel bands were large orchestras of these drums, and were banned by the British colonial authorities. Nevertheless, steel drums spread across the Caribbean, and are now an entrenched part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E

5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized with the means and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E
5|$|Beer is {{distributed}} in bottles and cans {{and is also}} commonly available on draught, particularly in pubs and bars. The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. The strength of modern beer is usually around 4% to 6% alcohol by volume (abv), although it may vary between 0.5% and 20%, with some breweries creating examples of 40% abv and above. Beer forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> many nations and is associated with social traditions such as beer festivals {{as well as a}} rich pub culture involving activities like pub crawling and pub games such as bar billiards.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E

5|$|The ancestral {{species of}} the genus Cucurbita {{were present in the}} Americas before the arrival of humans, and are native to the New World. The likely center of origin is {{southern}} Mexico, spreading south through what is now known as Mesoamerica, on into South America, and north to what is now the southwestern United States. Evolutionarily speaking, the genus is relatively recent in origin, dating back only to the Holocene, whereas the family Cucurbitaceae, in the shape of seeds similar to Bryonia, dates to the Paleocene. No species within the genus is entirely genetically isolated. C.moschata can intercross with all the others, though the hybrid offspring may not themselves be fertile unless they become polyploid. The genus was part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> almost every native peoples group from southern South America to southern Canada. Modern-day cultivated Cucurbita are not found in the wild. Genetic studies of the mitochondrial gene nad1 show there were at least six independent domestication events of Cucurbita separating domestic species from their wild ancestors. Species native to North America include C.digitata (calabazilla), and C.foetidissima (buffalo gourd), C.palmata (coyote melon), and C.pepo. Some species, such as C.digitata and C.ficifolia, are referred to as gourds. Gourds, also called bottle-gourds, which are used as utensils or vessels, belong to the genus Lagenaria and are native to Africa. Lagenaria are in the same family and subfamily as Cucurbita but in a different tribe.|$|E
