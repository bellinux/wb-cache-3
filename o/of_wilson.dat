5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and a strong supporter <b>of</b> <b>Wilson.</b>|$|E
5|$|For many years, Adrian Boult {{had been}} a close friend <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> and his first wife Ann, née Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She {{divorced}} Wilson on grounds of cruelty in 1931, and married Boult two years later. The enmity provoked in Wilson was to have lasting repercussions. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career: he was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the Three Choirs Festival for 25 years until 1957, when he narrated Honegger's King David in Worcester, by which time his singing career had ended.|$|E
5|$|In Menominee County, the {{environment}} {{takes on a}} more agricultural character along US2. The highway passes through {{the edge of the}} community of Hermansville before entering Powers. US2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US41. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> and Spaulding {{on the south side of}} the CN Railway. At Harris, the trunkline enters the Hannahville Indian Community. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to Bark River on the Delta County side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses the community's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of Escanaba.|$|E

5|$|On November 17, 1999, Shiller {{joined in}} {{unanimous}} support for Daley's 2000 budget, her first affirmative {{vote on a}} Daley budget and only her second affirmative vote on a City budget. Aldermen applauded. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2001, 2002, and 2003 budgets. In the 2001 redistricting of Chicago wards, Daley tried to deprive Shiller of her most committed supporters, but failed when none of the aldermen in adjacent wards wanted to contend with Shiller's supporters. Shiller and Daley, however, reached an understanding: the mayor supported her in the 2003 elections and also pushed forward development <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> Yard, a Chicago Transit Authority facility destroyed by fire, into affordable housing and a Target store, using the Wilson Yard Tax Increment Financing District and the $26.5 million it generated. Subsequently, Shiller consistently voted {{in support of the}} mayor's agenda.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the prime}} opponents <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> and the League was Senate Majority Leader Henry Cabot Lodge. After McNary {{demonstrated}} his skill {{in the debate over}} the League, Lodge took him under his wing, and the two formed a longtime friendship. The friendship helped McNary secure favorable committee assignments and ushered him into the inner power circle of the Senate. Early in his career, he served as chairman of the Irrigation and Reclamation of Arid Lands Committee, and {{as a member of the}} Agriculture and Forestry Committee. In 1922, President Warren G. Harding asked McNary to be the Secretary of the Interior to replace Albert B. Fall because of Fall's involvement in the ongoing Teapot Dome scandal. McNary declined, preferring to stay in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Several legal {{developments}} {{occurred on}} the eve of the settlement. First, the First Circuit held in Bottomly v. Passamaquoddy Tribe (1979) that the Passamaquoddy were entitled to tribal sovereign immunity (see supra). Second, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court held in State v. Dana (1979) that the state had no jurisdiction to punish on-reservation arson because of the federal Major Crimes Act. Third, in Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the provision of the Nonintercourse Act placing the burden of proof in land claims on non-Indians did not apply to U.S. state defendants (but did apply to corporate defendants); further, language in Wilson threatened to confine the applicability of the Act to Indian country. The tribes persuaded the U.S. Solicitor General to file a motion asking the Court to delete that language from its opinion. The Court denied the motion. Maine unsuccessfully sought certiorari in Dana on the basis <b>of</b> <b>Wilson.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{estimated}} cost {{to clean up}} debris from the two killer tornadoes was estimated at $500,000. The governor <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> County requested that the areas struck by the EF3 tornado and the EF2 prior as disaster areas to allow federal assistance. In Kenly, hospital staff raised about $300 to help a family whose home was completely destroyed. Up to 125 personnel were deployed to check on residents who were still at home and to assist those in need. Several volunteers helped remove trees and debris off roads {{to make way for}} aid. Two Red Cross teams set up a shelter at the Kenly Free Will Baptist Church. During church ceremonies, volunteers organized outside the church to feed residents who lost their homes. A Methodist church group from Virginia arrived in Johnston and Wilson counties the day after the tornadoes to assist with cleanup efforts. A fund was set up for the 11-year-old boy, Joshua Wiggens, who was killed by the Elm City tornado. By November17, the Red Cross funds were depleted funds needed to keep the organization out of debt were $38million below what was required. About $20,000 was spent in the charity effort in Kenly and the governor <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> County urged residents who were no affected by the storm to send donations to the Red Cross. The lack of funding for the Red Cross prompted the governor to allow up to $28,000 in the state's emergency funds to be used for assistance by the Red Cross. On November21, low-interest loans were approved for residents in the affected counties. Homeowners in Johnston, Franklin, Harnett, Nash, Sampson, Wake, Wayne and Wilson counties were able to apply for loans up to $200,000 to repair storm damage and businesses were allowed to apply for loans up to $2million. On November24, an unknown member of the 82nd Airborne Division donated 50 cases of non-perishable food and water to assist victims of the tornado. The relief goods were dropped off at the J.S. Waters School in Goldston without notice.|$|E
5|$|After the Falcons traded Favre to the Packers, Miller and Tolliver {{were the}} only quarterbacks on the roster. Before the season started, Wade Wilson signed with the team, and the two shared the role of backup to Miller. Tolliver played two of the first eight games, then was named the {{starting}} quarterback when the Falcons lost Miller for the season {{as a result of}} reconstructive surgery on his left knee. Tolliver's first start of the season came against the 49ers. He completed 16 of 25 passes, but threw three interceptions in a 41–3 loss. The next week against the Cardinals, Tolliver was benched for the final series as Wilson led the team to victory and Tolliver argued with coach Jerry Glanville. Despite the conflict and a shoulder injury, Glanville gave Tolliver the start the following week against the Buffalo Bills. He played a few more games before being replaced by Wilson {{for the rest of the}} season, partially as a result <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> throwing five touchdown passes in his first start en route to a 35–7 Falcons victory. Tolliver finished the season with five touchdowns, five interceptions, a 55.7% completion percentage, and a 70.4 QB rating.|$|E
5|$|As Liberal leader, Thorpe {{provided}} a clear {{contrast with the}} pedestrian images <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself {{at odds with the}} Young Liberals, who were advocating policies far {{to the left of the}} Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.|$|E

5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a waiting list. By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E
5|$|The third caution {{was given}} on lap ten; Tracy glanced the rear-right wheel of Servià's car heading into turn three which caused both drivers to spin and stall. De Ferran led at the lap-12 restart, ahead of Bräck and Franchitti. Bräck was {{overtaken}} by Franchitti {{for second place}} around {{the outside of the}} third turn on lap 18, while Tagliani passed Kanaan at the same corner one lap later. De Ferran continued to pull away {{from the rest of the}} field and held a 7.5 second lead over Franchitti by the 30th lap. The fourth caution came out two laps later when Takagi made contact with the side <b>of</b> <b>Wilson</b> at the entrance of turn three. Both cars spun with Takagi going into the outside tire barrier and Wilson went off into the run-off area with a broken suspension. Franchitti drove into the turn six run-off area to retire with an oil pressure problem on the same lap caused by a lack of oil in his car. During the caution, most of the field made pit stops. Dixon moved from 17th to fifth and Junqueira went from 18th to seventh position because they made pit stops before the caution was displayed. Andretti moved up from 15th to tenth place. De Ferran led the lap-37 restart, and was followed by Tagliani, Bräck, Castroneves and Dixon.|$|E
