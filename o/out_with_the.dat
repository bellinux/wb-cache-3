5|$|After going undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft, the San Francisco 49ers signed Brown to a {{free agent}} contract. He was re-signed to the {{practice}} squad, but the franchise released him on September 8 when it signed quarterback Troy Smith and moved Nate Davis to the practice squad. Later in September, Brown tried <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Pittsburgh Steelers alongside quarterbacks Levi Brown and John David Booty {{in search of a}} replacement for the injured Dennis Dixon. Brown also worked <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> New York Giants earlier in September and with the Houston Texans in October.|$|E

5|$|A royal {{charter of}} 1215 gave Wellington {{its status as}} a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> church at the east end of town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution.

5|$|Alan Hugh Dale (born 6 May 1947) is a New Zealander actor. As a child, Dale {{developed}} {{a love of}} theatre and also became a rugby player. After retiring from the sport, he took {{on a number of}} professions to support his family, before deciding to become a professional actor at age 27. With work limited in New Zealand, Dale moved to Australia, where he played Dr. John Forrest in The Young Doctors from 1979 to 1982. He later appeared as Jim Robinson in Neighbours, a part he played from 1985 until 1993. He left the series when he fell <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> producers over the pay he {{and the rest of the}} cast received.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Brown gained selection, although Bradman batted him out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened. Brown came in 6/335 and scored 25 at a typically placid pace, accumulating his runs at a lower strike rate than the other recognised batsmen. He was <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> score at 6/402 as Australia went on to declare at 8/462 and win by an innings.|$|E

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to represent the hosts. After his opponents had finalised their players, Bradman named a full-strength team. In a rain-interrupted match, Johnston bowled Edrich for 15. He ended with 1/20 as the hosts folded for 177. Johnston made an unbeaten 26 in a partnership of 30 with Lindsay Hassett as Australia replied with 8/489 declared. Time ran <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Leveson-Gower's XI at 0/75 in the second innings.|$|E
5|$|British Expeditionary Force {{commander}} General Douglas Haig and Second Army commander General Herbert Plumer both {{believed it}} necessary to expel the Germans from the captured positions. In view of the preparations for the Somme offensive, Haig {{did not wish to}} divert more forces than were necessary. Support was limited to a number of additional artillery units and an infantry brigade from the 20th (Light) Division. It was suggested that the next counterattack be carried <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> infantry available, with a particularly large emphasis placed on artillery.|$|E
5|$|Brown partnered the {{recovered}} Barnes and patiently scored 140, {{before being}} the fifth man <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> score at 344, as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings {{immediately after the}} Fourth Test. Looking to regain his Test position by sheer weight of runs, Brown started slowly; Barnes made 24 of the first 29 runs. He took 185 minutes to reach 50, much to the displeasure of the restless spectators, before accelerating and scoring his next 50 runs in 37 minutes.|$|E

Doug had asked the Bruins' Blair for more money for Bobby and was turned down. Doug Orr met Toronto lawyer Alan Eagleson at a juvenile fastball tournament dinner in Parry Sound and asked Eagleson to help <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> situation. Eagleson agreed {{to work with the}} family for free and continued to do so for the next two years. Bobby and Eagleson developed a relationship Orr would later describe as being like brothers.

5|$|Early {{improvement}} was carried <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> traditional tools, but new technology was increasingly important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first {{adopted in the}} south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E

5|$|Electrification of the Melbourne {{suburban}} {{network was}} also carried <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first train running in 1919. By 1924 210,000 passengers {{passed through the}} main city terminal of Flinders Street station per weekday. St Kilda was Melbourne's busiest suburban station with 4½ million journeys, followed by Footscray with almost 4 million, then Elsternwick, Ascot Vale, Essendon and Balaclava. Technology advancements continued, with 3 position automatic signals introduced in 1915, the conversion of screw couplings to knuckle couplers from 1924, and the first remote controlled signalling provided in 1925. The first level crossing flashing lights were installed at Mentone on Moorabin Road in 1932.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and the new}} captain {{received}} the first ball, but Gooch was soon <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> score on only 12. Some solid top-order play followed, with Curtis (30), Bailey (43) and Smith (57) all making starts but getting out when well set. From 120/3, England lost their remaining wickets for 85, but that is perhaps less surprising {{than the fact that}} off-spinner Roger Harper took three of them. A lion-hearted response by the England bowlers, led by Neil Foster (5/64), gave England a chance of a rare win, as the West Indies were dismissed for 183, giving the England team their first first-innings lead of the series, 22 runs ahead.|$|E
5|$|Following a raid in 710, a predominately Berber army {{under the}} command of Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed from North Africa in April 711 and landed somewhere in the {{vicinity}} of Gibraltar (though most likely not in the bay or at the Rock itself). Although Tariq's expedition was an outstanding success and led to the Islamic conquest of most of the Iberian peninsula, he ended his career in disgrace after falling <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Arab general Musa bin Nusayr. His conquest nonetheless left a long-lasting legacy for Gibraltar: Mons Calpe was renamed Jebel Tariq, the Mount of Tariq, subsequently corrupted into Gibraltar.|$|E
