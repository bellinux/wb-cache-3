5|$|The West Indies were an <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> the British Empire in {{the late}} 18th century, and the source or {{destination}} of one-third of Britain's foreign trade in the 1790s. Britain's economic interests were protected by a massive military presence, with 69line infantry regiments serving there between 1793 and 1801, and another 24 between 1803 and 1815.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new {{research}} station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was {{enthusiastic about the}} new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until {{nearly all of them}} died of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} bank of the Mississippi, a second simultaneous attack on the nearby former British colonial <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> Cahokia, occupied by Patriot Virginians, was also repulsed. The retreating Indians destroyed the crops and took captive civilians outside the protected area. The British failed to defend {{their side of the}} river and, thus, effectively ended any attempts to gain control of the Mississippi River during the war.|$|E
5|$|The geology of Shetland is complex, with {{numerous}} faults and fold axes.

There are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive features are the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor.|$|E

His father, Bolesław Wałęsa (1908–1945), was a {{carpenter}} who was rounded up and interned in a forced labour camp at Młyniec (<b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> KL Stutthof) by the German occupying forces before Lech was born. Bolesław returned home after the war but died two months later from exhaustion and illness. Lech's mother, Feliksa Wałęsa (née Kamieńska; 1916–1975), has been credited with shaping her son's beliefs and tenacity.|$|E
5|$|A lull ensued, {{during which}} November talks {{sponsored}} by the OAU failed to conciliate the opposing Chadian factions. Ethiopian leader Mengistu's attempt {{at the beginning of}} 1984 was also unsuccessful. Mengistu's failure was followed on 24 January by a GUNT attack, supported by heavy Libyan armor, on the FANT <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> Ziguey, a move mainly meant to persuade France and the African states to reopen negotiations. France reacted to this breach of the Red Line by launching the first significant air counter-attack, bringing new troops into Chad and unilaterally raising the defensive line to the 16th parallel.|$|E
5|$|After many hardships - {{including}} {{being pursued}} by four Indios who try their best to leave them stranded or dead - Tintin, Haddock, and Zorrino reach the Temple of the Sun, finding {{it to be a}} surviving <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> the Inca civilisation. They are brought before the Prince of the Sun, flanked by Chiquito and Huascar, the mysterious man Tintin encountered in Jauga. Zorrino is saved from harm when Tintin gives him Huascar's medallion, but Tintin and Haddock are sentenced to death by the Inca prince for their sacrilegious intrusion. The prince tells them they may choose the hour that Pachacamac, the Sun god, will set alight the pyre on which they will be executed.|$|E

Their only child, Elizabeth, was born on 1 January 1789. The relationship was not a happy one and Baker refused to accompany {{his wife and child}} when they were transferred to the remote colonial <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> Norfolk Island in March 1790. Susannah and Elizabeth had no further contact with Baker, even after they returned to Sydney in the 1800s.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{worrying}} about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> nine battalions with artillery support; the principal purpose of the infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. He did not believe any attack would occur; Daun's army had been dormant in recent months, refusing {{to be drawn into}} battles.|$|E
5|$|The Hudson Bay territories (known to the English as Prince Rupert's Land) {{were not}} {{significantly}} fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> Fort Albany in 1709. The Hudson's Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied {{for the return of}} its territories in the negotiations that ended this war.|$|E

These islands are the northern <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> the Caledonian orogeny {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalradian and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. Similarly, there are also Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which is a remnant of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of the island's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas. In the post-glacial epoch, , the islands experienced a tsunami up to 20metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater landslip {{off the coast of}} Norway.|$|E

5|$|The {{village of}} Khe Sanh was {{the seat of}} {{government}} of Huong Hoa district, an area of Bru Montagnard villages and coffee plantations, situated about seven miles from the Laotian frontier on Route 9, the northernmost transverse road in South Vietnam. The badly deteriorated Route 9 ran from the coastal region, through the western highlands, and then crossed the border into Laos. The origin of the combat base lay in the construction by US Army Special Forces of an airfield in August 1962 outside the village at an old French fort. The camp then became a Special Forces <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> the Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDG), whose purpose was to keep watch on NVA infiltration along the border {{and to protect the}} local population.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the Physics Department worked on the development of optical munitions, particularly aluminised mirrors for aerial photography. In February 1942, Oliphant persuaded Laby to release Burhop and Leslie Martin to work on microwave radar at the Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney. Burhop and Martin produced a laboratory model of a cavity magnetron on 23 July 1942. Their magnetron was based on an overseas design, but made entirely from local components so that it could be manufactured in Australia. In September 1942 he returned to the University of Melbourne as the officer in charge of the Radar Research Laboratory, an <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> the Radiophysics Laboratory, where his task was turning his cavity magnetrons and reflex klystrons from prototypes into production models. Eventually, over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Allied forces {{advanced}} to the fortified naval <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> Tobruk. The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts as they went. Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade. The Italian flag was taken down {{and in the absence of}} an Australian flag, a signaler from the 2/4th Battalion tied his slouch hat to the flag staff and hauled it up to the top. The battalion's losses during the fighting for Tobruk were seven officers and 50 men killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|At 2:00a.m. on 30 July, the Pashtuns {{launched}} another attack, {{during which}} Costello, and the Pashtun Mullah, were both wounded; the British also recorded one fatality among the sepoy contingent. That evening a further attack was repulsed by a bayonet {{charge of the}} 45th Sikhs. The following morning, on 31 July, {{the remainder of the}} 38th Dogras and 35th Sikhs entered Malakand South under the command of Colonel Reid, bringing with them 243 mules carrying 291,600 rounds of ammunition. But with their attention now drawn towards the nearby British <b>outpost</b> <b>of</b> Chakdara, attacks by the Pashtuns on Malakand South began to reduce until they ceased altogether. Churchill records a total of three British officers killed in action and 10 wounded, seven sepoy officers wounded, and 153 non-commissioned officers killed and wounded during the siege of Malakand South.|$|E
