In this experiment real size square shape kitchen cabinet have been manufactured using screw and two types of board, bare MDF without <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> and melamine overlaid MDF with <b>edge</b> <b>band,</b> both were exposed to accelerated aging test. Totally 50 boxes have been constructed and tested. 25 boxes manufactured with bare MDF and without <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> and 25 boxes (which were exactly similar) with melamine overlaid MDF with <b>edge</b> <b>band.</b> Total of five treatments (including control samples) which were only different in aging time, have been implemented on cabinets.

Results of statistical analysis showed {{that the effect of}} treatments on the stiffness of melamine overlaid MDF cabinets with <b>edge</b> <b>band</b> is significant at 1 % level (confidence level of 99 %). Comparison of T 1 (control) and T 5 (harshest) treatment showed that in both board types structure nearly 10 % decrease in cabinet stiffness happened.

40|$|We {{proposed}} a minimal model {{to describe the}} Floquet band structure of two-dimensional materials with light-induced resonant inter-band transition. We applied it to graphene to study the band features caused by the light irradiation. Linearly polarized light induces pseudo gaps (gaps are functions of wavevector), and circularly polarized light causes real gaps on the quasi-energy spectrum. If the polarization of light is linear and along the longitudinal direction of zigzag ribbons, flat <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> appear in the pseudo gaps, and if is in the lateral direction of armchair ribbons, curved <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> can be found. For the circularly polarized cases, <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> arise and intersect in the gaps of both types of ribbons. The <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> induced by the circularly polarized light are helical and those by linearly polarized light are topologically trivial ones. The Chern number of the Floquet band, which reflects the number of pairs of helical <b>edge</b> <b>bands</b> in graphene ribbons, can be reduced into the winding number at resonance.

5000|$|Traditional <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> was {{a manual}} process {{requiring}} ordinary carpentry tools and materials. In modern applications, particularly for high-volume, repetitive manufacturing steps such as cabinet doors, <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> {{is applied to}} the substrate by an automated process using a hot-melt adhesive. Hot melt adhesives can be water or solvent based and may consist of various raw materials including EVA, PUR, PA, APOA, and PO. A substrate primer may also be used as a bonding agent between the adhesive and the substrate. Thicker edge bandings typically require a slight concavity to provide a tight glue line. The thickness can vary from [...]018" [...] to 5mm or even more. The machine that applies the <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> is called edgebander. An edgebander bonds the <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> to the substrate, trims the leading and trailing edges, trims top and bottom flush with the substrate, scraps any surplus, and buffs the finished edge.|$|R

Yet there is little information available concerning the withdrawal strength of various fasteners, and, in particular, dowels in composite materials edged solid wood edge bandings. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the withdrawal strengths of 6, 8, 10 mm diameter dowels produced from beech with respect to edge of a medium-density fiberboard (MDF) or particleboard (PB) edged with 5, 10 and 15 mm thickness of solid wood <b>edge</b> <b>banding</b> of uludag fir, bonded with different adhesives.

40|$|The {{future of}} {{cellular}} radio ICs {{lies in the}} integration of an ever-increasing number of bands and channel bandwidths. This paper presents a transceiver together with the associated discrete front-end components. The transceiver supports 4 <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and 9 WCDMA bands (l-VI and Vlll-X), while the radio can be configured to simultaneously support the 4 <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and up to 5 WCDMA bands: 3 high bands (HB) and 2 low bands (LB). The RX is a SAW-less homodyne composed of a main RX and a diversity RX. To reduce package complexity with so many bands, we chose to minimize the number of ports by using single-ended RF interfaces for both RX and TX. This saves seve ral package pins, but requires careful attention to grounding. The main RX has 8 LNA ports and the diversity RX has 5, with some LNAs supporting multiple bands. On the TX side, 2 ports are used for all <b>EDGE</b> <b>bands</b> and 4 for the WCDMA bands...|$|R
