50|$|Early in De Forest's art {{career he}} used {{standard}} <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> to make landscape paintings. Later, in a deliberate attempt {{to move away}} from abstract expressionism, De Forest stopped using <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> and began using different mixtures of water-based paint. This does not allow the color of his paintings to blend as it would with <b>oil</b> <b>paint.</b> He sometimes used cheap <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> as well to get his desired rough, scorched textures.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, Hunter made a {{visit to}} Paris, funded by his {{earnings}} as an illustrator. He {{was inspired by the}} numerous artistic experiences there, and became fully resolved to take up <b>oil</b> <b>painting.</b> When he returned to San Francisco in 1905, he began preparing for his first solo exhibition, which was to be held the following year. However, Hunter's early work was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he returned to Scotland shortly afterwards, settling in Glasgow. Initially he continued to make his living there primarily as an illustrator. His <b>oil</b> <b>painting</b> began with still lifes on black backgrounds, influenced by the Dutch style.|$|E

50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>paint</b> {{is a type}} of slow-drying {{paint that}} {{consists}} of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit, and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> film. <b>Oil</b> <b>paints</b> have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. Thickness of coat has considerable bearing on time required for drying: thin coats of <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> dry relatively quickly.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>paints</b> {{may require}} the use of {{solvents}} such as mineral spirits or turpentine to thin the paint and clean up. These solvents generally have some level of toxicity and are often found objectionable. Relatively recently, water-miscible <b>oil</b> <b>paints</b> have been developed for artists' use. <b>Oil</b> <b>paint</b> films can become increasingly yellow and brittle with time; they lose much of their flexibility in a few decades. Additionally, the rules of [...] "fat over lean" [...] must be employed to ensure the paint films are durable.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} deals with 20 th century {{manufactured}} artists' <b>oil</b> <b>paints</b> containing raw and burnt umber pigments, this is, natural earth pigments {{resulting from the}} combination of iron and manganese oxides. Manganese, in particular, {{is known to be}} a primary drier and to have a siccative effect on <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> films. This research aims to show the diversity of formulations behind apparently same commercial names as well as to understand how the content of manganese, the presence of modern lipidic media and the hydrolysis mechanisms can promote significant differences in the expected mechanical properties of <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> films, thus conditioning their long-term performance. Several manufactured artists' <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> films containing manganese were selected. Dried films from raw and burnt umber <b>oil</b> <b>paints</b> by Winsor&Newton® (UK), Grumbacher® (USA), Gamblin® (USA) and Speedball® (USA) were studied and information about their chemical composition and mechanical behaviour is here presented. In addition to the identification and the study of the inorganic and organic components present in each formulation through LM, SEM-EDX, FTIR-ATR, XRD, GC-MS analysis, tensile tests were run and stress-strain curves were obtained. Together with evident hue differences, the obtained results showed significant differences in the chemical composition and the mechanical behaviour of the <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> films...|$|R

5|$|Sowing and Harvesting and Market, popularly {{referred}} to as the Vršac triptych, is a three-panel <b>oil</b> <b>painting</b> by the Serbian realist Paja Jovanović. Painted around 1895, it shows the everyday interactions of the inhabitants of Vršac, a multi-ethnic and multi-religious town in the Banat region of Austria-Hungary of which Jovanović was a native. The painting was commissioned by the Vršac city council in 1895 for the following year's Budapest Millennium Exhibition.|$|E
50|$|Sevada's early {{paintings}} {{touched upon}} many genres: landscape, still life, portraits, religious themes and more.

30|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} with a late 19 th century W&N <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> tube labelled “Lemon Yellow” (dated {{according to the data}} on the label; more details in the “Experimental” section). The pigment in the tube is composed of barium chromate and the additive magnesium carbonate was also found, Fig.  6. Magnesium carbonate was only detected by μ-FTIR, not by XRD, which means it is most probably in its amorphous form. As seen in Fig.  6, the infrared (between 1000 and 750  cm− 1) and diffraction pattern of the pigment in the “Lemon Yellow” <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> tube presents a very good match with the pigment reconstruction for W&N’s Lemon Yellow (LY 1 a, barium chromate). The presence of magnesium carbonate in the <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> tube is very interesting. This material was not listed in any of the W&N production records for manufacturing Lemon Yellow pigments, nor was it found in any of their 19 th century production records for lead chromate pigments but it was detected in 19 th century W&N lead chromate <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> tubes [25]. However magnesium carbonate does appear in some of W&N’s <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> formulations under the term “spar” [25], as revealed by a search in the on-line W&N Archive Database under the book code GR (entitled ‘Oil Grinding at New Factory, various colours at different dates’) [31]. It is possible that magnesium carbonate may be a good marker for W&N’s <b>oil</b> <b>paints.</b> Investigation into the <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> formulations of other contemporary colourmen will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.|$|R

5|$|The Kiss is an <b>oil</b> <b>painting</b> {{on canvas}} {{completed}} by the Norwegian symbolist artist Edvard Munch in 1897. Part of his Frieze of Life, which depicts the stages of a relationship between men and women, The Kiss is a realization of a motif with which he had experimented since 1888/89: a couple kissing, their faces fusing as one in a symbolic representation of their unity. Exhibited as early as 1903, this work is held at the Munch Museum in Oslo.|$|E

50|$|The {{advantage}} of the slow-drying quality of <b>oil</b> <b>paint</b> is that an artist can develop a painting gradually. Earlier media such as egg tempera dried quickly, which prevented the artist from making changes or corrections. With oil-based paints, revising was comparatively easy. The disadvantage is that a painting might take months or years to finish, which might disappoint an anxious patron. <b>Oil</b> <b>paints</b> blend well with each other, making subtle variations of color possible as well as creating many details of light and shadow. <b>Oil</b> <b>paints</b> can be diluted with turpentine or other thinning agents, which artists take advantage to paint in layers.|$|R
