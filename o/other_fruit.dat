5|$|Historically, Deir Ghassaneh {{depended}} {{primarily on}} olive cultivation, {{and until the}} present day most of Bani Zeid's cultivable land is covered by olive orchards. The cultivation of <b>other</b> <b>fruit</b> trees is significantly lower, with almonds being a distant second at 240 dunams. Other crops grown include grains which cover 135 dunams and onions, dry legumes and fodder to a lesser degree. Only 1% of the town's residents own livestock {{and according to the}} Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, there were 1,880 goats, 268 sheep, 12 cows and 281 beehives in Bani Zeid in 2009. Agriculture currently accounts for 10% of labor in the town.|$|E

5|$|While {{moving through}} the Philippines, Chanchu {{affected}} several islands with strong winds and heavy rainfall. In Legazpi, Albay, strong waves wrecked 100homes and left 1,500people homeless. High winds left widespread power outages, particularly in Mindoro, Batangas, and across the Bicol Region. The storm severely damaged the banana industry and affected various <b>other</b> <b>fruit</b> crops. Near Metro Manila, the winds damaged billboards, knocked over trees, and caused isolated power outages. Rough seas sank a ferry off Masbate, despite a warning against the operation of small craft, having left at sunrise to avoid the police. The Coast Guard rescued 18passengers, but 28people died in the wreck. An empty ferry sank at port in Tabaco. A ferry with 700people aboard went missing, but the Coast Guard found it washed ashore with everyone safe on board. Similarly, an oil tanker washed ashore at Pinamalayan, Oriental Mindoro, and its crew of 13 was rescued. Throughout the country, Chanchu killed 41people, mostly from the Masabate ferry wreck. The storm damaged 5,630homes, and destroyed 1,013others, forcing 53,307people to leave their homes. Agricultural losses totaled ₱71.57million (PHP, $1.3million USD), chiefly to the corn harvest, with an additional ₱46million (PHP, $850,000 USD) in infrastructure damage.|$|E
