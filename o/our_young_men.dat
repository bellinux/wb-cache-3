500|$|Walker became {{involved}} in a civil rights lawsuit in 1884 after a roller-skating rink in Steubenville denied entry to Walker and his friend, Hannibal Lyons. [...] The Cleveland Gazette, an African-American weekly newspaper, described the circumstances as follows:Steubenville, like many other places, is suffering now from the roller skate craze. [...] There are now three in full blast and prospects for more. [...] Discrimination on account of color never was carried on in Steubenville until these strangers starting rinks here issued the edict [...] "No Negroes need apply except for positions of menials." [...] On the 16th there was an opening night at the South Side Rink, and two of <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> of gentlemanly deportment and honest reputation applied for admission. [...] The proprietor of the rink flatly told them, [...] "You are colored and you can't skate." ...|$|E

On July 29, 2007, McCain voted against a bill increasing federal student loans and Pell Grants and expanding eligibility for financial aid. In 2008, he expressed support for increasing the funding of Pell Grants, saying, [...] "We should not burden <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and women after college with debt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1941 General ‘Hap’ Arnold flew to London and {{met with}} RAF {{officers}} at the Air Ministry, offering to train four thousand British pilots alongside American aviation cadets. The British Air Council accepted the generous offer and planning began immediately. On 10 May 1941, in a telegram to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill [...] referred to the “splendid offer which General Arnold made to us of one-third of the rapidly expanding capacity for pilot training in the United States {{to be filled with}} pupils from here”, stating that “the first five hundred and fifty of <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> are now ready to leave”.|$|E

2500|$|In March 2007, {{during a}} news conference in Staten Island, Bloomberg {{declared}} his strong opposition to legislation proposed in Congress calling for a clear timetable for troop withdrawal. He said, [...] "We ask <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> and women to go over and to fight, {{and if you have a}} deadline knowing they're pulling out, how can you expect them to defend this country? How can you expect them to go out and put their lives at risk? I just think that's untenable and that this is not a responsible piece of legislation. It is totally separate of how we're conducting the war. It's totally separate of whether we should have been there. The issue that you asked about is plain and simple: Should the Congress pass a law forcing the president to withdraw troops at a given point in time? I think that is not something that is in the country's interest or in the military's interest." ...|$|E

Red Shirt presented an image of Native Americans that Europeans could associate with progress, nobility, and civilization. Queen Victoria adored Chief Red Shirt and requested a special command performance. Red Shirt commented to The Brisbane Courier [...] on the future of Natives in the United States. [...] "The red man is changing in every season. [...] The Native of the next generation will not be the Native of the last. [...] Our buffaloes are nearly all gone, the deer have entirely vanished, and the white man takes more and more of our land. But the United States government is good. True, it has taken away our land, and the white man have eaten up our deer and our buffalo, but the government now gives us food that we may not starve. They are educating our children and teaching them to use farm implements. [...] Our children will learn the white man’s civilization and to live like him. [...] It is our only outlook in the future. [...] Now we are dependent upon the rations of the Government but we feel we are fully entitled to that bounty. [...] It {{is a part of the}} price they pay for the land they have taken from us, and some compensation to us for having killed off the herds upon which we subsisted. [...] For myself, I know it is no use fighting against the United States government. [...] I accept my fate. [...] The red man cannot kill all the white men that live in villages as big as the largest forests. [...] But some of <b>our</b> <b>young</b> <b>men</b> do not know this, and they may perhaps elect to die like their fathers with their tomahawks in their hands rather than starve to death like a dog upon the prairie." ...|$|E
