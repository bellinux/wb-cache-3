5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia went <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium fuel tank underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by {{the trees and}} exploded. The fuel tank was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would {{not have time to}} get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E

25|$|In {{his book}} Ready for the Plaintiff, Belli noted {{examples}} of negligence cited {{by himself and}} other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the municipal code because {{of the effect of}} the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of Vitreous marble, whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his Montgomery Street office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.|$|E
25|$|Although {{trampoline}} {{competitors are}} highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing off the bed. They also have padded end decks, which are the locations that athletes are most likely to fall off the trampoline. The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trampoline bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting.|$|E
25|$|Clarice is apprehended by Hartman and, upon disparaging both him and {{his dead}} daughter, is {{shot in the head}} as the others watch from a distance. Jackson and Bud {{continue}} on with Elizabeth in tow. As a Deputy passes, Elizabeth screams out, inadvertently leading to Bud getting shot. Bud's death sends Jackson into a rage, as he kills the Deputy and has Elizabeth drive them in the deputy's vehicle in attempt to reach safety. During their drive, the two are pursued by the deranged Hartman, who opens fire on the two with one of the bullets severing Jackson's face and causing the vehicle to careen <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> road. Later that night, Elizabeth awakes handcuffed in Hartman's car and answers a dispatch call, alerting Sorells to her location. Sorells visits Verna and reveals to her that Hartman has Jedidiah at the old barn where Betty was killed. Verna feeds Sorells to her pigs and then gathers the family to converge on Hartman's location. At the barn, Hartman takes Elizabeth and the injured Jackson hostage, revealing that Jackson is Jedidiah Sawyer. Verna arrives and Hartman is soon incapacitated by the other Sawyers.|$|E

500|$|Roger Moore {{said he had}} a {{great fear}} of heights, and to do the {{climbing}} in Greece, he resorted to moderate drinking to calm his nerves. Later in that same sequence, Rick Sylvester, a stuntman who had previously performed the pre-credits ski jump in The Spy Who Loved Me, undertook the stunt of Bond falling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff. The stunt was dangerous, since the sudden rope jerk at the bottom could be fatal. Special effects supervisor Derek Meddings developed a system that would dampen the stop, but Sylvester recalled that his nerves nearly got the better of him: [...] "From where we were , you could see the local cemetery; and the box [...] looked like a casket. You didn't need to be an English major to connect the dots." [...] The stunt went off without a problem.|$|E
500|$|On the Kahana, Desmond and Sayid {{are still}} waiting {{to speak to the}} captain of the freighter, Gault (Grant Bowler). When they are taken to see him, Regina (Zoë Bell) jumps <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, having wrapped herself in chains, but Gault dismisses it as [...] "a {{heightened}} case of cabin fever", and asserts that losing her is better than losing several more in saving her. He says that he is employed by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), Desmond's girlfriend's father, and later takes them into his cabin, and tells that [...] Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson) faked the plane crash by expending tremendous resources in the process and procured 324 dead bodies to make everybody believe that all the passengers were dead. Gault proceeds by saying {{that is one of the}} reasons why Mr. Widmore is keen on finding Benjamin Linus [...] and the island. After their meeting, Desmond and Sayid are relocated to a different part of the ship, where they meet Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau, Jr.) working as a deckhand under the alias [...] "Kevin Johnson".|$|E

500|$|Washington, who was {{watching}} the battle {{from the other side}} of the river, sent a note to Magaw asking him to hold out until nightfall, thinking that the troops could be evacuated during the night. By this time, the Hessians had taken the ground between the fort and the Hudson River. Johann Rall was given the honor of requesting the American surrender by Knyphausen. [...] Rall sent Captain Hohenstein, who spoke English and French, under a flag of truce to call for the fort's surrender. Hohenstein met with Cadwalader, and Cadwalader requested that Magaw be given four hours to consult with his officers. [...] Hohenstein denied the request and gave the Americans a half hour to decide. As Magaw was consulting with his officers, Washington's messenger, Captain John Gooch arrived, just before the fort was completely surrounded, with Washington's request to hold out until nightfall. Magaw attempted to get easier terms for his men, who would only be allowed to keep their belongings, but this failed. Magaw announced his decision to capitulate at 3:00 pm, and at 4:00 pm, the American flag was brought down in the fort, replaced by the British flag. Before the surrender, John Gooch leaped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort, tumbled to the bottom of the cliff, evaded musket fire and bayonet stabs, and managed to get onto a boat, arriving at Fort Lee a short while later.|$|E
500|$|By {{spring of}} 1997, the real-life {{backstage}} conflict between Michaels and Hart were reaching its heights. Both men {{were going out}} on television and frequently making personal, true to heart remarks about one another. Michaels briefly left the WWF in June of that year after a real backstage fight with Hart, just hours before a Raw Is War show, which allegedly resulted from Michaels making an on-air remark, known as the [...] "Sunny Days" [...] comment, implying that Hart (who was married at the time) {{was having an affair}} with Tammy Sytch, a Diva who was signed to the WWF as Sunny. Michaels and Austin were still WWF Tag Team Champions at the time during an ongoing feud with the Hart Foundation and a tournament was made to decide new tag team champions. Michaels would eventually return that summer in July. At SummerSlam, Michaels officiated the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. The match ended in controversial fashion, with Michaels hitting Undertaker with a chair (unintentionally, as he was aiming for Hart after he spat in his face). Michaels was then forced to award the championship to his nemesis, Bret Hart. The next night on Raw Is War, signs of a heel turn started to show as Michaels told the WWF fans what happened at SummerSlam was an accident and that he would deal with the Undertaker when the time came. At WWF One Night Only, held in Birmingham, England in September, Michaels defeated The British Bulldog to capture the European Championship. The fans at the event were so appalled at the result of the match they booed Michaels out of the building to the extent that they littered the ring with garbage, cementing his second heel turn. With this win, Michaels became the first Grand Slam Champion. At , Michaels and Undertaker participated in the first Hell in a Cell match, during which Michaels fall <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] high structure through a table and saw him as the winner in the match after the debuting Kane tombstoned his victory bound half-brother, The Undertaker.

2500|$|Not every {{bird species}} builds or uses a nest. Some auks, for instance—including common murre, thick-billed murre and razorbill—lay their eggs {{directly}} onto the narrow rocky ledges they use as breeding sites.

This is critical {{for the survival of}} the developing eggs, as there are no nests to keep them from rolling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff. Presumably because of the vulnerability of their unprotected eggs, parent birds of these auk species rarely leave them unattended. Nest location and architecture is strongly influenced by local topography and other abiotic factors.|$|E
