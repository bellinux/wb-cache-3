40|$|The {{stability}} of squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes is studied. The squashed Kaluza-Klein black hole looks like five dimensional {{black hole in}} the vicinity of horizon and four dimensional Minkowski spacetime with a circle at infinity. In this sense, squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes can be regarded as black holes in the Kaluza-Klein spacetimes. Using the symmetry of squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes, SU(2) × U(1) ≃ U(2), we <b>obtain</b> <b>master</b> equations for a part of the metric perturbations relevant to the stability. The analysis based on the master equations gives a strong evidence for the {{stability of}} squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes. Hence, the squashed Kaluza-Klein black holes deserve to be taken seriously as realistic black holes in the Kaluza-Klein spacetime. Comment: 23 pages, 4 figures, v 2 : Erratum added to en...|$|E
40|$|We specify an experts {{algorithm}} {{with the}} following characteristics: (a) it uses only feedback from the actions actually chosen (bandit setup), (b) it can be applied with countably infinite expert classes, and (c) it copes with losses that may grow in time appropriately slowly.

From this, we <b>obtain</b> <b>master</b> algorithms for "active experts problems", {{which means that the}} master's actions may influence the behavior of the adversary. Our algorithm can significantly outperform standard experts algorithms on such problems. Finally, we combine it with a universal expert class. This results in a (computationally infeasible) universal master algorithm which performs - in a certain sense - almost as well as any computable strategy, for any online problem.

40|$|On the {{elementary}} level, electronic current consists of individual electron tunnelling {{events that are}} separated by random time intervals. The waiting time distribution is a probability to observe the electron transfer in the detector electrode at time t+τ given that an electron was detected in the same electrode at earlier time t. We study waiting time distribution for quantum transport in a vibrating molecular junction. By treating the electron-vibration interaction exactly and molecule-electrode coupling perturbatively, we <b>obtain</b> <b>master</b> equation and compute the distribution of waiting times for electron transport. The details of waiting time distributions are used to elucidate microscopic mechanism of electron transport {{and the role of}} electron-vibration interactions. We find that as nonequilibrium develops in molecular junction, the skewness and dispersion of the waiting time distribution experience stepwise drops with the increase of the electric current. These steps are associated with the excitations of vibrational states by tunnelling electrons. In the strong electron-vibration coupling regime, the dispersion decrease dominates over all other changes in the waiting time distribution as the molecular junction departs far away from the equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} media-independent {{handover}} key management architecture that uses Kerberos for secure key distribution among a server, an authenticator, and a mobile node. With the proposed architecture, signaling for key distribution {{is based on}} re-keying and is decoupled from re-authentication that requires EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) and AAA (Authentication, Authorization and Accounting) signaling similar to initial network access authentication. In this framework, the mobile node is able to <b>obtain</b> <b>master</b> session keys required for dynamically establishing the security associations {{with a set of}} authenticators without communicating with them before handover. By separating re-key operation from re-authentication, the proposed architecture is more optimized for proactive mode of operation. It is also optimized for reactive mode of operation by reversing the key distribution roles between the mobile node and the target access node. This paper discusses how the proposed architecture is applicable to the existing link-layer technologies including IEEE 802. 11 and 802. 16 and across multiple AAA domains. This paper also describes how Kerberos is bootstrapped from initial access authentication using an EAP method. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|E

The {{possibility}} that the asymptotic quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies {{can be used to}} obtain the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for the Schwarzschild black hole — commonly referred to as Hod’s conjecture — has received considerable attention. To test this conjecture, using monodromy technique, {{attempts have been made to}} analytically compute the asymptotic frequencies for a large class of black hole spacetimes. In an earlier work, two of the current authors computed the high frequency QNMs for scalar perturbations of (D+ 2) -dimensional spherically symmetric, asymptotically flat, single horizon spacetimes with generic power-law singularities. In this work, we extend these results to asymptotically non-flat spacetimes. Unlike the earlier analyses, we treat asymptotically flat and de Sitter spacetimes in a unified manner, while the asymptotic anti-de Sitter spacetimes is considered separately. We <b>obtain</b> <b>master</b> equations for the asymptotic QNM frequency for all the three cases. We show that for all the three cases, the real part of the asymptotic QNM frequency – in general – is not proportional to ln(3) thus indicating that the Hod’s conjecture may be restrictive. N...|$|E

40|$|An {{analysis}} of a novel indentation model has been implemented to <b>obtain</b> <b>master</b> curves describing the optimal experimental parameters necessary to achieve the highest possible accuracy in the determination of viscoelastic properties of soft materials. The indentation model is a rigid indenter driven by a compliant measurement system, such as an atomic force microscope or optical tweezers, into a viscoelastic half space. The viscoelastic material {{is described as a}} multiple relaxation Prony series. The results have been extended via an application of a viscoelastic equivalence principle to other physical models such as poroelasticity. Optimisation of the indentation parameters has been conducted over many orders of magnitude of the velocity, viscoelastic moduli, spring stiffness, relaxation times and the duration of indentation resulting in a characteristic master curve. It is shown that using sub-optimal conditions gives the appearance of a more elastic material than is actually the case. For a two term Prony series the ideal ramp duration was found to be approximately one eighth of the relaxation. Also the ideal ramp duration for a three term Prony series was determined and shown to guarantee distinct relaxation times under specific conditions...|$|E

Stress relaxation measurements {{were made in}} uniaxial tension under superposed hydrostatic pressures up to 5 kbar at temperatures ranging from - 25 to 50 [degrees]C. Two lightly filled (Hypalon- 40 and Viton-B) and one highly filled elastomer (Neoprene) were studied because their pressure transition lie {{within the range of}} the apparatus. The construction and operation of the apparatus are discussed. Measurements on Hypalon and Viton were made either by varying the temperature while maintaining the pressure constant at 1, 1, 000, and 2, 000 bars, or by holding the temperature constant while varying the pressure from atmospheric to 4, 600 bars. The viscoelastic response of Neoprene was measured at 25 [degrees]C and pressures up to 4, 600 bars. The measurements were converted to a time dependent shear modulus. Time-temperature and time-pressure superposition was then applied to the reduced data to <b>obtain</b> <b>master</b> curves at 1, 1, 000, and 2, 000 bars. By introducing either the Murnaghan or the Tait equation of state into the free volume theory, an expression was obtained which describes the shift factors, log a[subscript T,P'] resulting from the empirical shifts into the master curves at atmospheric pressure. This equation then gave an excellent prediction of the empirically found shift factors resulting from forming the master curves at 1, 000 and 2, 000 bars. Because the measurements made as function of temperature and those made as a function of pressure must be consistent, certain ambiguities in the free volume theory have been removed. This leads to an essential improvement in the theory...|$|E
