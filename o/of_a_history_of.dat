5|$|The {{partners}} published their History of Quadrupeds in 1790, {{intended for}} children but reaching an adult readership, and its success {{encouraged them to}} consider a more serious work of natural history. In preparation for this Bewick spent several years engraving the wood blocks for Land Birds, the first volume <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> British Birds. Given his detailed knowledge of the birds of Northumberland, Bewick prepared the illustrations, so Beilby was given the task of assembling the text, which he struggled to do. Bewick ended up writing most of the text, {{which led to a}} dispute over authorship; Bewick refused to have Beilby named as the author, and in the end only Bewick's name appeared on the title page, along with a paragraph of explanation {{at the end of the}} preface.|$|E
5|$|William {{wrote an}} account of the Lateran Council and a history of the Islamic states from the time of Muhammad. Neither work survives. He is famous today as the author <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Kingdom of Jerusalem. William {{composed}} his chronicle in excellent Latin for his time, with numerous quotations from classical literature. The chronicle is sometimes given the title Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum ("History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea") or Historia Ierosolimitana ("History of Jerusalem"), or the Historia for short. It was translated into French soon after his death, and thereafter into numerous other languages. Because it is the only source for the history of twelfth-century Jerusalem written by a native, historians have often assumed that William's statements could be taken at face value. However, more recent historians have shown that William's involvement in the kingdom's political disputes resulted in detectable biases in his account. Despite this, he is considered the greatest chronicler of the crusades, {{and one of the best}} authors of the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|As Dean of Christchurch, Hilary {{restored}} the organisation to its traditional round of religious ceremonies {{that had been}} abandoned by his predecessors, as well as securing grants of privileges and lands. He ordered the writing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the church at Christchurch, a book which still survives. Hilary was unsuccessful {{as a candidate for}} the archbishopric of York against Henry Murdac in 1147, but Pope Eugene III chose to compensate him by appointing him to the see of Chichester. His candidacy to York had been supported by Hugh de Puiset, then treasurer of York and later Bishop of Durham, and by Robert of Ghent, who was Dean of York and Lord Chancellor of England, as well as by King Stephen of England. Hilary seems to have received the largest number of votes, but because the election was disputed by Murdac's supporters the result was referred to the papacy, and Eugene chose Murdac. Hilary was appointed to Chichester in July 1147, and he was consecrated on 3 August 1147. Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, consecrated him at Canterbury, with Nigel, the Bishop of Ely, Robert, the Bishop of Bath, and William de Turbeville, the Bishop of Norwich, assisting in the ceremony. For a number of years, Hilary continued to hold the deanship in plurality, which is the holding of two ecclesiastical benefices at once.|$|E
5|$|While bishop, Hervey {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the refounding of the abbey of Ely, which later became {{incorporated into the}} Liber Eliensis. This was a Latin reworking of an Old English book of grants compiled by Bishop Ã†thelwold of Winchester. He was energetic in recovering the feudal rights of the bishopric against knights who had intruded themselves on the lands, but were not rendering knight service to the bishop. As bishop, he attended a legatine council, or council held by a papal legate, in 1127, and a royal council in 1129, but otherwise his administrative actions remain obscure. The causeway between the island of Ely and Exning, which {{made it easier for}} pilgrims to visit the shrine of Saint Ethelreda, was built under Hervey's orders. Insight into his activities as bishop is given in the Pipe Roll of 1130, the first surviving Pipe Roll. In that record, Hervey is recorded as owing King Henry 45 pounds to provide an office for a nephew, 100 pounds on an old settlement with the king, another 100 pounds for the settlement of a case dealing with Ramsey Abbey, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey and the bishop, 240 pounds for the right to be rid of a surplus of knights, and finally 1000 pounds for the king to allow the bishop's knights to serve castleguard at Ely instead of Norwich.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason why}} Odo was {{defeated}} so easily at Bordeaux and Garonne, but had won 11 years earlier at the Battle of Toulouse is simple. At Toulouse, Odo managed a surprise attack against an overconfident and unprepared foe. The Umayyad forces were mostly infantry, and what cavalry {{they did have}} {{never got a chance}} to mobilize. As Herman of Carinthia wrote in one of his translations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> al-Andalus, Odo managed a highly successful encircling envelopment which took the attackers totally by surprise â€“ the result was a chaotic slaughter of the Muslim forces.|$|E

The racketeering charges stemmed from an accusation that LILCO filed false documents {{in order to secure}} rate increases. LILCO sought a dismissal of these charges on the grounds that Suffolk County lacked authority under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and that the allegations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> racketeering did not qualify as a continuing criminal enterprise.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{attracting}} less {{media attention}} than Australian rules football and rugby league, soccer is Australia's highest participation football code. During {{the second half}} of the 20th century many Australian soccer clubs were based around ethnic groups, mostly European. However, the national league was completely reformed in 2004. Australia's national team, the Socceroos, has competed in the finals of four FIFA World Cup championships. In 2006 the Socceroos moved from the Oceania Football Confederation to the Asian Football Confederation, a much stronger confederation which has allowed the Australian team to avoid repetition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> missed World Cup qualifications in forced sudden-death playoffs. Australia won the 2015 AFC Asian Cup. Major international stars from Australia include Tim Cahill, Mark Viduka, Mark Schwarzer and Harry Kewell.|$|E

Throughout {{the last decade of}} the century, his fame as an antiquarian slowly rose, as did the public attention paid to his museum â€“ an object of curiosity to strangers visiting the city. As a result of his studies of Roman remains, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1697; some of his communications appear in their transactions. In the same year he was elected an Assistant, or Common-Councilman, in the Corporation of Leeds. He abandoned his connections with the dissenters in 1699.|$|E
25|$|Many reasons {{have been}} put forward to explain {{the demise of the}} federation. These include the lack of local popular support, {{competing}} insular nationalism, the weakness of the federal government, prohibitions on federal taxation and freedom of movement, inadequacies in the Federal constitution, fundamental changes made to the constitution very early in its existence, political feuds between the influential leaders, the decision of the three most influential politicians not to contest Federal elections, friction between these leaders and the Federal government, the overwhelming concentration of population and resources in the two largest units, geographic and cultural distance between the units, the lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> common administration, and the impact of the period of self-government that followed the promotion from Crown Colony system.|$|E
25|$|With {{his health}} in decline, in 1948 Burdon moved from his farm to Wellington. He was {{contracted}} by the War History Branch, {{the section of}} the Department of Internal Affairs tasked with the production <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand's contribution to the Second World War, to produce an account of the 24th Battalion. One of several volumes of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939â€“45, his book was published in 1953 and was followed two years later with a biography of Richard Seddon. A study of the Christchurch academic, Alexander Bickerton, was produced the next year. Having already had to resort to walking with the assistance of a cane for several years, his research abilities were becoming compromised by his physical condition, which affected his abilities to undertake serious archival work. In 1965, he produced The New Dominion, a social history of New Zealand from 1919 to 1939, but critics noted it was heavily based on newspapers and secondary sources.|$|E
