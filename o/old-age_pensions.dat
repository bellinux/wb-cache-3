5|$|With a {{majority}} of seats in the Labour-Protectionist government, Labour caucus by early 1908 had become restive as {{to the future of}} the Deakin minority government. With the Deakin ministry in trouble, Deakin spoke to Fisher and Watson about a possible coalition, and following a report agreed to it providing Labour had {{a majority}} in cabinet, that there was immediate legislation for <b>old-age</b> <b>pensions,</b> that New Protection was carried and that at the following election the government would promise a progressive land tax. No coalition was formed, however the pressure from Labour brought about productive change by Deakin: he agreed to a royal commission into the post office, <b>old-age</b> <b>pensions</b> were to be provided from the surplus revenue fund and £250,000 set aside for ships for an Australian Navy. New Protection was declared invalid by the High Court in June, Fisher found the tariff proposals of Deakin unsatisfactory, while caucus was also dissatisfied with the old-age pension proposals. Without Labour support the Deakin government collapsed in November 1908.|$|E

Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs.

In 1895 he began to agitate for <b>old-age</b> <b>pensions,</b> but in 1899 he was investigated again after Premier George Reid paid him £350 for writing a report; although Neild repaid the money, the incident was part of the pretext for a successful no confidence motion in September which brought down the Reid government.|$|E

Among other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.|$|E

40|$|The topicality of the {{research}} subject. The foundations of the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> scheme based on notional accounts, {{also referred to as}} the "notional defined contribution" or "non-financial defined contribution" (NDC) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> scheme, were laid in Sweden in 1994, when the prevailing view was that a sus­tainable defined-contribution PAYG <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> scheme is impossible. Since then, the NDC system modifications have been implemented in several countries; since 2000, this scheme is also part of the Latvian pension system and works significantly better than {{the other part of the}} pension system - the funded pension scheme. However, the sustainability of NDC scheme is still being questioned. To prevent the NDC pension system sustainability problems, the authors (Pukis, M., & Dundure, I., 2012) in their publication "The Sustainability of the Pension System in Latvia" and (Dundure, I., 2015), the article "Sustainable <b>Old-age</b> <b>Pension</b> System by Developing Notional Defined Contribution Pension Scheme" have proposed a modified NDC model that provides sustainability of the pension system considering the known risks inherent in the pension system. The aim of the paper is to research and analyse the conditions for building a sustainable pension system by developing a Notional Defined Contribution pension scheme and working out an adjusted (modified) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> calculation formula. In order to achieve the above mentioned aim, the authors set the following tasks:Define the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system based on NDC principles;Define the primary objectives of pension systems and perform analysis of pension adequacy;Define the conditions for achieving a sustainable <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system based on NDC principles;Develop an adjusted (modified) <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> calculation formula based on NDC principles. In order to achieve the established aim and tasks, the following scientific research methods have been used in the work: analytical method, comparative method, logically and abstractedly constructive method. The analytical method and the comparative method are employed for conducting pension adequacy analysis and examination of pension capital indexation and indexation of pensions after retirement, as well as for the purpose of studying the Notional Defined Contribution pension system. The logically and abstractedly constructive method is employed for making forecasts and defining the main research results – the conditions for ensuring pension system sustainability that have been determined by the authors in the course of {{the research}}. The authors proved that by basing on the principle of generation solidarity and equity and through improvement of NDC pension calculation formula, it is possible to create the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system, which would be capable of excluding the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> instability causes...|$|R
5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory <b>old-age</b> <b>pensions</b> and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E

In 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. By the 1999 election, the ANC could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5 million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2 million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3 million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3 million people.|$|E

Using survey data collected by the authors, this paper examines a host of factors which influence migrant workers’ participation in the old-age scheme. The result shows that individual characteristics, employment status, attitudes toward old-age support and perception of the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system significantly differentiate two groups of migrant workers between those that have participated in and their counterparts who have not participated in the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> schemes.

40|$|The {{study on}} which {{this article is based}} {{investigated}} the expenditure patterns of households receiving the state’s <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> grant. The <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> grant is the second-largest social grant {{in terms of the number}} of recipients and the largest when it comes to the monetary cost for the national government. The study looked at households in Kwakwatsi township receiving an <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> grant as the main source of income. The state’s <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> grant is used only for sustenance, and for buying basic household necessities. Food is the biggest household expenditure for pension grant recipients. The pension grant is also used to support additional family members, thereby reducing its distributional impact. Households spend the grant mainly on products that support the daily functioning of the household.

The basic <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> is NIS 1,531 a month, which rises to NIS 1,617 a month after the pensioner turns 80. A seniority increment is added based on the amount of years the pensioner paid contributions, up to a maximum of 50% of the basic pension. Additional increments are available to those living with spouses who do not qualify for an <b>old-age</b> <b>pension,</b> dependent children, and those who are not entitled to a pension or only a small pension which they must first waive. Income supplements to ensure a minimal standard of living are available to those with no additional sources of income other than an <b>old-age</b> <b>pension.</b> Health insurance contributions are deducted from pensions, as well as increments and supplements. Salaried employees not covered by collectively-bargained pension plans with unions are legally required to have private pension plans to which employers must contribute to, and most self-employed persons are also legally required to have private pensions.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the factors that}} {{played a major role}} in development of the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system in Georgia. Based on data collected from 1991 - 2009, this analysis centers on the system’s patterns of development and identifies four main attempts to reform the <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system. Economic performance, demographic aging, domestic political constellations, and external influence are traditionally thought to be responsible for the pension system reforms. Qualitative data analyses and in-depth interviews have been used to test these explanations. This analysis did not confirm the hypotheses, but it revealed that fiscal constraints and international technical assistance were the main factors behind reforms during the first two chronological attempts to change the system. Political factors and liberal economic ideology influenced the patterns of <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> policy development from 2004 – 2008, while the negative outcomes of the Russian-Georgian War and World Financial Crisis are currently the major obstacles for comprehensive pension reforms. The limitations of this study suggest that in order to clarify the exact nature of <b>old-age</b> <b>pension</b> system, shorter time periods and separate reform initiatives should be investigated...|$|R

25|$|From the {{perspective}} of longer term fiscal sustainability, the long-awaited reform of <b>old-age</b> <b>pensions</b> entered into force in 1999. This entails a far more robust system vis-à-vis adverse demographic and economic trends, which should keep the ratio of total pension disbursements to the aggregate wage bill close to 20% in the decades ahead. Taken together, both fiscal consolidation and pension reform have brought public finances back on a sustainable footing. Gross public debt, which jumped from 43% of GDP in 1990 to 78% in 1994, stabilised around {{the middle of the}} 1990s and started to come down again more significantly beginning in 1999.

25|$|A {{month after}} taking office, Campbell-Bannerman called a general election, {{in which the}} Liberals gained a {{landslide}} majority of 132. However, Asquith's first budget, in 1906, was constrained by the annual income and expenditure plans he had inherited from his predecessor Austen Chamberlain. The only income for which Chamberlain had over-budgeted was the duty from sales of alcohol. With a balanced budget, and a realistic assessment of future public expenditure, Asquith was able, in his second and third budgets, to lay the foundations for limited redistribution of wealth and welfare provisions for the poor. Blocked at first by Treasury officials from setting a variable rate of income tax with higher rates on those with high incomes, {{he set up a}} committee under Sir Charles Dilke which recommended not only variable income tax rates but also a super-tax on incomes of more than £5,000 a year. Asquith also introduced a distinction between earned and unearned income, taxing the latter at a higher rate.
