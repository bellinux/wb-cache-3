5|$|For THSRC, {{the over}} heavy {{accounting}} of the fixed cost of fixed assets like rolling stock and infrastructure (depreciation) is a significant non-cash element of total <b>operating</b> costs. In its {{first two years of}} operation, THSRC applied straight-line depreciation, distributing costs evenly over a period of 26.5 years. As a result, the balance of <b>operating</b> revenues and costs (<b>operating</b> income) showed a high loss {{in the first year of}} operation, which was only reduced as revenues grew in the second year. The depreciation period set for THSRC reflected the length of the B.O.T. concession rather than the much longer lifespan of the infrastructure, and it is the factor for the <b>operating</b> loss. After adopting an activity depreciation method which is variable in time, THSRC posted its first <b>operating</b> profit for 2009, the third year of operation. The company reported its first annual profit of NT$5.78 billion for 2011 after five years of operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Microsoft {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM to bundle Microsoft's <b>operating</b> system with IBM computers, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested that Microsoft write a new <b>operating</b> system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft wrote the <b>operating</b> system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E

As a part of porting the game to the PDP-7, Thompson developed his own <b>operating</b> system, which later formed the core of the Unix <b>operating</b> system.

5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above.

In contrast, if the economy is <b>operating</b> below the curve, it is said to be <b>operating</b> inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|DOS (Disk <b>Operating</b> System) was the <b>operating</b> {{system that}} brought the company its real success. IBM first {{approached}} Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M <b>operating</b> system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an <b>operating</b> system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered <b>operating</b> system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E

5|$|Plan 9 {{demonstrated}} that an integral concept of Unix—that every system interface could be {{represented as a}} set of files—could be successfully implemented in a modern distributed system. Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, have been implemented in other <b>operating</b> systems. Unix-like <b>operating</b> systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of rfork, Plan 9's process creation mechanism. Additionally, in Plan 9 from User Space, several of Plan 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity. Several projects seek to replace the GNU <b>operating</b> system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 <b>operating</b> system programs. The 9wm window manager was inspired by 8½, the older windowing system of Plan 9; wmii is also heavily influenced by Plan 9.|$|E
