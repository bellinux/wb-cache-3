5|$|After many failed {{attempts}} {{to steal the}} teddy bear, in desperation, Mr. Burns has Smithers literally beg Homer for the bear. Homer tells Mr. Burns that it is Maggie's now, and {{she is the only}} one that can return it. Mr. Burns decides to talk to Maggie and becomes deeply depressed and asks Maggie to look after his bear. Maggie, in an act <b>of</b> <b>pity,</b> lets the desperate Mr. Burns have the bear.|$|E
5|$|Kyle, Cartman and Kenny {{surprise}} Stan {{by creating}} a Facebook account for him. Stan protests, but is quickly pressured by family and friends to add them as friends. To his annoyance and frustration, Stan finds people such as Randy, his grandmother and even Wendy confronting him over his supposed disregard for them and judging his real-world friendship solely by his Facebook configuration. Meanwhile, Kyle adds shy nerdy student Kip Drordy (anagram: Dorky Drip) to his thriving friends list out <b>of</b> <b>pity.</b> Kyle's number of Facebook friends rapidly declines when he does this, {{in part due to}} a Mad Friends podcast he finds Cartman has set up in which he berates Kyle for choosing a loser as a friend and asserts nobody will want to hang out with Kyle. Kyle understands this, but, on principle and out <b>of</b> <b>pity,</b> cannot bring himself to delete Kip to please others. Desperate to stem the loss of friends, he asks Cartman for advice. Cartman introduces Kyle to Chatroulette as a way to make new friends, which fails as most {{of the people on the}} site are either jacking off or showing their genitals, until Cartman finally finds another Jewish kid named Isiah, who agrees to be Kyle's friend, much to Kyle's delight.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young roguish prince, Fiyero, {{has arrived}} at Shiz. Galinda is charmed when Fiyero shares his life {{philosophy}} ("Dancing Through Life"). They all decide {{to have a}} party that evening. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to invite her to the party, but she convinces him instead to ask Nessarose out <b>of</b> <b>pity,</b> leaving her free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq {{are meant to be}} together and how Galinda helped it happen. When Galinda offers Elphaba a hat to wear to the party, Elphaba begins to wonder if she was wrong about her roommate.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} mother turned toward Meriem, an {{expression}} <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> sorrow erasing the happiness from her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is very {{fortunate}} {{this has been}} discovered in time,' said Philip. 'Instead <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> her, I should rejoice in her escape.' ...|$|R
60|$|So they parted at {{the gate}} of the park, the younger man full of hope and confidence, the elder full <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> misgiving.|$|R
5|$|The legend {{strongly}} {{emphasizes that}} Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland {{which became a}} conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out <b>of</b> <b>pity,</b> but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it does not even mention his burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland {{that it could have}} been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.|$|E
5|$|A paper {{airplane}} {{contest is}} being hosted at Dunder Mifflin {{by a new}} paper supplier. All of the office workers compete against {{each other for a}} $2,000 prize. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) in particular is fiercely competitive, and even as she realizes that she is showing an ugly side of herself to her boyfriend Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), she cannot hold back from smashing a box of packing peanuts when she loses in the semi-finals. After several intense rounds, it comes down to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey). Dwight, who is dating Esther (Nora Kirkpatrick), tries to throw the contest. Angela is flattered by the gesture. However, when Esther expresses her condolences to Angela about her financial situation since her husband separated from her, she realizes that Dwight is letting her win out <b>of</b> <b>pity,</b> not love. Angered, she rebuffs Dwight's pity and lets him win the contest.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture <b>of</b> <b>pity</b> and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "O yes," [...] said Dick, with frigid rhetoric <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> astonishment, [...] "we're {{engaged to}} be married, you see, and I {{naturally}} look after her." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{third of}} the party shook his pipe out, and pursed up his face, which was not an {{attractive}} one, into an expression <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> contempt.|$|R
60|$|He was {{suddenly}} conscious <b>of</b> her <b>pity,</b> <b>of</b> a moistness {{in her eyes}} as she looked at him.|$|R
5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League <b>of</b> <b>Pity,</b> and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film about water safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|An event where {{a scholar}} was once injured {{on the head}} here by a cuju football, and out <b>of</b> <b>pity</b> for his plight, the emperor gave him a {{personal}} gift of twenty-five pints of drinking ale.|$|E
25|$|The {{intention}} of {{the design of the}} doors is to illustrate the Life of Our Lord in its relation with the Holy Mother to whom the church is dedicated and by the general treatment to suggest the idea <b>of</b> <b>pity.</b>|$|E
60|$|Sophy's next visitor {{came up with}} a manly tread, and {{she almost}} feared that she had made herself ill enough for the doctor; but it was Mr. Ferrars, with a kind face <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> sympathy.|$|R
60|$|And {{after the}} first interview, no more doubts on that score were expressed; but the vicar's tone <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> reverence in {{speaking}} of the prisoner was like that of his friends in the High Street.|$|R
60|$|She {{took his}} hand in hers; afraid that he would sit down again, she yet could not help a soft glance into his eyes, and a little rush <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> warmth in the {{pressure}} of her hand.|$|R
25|$|Enraged, Hera or Artemis (some {{accounts}} say both) {{changed her}} into a bear. Arcas almost killed the bear, but Zeus stopped him just in time. Out <b>of</b> <b>pity,</b> Zeus placed Callisto the bear into the heavens, thus the origin of Callisto the Bear as a constellation. Some stories say that he placed both Arcas and Callisto into the heavens as bears, forming the Ursa Minor and Ursa Major constellations.|$|E
25|$|Ella rapidly ages {{as she is}} {{stripped}} of her powers, but after Leon is brought in on her secret and is granted the power to see Thelma, he helps to revive her using the Volta. A friend of Leon's who helped him get Ella {{out of the hospital}} (where she was cared for by Azazeal's lover Perie the Faerie) is tortured by Azazeal and the now teenaged Malachi, who kills him out <b>of</b> <b>pity.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{operations}} in {{observation of the}} Elbe and the relief of a POW camp containing around 100 Belgians the regiment entered Hamburg after the surrender of that city. The condition {{of the city and}} its people made him feel very uncomfortable and his feelings towards the German populace mellowed from that of hate to that <b>of</b> <b>pity.</b> After VE Day he was able to work alongside the Catholic relief agency CCRA based at Greven near Münster, helping displaced persons.|$|E
6000|$|The two elder women {{rose and}} {{regarded}} him with looks <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> disdain. Miss Polson’s glance said [...] "Fool!" [...] plainly; Susan, a simple child of nature, given to expressing her mind freely, said [...] "Blockhead!" [...] with conviction.|$|R
6000|$|Ruth {{advanced}} towards him, {{her face}} grave, her sweet eyes full <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> concern. She placed a hand upon his sleeve. [...] "My poor Richard..." [...] she began, but he shook off her kindly touch, laughing angrily--a mere cackle of irritability.|$|R
6000|$|Then each {{mounted on}} horseback, the {{trumpets}} sounded, the sponsors {{led them to}} their places, and the Prince's clear voice exclaimed, [...] "And so God show the right." [...] One glance <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> sympathy would have filled Richard's arm with fresh vigour.|$|R
25|$|Overwhelmed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} of all his crimes, Oedipus rushes into the palace where he finds his mother-wife, dead by her own hand. Ripping a brooch from her dress, Oedipus blinds himself with it. Bleeding from the eyes, he begs his uncle and brother-in-law Creon, who has just arrived on the scene, to exile him forever from Thebes. Creon agrees to this request. Oedipus begs to hold his two daughters Antigone and Ismene with his hands one more time to have their eyes fill of tears and Creon out <b>of</b> <b>pity</b> sends the girls in to see Oedipus one more time.|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, there was a growing {{tendency}} to make explicit distinction between the condemned and the reader. The condemned was increasingly relegated to his social sphere; he was not seen as a sinner, someone to whom the audience could relate to, but as someone who came from an intellectually and morally inferior class. By the 1760s it was common for the Ordinary to put emphasis on grammatical and orthographic errors of the condemned and to apologise for having as subjects such mean individuals. The Ordinary frequently made claims that the condemned were creatures deserving <b>of</b> <b>pity,</b> suggesting that common criminals lacked the moral and intellectual faculties of the readers and so emphasising the distance between the reader and the condemned.|$|E
25|$|In The Return of the King, Sam single-handedly rescued Frodo from Cirith Ungol and, {{dressed in}} {{scavenged}} Orc-armour, the two {{began to make}} their way across the plateau of Gorgoroth. They finally arrived, against all odds, at Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring could be destroyed. However, Gollum had secretly followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life out <b>of</b> <b>pity,</b> and turned his back on the beaten (but still wily) creature and followed Frodo.|$|E
60|$|The clerk {{gazed at}} him with a smile <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> contempt. Mad, mad; quite mad! The loss of his fortune had, no doubt, unhinged this shareholder's reason. But Guy, never heeding him, rushed out into the street and hailed a passing cab.|$|R
60|$|His humour was one <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> {{patience}} {{for a girl}} that had not the wit to see that to ask him--the most noble d'Ombreval--to die that La Boulaye might live was very much like asking him to sacrifice his life to save a dog's.|$|R
6000|$|And in the sonnet that follows, he accuses her <b>of</b> {{preventing}} <b>pity</b> <b>of</b> him in others, by such [...] "killing mockery" [...] as {{makes him}} wish for death ("la pietà, che 'l vostro gabbo recinde," [...] &c.)[7] ...|$|R
25|$|However, in January 1989, Colin's health deteriorates, and Legg finally {{reveals that}} he has MS. Colin is furious at Legg for lying and threatens to report him to the authorities. Colin spends weeks {{coming to terms with}} the news, but Guido stands by him and Colin {{eventually}} accepts his condition. Problems arise in Colin and Guido's relationship in 1989; Colin begins to believe that Guido is only staying with him out <b>of</b> <b>pity.</b> Colin decides to move to his brother's in Bristol. He opts not to tell Guido that he is going, but a surprise visit from Barry stalls his departure and Guido comes home to see Colin packed and ready to leave. Colin tells Guido that he needs some space and asks him to look after his flat while he sorts himself out. He then leaves Walford whilst his friends wave him goodbye.|$|E
500|$|He disappears {{from the}} series {{continuity}} until [...] (2002), in which Shao Kahn is killed along with Liu Kang by the evil sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, but Ermac remains under his control and wanders Outworld without instructions until {{an encounter with}} blind swordsman Kenshi, who breaks him free of Kahn's spell out <b>of</b> <b>pity.</b> As a token of gratitude, Ermac teaches Kenshi the Telekinetic Slam.|$|E
500|$|In his 1902 novel The Fifth String, a young violinist made a {{deal with}} the Devil for a magic violin with five strings. The first four strings of the violin excited the {{emotions}} <b>of</b> <b>Pity,</b> Hope, Love and Joy. The fifth string would cause the player's own death once played. When the violinist was unable to win the love of the woman he desired, he played upon the death string at what would be his final live concert.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Harris violently nodded. As {{abruptly}} as it came, {{this action}} left her, and then slowly, imperceptibly, her expression changed, {{a look of}} ineffable maternal sweetness came into her face; she seemed to cradle a tiny babe upon her arm. At last she sighed, [...] "Oh, the <b>pity</b> <b>of</b> it, the <b>pity</b> <b>of</b> it!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Rubelle smelt at {{her flowers}} {{with a smile}} <b>of</b> {{malicious}} <b>pity.</b>|$|R
60|$|During this recital Smith {{sat with}} his eyes eagerly fixed upon the speaker's face, {{dwelling}} upon every word. At {{the conclusion of the}} story he dropped {{his face in his hands}} a moment, visibly shuddering. Then again he looked up, and after reading the circle <b>of</b> <b>pitying</b> faces confronting him he bravely met Mr. Merrick's eyes.|$|R
