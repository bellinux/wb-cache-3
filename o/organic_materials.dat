25|$|The {{presence}} of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> can colour a rock black or grey. <b>Organic</b> <b>material</b> is formed from dead organisms, mostly plants. Normally, such material eventually decays by oxidation or bacterial activity. Under anoxic circumstances, however, <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> cannot decay and leaves a dark sediment, rich in <b>organic</b> <b>material.</b> This can, for example, {{occur at the}} bottom of deep seas and lakes. There is little water mixing in such environments, as a result oxygen from surface water is not brought down, and the deposited sediment is normally a fine dark clay. Dark rocks, rich in <b>organic</b> <b>material,</b> are therefore often shales.|$|R

5|$|Dentin is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of dentin {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% <b>organic</b> <b>materials,</b> and 10% water by weight.

5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E

5|$|Carbon-14 (C) is a {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope, {{created in the}} upper atmosphere (lower stratosphere and upper troposphere) by interaction of nitrogen with cosmic rays. It is found in trace amounts on Earth of up to 1 part per trillion (0.0000000001%), mostly confined to the atmosphere and superficial deposits, particularly of peat and other <b>organic</b> <b>materials.</b> This isotope decays by 0.158MeV β emission. Because of its relatively short half-life of 5730years, C is virtually absent in ancient rocks. The amount of C in the atmosphere and in living organisms is almost constant, but decreases predictably in their bodies after death. This principle is used in radiocarbon dating, invented in 1949, which has been used extensively to determine the age of carbonaceous materials with ages up to about 40,000years.|$|E

40|$|We are {{learning}} about a soil <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> {{as a unit}} from diverse media or lay and specialist literature. This informations are not differing the parts and characteristic of the soil complex. There are also terminological discrepancies which lead to incorrect deduction about soil fertility, decrease of topsoil content and poor management.

It is a essential to distinguish the soil components for their different quality and the different origin after transformation precess. My task was a term clarification in soil <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> segmentation. We can divide it in two major groups: primary soil <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> and stable topsoil.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> from one coastal environment to another can increase production in recipient habitats {{in a process}} known as spatial subsidy. Microorganisms drive the generation, transformation, and uptake of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> in shallow coastal environments, but their significance in connecting coastal habitats through spatial subsidies has received limited attention. We address this by presenting a conceptual model of coastal connectivity that focuses on the flow of microbially mediated <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> in key coastal habitats. Our model suggests {{that it is not the}} difference in generation rates of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> between coastal habitats but the amount of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> assimilated into microbial biomass and respiration that determines the amount of material that can be exported from one coastal environment to another. Further, the flow of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> across coastal habitats is sensitive to environmental change as this can alter microbial remineralization and respiration rates. Our model highlights microorganisms as an integral part of coastal connectivity and emphasizes the importance of including a microbial perspective in coastal connectivity studies. © 2016 The Authors.

5|$|Dissolved {{oxygen in}} fresh water is {{measured}} {{to indicate the}} health {{of plant and animal}} life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Except for water, {{the only}} other {{compound}} identified {{on the surface of}} Ariel by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide (CO2), which is concentrated mainly on its trailing hemisphere. Ariel shows the strongest spectroscopic evidence for CO2 of any Uranian satellite, and was the first Uranian satellite on which this compound was discovered. The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear. It might be produced locally from carbonates or <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> {{under the influence of the}} energetic charged particles coming from Uranus's magnetosphere or solar ultraviolet radiation. This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution, as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere. Another possible source is the outgassing of primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Ariel's interior. The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to past geological activity on this moon.|$|E

Yet the most common mapping method of these features is based on visual, qualitative interpretation of air-photos.
