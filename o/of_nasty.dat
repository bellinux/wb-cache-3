5|$|The Master and Mistress buy {{a female}} collie puppy named Lady to be Lad's {{companion}} and mate. Lad becomes her protector and slave, as she bullies {{him from his}} food and {{the best places to}} lie, and endures the flashes <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> temper that lead her to bite his ears and paws. As she grows older, she becomes a generally well-behaved house dog, but when she is eight months old, she tries to attack a beloved mounted bald eagle belonging to the Master. He whips her and then locks her in a shed for the night as punishment; however, during the night it catches on fire. Lad desperately tries to break down the door to free her, then howls in agony, before jumping through its high window to join Lady inside. The Master, awakened by Lad's howl, arrives in time to free them both, though both have badly burned coats.|$|E
25|$|His next fight saw Booth, who now had {{a record}} of 20-1 {{challenge}} once again for the European flyweight title. This time the opponent was Russian Alexander Mahmutov and the fight was {{to be in the}} Spanish capital Madrid. Booth's second career defeat once again came when challenging for European honours losing the bout again on points over 12 rounds. Booth was hoping to make it third time lucky when in June 2001 he challenged once again for the title. Mahmutov had vacated and the vacant title was up for grabs with Booth travelling back to France to face Mimoun Chent. The dream was not to be realised however when the fight was stopped in the seventh round due to a series <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> cuts around the Frenchman's eyes, Booth ended up losing on a technical decision.|$|E
25|$|For those {{grounded}} in the RPG tradition, the very first release of Call of Cthulhu created a brand new framework for table-top gaming. Rather than the traditional format established by Dungeons & Dragons, which often involved the characters wandering through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced {{the concept of the}} Onion Skin: Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the Player Characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, CoC assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe {{way to deal with the}} vast majority <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> things described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run CoC campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy in Variety {{wrote that}} [...] "the real {{accomplishment}} {{of the film}} lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe. Where Burton's ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know, but {{the result is a}} seamless, utterly consistent universe full <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> notions about societal deterioration, greed and other base impulses." [...] He praised the contributions of Stan Winston, Danny Elfman, Bo Welch and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and in terms of performances, opined that [...] "the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains", calling DeVito [...] "fascinating" [...] and Pfeiffer [...] "very tasty." ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{recorded}} {{an early}} version of [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] during the first day of sessions for their album Rubber Soul, on 12 October 1965. The session took place at EMI Studios in London, with George Martin producing. Titled [...] "This Bird Has Flown", the song was extensively rehearsed by the group, who then taped the rhythm track in a single take, featuring two 12-string acoustic guitars, bass, and a faint sound of cymbals. Harrison added his sitar part, with the take emphasising the drone quality of the instrument more so than the remake that was eventually released. The sound of the sitar proved difficult to capture, according to sound engineer Norman Smith, who recalled problems with [...] "a lot <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> peaks and a very complex wave form". He declined to use a limiter, which would have fixed the technical problem with distortion, but would have affected the sound.|$|E

500|$|The writers for {{the film}} {{magazine}} Empire listed Drive as their number one film of 2011.

[...] Travers also said, [...] "Prepare to be blown away by Albert Brooks. Brooks' performance, veined with dark humor and chilling menace (watch him with a blade), deserves to have Oscar calling." [...] The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern also praised Brooks's performance, calling his villainous performance [...] "sensational." [...] James Rocchi of The Playlist gave the film an A letter grade, and wrote that [...] "Drive works as a great demonstration of how, when there's true talent behind the camera, entertainment and art are not enemies but allies." [...] Rocchi placed Drive as his number one film of 2011.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} scored by series {{composer}} Mark Snow, and was, according to him, his best episode {{score of the}} fifth season. He described the main theme as [...] "a very dark, macabre, insidious sort <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> waltz". The episode's main theme is also greatly inspired by The Elephant Mans theme song by John Morris. Three songs are heard in the versions sung by Cher during the episode: [...] "The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore", [...] "Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves" [...] and [...] "Walking in Memphis". The latter is played {{at the end of}} the episode when the agents take The Great Mutato to a Cher concert. In the episode, the character watches Cher's 1985 movie Mask, and derives comfort from the loving relationship between Cher's character and her son, who has a disfiguring genetic bone disorder. At the end of the episode, Mulder and Scully take The Great Mutato from his small town to a Cher concert, where she picks him out of the crowd to dance.|$|E
500|$|Turpin {{most likely}} became {{involved}} with the Essex gang of deer thieves in the early 1730s. [...] Deer poaching had long been endemic in the Royal Forest of Waltham, and in 1723 the Black Act (so called because it outlawed the blackening or disguising of faces while in the forests) was enacted {{to deal with such}} problems. [...] Deer stealing was a domestic offence that was judged not in civil courts, but before Justices of the peace; it was not until 1737 that the more severe penalty of seven years' transportation was introduced. [...] However, in 1731 seven verderers became so concerned by the increase in activity that they signed an affidavit which demonstrated their worries. [...] The statement was lodged with Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who responded by offering a £10 reward to anyone who helped identify the thieves, plus a pardon for those thieves who gave up their colleagues. Following a series <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> incidents, including the threatened murder of a keeper and his family, in 1733 the government increased the reward to £50 (about £ as of [...] ).|$|E

Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{described}} the episode as [...] "a nasty episode that doesn't quite cohere into the level <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> it could", but that the series [...] "doesn't do horror/action all that often, and it serves as a good change of pace if nothing else". He gave [...] "Conspiracy" [...] a score of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, who reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that while [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was a [...] "hard episode to forget", it was not quite as good as he remembered and did not quite [...] "fit" [...] with the rest of the season. He thought that certain parts of the plot were [...] "idiotic", and the Admirals reminded him of a [...] "Bond villain convention". He gave the episode an overall grade of B, writing, [...] "fingers crossed that next time we encounter a danger this sinister, the writers know how to handle it".|$|E
500|$|He {{released}} goalkeeper Brian Horne, who {{he described}} as a [...] "fat slob"; this {{proved to be an}} unpopular move with [...] "a lot <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> people who support Hartlepool... who purport to support this club [...] would rather back fat professional players than people who really care about Hartlepool United". As his replacement he signed Stephen Pears from Liverpool, as well as young defenders Glen Davies and Chris McDonald, teenage winger David Clegg, Exeter City midfielder Mark Cooper, and Blackpool midfielder Chris Beech. Hartlepool started the 1996–97 campaign with wins over Colchester United and Fulham, but his playing career came to an end after the fifth game of the season, against Wigan Athletic, when he retired due to a persistent knee injury. He continued to bemoan refereeing decisions which seemed to consistently go against Hartlepool. This in turn led to continued punishments from the FA over his use of foul language towards officials. With his team on a poor run of results {{at the foot of the}} table, he left the club by mutual consent on 4 November 1996. His assistant Mick Tait led the club to a 20th-place finish, and organised a benefit match for Houchen against Middlesbrough, which raised £23,000.|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern from The Wall Street Journal {{wrote that}} the movie manages to keep a hold on its audience's attention. He thought that Douglas {{measured}} up to Gekko's standards in the film, believing {{that he was the}} only actor to sustain a [...] "sense <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> fun", and felt that LaBeouf's effectiveness was within the range of the film-maker's direction, but was unimpressed with Brolin's portrayal of James. He concluded that the script takes an unconvincing jab at Gekko's [...] "spiritual regeneration," [...] which was due to a scene that he considered to be [...] "inherently illogical and emotionally inert." [...] The Daily Telegraphs David Gritten said that Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps lacked the [...] "punch" [...] of the original film and was annoyed by the number of cameos throughout the film. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps received three out of five stars from Stephen Lambrechts of IGN Australia. Lambrechts felt that Stone's growth as a film director might mirror Gekko's as a person; having had used time to calm down over the years and settle into a more relaxed state of being. He concluded that the film's final result is not [...] "quite the incendiary attack that it could have been, but it still has plenty to say while also managing to be an entertaining crowd pleaser." ...|$|E

500|$|When the War of the Second Coalition {{began in}} early 1799, Nauendorf {{fought in the}} Austrian {{victories}} at Ostrach (21March) and then at Stockach (25March). [...] In early March he led the Advanced Guard of 17,000 across the Lech River by Augsburg, to deploy at Ostrach, a village about [...] of the Danube River, and less than [...] from the Free Imperial City of Pfullendorf. [...] Jourdan's Army of the Danube had crossed the Rhine on 1March, and moved east to cut communication between the main Austrian force, quartered near Augsburg, and the Austrian troops in northern Italy. [...] At Ostrach, his Advanced Guard sustained the immediate shock of contact, but the main force of the army {{was less than a}} day behind him, and Archduke Charles, the commander of the Austrian force, divided his army into three assault columns to make a simultaneous attack at three points on the French line; after a day <b>of</b> <b>nasty</b> fighting, the Austrians flanked the French at the north and south, and threatened to break through the line in the middle. [...] The French withdrew to Mösskirch, and then to Engen and Stockach, where, on 25March, the fighting renewed. At Stockach, Nauendorf again commanded the Austrian advanced guard, which was composed of troops seasoned, as he had been, in the Habsburg border wars. The advanced guard, or Vorhut, was redeployed before the battle as the center of the main Austrian line, and took the brunt of the initial fighting.|$|E

[...] Mesfin Fekadu from the Associated Press described [...] "Haunted" [...] as a [...] "gloomy" [...] song. Writing for the website The 405, editor White Caitlin felt the singer offered part of her insecurities and flaws through the song and [...] "sheds slut-shaming, the shackled role of uptight matriarch or calculated star". Facts Chris Kelly described its composition as [...] "foreboding" [...] and found a [...] "seductive" [...] and [...] "haunting" [...] hook; he further described the first part as [...] "smoky ethereality". Mojos Priya Elan felt that some of the lines were a [...] "nihilistic streak". In a review for The Quietus, Mof Gimmers described [...] "Haunted" [...] as a [...] "perfect slice of vanguard-pop". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described it as a [...] "two-part dream". Robert Leedham of the website Drowned in Sound felt that the album's [...] "confessional moments are when you connect with it the most", exemplifying the statement with lyrics from [...] "Haunted".

AllMusic reviewer Andy Kellman also chose [...] "Haunted" [...] as one of the highlights on Beyoncé.
