5|$|Because banded sea kraits {{spend much}} of their time on land, they are often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found in the water intake and exhaust pipes <b>of</b> <b>boats.</b> Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
5|$|In coastal regions, {{dolphins}} run {{the risk}} of colliding with boats. Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving behavior in the presence and absence <b>of</b> <b>boats.</b> Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels. Driving behavior, speed, engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety.|$|E

5|$|After Lee's death, {{his wife}} Emma {{continued}} {{to operate the}} ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below {{the confluence of the}} Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee's Backbone segment. However, this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from snowmelt. In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family. In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River to reduce the risk <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> washing downstream during high water.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{deployed}} his own forces {{along the}} whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber {{where they were}} slaughtered and drowned. The battle was brief: Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge. Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under {{the force of a}} Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge <b>of</b> <b>boats,</b> but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.|$|E
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{hurricane}} moved from Connecticut through the Springfield area. There {{was a small}} F1 tornado in Middlesex County that damaged trees. High winds knocked over thousands of trees, and about 500,000 people statewide lost power. Heavy rainfall caused stream flooding, although the heaviest damage was from the winds. The hurricane destroyed a radio tower in Framingham and damaged hundreds of homes in the eastern portion of the state. Along the coast, the storm tide caused minor coastal flooding and damaged hundreds <b>of</b> <b>boats.</b> Across Massachusetts, damage was estimated at $61 million, including $6 million from crop damage.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} {{standard}} USCG practice, <b>boats</b> <b>of</b> this size have hull numbers {{and are not}} named.

In the case <b>of</b> the RB-M <b>boats,</b> the hull numbers begin with 601. Thus the first boat will be RB-M 45601.|$|R

5|$|In South Korea, the {{government}} issued a typhoon warning {{for the southern}} portion of the country along the coast, prompting the airport at Pohang to close, and forcing 162flights to be canceled. Ferry service was also disrupted, and thousands <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> returned to port. The storm also prompted 138schools to close in the region. Earlier, the storm spurred fears of a possible repeat of either typhoon Rusa in 2002 or Maemi in 2003, {{both of which were}} devastating storms in South Korea. Officials in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning for Vladivostok, advising boats to remain at port.|$|E
5|$|In early 1916, UB-7 and UB-8 {{were still}} {{cruising}} in the Black Sea out of Varna. The Germans {{did not have}} good luck in the Black Sea, which was not a priority for them. The Bulgarians, who saw {{the value of the}} submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase UB-7 and UB-8. Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there. The transfer of UB-8 to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916, but for reasons unreported in sources, UB-7 remained under the German flag.|$|E
5|$|On {{learning}} {{that they had}} been outmanoeuvred, the allied commanders debated their options. They decided to march south to Tadcaster and Cawood, where they could both protect their own supply lines from Hull, and also block any move south by Rupert {{on either side of the}} Ouse. Their foot (infantry), ordnance and baggage set off early on 2 July, leaving the cavalry and dragoons, commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax, as rearguard. At about 9am, the allied generals learned that Rupert's army had crossed the captured bridge <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> at Poppleton, and was advancing onto Marston Moor. The Covenanter and Parliamentarian foot, some of whom had already reached Tadcaster, were hastily recalled.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, more allied guns were in line and the fire intensified. In desperation, Cornwallis {{attempted}} to evacuate his troops across the York River to Gloucester Point. At Gloucester Point the troops {{might be able to}} break through the allied lines and escape into Virginia and then march to New York. One wave <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> made it across but a squall hit when they returned to take more soldiers across, making the evacuation impossible.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Fobney Lock and the {{associated}} water treatment works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At County Lock the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as Brewery Gut. Because of poor visibility and the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled {{by a set of}} maritime traffic lights. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's The Oracle shopping centre.|$|E
5|$|Some of the ferry's six {{proposed}} routes {{were originally}} {{supposed to be}} operational in June 2017, but the implementation date was later moved to May 1. Under the 2015 plan, the whole system is expected to come into full service by 2018. The system includes routes that were formerly under NY Waterway, most notably the East River route. There {{would be at least}} 18 boats needed for rush-hour operation. Twelve boats would be deployed in 2017, while the other six would be put in service the next year. The number <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> was later revised slightly to 20, including three boats that would be upgraded later.|$|E

5|$|Storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} from Savannah, Georgia to Fort Pierce, Florida {{subsequent to the}} discovery of the hurricane. The National Weather Bureau advised all small craft to remain at port and recommended residents in the northern Bahamas to take immediate precautions. On Grand Bahama, the threat of Hurricane Able resulted in a construction crew to evacuate further inland; the crew was constructing an observation post for guiding long-range missiles from Cape Canaveral. Fishermen on dozens <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> left the open ocean for safety on two Bahamian islands, while two airplanes safely rode out the hurricane. Small craft warnings and storm warnings were later issued from North Carolina through New England.|$|E
5|$|The {{four hours}} passed with no reply, and Salvori began formulating his {{plan of attack}} against Tripoli. Though the Sardinian {{commander}} had initially wished to use his squadron's frigates in {{the assault on the}} city, the seas were too rough to ensure their safety close to shore, so he instead made plans to attack Tripoli using several boats from his squadron's vessels. Sivori placed 260 men in ten boats separated into three divisions under the command of Commercios Lieutenant Giorgio Mamelli. One division would attack the Tripolitanian brig, another the schooners, and the third group <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> would assault the city's dockyard and customs house to ensure no reinforcements could enter the harbor.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{initially}} brought {{heavy rainfall}} to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Upon striking Bangladesh, Cyclonic Storm Akash produced a moderate storm tide, along with strong winds and heavy rains. The storm left dozens <b>of</b> <b>boats</b> missing, with three fisherman confirmed killed and another 50missing. Near the coast, thousands of houses were damaged from the flooding {{caused by the}} storm. In Burma, its storm tide caused some coastal flooding. In all, 14 {{people were killed and}} damages amounted to US$982million.|$|E

A timber merchant called John Boxold owned barges in 1815 and 1832, while in 1820, a company began running regular freight services to London, using three barges based near the town quay. By 1823 they had ten barges, which had reduced to seven by 1830, and barges ran twice-weekly to Chichester, London, Midhurst, and Petworth. The company was variously called Seward and Co., The Arundel Barge Co., and several other names.|$|E

Brook writes that it was quite a comfortable privilege for disgraced and dismissed officials to be escorted by the courier service, yet even this saving of face was still a firm reminder of their banishment from court.|$|E
