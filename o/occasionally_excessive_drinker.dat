40|$|Abstract — The aim of {{our study}} was to answer the {{following}} questions: (1) is thiamine deficient in chronic excessive drinkers; and (2) is peripheral neuropathy associated with thiamine deficiency or with alcohol intake itself? We performed direct assays of blood concentrations of free thiamine and thiamine phosphate in <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> with or without peripheral neuropathy and in control subjects. We found no difference in free thiamine concentrations between <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> with. and without neuropathy, and no difference in free thiamine concentrations between the two groups of <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> and the control group. By contrast, a deficiency in thiamine phosphate was observed in each group of <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> compared to the control group. This was reflected in blood concentrations of total thiamine which were also lower in <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> than in controls. Finally, the thiamine phosphate: free thiamine ratio was slightly but significantly lower in the two groups of <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> than in the control group. Both groups of <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> showed typical moderate liver disease of alcoholic origin. In conclusion, the free thiamine fraction was not diminished in this group of alcoholic hospital inpatients. Thiamine deficiency would not therefore appear to play a determining role in the onset of peripheral neuropathy. In contrast, the phosphorylated fraction was slightly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Excessive alcohol {{consumption}} kills approximately 75, 000 people {{annually in the}} United States. Although alcohol screening among primary care patients is recommended by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, it is rarely performed. It is unclear whether low screening rates are due to limited access to health care, missed screening opportunities during patient visits, or both. Methods Data came from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a population-based telephone survey of noninstitutionalized U. S. adults. Current health insurance status {{and a history of}} a recent medical checkup (within 2 years) were assessed in relation to {{alcohol consumption}} status. <b>Excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> included those who reported binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one or more occasions in the past month), heavy drinking (consuming more than 60 drinks in the past month for men or more than 30 for women), or both. Results The prevalence of excessive drinking among the general population (17 %) was only slightly higher than the prevalence among those with current health insurance (15 %) or a recent checkup (14 %). Among <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers,</b> 79 % had current health insurance and 78 % had a recent checkup. Although <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> were somewhat less likely to have health insurance or a recent checkup compared with nonexcessive drinkers and nondrinkers, these differences were less pronounced after stratifying by age. <b>Excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> with the lowest rates of health insurance were young, Hispanic, less educated, and unemployed. However, most <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> who lacked insurance or a checkup were employed. Conclusion Most <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> were insured and had a recent medical checkup, suggesting that low screening rates among <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> are mostly due to missed screening opportunities rather than a lack of screening opportunities.

40|$|Introduction and Aims. This study {{aimed at}} {{comparing}} adolescent abstainers, consumers and <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> {{in terms of}} family characteristics (structure of family, socioeconomic factors), perceived social support, personality characteristics (extraversion, self-esteem, aggression) and well-being. Design and Methods. Cross-sectional data were obtained from 3694 elementary school students in the 8 th and 9 th grades from several cities in Slovakia (mean age 14. 5, 49. 0 % men; response rate 93 %). Respondents completed questions {{on the use of}} alcohol and on family structure (parental divorce), the socioeconomic position of the family (parents' education and family affluence), perceived social support, extraversion, self-esteem, aggression and psychological well-being. They were split into three groups based on the pattern of alcohol use-abstainers, consumers and <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> (i. e. being drunk at least once during the past 4 weeks). Results. The results showed significant differences between abstainers, consumers and <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> in almost every characteristic explored. A risky pattern of alcohol consumption occurs more frequently among adolescents who have divorced parents, higher socioeconomic position, higher scores for perceived social support from friends, extraversion, negative self-esteem and aggression, and lower scores for social support from family and for well-being. Discussion and Conclusions. A risky pattern of alcohol consumption is more likely among relatively easily identifiable groups of adolescents from high socioeconomic position and divorced families. Their personalities and social networks have characteristics that could be accommodated in preventive interventions as well. [Tomcikova Z, Madarasova Geckova A, van Dijk JP, Reijneveld SA.

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{current study}} was {{undertaken}} to carefully assess the accuracy of routinely used laboratory tests in detecting excessive/recent alcohol use. We also determined the kinetics of these markers in subjects who underwent an intensive alcohol rehabilitation program. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 210 nonexcessive <b>drinkers,</b> 272 <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers,</b> and 76 with alcoholic cirrhosis. To determine the kinetics of these markers during alcohol abstinence, we followed 45 subjects with history of excessive alcohol use for 12 weeks during the intensive alcohol treatment program. RESULTS: Percentage of carbohydrate deficient transferrin (%CDT) provided the highest diagnostic performance (area under the curve [AUC] 0. 77) followed by gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) (AUC 0. 68) to detect <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers.</b> The percentage of <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> with aspartate aminotransferase:alanine aminotransferase (AST:ALT) > 2 was only 2 %, whereas 51 % of subjects with alcoholic cirrhosis had AST:ALT > 2. In the multivariate analysis, the levels of GGT and %CDT {{were associated with the}} level of alcohol consumed during the past 30 days. The levels of GGT, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and %CDT were significantly lower compared to those at baseline before alcohol rehabilitation, whereas the AST, ALT, and AST:ALT ratio were unchanged. The percent reduction was ~ 2. 7 % (for MCV), 19 % (for GGT), and 43 % (for %CDT) {{at the end of the}} 12 -week follow-up compared to the baseline. CONCLUSIONS: %CDT are useful markers to screen for excessive alcohol use and for follow-up of abstinence. Most subjects with excessive alcohol use do not have a high AST:ALT ratio. Rather, the AST:ALT > 2 is suggestive of alcoholic cirrhosis. The performance of the %CDT to screen for heavy alcohol use is still not ideal.

40|$|BACKGROUND A quick {{method of}} {{assessing}} readiness to change {{was needed for}} a major study of implementing screening and alcohol brief intervention in England. For this purpose, a Readiness Ruler that had been validated among a sample of male college students in the USA was adapted and applied {{to a sample of}} <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> in a general medical practice located in a deprived area of Gateshead, England. METHODS 72 participants identified as <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> by health professionals completed a single-item Readiness Ruler, the 12 -item Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ) and the AUDIT questionnaire. RESULTS In terms of concurrent validity, the relationships between the Readiness Ruler, on the one hand, and either stage of change allocation or a dimensional score derived from the RCQ, on the other hand, were highly significant but weaker than expected. When patients who endorsed the "maintenance" point on the Readiness Ruler were excluded from the analysis, the above relationships were considerably strengthened for reasons that are discussed. On this basis and with another small change, a final Readiness Ruler was developed. CONCLUSION If the validity of the Readiness Ruler is confirmed in subsequent research, a quick and simple way of measuring readiness to change will be available for research or clinical work with alcohol brief interventions...|$|R

Methods: Alcohol and illicit drug use were assessed using a self-report questionnaire filled in by the patients, and by combining self-report with staff judgement on alcohol and illicit drug use. Results: Data on alcohol use (self-reported and staff judgement combined) resulted in prevalence rates of 4. 9 – 18. 2 %. Patients positive for alcohol {{are more likely to}} be male, aged 48 – 58 years, more likely to be a frequent <b>excessive</b> <b>drinker,</b> and to have injuries as a result of violence.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Two {{types of}} social norm message frame for {{encouraging}} seeking of alcohol-related health information by <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> were compared: (a) {{how much the}} average person actually drinks and (b) how their drinking ranks among others. It was hypothesized, in accordance with recent evidence of how the brain represents value, that Frame (b) {{would be more effective}} than Frame (a). This is the first test comparing these frames in any domain of social norms research. METHOD: U. K. university students with excessive alcohol intake (n = 101; 66 female) were sent 4 weekly messages containing 1 of 4 types of information depending upon the experimental condition to which each participant was randomly allocated: (a) official alcohol consumption guidelines, (b) how their alcohol consumption compared with official guidelines, (c) how their consumption compared with the sample mean, or (d) how their consumption ranked among the sample. They then had the opportunity to request up to 3 types of alcohol-related health information. RESULTS: Participants informed of how their consumption ranked were more likely to request information (p <. 01, odds ratio = 6. 0) and tended to request a greater number of types of information (p <. 01, Wald = 7. 17) than those in other conditions.

40|$|A self {{administered}} questionnaire, {{the health}} survey questionnaire, {{was designed to}} detect excessive alcohol consumption and mailed to patients who were registered with two general practices. Replies were received from 2572 (75 %) of 3452 patients. Excessive consumption was taken as 42 units of alcohol per week or more for men and 21 units per week or more for women: 1 unit = approximately 10 g ethanol and is equivalent to a half pint of beer, one glass of wine, or one standard measure of spirits. One hundred and twenty men (11 %) and 68 women (5 %) were identified by their responses to the questionnaire as <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers.</b> According to their responses, roughly half of these expressed some concern about their drinking. In the practice where a disease register was kept 18 patients had been recorded as heavy drinkers before the study, and an additional 74 were detected by the questionnaire. Within 12 months after the questionnaire survey three groups of respondents were reviewed: (a) the <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers,</b> (b) those who indicated concern about drinking but did not exceed the limits for excessive consumption, and (c) {{a random sample of}} those who were in neither of these two categories. Patients in these three groups were interviewed in a standard fashion to determine their alcohol consumption. Breath alcohol measurement was also carried out and a blood sample taken for the estimation of mean cell volume, gamma glutamyltranspeptidase activity, and serum aspartate transaminase activity. There were highly significant correlations between estimates of consumption obtained by the questionnaire and those obtained at interview except among the women who were excessive consumers, whose responses to the questionnaire indicated levels of consumption that were much higher than those to which they admitted at interview. Stated weekly consumption at interview that was above the limits set for the study was used as the standard measure for comparing the questionnaire with the other indicators of excessive drinking.

40|$|Patients with {{alcoholic}} {{liver disease}} {{have been reported}} to have a significantly lower percentage of body fat (%BF) than controls. The mechanism for the reduction in %BF in heavy alcohol users has not been elucidated. In adipose tissue, Pref- 1 is specifically expressed in pre-adipocytes but not in adipocytes. Pref- 1 inhibits adipogenesis and elevated levels are associated with reduced adipose tissue mass. We investigated the association between serum Pref- 1 and %BF, alcohol consumption, and serum free fatty acids (FFA) in a well-characterized cohort of heavy alcohol users compared to controls. One hundred forty-eight subjects were prospectively recruited. The Time Line Follow-Back (TLFB) questionnaire was used to quantify the amount of alcohol consumed over the 30 -day period before their enrollment. Anthropometric measurements were performed to calculate %BF. Serum Pref- 1 and FFA were measured. Fifty-one subjects (mean age 32 ± 9 years, 88 % men) were non-excessive drinkers whereas 97 were <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> (mean age 41 ± 18 years, 69 % men). Compared to non-excessive <b>drinkers,</b> individuals with <b>excessive</b> drinking had significantly higher levels of Pref- 1 (p< 0. 01), FFA (p < 0. 001), and lower %BF (p = 0. 03).

In the THP group, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the prevalence of excessive alcohol drinking were decreased, and nutritional score was improved, although BMI was increased. In contrast, SBP, BMI and the ratio of <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> were all increased in the controls. Multiple regression analysis of the THP group showed that the reduction in SBP was positively associated {{with the increase in}} maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) and physical activity scores, as well as the decrease in BMI. In sub-group analyses of the THP group, VO 2 max and physical activity scores were increased, and BMI did not change in the sub-group with marked BP decrease. In the sub-group with marked BP increase, however, BMI was increased, and VO 2 max was decreased. The ratio of <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> was reduced only in the sub-group with marked BP decrease. The obese-hypertensive subjects in the THP group showed decreases in BMI and BP, and increases in VO 2 max.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To improve blood {{pressure}} control among hypertensive (> 140 / 90 mmHg) <b>excessive</b> alcohol <b>drinkers.</b> DESIGN [...] Fourteen worksite physicians were randomised onto an intervention group and a control group. The intervention {{was based on}} training the worksite physicians and follow up of those hypertensive subjects defined as <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers.</b> Follow up was based on self monitoring of alcohol consumption by the subject, {{in view of the}} results of their gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity determination. SETTING [...] Fourteen workplaces in France - mainly in the industrial sector. SUBJECTS [...] Altogether 15 301 subjects were screened by the 14 physicians: 129 of these were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] This was the difference between the initial systolic {{blood pressure}} (SBP) and the SBP one year later (delta BP). Secondary criteria were the difference between the initial and final diastolic blood pressure (delta DBP) and delta BP at two years; antihypertensive treatment; state alcohol consumption (delta AC); delta GGT; and body mass index (delta BMI). RESULTS [...] The decrease in SBP levels was significantly larger in the intervention group than in the control group: at one year, delta SBP values were - 11. 9 (15. 6) mmHg and - 4. 6 (13. 8) respectively (p < 0. 05). This benefit was still observed after two years of follow up (- 13. 8 (17. 4) mmHg v - 7. 5 (14. 2) mmHg (p < 0. 05)). No difference was observed in DBP. The percentage of treated subjects did not differ between groups. At one year, delta AC was larger in the intervention group (- 2. 8 (5. 2) U/d) than in the control group (- 1. 6 (3. 4) (p < 0. 1)). delta GGT and delta BMI did not differ between the two groups. A weak positive correlation was observed between delta AC and delta SBP (r = 0. 16).

However, the potential of both General Practitioners and primary health care nurses to reduce the prevalence of alcohol related problems contrasts sharply with current practice. This Doctorate of Philosophy by published work is based on a programme of research, using the principles of social marketing, to disseminate and implement screening and brief alcohol intervention in primary health care. The submission includes a series of papers, published in a variety of peer-reviewed journals. Although the papers included in this thesis address different research questions and report a range of research techniques each makes a contribution to the field of screening and brief alcohol intervention. Publications reveal that General Practitioners remain unaware of the evidence for screening and brief alcohol intervention. While effective dissemination and implementation strategies are available, General Practitioners exhibit selective provision of screening and brief alcohol intervention. This is also the case for primary health care nurses. Although health professionals often cite negative patient reactions, patients consider screening and brief alcohol intervention appropriate when carried out under suitable conditions.

Objective: Two types of social norm message frame for encouraging seeking of alcoholrelated health information by <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> were compared: (a) how much the average person actually drinks, and (b) how their drinking ranks amongst others. It was hypothesized, in accordance with recent evidence of how the brain represents value, that frame (b) {{would be more effective}} than frame (a). This is the first test comparing these frames in any domain of social norms research. Methods: United Kingdom university students with excessive alcohol intake (n = 101, 66 female) were sent four weekly messages containing one of four types of information depending upon the experimental condition to which each participant was randomly allocated: (1) Official alcohol consumption guidelines; (2) how their alcohol consumption compared to official guidelines; (3) how their consumption compared to the sample mean; or (4) how their consumption ranked amongst the sample. They then had the opportunity to request up to 3 types of alcohol-related health information. Results: Participants informed of how their consumption ranked were more likely to request information (p <. 01, OR = 6. 0) and tended to request a greater number of types of information (p <. 01, Wald = 7. 17) than those in other conditions. Conclusions: Informing <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> of how their alcohol consumption ranked was more effective in eliciting their seeking of alcohol-related health information than informing them of how their consumption compared to the mean. Research investigating the effectiveness of this message frame in social norms interventions more generally is needed.

40|$|Aims. To {{identify}} the attrition rate of eligible subjects {{from the general}} practice brief intervention studies, reasons for attrition, and the potential bias arising from lost subjects. Design. Review of all published trials of brief intervention for <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> in primary care settings. Findings. The attrition rate of eligible subjects from the general practice brief intervention studies ranges from 44. 3 to 83. 2 % (mean 70. 6 %). The potential bias introduced by the characteristics of subjects available and not available for research is not adequately addressed. Where there is evidence, subjects unavailable for study or those lost to follow-up usually show different characteristics (e. g. younger, heavier drinkers, less educated) from those completing the study. Conclusions. Study populations in general practice-based brief alcohol interventions may have been those most susceptible to intervention. This suggests caution is appropriate in generalizing from brief intervention study results to routine primary care...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the consequences of chronic non-pathological drinking, i. e., social drinking, on brain functioning. While ERPs were recorded, social drinking participants were assessed on cognitive tasks, which were chosen because normal functioning in these tasks allegedly depends on undamaged frontal lobes. Verb generation task Two studies were described. Study 1 involved two groups of students, a moderate social drinkers group and a heavy social drinkers group. Study 2 involved three older groups of social drinkers (light, moderate and, heavy) and an <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> group (mean age approximately 50 years). Interaction effects between group and verb generation were found at one mid frontal scalp location and at two right frontal scalp locations. An expected task effect, larger amplitudes for generating than for reading at an early latency at Fz, was found in both groups in study 1, but only for the light social drinkers in study 2. The moderate, heavy and <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> in study 2 did not show this task effect. <b>Excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> also made more retrieval errors than the heavy social drinkers and differed at right frontal (F 4) ERP components from the heavy social drinkers. A third interaction effect was found at the right frontal lead F 6. At F 6 higher amplitude was found for generating than for reading for the moderate drinkers of study 1 and the light drinkers of study 2. Wisconsin card-sorting task In the Wisconsin card-sorting task the N 1 ERP component in response to the feedback stimuli differed between groups. The light social drinkers showed a trend towards more early negativity (N 1) on early trials than on late trials; this effect was significant for the moderate drinkers, but absent in the heavy and excessive groups. Other tasks In neither the continuous performance task, the visual attention task, nor the auditory odd-ball task, differences between social drinking groups were found on the various ERP components. According to the DSM-IV criteria, a subgroup of five participants in the excessive drinking group scored for alcohol dependence. Contrasting this subgroup of alcohol dependent participants with light social drinkers showed significantly smaller frontal Go P 3 in the continuous performance task, and a trend towards smaller parietal P 3 to attended stimuli in the visual attention task. No effects were found with respect to the auditory odd-ball task. Conclusion This study provides new insights in the effects of long-term alcohol use. We propose that the effects of alcohol use begin with very mild cognitive effects in young social drinkers, which are found at the right frontal cortex; with progressing age and alcohol use the effects become visible on more ERP components that expand to mid-frontal locations. It seems that all these effects in social drinkers are only found when the brain is challenged with more demanding or complex tasks. When participants become dependent on alcohol, also less complex and less demanding attention and inhibition tasks show effects that, in case of the visual attention task, also become more widespread, involving also parietal scalp locations...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionExcessive alcohol {{consumption}} kills approximately 75, 000 people {{annually in the}} United States. Although alcohol screening among primary care patients is recommended by the U. S. Preventive Services Task Force, it is rarely performed. It is unclear whether low screening rates are due to limited access to health care, missed screening opportunities during patient visits, or both. MethodsData came from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a population-based telephone survey of noninstitutionalized U. S. adults. Current health insurance status {{and a history of}} a recent medical checkup (within 2 years) were assessed in relation to {{alcohol consumption}} status. <b>Excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> included those who reported binge drinking (consuming five or more drinks on one or more occasions in the past month), heavy drinking (consuming more than 60 drinks in the past month for men or more than 30 for women), or both.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ-D). The subjects were 246 <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers</b> admitted to an addiction treatment centre and 54 offenders convicted of an alcohol-related crime in The Netherlands. The factor structure of the RCQ-D for the two samples combined was found to be consistent with the three-factor structure established for the original RCQ. The reliability of the items for each scale was found to be satisfactory. Allocated stage of change showed significant differences between the different subsamples. As expected, the scale scores for adjacent stages of change showed significantly higher inter-correlations than the scale scores for non-adjacent stages. Additionally, the negatively formulated items from the pre-contemplation scale were reformulated positively and their internal consistency tested among the offender sample. The positively formulated pre-contemplation items showed a higher alpha value than the negatively formulated items. We therefore suggest that the positively formulated items should replace the negatively formulated one...|$|R
5000|$|Ann Larson {{stated that}} [...] "the higher {{fertility}} {{is the result}} of an economic growth that has sidelined young regional women, {{and to a lesser extent}} young men, who do not have the range of educational and employment opportunities to lead them into pathways other than early parenting". This statement can be backed up through various research and epidemiology indicating a direct trend between rural and remote areas, and rates of teenage pregnancy. Other issues come with living in rural areas in Australia including; high rates of teenage smokers and <b>excessive</b> <b>drinkers,</b> as well as lack of employment and in-adequate education. These risks have been linked to increased caesarean and abortion rates among mothers living in rural and remote areas. Although the above research concludes that there are extremely high teenage pregnancy rates in rural and remote areas, the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that the distribution of births in Australia are lowest in remote areas. These statistics can be viewed in the table below.|$|R
