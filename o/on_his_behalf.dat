5|$|During {{the penalty}} {{phase of the}} trial, Bundy took {{advantage}} of an obscure Florida law providing that a marriage declaration in court, {{in the presence of}} a judge, constituted a legal marriage. As he was questioning former Washington State DES coworker Carole Ann Boone—who had moved to Florida to be near Bundy, had testified <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf</b> during both trials, and was again testifying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf</b> as a character witness—he asked her to marry him. She accepted, and Bundy declared to the court that they were legally married.|$|E

5|$|By February 1326, it {{was clear}} that Isabella was {{involved}} in a relationship with the exiled Marcher Lord, Roger Mortimer. It is unclear when Isabella first met Mortimer or when their relationship began, but they both wanted to see Edward and the Despensers removed from power. The King appealed for his son to return, and for Charles to intervene <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf,</b> but this had no effect.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beauregard was {{reluctant}} to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled him to do so, which he did before the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He {{was one of many}} Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by President Andrew Johnson on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief and the bill <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf</b> was signed by President Grant on July 24, 1876.|$|E

5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an agent {{to make a}} contract <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf</b> with a third party. In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E
5|$|Aqil's {{closeness}} {{with the}} Europeans disturbed the Ottomans. His {{relations with the}} kaimakam of Acre, who in 1863 was Hasan Effendi, were also deteriorating. Since his return to Palestine in 1854, he avoided setting foot in the city, instead assigning a resident representative who engaged the kaimakam <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf.</b> Hasan Effendi lodged complaints to the provincial governor in Beirut, Kapuli Pasha, about the misconduct of Aqil's men who extorted the local peasantry. Indeed, Aqil's protection was generally limited to those who could pay for his services or otherwise benefit his interests, including merchants, travelers, monks, pilgrims, Christians and Jews.|$|E

5|$|Burton set Mars Attacks! up with Warner Bros. and {{the studio}} {{purchased}} the film {{rights to the}} trading card series <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf.</b> The original theatrical release date was planned for the summer of 1996.

5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf,</b> also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex.

Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|He turned {{professional}} at Burnley {{at the age}} of 17 {{on wages}} of £7 a week. His grandfather attempted to negotiate a £500 signing-on fee <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>behalf</b> but was rebuffed after the club alerted Charles Sutcliffe, Secretary of the Football League, who informed them that any attempt to circumvent the league's maximum wage was illegal. Lawton scored in his first appearance since signing the contract after just 30 seconds, before going on to record a hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a goal with either foot and one with his head.|$|E
