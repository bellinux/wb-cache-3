25|$|Other {{reviews of}} the book and audio-book were mixed. The {{reviewer}} in The New York Times mentioned (by way of criticism) that Sophocles and Freud had pursued the same idea that forms the book's focus, that is, that we are defined by <b>our</b> <b>fears.</b> Greil Marcus said Rakoff's stories are not as funny as those he read on the radio.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{described}} as an anti-war film, as civilians run and only try to save themselves and their family instead of fighting back against the alien Tripods. Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as [...] "If aliens invade, don't fight back. Run." [...] Saunders compared the film to Independence Day, where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate {{the atmosphere of the}} September 11 attacks, with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. Spielberg declared to Reader's Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: [...] "They are a wake-up call to face <b>our</b> <b>fears</b> as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life." [...] Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War, but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip – [...] "I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I think that when you're that age you don't fully consider the ramifications of what you're doing and you're very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that's a good idea or not." [...] Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men's weapons, but the planet's smallest creatures, bacteria, which Koepp described as [...] "nature, in a way, knowing a whole lot more than we do".|$|E

2500|$|Naomi Wood of Kansas State University {{challenges}} Robbins' reading, {{arguing that}} before the World Trade Center attacks of 2001, [...] "Robbins's argument might seem merely playful, anti-intuitive, and provocative." [...] Wood concludes: [...] "Perhaps the truth of 'The Emperor's New Clothes' {{is not that the}} child's truth is mercifully free of adult corruption, but that it recognizes the terrifying possibility that whatever words we may use to clothe <b>our</b> <b>fears,</b> the fabric cannot protect us from them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Subsequently, {{the film}} {{underwent}} reassessment by American critics and audiences, {{and it is}} now generally considered one of the best action films of the 1970s. When playing at the Chicago International Film Festival in 1978, the film was described in the program notes as, [...] "...a nightmarish poem which plays on <b>our</b> <b>fears</b> of irrational and uncontrolled violence." [...] Carpenter has said that the British audiences immediately understood and enjoyed the film's similarities to American westerns, whereas American audiences were too familiar with the western genre to fully appreciate the movie at first.|$|E
2500|$|... "John Carpenter, whose small-budget science-fiction epic Dark Star {{was widely}} acclaimed, has turned his inventive {{imagination}} to the thriller {{for his first}} solo directional effort. The result, even without taking into consideration his tiny budget and cast of unknowns is astonishing. Assault on Precinct 13 {{is one of the}} most powerful and exciting crime thrillers from a new director in a long time. It grabs hold of the audience and simply doesn't let go as it builds to a crescendo of irrational violence that reflects only too well <b>our</b> <b>fears</b> of unmotivated attack... It is a frightening look at the crumbling of rational ideas of law and order under an irresistible attack by the forces of irrationality and death." [...] Wlaschin found Assault to be the best film of the London Film Festival and included it in his [...] "Action Cinema" [...] section of that festival. It became one of the festival's best-received films, garnering tremendous critical and popular acclaim. According to Derek Malcolm of the Guardian, the applause was [...] "deafening". Carpenter was delighted by the new praise.|$|E

2500|$|The {{overwhelmingly}} positive British {{response to}} the film led to its critical and commercial success throughout Europe. Derek Malcolm of Cosmopolitan wrote, [...] " [...] is fast {{becoming one of the}} cult movies of the year ... The great virtue of the film is the way it grabs hold of its audience and simply refuses to let go. It exploits all <b>our</b> <b>fears</b> of irrational violence and unmotivated attack, {{and at the same time}} manages to laugh at itself without spoiling the tension - a very considerable feat. Carpenter, who is clearly a director with places to go, has succeeded in making a comedy that scares the pants off us. And don't think you're laughing at it. As a matter of fact, it's laughing at you." [...] Malcolm later wrote that he held some reservations about the film: [...] "I don't feel like going on and on about the movie, partly because I think it is in grave danger of being oversold anyway, and partly because it isn't much more to me than tremendous fun". The film broke one house record in the UK and was named one of the best films of the year by critics and moviegoers.|$|E
