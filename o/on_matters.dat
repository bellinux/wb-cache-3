40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} simple general proof that Casimir force cannot {{originate}} from the vacuum energy of electromagnetic (EM) field. The full QED Hamiltonian consists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term Hem, the pure matter term Hmatt {{and the interaction}} term Hint. The Hem-term commutes with all matter fields {{because it does not}} have any explicit dependence <b>on</b> <b>matter</b> fields. As a consequence, Hem cannot generate any forces <b>on</b> <b>matter.</b> Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum energy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the forces. The misleading statements in the literature that vacuum energy generates Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that Hem attains an implicit dependence <b>on</b> <b>matter</b> fields by the use of the equations of motion and to the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was explicit. The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated by Hint...|$|R
