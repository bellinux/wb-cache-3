40|$|Oxygen is an {{important}} element in the chemistry of the solar system objects given its abundance and its presence in many molecules including H 2 O 80 % of cometary ices). The analysis of oxygen atoms in comets can provide information not only on the comets themselves but also on the solar system. These atoms have been analyzed using the 3 forbidden <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> [OI] observed in emission in the optical region at 5577. 339 Å (the green line), 6300. 304 Å and 6363. 776 Å (the red lines) (Swings, 1962). Our analysis is based on a sample of 12 comets of various origins. The observing material is made of 53 high signal-to-noise spectra obtained with the high-resolution UVES spectrograph at the ESO VLT from 2002 to 2012 (Manfroid et al, 2009). After noticing that the green line is blended with one C 2 line, we built synthetic spectra of C 2 for each observing circumstances and we subtracted its contribution to the cometary spectra in order to ensure the decontamination of the 5577 Å line. Then, we measured the intensity of the 3 [OI] lines at different heliocentric distances. By comparing the green to red lines ratio (G/R) with the Bhardwaj & Raghuram (2012) effective excitation rates, we found that H 2 O is the main parent molecule when the comet is observed at 1 au. When the comet is located beyond 2. 5 au from the Sun, CO 2 also contributes to the production of oxygen. Studying forbidden <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> could be a new way to estimate the abundances of CO 2 in comets, a very difficult task from the ground (Decock et al. 2013). In order to estimate the effect of the quenching on our results, we analyzed the evolution of the G/R ratio at different nucleocentric distances. For nearby comets, we divided the extended 2 D spectrum into several zones in order to analyze the <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> {{as close as possible to}} the nucleus (down to ~ 10 km for the closest comets). Their analysis will allow us to study the link of the <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> with the nucleocentric distance.

40|$|International audienceSpace weather thermospheric {{monitoring}} requires real-time {{and large-scale}} measurements. In order {{to monitor the}} thermospheric variations due to geomagnetic activity, one relies mostly on the measurements of {{the intensity of the}} atomic <b>oxygen</b> green <b>line</b> and on the indirect measurement of the total electron content. These two parameters do not allow retrieving the full characteristics of the thermosphere, and a third proxy is required, for example, in orbitography. We propose to use the polarization of the atomic <b>oxygen</b> red <b>line</b> to fulfill this requirement. The first measurements of the polarization of thermospheric nightglow lines have been performed {{in the first part of}} the twentieth century and especially during the last International Geophysical Year. Amongst the <b>oxygen</b> visible <b>lines,</b> only the red one seems to be potentially polarized. However, there exists a disagreement between the different measurements. At the origin of the polarization, there is always a dissymmetric mechanism. It triggers either an emission process, a light scattering, or, in the case of the <b>oxygen</b> red <b>line,</b> a collision mechanism.

40|$|We build a bulk velocity-dependent photoionization {{model of}} the warm {{absorber}} of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3783.

The model reproduces the observed relationship between the gas ionization and the velocity shift of the line centroids as well as the asymmetry of the absorption lines in the X-ray spectrum of NGC 3783.
