In addition, maintaining a good performance and quality of work away from possible loss. The purpose of the research is to examine the {{overhead cost}}s management practice in the construction industry in the Gaza Strip. The awareness of construction companies and techniques followed by the contractors in estimating the overhead costs, affecting factors and mitigation measures was examined. A structured questionnaire supported by personal interviews was used to collect information. Sixty-three contracting companies working in the construction industry in the Gaza Strip were surveyed. The analysis shows a good awareness of the concept of <b>overheads</b> <b>costs</b> and its components. Gaza Strip Contractors follow precise practices to estimate the <b>overheads</b> <b>costs.</b> Contractors are taking several precautionary measures to minimize any risks associated with <b>overheads</b> <b>costs.</b> Factors affecting the estimation of overhead costs are including the management capacity of the company and its policy, led by the company's experience and ability to implement the project within the time frame.

40|$|AbstractBy {{influence}} {{of globalization and}} by increasing competition are many enterprises forced in the present to perform a variety of activities, which are although {{not related to the}} main subject of their activities, but for some reason are necessary for business. The implementation of subsidiary services and auxiliary activities has increased the amount of overhead costs. The reaction to a difficult economic situation is just an effort to reduce overhead costs. Potential way of reducing <b>overheads</b> <b>costs</b> becomes the application of the outsourcing principles. This paper is focused on the detailed specification of costs {{associated with the use of}} outsourcing. Outsourcing priority task, in addition to the cost savings, is the transfer of risk to the service provider, with the ensuring and increasing the quality level of carried out activities. Practice has confirmed that the vision at a cost saving are often greater than it actually is. The problem seems to be that it is quite difficult to determine and know the extent of its costs for the implementation of outsourced processes and there is often forgotten to the level of additional costs for manage the outsourcing relationship. In the paper we paid attention to the draft of assessment of the outsourcing efficiency from the cost savings perspective to ensure the business supported processes...|$|E

Aman season rice MV, BR 32. The results suggest that the efficiency of the extension services was associated with the allocation of project funds between farm-level dissemination activities and <b>overheads</b> <b>costs,</b> and with the timing of project implementation.   The presence of many divisions and administrative levels in the technology transfer system appears to be responsible for high overheads, while farm-level diffusion of BR 32 was delayed for 4 years after its release due to the late start of project-funded dissemination activities.   The rate of MV diffusion was restricted by seed scarcity, deficiencies in technical knowledge transfer, and some undesirable technology attributes.   The reasons for the seed crisis were:  i) the low amounts supplied by the public parastatal agency whose capacity was found to be under-utilized, ii) the lack of effective distributional channels for farmer-produced seeds, iii) the lack of farmer access to information about seed sources and demonstration sites, and iv) the low involvement of NGOs and the private sector.   The average and marginal costs of BR 32 dissemination would have been much lower if seed and technical knowledge could have been delivered more according to farmers’ demand.

We find that the firms adopt a high cost strategy to bargain with the state for higher plan prices, because of the one-firm-with-one-plan-price policy. This causes a soft price constraint on costs, which inevitably protects high cost firms, driving up the total costs of the firm, and providing a lower incentive to the firm to improve their cost efficiency. The firms are planned by the state for their outputs. Will the state plan affect the capacity of power supply in favour? The study argues yes, because (1) entry is free and capacity investment is under firm‟s autonomy, (2) the firms are very responsive to capacity utilization and demand in choosing their capacity investment, and (3) the firms seek more profits through seeking more plan outputs that are linked with capacity. Therefore, the firms do not compete in prices but the capacity of power generation. These explain why the reformed plan system works in stimulating capacity growth...|$|E
