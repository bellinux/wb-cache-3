5|$|During {{the early}} laps, Massa {{appeared}} to have a faster car than Hamilton, and repeatedly tried to pass the McLaren {{on the inside of}} turn four. His first attempt was on lap three, but Hamilton braked late and kept ahead of Massa into the following corner. Massa tried again at the same place on the next two laps. He passed Hamilton briefly into the turn on lap five, but overshot the corner and ran wide <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> He dropped to fifth, behind teammate Räikkönen and BMW's Nick Heidfeld. Hamilton apologised after the race for 'tricking' Massa into the move. Albers, in the sole remaining Spyker, retired on lap nine with a gearbox fire.|$|E
5|$|The Saturday morning {{sessions}} {{were held in}} dry conditions and later on a wet track, were grip was poor and some drivers were forced <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> after sliding off the track. Häkkinen was fastest in the third practice session, {{with a time of}} 1:11.355; Coulthard had the second fastest time. The two Ferrari drivers were third and fourth; Barrichello ahead of Michael Schumacher. Verstappen continued his quick form and set the fifth fastest time, ahead of Fisichella and Villeneuve. Zonta, Trulli and Herbert rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. In the final practice session, Häkkinen again set the fastest time, a 1:11.336, despite spinning into the gravel late in the session; his teammate Coulthard remained second quickest. Michael Schumacher was third fastest ahead of teammate Barrichello. Villeneuve was fifth fastest, ahead of Herbert and Frentzen. Salo, Fisichella and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 26, {{and on the}} approach to the hairpin later in the lap Robert Kubica hit the back of Jarno Trulli's Toyota. The impact forced Kubica <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> {{at the edge of}} the track, where a bump launched his car into and along the concrete wall just before the hairpin. After losing three wheels, the nose and suffering major damage to the sidepods in the initial impact, the BMW flipped back across the track and came to rest against the barrier in the run-off area on the other side of the track. Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi crashing into the wall of champions once again.|$|E

5|$|After {{discussions with}} Whiting during the Friday night drivers' briefing, {{the height of}} the apex at turn sixteen was {{increased}} and the wall around that area was moved back. A new apex kerb at turn eighteen was built to stop dirt and stones from accumulating on the circuit, and the track was extensively cleaned. Drivers were told they could drive into the pit lane from the racing line without incurring a penalty. Bridgestone had reported heavy tyre graining during the Friday practice sessions; their Motorsport Tyre Development director Hirohide Hamashima said drivers would face a challenge of looking after their tyres if track conditions had not changed before the race. Kubica was quickest in the final practice session; his late lap of 1:37.354 was 0.048 seconds quicker than Hamilton's in second. Alonso was third-quickest and Webber was fourth. Rosberg, who was fifth, slowed at turn fifteen during the session's closing stages; he narrowly avoided a collision with Alonso. The incident was subject to a stewards' investigation; the stewards decided not to penalise Rosberg. Massa, Button, Hülkenberg, Schumacher and Sutil completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vettel was sixteenth; the result of running <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} round of pit stops, Räikkönen was five seconds ahead of Hamilton, but Hamilton began to close in on Räikkönen during the last stint {{as a result of the}} tyres better suiting his McLaren Mercedes. Heavy rain began to fall on lap41. Hamilton closed the gap on Räikkönen to under a second, still sixseconds ahead of Massa. Hamilton {{attempted}} to pass Räikkönen at the Bus Stop chicane, but he cut across the corner. Consequently, Hamilton led out of the chicane but allowed Räikkönen to re-pass him halfway down the straight. Hamilton then passed him again at the La Source hairpin under braking. Räikkönen tried to double-back on Hamilton to regain the position but the line was defended, resulting in Räikkönen touching his front wing on Hamilton's rear tyre. The rain started coming down more heavily and Nico Rosberg spun at Fagnes corner, rejoining in front of the two frontrunners and causing Hamilton to run <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> At the next corner, Räikkönen spun and gave the lead back to Hamilton. Räikkönen then lost control of his Ferrari through the Blanchimont corner and collided with the barrier, ending his race.|$|E
5|$|Nurmi's {{trip to the}} 1924 Summer Olympics was {{endangered}} by a knee injury {{in the spring of}} 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day. On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances. In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster. His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe, still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds. The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m. Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace. Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel. On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, he was penalised five grid {{places for}} failing to slow down for yellow flags after Sébastien Buemi crashed, {{scattering}} debris <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> track. The R29's pace was again disappointing, when he could only manage to climb up to 10th from 16th place on the grid, despite a late safety car period after Jaime Alguersuari crashed heavily. Alonso said that his race was pretty much decided in qualifying, although he admitted that his car seemed to be fairly competitive. In Brazil however, he retired on the first lap when Adrian Sutil and Jarno Trulli collided, and Alonso was unable to avoid the out-of-control Force India, which had spun <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> wet <b>grass,</b> terminally damaging a sidepod on Alonso's car, forcing him to retire.|$|R
5000|$|In late 2006 {{plans for}} a new [...] "state of the art" [...] 6th form area to replace the {{temporary}} one, and a sports pavilion/dance studio (including a bar) were approved to be added <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> adjoining <b>grass</b> land and were recently built. The pavilion is {{at the head of a}} series of astroturf pitches, currently operated under the Powerleague franchise. There were also {{plans for a}} large theatre to improve the performing arts facilities, known as [...] "The Venue".

5000|$|One of Goodall's major {{contributions}} {{to the field of}} primatology was the discovery of tool making in chimpanzees. She discovered that some chimpanzees alter pieces of grass or twigs and then poke them into termite mounds. The termites would grab <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> blade of <b>grass</b> or twig with their mandibles and the chimpanzees would then just pull <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> out and eat the termites. Though many animals had been clearly observed using [...] "tools", previously, only humans were thought to make tools, and tool-making was considered the defining difference between humans and other animals. This discovery convinced several scientists to reconsider their definition of being human. Another characteristic of the chimpanzee that Goodall discovered was their cooperative hunting of red colobus monkeys.|$|R
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session the 107% rule was in effect, requiring each driver to remain within 107% of the fastest lap time {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Häkkinen clinched his fifth pole position of the season and his third at the circuit, with a time of 1:50.646; although he was optimistic about his race prospects, he was concerned about the start. Häkkinen was joined in the front row of the grid by Trulli, who equalled his best qualifying performance of the season (at the Monaco Grand Prix). Trulli was also optimistic about his chances because of the Jordan team's strong record at the circuit. Button qualified third, and said he was happy with his starting position. Michael Schumacher secured fourth position, nine-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen, setting a lap time which pushed Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard into fifth. Coulthard, who had problems with grip, believed that he could have had a faster lap time. Ralf Schumacher secured sixth position after being caught in traffic during his final run, keeping the Williams driver from a quicker lap time. Villeneuve, in seventh, reported oversteering. Frentzen qualified eighth; his best lap time was disqualified after Coulthard blocked him at the Bus Stop chicane, which caused Frentzen to run <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> Herbert and Barrichello rounded out the top ten drivers, with Barrichello spinning at the chicane during his third run after locking his brakes. Fisichella, eleventh, missed the top ten by three-tenths of a second on his only quick run of the session. Herbert's teammate, Eddie Irvine, qualified twelfth with tyre-grip problems. He was ahead of Zonta in the slower of the two BARs (which lost a half-second through Eau Rouge), Heidfeld in the faster Prost, Sauber's Pedro Diniz and Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa. Alesi qualified 17th, despite spinning at the chicane and triggering a yellow flag. Salo qualified 18th, ahead of Wurz (who had engine problems and shared the spare Benetton monocoque with Fisichella). Verstappen and the two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the back of the}} grid, in positions 20 to 22.|$|E
25|$|At the , Räikkönen again {{qualified}} fourth. He passed Kovalainen and Massa at {{the start}} to be second, and took the lead from Hamilton on the second lap. He pulled away, setting the fastest lap of the race and built a five-second gap. He looked set to win but owing to a late-race rain shower, Hamilton closed right {{up to him and}} tried to pass him at the final chicane with two laps to go. Hamilton cut the chicane and rejoined ahead of Räikkönen. He let Räikkönen take the place back. Hamilton then repassed him for the lead. The two battled on {{for the rest of the}} lap, with Räikkönen retaking the lead when the two stumbled upon spinning backmarker Nico Rosberg, forcing Hamilton <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> Räikkönen spun at the next corner and fell behind Hamilton again. While trying to catch up, he lost control of the car, smashed into a wall and retired.|$|E
25|$|On lap 44 Timo Glock ran wide <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> and {{the bottom}} of his car hit two {{substantial}} bumps, the second of which caused it to briefly fly {{up in the air and}} land with force sufficient to break the suspension, leaving the monocoque in contact with the ground and unable to be stopped, resulting in a sizable accident. Glock spun twice and came to rest against the wall further down the track. He was forced to retire and the safety car came out for a third time. On the same lap, due to a false signal from the chief mechanic, Barrichello left a pit stop before the fuel hose had been removed from his car. Several mechanics suffered minor injuries. He would also serve a ten-second penalty for this pit stop as it was taken while the pit lane was closed. Ultimately he was disqualified for exiting the pitlane when the red light was on.|$|E
40|$|Grass {{rendering}} {{is needed}} for many outdoor scenes, but for real-time applications, rendering each blade of grass as geometry has been too expensive so far. This is why grass is most often drawn as a texture mapped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> ground or <b>grass</b> patches rendered as transparent billboard quads. Recent approaches use geometry for blades that are near the camera and flat geometry for rendering further away. In this paper, we present a technique which is capable of rendering whole grass fields in real time as geometry by exploiting {{the capabilities of the}} tessellation shader. Each single blade of grass is rendered as a two-dimensional tessellated quad facing its own random direction. This enables each blade of grass to be influenced by wind and to interact with its environment. In order to adapt <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> field to <b>the</b> current scene, special textures are developed which encode on the one hand the density and height of <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> and on <b>the</b> other hand its look and composition...|$|R

50|$|Lizzard buzzards hunt from perches, 6-10 m in height, {{and catch}} prey by {{swooping}} or gliding <b>onto</b> prey in <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> They {{have a low}} attack rate, passively searching for prey which is energetically inexpensive but time-consuming. They rarely catch prey in flight. They have shorter pointed wings (ratio of wing length to body height 0.76) resulting in a more rapid flight in forests which suggests an adaptation to prey capture in dense vegetation. Their diet consists of invertebrates, reptiles and mammals. By number most common prey are grasshoppers and termites, while by biomass rodents are the most frequent. Reptiles favoured are lizards especially Mabuya and Agama lizards, frogs and snakes.|$|R
25|$|On lap 2, Schumacher took {{second from}} Alesi {{after a couple}} of {{unsuccessful}} earlier attempts. The Frenchman had been holding Schumacher up while Senna pulled out a 4-second lead. Senna and Schumacher pulled away {{from the rest of the}} pack, increasing their lead by over a second a lap. Both pitted on lap 21 but Schumacher was quicker and rejoined ahead. He pulled away to take a 10-second lead but then Senna began to reel him in. By lap 35, Verstappen, Brundle and Eddie Irvine had all got ahead of Wendlinger. As they came up to lap Éric Bernard, Verstappen tried to pass Irvine. Irvine pushed him <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> and Verstappen spun off, going over Irvine and tipping it into Bernard's car and then hitting Brundle, being launched into a series of barrel rolls. No-one was hurt, but Irvine was banned initially for one race, later extended to three races by the FIA after an unsuccessful appeal. By now, Alesi, who had stopped twice, was behind Hill who had only stopped once.|$|E
25|$|Prodrive Racing Australia {{carried their}} strong form into the Winton event. Chaz Mostert claimed the opening race, his {{first for the}} season, ahead of his {{teammate}} Mark Winterbottom, while Michael Caruso claimed Nissan Motorsport's first podium finish for the year. Winterbottom won the second race of the weekend, with Rick Kelly scoring another podium for Nissan Motorsport, while Mostert finished in third place after starting from pole. The Holden Racing Team endured a difficult race after James Courtney carried too much speed into the first corner and took his teammate Garth Tander out of the race. Lee Holdsworth, driving a customer Holden Racing Team car, also suffered damage in the incident. Mostert took his fourth consecutive pole position in qualifying for the third race, becoming the first driver to achieve the feat since Winterbottom in 2011. Mostert was leading at the halfway mark of the race when he dropped his left-rear wheel <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> on the entry to turn four, causing him to spin into the tyre wall. Winterbottom inherited the lead {{and went on to}} win the race ahead of Fabian Coulthard and Craig Lowndes. Despite finishing on the podium, Lowndes lost the championship lead to Winterbottom.|$|E
25|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in cloudy weather with occasional rain showers. Michael Schumacher clinched his seventh pole position of his career, his first at the circuit, with a time of 1:14.266. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard, who was one-tenth of a second slower and was helped by running in the slipstream of teammate Häkkinen on the main straight. Häkkinen qualified third and stated that he was not unhappy with his starting position. Barrichello qualified fourth, three-tenths of a second behind Michael Schumacher, and said he had more grip in his car to improve his time. Trulli qualified fifth. Button took sixth and was happy with his effort despite encountering a yellow flag on his third run and admitted to pushing too hard on his fourth attempt. Frentzen slid <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> during the session and managed to record the seventh quickest time. Villeneuve who secured eighth believed he could have set a faster time as he spun while on a quick lap. Diniz took ninth having removed some downforce which improved the feel of his car. Ralf Schumacher rounded out the top ten having suffered his spin on his fourth run. Wurz qualified eleventh and said that he was happy with his car. Ricardo Zonta qualified twelfth, blaming his car for his qualifying performance. He was ahead of Verstappen and Salo. Fisichella, who started 15th, stated that understeer and poor grip prevented him from setting a faster lap time. He managed to qualify ahead of Heidfeld and Irvine, who spun during the session. Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa, Herbert and Alesi filled the next three positions; the latter had a lack of running due to a pneumatic valve system failure in his engine. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid; Gastón Mazzacane in front of Gené.|$|E
5000|$|On lap 13 Andrea de Cesaris survived one of {{the biggest}} crashes ever seen in Formula One when his Ligier-Renault got {{sideways}} at the left hand Panorama Curve and slid <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> outside <b>grass</b> at high speed. <b>The</b> <b>grass,</b> wet from overnight rain caused the Ligier to initially slide sideways before his right rear hit a slight bank launching the car into a series of rolls with de Cesaris's head bouncing around freely in the cockpit. Somehow as soon as the Ligier came to a rest (thankfully the right way up), de Cesaris undid his seat belts and walked away with nothing more than a mud-splattered helmet and driving suit. The crash was the end for de Cesaris at Ligier, with team owner Guy Ligier firing the Italian after he saw a replay of the crash stating [...] "I {{can no longer afford to}} keep employing this man" [...] referring to the constant repair bills from de Cesaris's crashes since he joined the team in [...] When he returned to the pits, de Cesaris told the team that the reason for his DNF was that the car had stalled and wouldn't restart.

She found that the termites bit <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> with their jaws. The chimpanzee had been using the grass {{as a tool to}} [...] "fish" [...] or [...] "dip" [...] for termites.|$|E
50|$|Stremme's engine failed on lap 157 and his car spun {{in front}} of a small pack of traffic after his car dropped oil on the track, causing the seventh caution. The leaders, which {{included}} Kenseth, made pit stops and some for two tires. Under caution, Montoya reported to his team that he felt a vibration on his car after leaving pit road; he returned to his pit box on lap 159 where his pit crew checked underneath his car for the vibration which they could not find. He then drove at racing speed after rejoining the track at turn two {{to catch up with the}} pace car when a rear trailing arm on his car broke at turn three where two jet dryers were clearing debris. He lost control, skidded up the banking and collided with a trailer-mounted jet engine filled with 200 gal of jet kerosene, destroying it and rupturing the fuel tank, which started leaking fuel <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> track. Montoya drifted down <b>the</b> track <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> infield <b>grass.</b> Seconds later, Terry Labonte drove over the stream; a spark caused the fuel to ignite, creating a wall of fire across the track. The conflagration caused a red flag to be shown.|$|R
5000|$|Sutil's race ended {{instantly}} but Pérez {{was able}} to limp back his damaged Force India back to the pit lane to retire. The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car to allow debris to be cleared from the track by trackside marshals. Both McLaren cars, Hülkenberg, Gutiérrez and Vettel made pit stops for the change to medium compound tyres. The safety car was withdrawn {{at the end of}} the fourth lap and racing resumed with Rosberg leading Hamilton [...] Both Mercedes cars pulled away from Massa who fended off attempts by his teammate Bottas to retake third position. Alonso locked his rear wheels, and Ricciardo drove on the outside line before steering <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> inside lane to pass him for fifth. He narrowly avoided hitting the rear-end of Bottas's car. Alonso attacked Ricciardo and the two went alongside each other through the second corner with the Red Bull driver keeping fifth by driving <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> artificial <b>grass</b> at <b>the</b> turn's exit, prompting Alonso to reduce his speed as they drove through the turn three and four switchback. Maldonado pressured Räikkönen but the Ferrari driver resisted attempts to pull away from him. Vergne lined up an overtake on Maldonado entering the first turn but was unable to get ahead of the Lotus driver.|$|R
50|$|The campus also {{includes}} top notch athletic facilities {{which include a}} set of 3 tennis courts and a practice tennis court, 2 baseball/softball fields, 1 practice field, and a newly added 7 million dollar stadium, including artificial turf, buildings for both team, the home team's (the Lions') includes a weight training room, a paramedic station and coaches' offices. The stadium, used for soccer, football, track and field events, includes an 8 lane track, a high jump pit, a pole vault pit, and a long jump area. The home team's seats are incredibly ergonomic, including actual chairs instead of traditional bleacher/benches. The sound system and lights are all controlled from a state-of-the-art A/V room {{on top of the}} home team's stands, and includes cameras and camera posts. Furthermore, the field-turf, a new age playing surface, has been installed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> formerly <b>grass</b> football field which improves its durability and allows it to be used for other field sports such as soccer and lacrosse. The campus also has a one million dollar baseball/softball complex featuring turf fields.|$|R
