5|$|Flora Duffy {{was invited}} to {{participate}} in the Beijing Olympics based on her performance in the qualification competitions. Participating on the August 18 event, Duffy competed in the women's triathlon. Duffy swam the 1.5kilometers portion of the distance in 20:26minutes, ranking 41st out of 55 in that portion of the event, behind Luxembourg's Liz May (40th) by under a second and ahead of Hungary's Zita Szabó by two seconds. In this portion of the event, Duffy was 37 seconds behind the United States' Laura Bennett, who finished the swimming portion of the event first at 19:49. Duffy took 33 seconds to make the transition from swim to cycling, the second part of the event, tying with Mak So Ning of Hong Kong at 52nd place out of 55. Duffy, however, was lapped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leg and was disqualified before reaching the running portion or completing the event.|$|E
5|$|Hall {{slowed the}} leading pack {{down so that}} her {{teammate}} Helen Jenkins could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peleton {{at the end of}} the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. The quickest individual bike split was shared between two New Zealanders, Andrea Hewitt and Kate McIlroy, who both completed the bike leg in one hour, five minutes and 26 seconds. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. At the second transition (cycling to running) Anne Haug (Germany), who was in the second group, was the quickest through the transition in a time of 27 seconds. Of the leading group most went through in around 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine balance, wheel balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is {{a comparison of the}} natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E

5|$|The women's triathlon {{took place}} on 4 August 2012, {{featuring}} 55 women from 31 countries. Lucy Hall (Great Britain), the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first {{in a time of}} 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In {{the early stages of the}} bike leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nordén (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after been dropped earlier on in the race. With 500 metres in the final lap to race Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff; Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth. After the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal.|$|E
25|$|In the women's race, Mikayla Nielsen won {{the junior}} world title. Lucy Hall led {{out of the}} 750-metre swim section. Hall was quickly joined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> by Anastasia Gorbunova, Sophie Drews and Monika Orazem. Hall and Orazem broke away and were caught by the 15 chasers {{at the end of}} the second lap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> Out of {{transition}} Nielsen made her move with Ashlee Bailie and Hanna Philippin following. Nielsen though held the pair of for her first world title as Bailie came second and Philippin third.|$|E

25|$|In the women's race, Sarah Haskins led the women's field {{coming out}} of the water with Helen Jenkins next, down 20 seconds, and Paula Findlay a minute behind. Haskins and Jenkins broke away <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> but were unable to sustain a 40-second first lap lead before being caught on the fourth lap by a chase group of 19. On the run, the race came down to Findlay, Jenkins and Sarah Groff with Jenkins losing out to Findlay once again, {{finishing}} second. With the win, Findlay became the most successful woman in the series' three-year history with five wins. It was the Canadian's third consecutive win on the 2011 series. Elsewhere, Emma Moffatt, who fell behind the lead group <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> caught up to the field on the run to finish fourth. Ai Ueda had a strong run performance, passing most of the field en route to seventh-place finish. In the overall standings, Findlay had a perfect score and was approximately 500 points ahead of Díaz, Hewitt, Bennett and Jenkins who rounded out the top five.|$|E
25|$|The men {{competed in}} cold, wet, windy conditions. Alistair Brownlee {{came out of}} the swim in the lead but was soon part of a 50-man peloton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> However, Brownlee, Stuart Hayes and Reinaldo Colucci broke away to lead the field by 30 seconds {{entering}} the second transition. Once out of transition and on the run, Brownlee dropped Hayes and Colucci and went on to record his second Kitzbühel win, having won previously in 2009. Behind him, Alexander Brukhankov, Brad Kahlefeldt, Sven Riederer, William Clarke and Laurent Vidal formed a group that passed Hayes and Colucci. Halfway through the run, Brukhankov made a break for second place before Riederer broke on the final lap to secure third. Clarke won the battle for fourth as Kahelfeldt finished fifth and Vidal sixth. Meanwhile, McCormack's return to ITU racing triathlon was cut short as he pulled out of the race <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> Following the race, Alistair Brownlee led the overall championship standings over Brukhankov with Gómez and Jonathan Brownlee now third and fourth with Riederer moving up to fifth.|$|E

25|$|Three wheeled {{motorcycles}} {{without the}} ability to lean have {{no need to be}} countersteered, and an initial steer torque in one direction does not automatically result in a turn in the other direction.

25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> wheels and powered every time a magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages are pretty much the same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|Alistair Brownlee, Alexander Bryukhankov, James Elvery and Ivan Rana {{managed to}} pull clear {{from the rest of}} the field <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> Brownlee in the run section moved away from the other three to finish 25 seconds ahead of Bryukhankov as his brother Jonathan Brownlee and Javier Gómez picked off Elvery and Rana before Brownlee moved away from the {{defending}} World Champion. The overall series still had Gómez leading from Alistair and Bryukhankov. Several athletes pulled out including Chris McCormack with a hamstring tare. Olympic qualification was also up for grabs as Justus, Hauss and Vidal took spots, whilst Frodeno just edged out Petzold to claim the second German spot.|$|E

25|$|Her coach {{had advised}} her {{to hold back}} on her swim speed, {{otherwise}} she {{might not be able}} to complete the race; together with the lack of power in her left arm, that meant her swim was much slower than usual at 61minutes. In contrast with her previous races at Kona, where Wellington had dominated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> she started the marathon stage with five women still in front of her. Wellington's main concern, though, was Mirinda Carfrae, the 2010 champion who was only a little over three minutes behind her, and the only woman who had run faster than her on this course – a serious worry, given Wellington's injuries.|$|E
25|$|In {{the race}} itself, {{a group of}} 15 triathletes broke away on the swim which {{included}} Jenkins, Groff and Hewitt. Only Vicky Holland and Kate Roberts fell off the group <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike.</b> Moffatt, Jackson, Riveros Diaz, Snowsill and Spirig in the chase group saw their deficit go from 30 seconds to 2 minutes by the second transition even with Sprig up front. Jenkins and Hewitt {{pulled away from the}} rest on the run, before the New Zealander kicked away in the last few metres to win. Melanie Annaheim managed to out-sprint Norden, Bennett and McIlroy for her first World Series medal. On the Olympic front, Harrison and McIlroy managed to qualify for France and New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Two groups formed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> {{out of the}} swim. Wang Yingying pleased {{the home}} fans {{coming out of the}} swim first. Yuko Takahashi (JPN), Alexandra Coates (CAN), Robisch and Kaitlin Shiver were in the first group of 15, but before the 10km point the chase pack had {{eliminated}} a 25-second gap to form a group of 25. In the run, a group of 10 quickly formed including Yuliya Yelistratova and Jerzyk, Kovacs, Kyla and Alexandra Coates (CAN) and Lauren Goss. On the third lap the group began to splinter, as Kovacs led with Yelistratova, Jerzyk and Shiver chasing. Yelistratova fell off the pace on the final lap as Jerzyk outsprinted Kovacs in the final 200 metres. While Robish ran through Shiver to claim bronze. Jerzyk’s win was Poland’s first ever World Championship medal.|$|E
25|$|The men's race saw Lukas Verzbicas {{fulfill his}} promise to Kevin McDowell and win his first world title.

The run section had the field complete four 2.5km around the Serpentine. The course differs from that of previous editions, most notably one swim loop instead of two {{and for the first time}} the course ventured outside of Hyde Park <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> section as the athletes passed through transition a total of 12 times.|$|E
