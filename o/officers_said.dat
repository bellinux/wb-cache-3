5|$|Euell {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} and died about an hour after the shooting. He was never able to formally identify Shay as the shooter. When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> that he appeared to be intoxicated. He refused to make any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E

25|$|Six {{days after}} the bombing, RUC {{officers}} shot dead INLA members Seamus Grew and Roddie Carroll near a vehicle checkpoint in Armagh.

25|$|On May 6, 2014, the Taxi Service Commission in Victoria, Australia, issued several {{infringement}} notices to Uber {{drivers with}} a fine of A$1,723, after a public warning discouraging people to use TNCs. State <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> that they will review the state's Transport Act, while Uber said it will reimburse drivers.|$|E
25|$|People {{removing}} {{items from}} the shoreline for their own use could have been faced with prosecution, according to police at the time. Eight extra police were brought over to Scilly from mainland Cornwall to assist, taking notes of who was removing goods. Customs <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> that, under the Merchant Acts of 1894 and 1906, people are obliged to report recovered flotsam to the Receiver of Wreck. There is no known case of police taking up criminal proceedings {{for the removal of}} the flotsam.|$|E
25|$|In November 2012, {{one of the}} Russian {{supersonic}} heavy {{strategic bomber}} Tu-160, based at the Engels-2 Air Force Base, was named for Igor Sikorsky, which caused controversy among air base crew members. One of the <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> that Igor Sikorsky does not deserve it because he laid {{the foundations of the}} U.S., rather than Russian aviation. However, the Long Range Aviation command officer said that Igor Sikorsky is not responsible for the activities of his military aircraft. In 2013, Flying magazine ranked Sikorsky number 12 on its list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing {{can save}} him," [...] the <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> shaking his head. Ronald looked round; {{there was no}} rope lying {{anywhere}} on the shore.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s Fenton {{agreed to help}} the IRA and moved {{explosives}} from an arms dump to a safe house. He was then approached by officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary's Special Branch who said he could be prosecuted for the offence. The <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> if Fenton agreed {{to work for them}} as an informer he would not be prosecuted, and he would be paid in addition. After agreeing to a further meeting with the officers, Fenton tried to extricate himself from the situation by attempting {{to start a new life}} in Australia with his wife and four children.|$|E
25|$|Also in April, {{heavily armed}} {{members from the}} PSNI Special Operations Branch (C4) raided four houses in south County Armagh and seized mobile phones and documentation, as well as taking away other {{material}} for forensic examination. Senior officers informed journalists that the searches had been intelligence led, and were focused on suspected criminals or associates {{of members of the}} gang believed to have been responsible for the murder of Donohoe. No-one was detained during the four searches, but <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> that the operation's primary objective was to gather evidence. Follow-up operations to the PSNI seizures were carried out a number of weeks later south of the border by Gardaí. Several search warrants were executed by investigators in the Carlingford area of Louth.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, 2005, Game {{was charged}} with disorderly conduct and {{resisting}} arrest in Greensboro, North Carolina. At one point, police said his companions were pepper sprayed when they surrounded officers in a threatening manner. Mall security <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> the rapper was wearing a full-face Halloween mask, filming shoppers, cursed loudly, and refused to leave when asked. Game continued to act up and was arrested, a police statement said. Game claimed that officers overreacted {{and that he did}} nothing wrong when he was pepper-sprayed by the mall security. The five officers involved in the incident ended up suing Game for defamation. The officers were awarded $5 million in compensatory damages, which was upheld on appeal by the North Carolina Court of Appeals in February 2012.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{shall not}} be disturbed," [...] the <b>officer</b> <b>said</b> respectfully, and Stanley heard a {{movement}} of feet, and then {{the closing of the}} door.|$|R
25|$|Police {{arrested a}} suspect that closely matched the {{description}} on Sunday. The suspect had gloves that Mrs. Harmon {{identified as the}} same gloves worn by her attacker. The man was also wearing blue clothes and khakis. The pocket knife the 33 year-old was carrying, though, had a blade much shorter than five inches. This man was also clean shaven. After investigating the suspect, officers {{did not believe the}} man was the Phantom. According to the man's story about bumming around the country, he could not have been in Texarkana during the slaying of Virgil Starks. The man said that he left Pine Bluff {{in the latter part of}} April and went to Colorado. <b>Officers</b> <b>said</b> that they were going to thoroughly check his story. They kept him in jail for three weeks so his beard would grow back, which would allow Mrs. Harmon to positively identify him as her attacker.|$|E
500|$|The next day, Gröning and {{the other}} arrivals {{reported}} to the central SS administrative building and were asked about their background before the war. One of the <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> Gröning's bank clerk skills would be useful, {{and took him to}} barracks where the prisoners' money was kept. Gröning [...] was told that when prisoners were registered into the camp, their money was stored here and later returned to them when they left.|$|E
500|$|Gotovina {{assessed}} the VRS's {{resistance to the}} HV and the HVO units early on during the battle as fierce, while former RSK <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> that the overall resistance of the VRS and the RSK battlegroup in Bosansko Grahovo area was not great. Of the attacking HV/HVO forces, 18 men were killed in action and 155 were wounded. Approximately [...] of territory changed hands and the KninDrvar road, vital to resupply of the RSK, was interdicted. The offensive displaced between 12,000 and 14,000 Serb refugees who fled towards Banja Luka.|$|E

500|$|Many of the German {{units were}} recent conscripts {{with very little}} experience. Sergeant Vinz Kuhlbach's platoon was typical. Most of his {{soldiers}} had little combat experience and even less training. The German units had been formed by conscripting teenage boys and men over 50, men previously rejected as physically unfit for service, wounded soldiers newly released from hospitals, and men transferred from the [...] "jobless" [...] personnel of the shrinking Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe. The German 3rd Fallschirmjäger [...] Division, which had previously acquired a superb combat reputation, had been virtually destroyed during the Normandy Invasion in the Falaise pocket. It had been resurrected by using replacements from the 22nd, 51st, and 53rd Luftwaffe Field Regiments. The German units were usually organized around small cadres of seasoned veterans. Although they carried the new StG 44 and were equipped with rifle grenades, few had ever fired them in combat. The German recruits were told the American soldiers they faced {{would not have the}} nerve to stand and fight. Their <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> the Americans were [...] "a gum-chewing, undisciplined half-breed with no stomach for real war." ...|$|E
500|$|After the {{demographics}} changed, youth street gangs appeared in Gulfton. [...] the Gulfton area has gangs such as [...] "Southwest Cholos," [...] "La Primera," [...] "La Tercera Crips," [...] "Somos Pocos Pero Locos," [...] and [...] "Mara Salvatrucha" [...] (MS-13). Charles Rotramel, {{the director of}} a nonprofit group called [...] "Youth Advocates," [...] said that Gulfton's dense conditions, lack of features intended for children, and lack of recreational and athletic programs helped form the gang cultures. He added that other factors included fathers being absent, including many who were imprisoned, and mothers who had issues like drug and alcohol addictions or mothers who worked for jobs with very lengthy working hours. In 1993, the [...] "Southwest Cholos" [...] began to appear in Gulfton. The gang did not have a traditional leadership structure like those in New York City and Los Angeles. Several police <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> that the gang engaged in criminal activities. Controversy erupted in 1995 after six teenagers and two adults sustained injuries in a drive-by shooting near Jane Long Middle School. Police believed that the shooting was related to street gangs and arrested a 13-year-old Sharpstown Middle School student in connection with the shooting. The Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization had demanded for years that the City of Houston expand its anti-crime activities. Sarah Turner, a spokesperson for the mayor, insisted that the city had taken corrective action.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Jerusalem Post, [...] IAF <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> on 31 July 2011 {{that they}} did not {{anticipate}} that the delivery date for the F-35 would slip beyond 2017. [...] If it did, the IAF will need to consider other options for that time period, such as additional F-15s to fill the gap that would be created in the event that the JSF program is further delayed.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{we could}} get a wire across," [...] the {{engineer}} <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "we certainly could build the bridge in less time than I stated." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This is {{important}} news indeed," [...] the <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and your conduct {{has been in}} every way most gallant. What is your name, lad?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Disgruntled users nicknamed NMCI [...] "No More Contracted Infosystems," [...] {{according}} to {{an article in the}} Marine Corps Times. Some users also complain that they are not able to access all the Web sites they want, like box.net and npr.org. [...] Senior <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> they enacted the worldwide ban on these types of sites out of concern that the rapidly increasing use of these sites threatened to overwhelm the military's private Internet network and risk the disclosure of combat-sensitive material.|$|E
2500|$|Paddick {{asserts that}} he {{implemented}} the policy {{because he wanted}} his officers to deal with cannabis quickly and informally {{so that they could}} concentrate on heroin and crack cocaine offences, and street robbery and burglary, which were affecting {{the quality of life in}} Lambeth to a greater extent. [...] "olice <b>officers</b> <b>said</b> they weren't prepared any longer to drop cannabis down the drain because one of their colleagues had been arrested by internal investigators apparently for doing just that. They were going to arrest everybody they found even with the smallest amount of cannabis. I couldn't have allowed that to happen. They would have been doing nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three white Minneapolis police {{officers}} were charged in the beating of an African American man in a suburb south of Minneapolis, in 2013. William C. Woodis, Christopher J. Bennett and Andrew R. Allen were off-duty and having drinks at a bar when a black man introduced himself to them. When Apple Valley, Minnesota police were called the officers claimed that Spann followed {{them out of the}} bar, but security camera footage showed them following him. Spann's nephew, who was also hit by the officers, as well as another witness who did not know Spann or the <b>officers,</b> <b>said</b> that the officers were [...] "on attack." [...] Woodis and Bennett pled guilty to misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct. Charges against Allen were dropped.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] the <b>officer</b> <b>said,</b> passionately, [...] "you {{introduce}} them to me, not me to them. The inferior rank is introduced to the superior." ...|$|R
