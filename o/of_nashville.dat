5|$|Black Lives Matter {{protested the}} {{shooting}} of Jocques Clemmons which occurred in Nashville, Tennessee on February 10, 2017. On May 12, 2017, a day after Glenn Funk, the district attorney of Davidson County decided not to prosecute police officer Joshua Lippert, the Nashville chapter of BLM held a demonstration near the Vanderbilt University campus {{all the way to}} the residence <b>of</b> <b>Nashville</b> mayor Megan Barry.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Karl Dean drafted {{plans for}} {{financing}} the stadium and acquiring the necessary {{land from the}} state. The deal involved the Metropolitan Government <b>of</b> <b>Nashville</b> and Davidson County (Metro) receiving the state-owned Sulphur Dell property—then in use as a parking lot for state employees—in exchange for paying the state $18million {{for the construction of}} a 1,000-car parking garage on the site and $5million for an underground parking garage below the proposed new state library and archives. The city also acquired the property on which the Nashville School of the Arts is located.|$|E

5|$|On the Monday {{following}} the first sit-in, the Baptist Minister's Conference <b>of</b> <b>Nashville,</b> representing 79 congregations, unanimously voted {{to support the}} student movement, thus throwing the weight of Nashville's black religious community behind the students. Local religious leaders called on people of good will to boycott downtown merchants who practiced segregation. Nashville's black community strongly supported the boycott, causing economic hardship for the merchants.|$|E

5|$|The intrastate rivalry was {{interrupted}} when Nashville {{moved to the}} American Association in 1985, but was renewed when the Sounds joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998. The Sounds and the Memphis Redbirds have been division rivals ever since. In 2009, Memphis clinched the American Conference Northern Division title, finishing the season just two games ahead <b>of</b> <b>Nashville</b> which spent {{the majority of the}} season in first place. Similarly, Nashville finished the 2014 season two-and-a-half games behind Memphis after having led the division for most of the season.|$|E

For over a decade, the Sounds attempted to secure agreements with the Metropolitan Government <b>of</b> <b>Nashville</b> and Davidson County for a new ballpark to replace Greer, eventually resulting in the construction of First Tennessee Park, which became the Sounds' new home in 2015.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and {{the ebb and flow}} of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense <b>of</b> <b>Nashville</b> as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its first}} two years, the 70th Indiana {{performed}} reconnaissance duty and guarded railroads in Kentucky and Tennessee. In 1864, Harrison and his regiment joined William T. Sherman's Atlanta Campaign {{and moved to the}} front lines. On January 2, 1864, Harrison was promoted to command the 1st Brigade of the 1st Division of the XX Corps. He commanded the brigade at the battles of Resaca, Cassville, New Hope Church, Lost Mountain, Kennesaw Mountain, Marietta, Peachtree Creek and Atlanta. When Sherman's main force began its March to the Sea, Harrison's brigade was transferred to the District of Etowah and participated in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Nashville.</b>|$|E

5|$|Johnston decided upon {{a course}} of action that {{forfeited}} the initiative across most of his defensive line, tacitly admitting that the Confederate defensive strategy for Tennessee was a sham. On February 7, at a council of war held in the Covington Hotel at Bowling Green, he decided to abandon western Kentucky by withdrawing Beauregard from Columbus, evacuating Bowling Green, and moving his forces south of the Cumberland River at Nashville. Despite his misgivings about its defensibility, Johnston agreed to Beauregard's advice that he should reinforce Fort Donelson with another 12,000 men, knowing that a defeat there would mean the inevitable loss of Middle Tennessee and the vital manufacturing and arsenal city <b>of</b> <b>Nashville.</b>|$|E
5|$|M-79 starts {{south of}} Hastings at a {{three-way}} intersection with M-37 in Hastings Township. The trunkline runs east and parallel to {{a section of}} the Thornapple River through wooded terrain that is interspersed with farm fields. South of Thornapple Lake, M-79 angles southeasterly moving from Quimby Road to Scott Road running parallel to the Thornapple River again into the community <b>of</b> <b>Nashville.</b> M-79 meets M-66 and turns south along the latter highway's route along Main and Durkee streets through the community. South of town in Maple Grove Township, M-79 separates from M-66 and turns east along Lawrence Road. Outside of Charlotte, M-79 curves southeast to transition to Lawrence Avenue through town. The eastern terminus is at an intersection with Cochran Avenue, which carries BLI-69 and M-50.|$|E
5|$|M-79 {{was formed}} as a state {{trunkline}} by July 1, 1919 along part of its present routing. At the time, it ran between Hastings and Nashville as it does today. From Nashville, the trunkline turned south and west to end at the contemporary M-17 in Battle Creek. By 1927, the southernmost section of M-79 was truncated when M-78 was extended to Battle Creek. In late 1930, the southernmost section was shortened once again as a new M-14 designation replaced M-79 south <b>of</b> <b>Nashville.</b> An eastward extension of M-79 {{at the same time}} carries the highway designation to Vermontville.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the campaigning {{season of}} 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama. Their {{marriage}} {{was never to}} be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill-conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, just south <b>of</b> <b>Nashville,</b> Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised, after his horse was shot out from under him. Accounts later {{said that he was}} found just inside the Federal line and his body carried back to an aid station along the Columbia Turnpike. Confederate war records indicate he died of a shot to the abdomen, or possibly a bullet that went through his heart. When Confederates found his body, he had been picked clean of any valuable items, including his sword, boots and pocket watch.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral David Porter. During {{the retreat}} down the Red River, Neosho was trapped above the falls at Alexandria, Louisiana, {{along with most}} of the other ironclads of the Mississippi Squadron, when the river's water level {{unexpectedly}} began to fall. Two temporary dams, known as Bailey's Dam, had to be built in April–May to raise the water level high enough to allow the ironclads to proceed downstream. During the Franklin-Nashville Campaign in December 1864 Neosho, accompanied by the casemate ironclad , bombarded Confederate artillery batteries on the Cumberland River, near Bell's Mills, Tennessee, on 6 December. Despite being hit over 100 times, she was not seriously damaged. The monitor bombarded the Confederate right wing during the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Nashville</b> on 15–16 December.|$|E
5|$|The 11th Indiana Infantry Regiment, {{also known}} as the Indiana Zouaves, under the command of Lew Wallace, was the first {{regiment}} organized in Indiana during the Civil War and the first one to march into battle. The 11th Indiana fought in the Battle of Fort Donelson, the Siege of Vicksburg, {{the second day of the}} Battle of Shiloh, and elsewhere. In 1861 the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment became one of the first Hoosier regiments to see action in the war. The 9th Indiana fought in many major battles, including the Battle of Shiloh, the Battle of Stones River, the Atlanta Campaign, and the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Nashville,</b> among others.|$|E

5|$|The Neosho-class {{monitors}} were {{a pair of}} ironclad river monitors {{laid down}} {{in the summer of}} 1862. After completion in mid-1863, both ships spent time patrolling the Mississippi River against Confederate raids and ambushes as part of Rear Admiral David Porter's Mississippi Squadron. Both ships participated in the Red River Campaign in March–May 1864, although Osage supported the capture of Fort DeRussy in March and participated in the Battle of Blair's Landing in April. Osage was grounded on a sandbar for six months {{after the end of the}} campaign while Neosho resumed her patrols on the Mississippi. The latter ship supported the Union Army's operations on the Cumberland River and provided fire support during the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Nashville</b> in December.|$|E
5|$|Grant, who was courteous to Buckner {{following}} the surrender, offered to loan him money {{to see him}} through his impending imprisonment, but Buckner declined. The surrender was a personal humiliation for Buckner and a strategic defeat for the Confederacy, which lost more than 12,000men, 48 artillery pieces, much of their equipment, {{and control of the}} Cumberland River, which led to the evacuation <b>of</b> <b>Nashville.</b> This was the first of three Confederate armies that Grant would capture during the war. (The second was John C. Pemberton's at the Siege of Vicksburg and the third Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at Appomattox). Buckner also turned over considerable military equipment and provisions, which Grant's troops badly needed. More than 7,000 Confederate prisoners of war were eventually transported from Fort Donelson to Camp Douglas in Chicago, Camp Morton in Indianapolis, and other prison camps elsewhere in the North. Buckner was held as a prisoner at Fort Warren in Boston until he was exchanged in August 1862.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital <b>of</b> <b>Nashville,</b> Johnson did not {{consistently}} vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E
50|$|After {{moving to}} Nashville in 2006, Lewis began reestablishing the Libertarian Party {{affiliate}} in the Nashville area as the Libertarian Party <b>of</b> Metropolitan <b>Nashville</b> and Davidson County.
