5|$|A set of {{elements}} under two binary operations, + and −, {{is called a}} Euclidean domain if it forms a commutative ring R and, roughly speaking, if a generalized Euclidean algorithm can be performed on them. The two <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> such a ring need not be the addition and multiplication of ordinary arithmetic; rather, they can be more general, such as the <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> a mathematical group or monoid. Nevertheless, these general operations should respect many of the laws governing ordinary arithmetic, such as commutativity, associativity and distributivity.|$|E
