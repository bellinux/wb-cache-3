5|$|At ground level, the three-track Northeast Corridor {{runs through}} the station. There are two side {{platforms}}; however, Providence/Stoughton Line trains do not stop at Readville in regular service. The platforms are occasionally used during service disruptions when Fairmount Line service is not running <b>or</b> <b>when</b> trains cannot stop at Hyde Park.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral methods involve {{regulating}} the timing or method of intercourse to prevent introduction of sperm into the female reproductive tract, either altogether <b>or</b> <b>when</b> an egg may be present. If used perfectly the first-year failure rate may be around 3.4%, however if used poorly first-year failure rates may approach 85%.|$|E
5|$|Cats may bite humans when provoked, during play <b>or</b> <b>when</b> aggressive. Complications from cat bites can develop. A cat bite {{differs from}} the bites of other pets. This is because the teeth of a cat are sharp and pointed causing deep punctures. Skin usually closes rapidly over the bite and traps {{microorganisms}} that cause infection.|$|E
50|$|Receptors are created, or expressed, by the DNA of the cell, {{and they}} can be increased, <b>or</b> upregulated, <b>when</b> the signal is weak, or decreased, <b>or</b> downregulated, <b>when</b> it is strong.|$|R
60|$|Miss Fairlie's expectations, then, {{were of a}} twofold kind, {{comprising}} her possible {{inheritance of}} real property, <b>or</b> land, <b>when</b> her uncle died, and her absolute inheritance of personal property, <b>or</b> money, <b>when</b> she came of age.|$|R

5|$|Composers {{tried to}} match beats-per-minute to the {{gameplay}} and traversal system. The game features a dynamic music system, in which in-game actions are {{reflected by the}} music. When there is more on-screen action, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> players perform kills, the music becomes more frantic and exciting to help players further immerse themselves in the game.|$|E
5|$|Deathmatch. Every man for himself. The game ends when {{a player}} reaches the score limit, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> time expires.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to the public, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E
5000|$|When {{considering}} {{a set of}} N non-interacting but identical atoms <b>or</b> molecules, <b>when</b> QT ≫ N , <b>or</b> equivalently <b>when</b> ρ Λ ≪ 1 where ρ is the density of particles, the total translational partition function can be written ...|$|R
50|$|This is {{not always}} the case. For example, the height of adult humans almost always starts with a 1 <b>or</b> 2 <b>when</b> {{measured}} in meters, and almost always starts with 4, 5, 6, <b>or</b> 7 <b>when</b> measured in feet.|$|R
50|$|Features include {{recording}} of the user's actions into macros, a visual programming language, sending email, window repositioning and resizing, text file processing, and file manipulation. Macros can be launched via a hotkey, <b>or</b> automatically triggered <b>when</b> a process starts <b>or</b> terminates, <b>when</b> a network connection has been made <b>or</b> released, <b>when</b> a file change occurred in a folder, or based on {{the contents of the}} clipboard.|$|R
5|$|For {{adventitious}} protection, {{an animal}} uses {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell to conceal its outline, for example when a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> a decorator crab decorates its back with seaweed, sponges and stones.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{foraging}} birds may feed actively on {{the substrate}} or pick grains {{dropped on the}} ground and these strategies may be chosen according to the situation. Early departures occur more often when expected searching time decreases and when competition intensity increases. Competition intensity is expected to increase when more scroungers are present <b>or</b> <b>when</b> patches are smaller.|$|E
5|$|Growling: Often {{accompanied}} by hissing and spitting, the cheetah growls {{to show its}} annoyance, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> faced with danger. A study showed that growls consist of numerous short pulses with a combined duration of up to five seconds.|$|E

International call prefix is 8~10 (<b>or</b> 8~CC <b>when</b> using alternative operators, where CC is 26-29, 56-59). The country code is +7.|$|R
25|$|Sleep {{paralysis}} is {{the temporary}} inability to talk <b>or</b> move <b>when</b> waking (<b>or</b> less often, <b>when</b> falling asleep). It may last {{a few seconds}} to minutes. This is often frightening but is not dangerous.|$|R

5|$|John Pomerleau, {{owner of}} Alternative Funeral Service {{which is located}} in the Algo Centre Mall said in July that more than 30 {{cremation}} urns were still trapped in the mall and it was unknown if <b>or</b> <b>when</b> they could be recovered.|$|E
5|$|New {{morphological}} {{features and}} ultimately new species {{are produced by}} variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> toolkit genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the Neo-Lamarckian theory that epigenetic changes are later consolidated at gene level, something {{that may have been}} important early in the history of multicellular life.|$|E

5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here {{to mean the}} re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other games}} in The Sims series, Sims could develop skills. There were six skills: art, cooking, music, writing, athletic, driving, and various project skill items which were tied with {{specific}} themed collections. Developing higher level skill levels allowed Sims to obtain new objects. Sims developed skills when the player interacted with an art object (such as easel <b>or</b> computer <b>when</b> level 30), a music object (such as a guitar <b>or</b> keyboard <b>when</b> level 10), a cooking object (such as a microwave, a coffee maker <b>when</b> level 10, <b>or</b> a stove <b>when</b> level 15), <b>or</b> a writing object (such {{as a computer}} <b>or</b> typewriter <b>when</b> level 10). At times, skills {{were a part of}} quests given to the player for their Sim to achieve.|$|R

5|$|Team Deathmatch. Same {{rules as}} a deathmatch except the player is {{automatically}} assigned {{to either the}} Chernovan (red) or Eucadian (blue) teams. Game ends when the combined score limit is met <b>or</b> <b>when</b> time expires.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{has been}} criticized by liberals, such as when it {{excluded}} Communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended Neo-Nazis, when it declined to defend Paul Robeson, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> it opposed {{the passage of the}} National Labor Relations Act. Conversely, it {{has been criticized}} by conservatives, such as when it argued against official prayer in public schools, <b>or</b> <b>when</b> it opposed the Patriot Act. The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as Rush Limbaugh, George Wallace, Henry Ford, and Oliver North; and it has supported liberal figures such as Dick Gregory, Rockwell Kent, and Dr. Benjamin Spock.|$|E
