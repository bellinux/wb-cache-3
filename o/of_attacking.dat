On the same episode, McIntyre simultaneously continued his feud with Kofi Kingston by teaming with Jack Swagger in a loss to Kingston and The Big Show.|$|E
5|$|Bradman saw Miller as a top-order batsman {{and as his}} new ball {{partner for}} Lindwall, {{although}} the Victorian allrounder was a reluctant bowler. The Australian captain felt that Miller was crucial to his strategy <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> England's strong batting line-up—which boasted the likes of Hammond, Denis Compton, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich and Cyril Washbrook—with high pace. Miller was duly selected for the Australian team for the First Test.|$|E

Throughout, Ferraro kept campaigning, taking on the traditional running mate role <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> the opposition vigorously. By the end, she had traveled more than Mondale and more than Reagan and Bush combined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, when Reynolds {{number is}} {{within the range of}} 10000 to 1000000, the {{horizontal}} component of the total pressure of flow around flat plate at high angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was regarded as lift of high angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> and the vertical component was regarded as drag of high angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The horizontal component of total pressure at small angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was regarded as shape drag, and the total drag coefficient at small angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was considered to the sum of the shape drag and frictional drag at zero angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> For the two states of large and small angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the application scopes of the formulas of lift and drag coefficients were given. Final, the relations of lift and drag coefficients were obtained by eliminating all angles <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Research results show that lift- drag curve of small angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is parabola, and the lift- drag curve of high angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is circle...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the angle}} <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{is less than}} the {{stalling}} angle any increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and lift coefficient decrease which tend to restore the wing to its original angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Conversely any decrease in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes a decrease in lift coefficient which causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends, the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and lift coefficient increase which tends to restore the wing to its original angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> For this reason the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is stable when it {{is less than the}} stalling angle. [...] The aircraft displays damping in roll.|$|R
5|$|Following Operation Source, {{the task}} <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> Tirpitz was {{assigned}} to the Home Fleet's aircraft carriers. Following months of preparations, a successful attack (Operation Tungsten) involving two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters was conducted on 3 April 1944. While Tirpitzs crew suffered heavy casualties during this operation, the battleship was not badly damaged. Nevertheless, she was placed out of action for several additional months while repairs were completed.|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, several {{injuries}} in the Italian squad, {{as well as a}} lack <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> options and Totti's run of good form as a substitute for Roma, led some in the media to call for manager Antonio Conte to include Totti as a reserve in Italy's Euro 2016 squad; however, he was later left out of Conte's 30-man preliminary Italy squad for the final tournament.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, clashes {{erupted in}} Quảng Ngãi Province between the Buddhists and the VNQDD, {{prompting}} the local ARVN commander Tôn Thất Đính to forcibly restrain the two groups.

5000|$|... #Caption: A typical graph of lift {{coefficient}} and drag coefficient versus angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> At any angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{greater than the}} stalling angle an increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes a reduction in {{lift coefficient}}, {{and a decrease in}} angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes an increase in lift coefficient.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the wing}} is stalled and the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{is greater than}} the {{stalling}} angle any increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes a decrease in lift coefficient that causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, which causes the lift coefficient to decrease and the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> to increase. Conversely any decrease in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> decreases and causes the lift coefficient to increase further towards the maximum lift coefficient. For this reason the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is unstable when it {{is greater than the}} stalling angle. Any disturbance of the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on one wing will cause the whole wing to roll spontaneously and continuously.|$|R
50|$|In aerodynamics, {{hysteresis}} can {{be observed}} when decreasing the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> a wing after stall, regarding the lift and drag coefficients. The angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> where the flow {{on top of the}} wing reattaches is generally lower than the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> where the flow separates during the increase of the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|R

Before Giltner's reinforcements arrived, Duke {{and his men}} counterattacked the Union linerouting it and forcing a withdrawal. Duke and Witcher then combined forces and charged the Union's extreme left flank, inflicting significant damage on a Union colored regiment.|$|E

5|$|Townshend {{took charge}} of the British forces and {{realised}} that Bougainville's column was approaching from the British rear, having taken some time to arrive from Cap Rouge. He quickly formed up two battalions from the confused troops on the field and turned them to meet the oncoming French, a day-saving manoeuvre; instead <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> with a well rested and ready force, Bougainville retreated while the rest of Montcalm's army slipped back across the St. Charles.|$|E
5000|$|The {{critical}} angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> which produces maximum lift coefficient. This is {{also called the}} [...] "stall angle of attack". Below the {{critical angle}} <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> as the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, the coefficient of lift (Cl) increases. Conversely, above the critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> as angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface. On most airfoil shapes, as the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, the upper surface separation point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge. At the critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil or wing is producing its maximum coefficient of lift. As angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases further, the upper surface flow {{becomes more and more}} fully separated and the airfoil/wing produces less coefficient of lift.|$|R
50|$|If an {{aircraft}} is longitudinally stable, a small increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{will cause the}} pitching moment on the aircraft to change so that the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> decreases. Similarly, a small decrease in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> will cause the pitching moment to change so that the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases.|$|R
40|$|The effects <b>of</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> between 0 and 4 degrees were studied. The results {{indicate}} that increasing angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from zero can produce substantial changes in the transonic flutter characteristics that are favorable or unfavorable depending on Mach number and angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The bottom <b>of</b> the transonic flutter-boundary 'bucket' is shown to occur at lower Mach number as angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases. These flutter results correlate well {{with the effects of}} Mach number and angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on aerodynamic behavior, especially on the development of transonic flow phenomena. The calculated flutter characteristics are in good agreement with the experimental data at zero angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> but at nonzero angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> the experiments show sharply declining and backward-turning transonic flutter boundaries that are not indicated by the calculations. These may be caused by variations in static aeroelastic deformation...|$|R
5|$|Up until now, the Bf 109s had {{successfully}} blocked {{attacks on the}} bombers.

Palmyra invaded Anatolia the following year, reaching Ankara and the pinnacle of its expansion.|$|E
5|$|A 1754 {{enactment}} introduced up to {{one year}} imprisponment for carrying of daggers and pocket pistols ("tercerols") as well as tough sentencing for cases <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> or resisting law enforcement with use of these weapons. Mere brandishing of a weapon against a state official was to be punished by life imprisonment. Wounding a state official would be punished by decapitation, killing of state official by cutting of hand followed by decapitation. Another 1754 enactment limited possibility of shooting within limits of certain cities to licensed shooting ranges, showing early development of sport shooting in the country.|$|E
50|$|Flow {{separation}} {{begins to}} occur at small angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> while attached flow over the wing is still dominant. As angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, the separated regions {{on the top}} of the wing increase in size and hinder the wing's ability to create lift. At the critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> separated flow is so dominant that additional increases in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> produce less lift and more drag.|$|R
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{are equipped with}} a built-in flight computer that automatically prevents the aircraft from increasing the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> any further when a maximum angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is reached, regardless of pilot input. This is called the 'angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> limiter' or 'alpha limiter'. Modern airliners that have fly-by-wire technology avoid the critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> by means <b>of</b> software in the computer systems that govern the flight control surfaces.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{investigation into}} the flow correction for an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> sensor mounted ahead of the wing tip of a general aviation research airplane has been conducted at the Langley Research Center. This correction has been determined in wind tunnels using a full-scale model up to angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 45 deg and a 1 / 5 -scale model up to 80 deg angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The flow correction has also been obtained in flight by using a standard technique at low angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and in spinning flight at larger angles <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> by using both a simple approximate technique and a parameter estimation technique. The results show the correction is significant, reaching 10 deg at a measured angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 90 deg. The flow correction was sensitive to the angle of sideslip at measured angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> greater than 60 deg and was not influenced by wing leading-edge modifications or aileron deflections...|$|R

For this mission, CCA (Combat Command A) of the 1st Armored Division {{was attached to the}} 45th Infantry Division. Landing on schedule, VI Corps surprised the Germans, but Major General Lucas's decision to consolidate the beachhead instead <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> gave the Germans time to bring the LXXVI Panzer Corps forward to oppose the landings.|$|E
5|$|Amir's brigade {{began to}} reach the plain between Artillery Road and the Firdan bridge at 09:00. So far no Egyptian {{resistance}} of any significance had been encountered. The brigade had the objective <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> 2nd Division's bridgehead. Abu Sa'ada, the division commander, had the 24th Armored Brigade as the divisional reserve, but he could only commit it {{in case of an}} Israeli penetration. Gonen wanted Adan {{to reach the}} Hizayon strongpoint, and contacted Elazar in Tel Aviv at 09:55 to request a crossing of the canal. Gonen either downplayed or ignored negative reports and only told Elazar of positive developments.

30|$|The {{results showed}} that when α <  0 °, the {{increase}} of the absolute angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> value decreased water-entry depth, horizontal displacement, and slope angle.

When α ≥  0 °, the decrease of initial angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> value decreased water-entry depth and horizontal displacement and accelerated the decrease of slope angle. It accelerated the increase of positive rotational angular velocity and positive angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The vehicle rotated downwards and even overturned. The decrease of initial water-entry angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> reduced the change of slope angle and angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> during water entry.

40|$|AbstractA formal {{analysis}} to footprint problem with effects <b>of</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> (AOA) is presented. First a flexible and rapid standardized method for footprint generation is developed. Zero bank angle control strategy and the maximum crossrange method {{are used to}} obtain virtual target set; afterward, closed-loop bank angle guidance law is used to find footprint by solving closest approach problem for each element in virtual target set. Then based on quasi-equilibrium glide condition, the typical inequality reentry trajectory constraints are converted to angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> lower boundary constraint. Constrained by the lower boundary, an original and practical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> parametric method is proposed. By using parametric angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> profile, optimization algorithm for angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is designed and the impact <b>of</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> to footprint is discussed. Simulations with different angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> profiles are presented to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} proposed footprint solution method and validity of optimal algorithm...|$|R
5|$|Caio Duilios first wartime patrol {{took place}} on 31 August.

No progress was made and they {{spent the rest of the}} day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E
5|$|Neither side made a {{substitution}} at half time. In the 56th minute, Cesc Fàbregas – who had {{a bicycle}} kick saved by Lloris – set up Diego Costa, whose shot from {{the left of the}} area deflected off Tottenham right-back Kyle Walker and into the net to double Chelsea's advantage. After conceding their second goal, Tottenham made a series <b>of</b> <b>attacking</b> substitutions – Andros Townsend, Ryan Mason and Chadli made way for Mousa Dembélé, Érik Lamela and Roberto Soldado respectively – but could not change the score.

There were four minutes of added time, in which Chelsea substituted Costa for Didier Drogba.|$|E
40|$|In-flight {{pressure}} distributions at four fuselage stations on the forebody of the X- 29 A aircraft {{have been}} reported at angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from 15 to 66 deg and at Mach numbers from 0. 22 to 0. 60. At angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 20 deg and higher, vortices shed from the nose strake caused suction peaks in the pressure distributions that generally increased in magnitude with angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Above 30 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the forebody pressure distributions became asymmetrical at the most forward station, while they remained nearly symmetrical until 50 to 55 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> for the aft stations. Between 59 to 66 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the asymmetry <b>of</b> the pressure distributions changed direction. Yawing moments for the forebody alone were obtained by integrating the forebody pressure distributions. At 45 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the aircraft yaws {{to the right and}} at 50 deg and higher, the aircraft yaws to the left. The forebody yawing moments correlated well with the aircraft left yawing moment at an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 50 deg or higher. At a 45 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the forebody yawing moments did not correlate well with the aircraft yawing moment, but it is suggested that this was due to asymmetric pressures on the cockpit region of the fuselage which was not instrumented. The forebody was also shown to provide a positive component of directional stability of the aircraft at angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 25 deg or higher. A Mach number effect was noted at angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 30 deg or higher at the station where the nose strake was present. At this station, the suction peaks in the pressure distributions at the highest Mach number were reduced and much more symmetrical as compared to the lower Mach number pressure distributions...|$|R
50|$|The angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is {{the angle}} between the chord line of an airfoil and the {{oncoming}} air. A symmetrical airfoil will generate zero lift at zero angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> But as the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, {{the air is}} deflected through a larger angle and the vertical component of the airstream velocity increases, resulting in more lift. For small angles a symmetrical airfoil will generate a lift force roughly proportional to the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley free-flight tunnel at low-subsonic speed to determine the static stability, control effectiveness, and damping in roll and yaw of a model with a low-aspect-ratio unswept wing and two different fuselage forebodies at angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from 0 deg to 90 deg. Results were obtained with a fuselage configuration having a long pointed nose and a shorter rounded nose. Although the wing stalled at an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 12 deg, maximum lift did not occur until an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 40 deg or 50 deg was obtained. The static longitudinal stability of the model having a short rounded nose was greater than that of the model having a longer pointed nose over the entire angle-of-attack range. The pointed-nose model had large out-of-trim yawing moments above an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 40 deg. Shortening and rounding the nose of the model delayed these out-of-trim yawing moments to slightly higher angles <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Both models were directionally unstable above an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 20 deg, but both had positive effective dihedral over virtually the entire angle-of-attack range. At the higher angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> the pointed-nose model had generally better damping in roll than that of the rounded-nose model. Both models had very high damping in yaw at an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 50 deg or 60 deg...|$|R
