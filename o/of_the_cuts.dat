As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> Bailey was examined by the ringside physician. Following this Bailey expressed that he didn't want to continue and the referee stopped the fight at 1:39 of the sixth round. Eleven days later, on December 22, 2004 the Puerto Rican boxing commission named Cotto as Puerto Rico's fighter of the year for 2004.|$|E
5|$|On March 7, 2016, Bevin {{released}} a video {{on social media}} claiming that House Democrats were not following through on their obligations to help craft the state budget. Legislators responded with a photo and statements that while Bevin was producing his film designed to chastise them, House leaders were in fact in committee meetings working out details of a budget proposal while Speaker Stumbo suggested the Governor was either unfamiliar with the legislative process, or intended to deceive people. On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> to executive agencies in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts. The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed closely to Bevin's original budget.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> cutting design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{chain saw}} {{is defined by}} the number, the {{arrangement}} and <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting tools. When using chisel cutting tools, the cross sectional area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> and <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groove are determined by the width and depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut.</b> <b>The</b> laboratory tests analyzed <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross sectional area and <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> on <b>the</b> forces and the specific energy. The testing was performed on a linear cutting machine with tool holders and cutting tools in real-scale size. According to the processed statistical data, increasing the cross sectional area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> reduces <b>the</b> specific energy, whereby <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> has a considerably larger impact. The tests have shown that besides the cross sectional area <b>of</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface also affects the forces and specific energy. Through increasing the width to depth ratio upon a constant cross sectional area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific energy and the cutting forces are reduced.

5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle in the minimum weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E

25|$|In 2001 X-rays and a CT scan {{revealed}} that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged {{in his left}} shoulder when he died, and a matching small tear on his coat.

25|$|Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{paintings}} at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. It is viewed by about 4,000 to 5,000 visitors daily with its value estimated at $925,000 in the 1970s. The painting was vandalized on several occasions. On 13 January 1911, an unemployed navy cook tried to cut it with a knife, but could not cut through the thick varnish on the painting. In 1975, William de Rijk, an unemployed school teacher, cut dozens of zigzag lines in the painting with a knife before he was wrestled by the guards. The day before, de Rijk had been turned away from the museum because he arrived after closing time. After the event, he was identified with a mental disorder; he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and committed suicide there on 21 April 1976. It took six months to restore the painting, and traces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> still remain. In 1990, a man threw acid on the painting. The guards managed to quickly dilute it with water so that it penetrated only the varnish layer, and the painting was restored again.|$|E
