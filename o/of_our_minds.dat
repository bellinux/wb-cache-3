25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds.</b> In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that our experience of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included the Critique of Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and the Critique of Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E

[...] It later discussed the conflict between PNR politicians and Khuen-Héderváry's successor, László Lukács.

But Paul's discussion of the Cross differs from John's in being less about how it reveals God's glory and more about how it becomes the stumbling block that turns our minds back to God. Paul also describes the Christian life as that of an athlete, demanding practice and training for the sake of the prize; later writers will see in this image a call to ascetical practices.|$|E

2500|$|The {{criticism}} of writing in Plato's dialogues (German: Schriftkritik). Many dialogues accepted as authentic are {{skeptical about the}} written word as a medium for transferring knowledge and express a preference for oral transmission. Plato's Phaedrus explains this position in detail. [...] There the superiority of oral over written teaching for transmitting philosophy {{is grounded in the}} far greater flexibility of oral discourse, which is held to be a decisive advantage. [...] Authors of texts cannot adapt to the level of knowledge and the needs of individual readers. Moreover, they cannot answer readers' questions and criticisms. These are only possible in conversation, which is alive and psychologically responsive. Written texts are mere images of speech. Writing and reading are thought not only to lead to a weakening <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>minds,</b> but also to be unsuited for communicating wisdom, which can only succeed in oral instruction. [...] Written words are useful only as reminders for those who already know something but may have forgotten it. Literary activity is therefore portrayed as mere play. Personal discussions with students are essential and may permit words in various individualized ways to be inscribed in the soul. Only those who can teach in this way, the Phaedrus continues, can be considered true philosophers. In contrast, those authors who have nothing 'more precious' (Gk., [...] timiōtera) than a written text, which they have long polished, are only authors or writers but not yet philosophers. The meaning here of the Greek for 'more precious' is debated but is thought to point toward the unwritten doctrines.|$|E
