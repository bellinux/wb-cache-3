5|$|The {{park has}} a large {{diversity}} of vegetation. Due to the temperature and climate differences between different areas and elevations of the park, not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> typical Aegean flora present, but also many specimens normally only found in separate coastal areas of Turkey, {{such as in the}} Mediterranean, Marmara, and Black Sea regions.|$|E
5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe. One of the primary features of Ōmoto-kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> park historic, {{but so is}} {{the mostly}} {{residential}} surrounding neighborhood. Many architectural works line the streets facing the park, designed by some of the most famous architects of the late 19th century, including Henry Hobson Richardson. At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston-based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park.|$|E

5|$|The spatial {{structure}} and {{positioning of the}} mirror's reflection are such that PhilipIV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as {{he appears to be}} working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.|$|E

25|$|Maher {{concludes that}} not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{paradoxical}} conclusion true, but that Nicod's criterion is false {{in the absence}} of background knowledge (except for the knowledge that the number of objects in the universe is two and that ravens are less likely than black things).|$|E
25|$|Today, in {{contrast}} to Gosse, young Earth creationists posit that not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Earth young but that the scientific data supports that view. However, the apparent age concept is still used in young Earth creationist literature. There are examples of young Earth creationists arguing that Adam {{did not have a}} navel.|$|E
25|$|Such loss {{results in}} severe melancholic {{symptoms}} more profound than mourning; not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> outside world viewed negatively, but the ego itself is compromised. The patient's decline of self-perception {{is revealed in}} his belief of his own blame, inferiority, and unworthiness. He also emphasized early life experiences as a predisposing factor.|$|E

25|$|Newton's flaming laser sword reply: Mike Alder {{argues that}} the entire {{argument}} is frivolous, because it is non-positivist: not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> distinction between simulating a mind and having a mind ill-defined, {{but it is also}} irrelevant because no experiments were, or even can be, proposed to distinguish between the two.|$|E

25|$|Paclitaxel total {{synthesis}} {{in organic}} chemistry {{is a major}} ongoing research effort in the total synthesis of paclitaxel (Taxol). This diterpenoid is an important drug {{in the treatment of}} cancer but, also expensive because the compound is harvested from a scarce resource, namely the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> synthetic reproduction of the compound itself of great commercial and scientific importance, but it also opens the way to paclitaxel derivatives not found in nature but with greater potential.|$|E

25|$|World Rugby cites rugby union's global participation, {{with men}} {{playing the game}} in well over 100 {{countries}} and women playing in over 50 as well; the organisation's compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code; and that a rugby sevens tournament could be (and generally is) accommodated in one stadium and is relatively inexpensive to play. Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> sevens game successful {{in the context of}} the Sevens World Series and World Cup Sevens, it is also very successfully played in the Commonwealth Games; the sevens tournament at the 2006 Games in Melbourne set all-time attendance records for a sevens tournament.|$|E
25|$|J. R. R. Tolkien {{is one of}} many {{scholars}} who have studied and promoted the Mercian dialect of Old English, and introduced various Mercian terms into his legendarium – especially in relation to the Kingdom of Rohan, otherwise known as the Mark (a name cognate with Mercia). Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> language of Rohan actually represented as the Mercian dialect of Old English, but a number of its kings are given the same names as monarchs who appear in the Mercian royal genealogy, e.g. Fréawine, Fréaláf and Éomer (see List of kings of the Angles).|$|E
25|$|Post-dispersal seed {{predation}} {{is extremely}} common {{in virtually all}} ecosystems. Given the heterogeneity in both resource type (seeds from different species are available), quality (seeds of different ages and/or different status of integrity or decomposition) and location (seeds are scattered and hidden in the environment), most post-dispersal predators have generalist habits. These predators usually belong to a diverse array of animals, such as ants, beetles, crabs, fish, rodents and birds. In addition, not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> assemblage of post-dispersal seed predators diverse, but its composition varies considerably among ecosystems.|$|E

25|$|Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías (FONART), the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa, the Universidad Veracruzana and the Instituto de Artesanías e Industrias Populares de Puebla {{have been}} working on ways to make amate paper making more sustainable. One aspect is to manage the {{collection}} of bark. Another is to find a substitute for caustic soda to soften and prepare the fibers without losing quality. Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> soda polluting, it has had negative effects on artisans' health. As of 2010, the group has reported advances in its investigations such as ways of including new types of bark from other species.|$|E
25|$|According to Dorin Chirtoacă, Mayor of Chișinău, {{pressure}} from society must exist, but organizers of protests should correctly calculate their forces and actions. He {{also stated that}} eventual early elections would further destabilize the situation in Moldova. A similar position was adopted by Moldova's parliament speaker, Andrian Candu, saying {{such a move would}} leave the country stuck in economic crisis. During the September protests, Dorin Chirtoacă has called for the tents to be removed from the central boulevard and claimed that not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> protest illegal, but that it is being fomented by Moscow. He has claimed that Renato Usatîi and Igor Dodon are puppets of Vladimir Putin.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{world trade}} has grown rapidly {{over the last}} decades. Total trade was roughly $100 US billion in 1990, 500 billion in 2000, 850 billion in 2004, 1400 billion in 2005, and 2200 billion in 2007. That computes to an over 20-fold {{increase}} in under 20 years and an annualized growth rate of nearly 18%. More remarkably, {{the vast majority of}} China's growth has taken place in the past decade; in other words, not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> size of China's trade growing, the rate of the growth is accelerating. Thanks to the decades-old Chinese diaspora, the economic dynamism of PRC embassies, China's low-cost manufacturing industry, an efficient export engine, and an exchange rate that until 2010 has been held deliberately low, China's global trade has thrived.|$|E
