40|$|This Article {{examines}} the parental rights <b>of</b> a <b>same-sex</b> partner/spouse who is neither biologically related to, nor an adoptive parent of, a child {{being raised by}} the couple. Using a hypothetical example <b>of</b> a <b>same-sex</b> couple with one child, this Article explores whether the parental rights granted to a non-biological parent by marriage, civil union, or domestic partnership can and will survive a move to another state that does not explicitly recognize such same-sex relationships. Relying on statutory and common law precedents, this Article argues that even in those jurisdictions that have enacted a mini- Defense of Marriage Act, parental rights likely can survive the invalidation <b>of</b> a <b>same-sex</b> relationship because the Uniform Parentage Act, precedents regarding the legitimacy of children, and general choice of law principles all provide potent arguments for advocates seeking to preserve the parental rights <b>of</b> the <b>same-sex</b> partner...|$|R
