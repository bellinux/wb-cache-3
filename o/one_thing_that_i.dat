He remarked, [...] "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans." [...] He added [...] "It's the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do in my life that's almost an avocation. I {{do it for the}} pure love of it." [...] Many obituaries of Hartman mentioned his work as McClure as {{one of the highlights of}} his career. The BBC said that [...] " [...] voice was known to millions" [...] because of McClure and Lionel Hutz.|$|E
500|$|Hartman {{provided}} the voices for numerous characters on the Fox animated series The Simpsons, appearing in 52 episodes. He {{made his first}} appearance in the second season episode [...] "Bart Gets Hit by a Car". Although he was originally brought in for a one-time appearance, Hartman enjoyed working on The Simpsons and the staff wrote additional parts for him.

His favourite part was that of McClure, and he often used this voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of NewsRadio.

I do it for the pure love of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huckabee took stances {{opposed to}} the nature of the {{incumbent}} president, Barack Obama. In comments made March 1, 2011, on The Steve Malzberg Show, Huckabee said of Obama, [...] "I would love to know more. What I know is troubling enough. And <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do know is his having grown up in Kenya, his view of the Brits, for example, is very different than the average American." [...] (This is a reference to the Mau Mau Uprising against the colonial rule of the United Kingdom in 1952; Obama himself has never lived in Kenya.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do not know, Polly, my {{experience}} has been so entirely the other way <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot say how it might be; and there is <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am never {{likely to have the}} experiment tried upon myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “That’s right, Weir,” said Frank heartily. “Go to bed {{and think}} over it; and I say, man, don’t forget your prayers! I don’t often do the moral—don’t go in {{for that sort of}} thing—but when I do there’s <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> sure, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mean it.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Opposition to Roe on {{the bench}} grew when President Reagan, who {{supported}} legislative restrictions on abortion, began making federal judicial appointments in 1981. Reagan denied {{that there was any}} litmus test: [...] "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I feel very strongly about those social issues, but I also place my confidence {{in the fact that the}} <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law. We've had too many examples in recent years of courts and judges legislating." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group {{developed}} a reputation for exciting and polished live performances that enabled them to work even {{without the benefit of}} best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed [...] "fast-stepping" [...] dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins: [...] "The <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!" [...] The group was a touring standout during this period with Knight's contralto lead vocals and the Pips' impeccable choreography and characteristic background vocals becoming highlights.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Chaffanbrass," [...] said Phineas, [...] "there is <b>one</b> special <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{want you}} to do." [...] The old man, having his own idea {{as to what was}} coming, laid one of his hands over the other, bowed his head, and looked meek. [...] "I {{want you to}} make men believe <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{innocent}} of this crime." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would ask,' said he. 'If you lay hands {{upon this}} Marshal Millefleurs--this dog of a brigand--what {{will you do}} with him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know but}} what you are right. I know <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{am going to do}} when I get to Mauch Chunk--that is, if {{business}} continues good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, dear Miss Kate. Say no more," [...] {{interrupted}} the captain; [...] "I must stick {{to my own}} cabin except at meal-times, and, of course, when we want {{a bit of a}} talk together. There is <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would like. I know you have family worship with your little lass. May I join you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There are <b>one</b> or two <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am {{not up to}} yet," [...] he answered, with a {{laugh in}} the corner of his eye, as he waxed his thread with a flourish.|$|R
5000|$|..... <b>one</b> of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{found very}} bothersome about Iran-Contra {{was that some}} of the prosecutions for false {{statements}} involved false statements that were made in unrecorded interviews with investigators, not in sworn testimony under oath ....|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do, but it {{is another}} thing to stand {{laughing}} here. I see <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall do--I shall take away your picture and hang it in my room.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There is <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> sir, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should like}} to ask you. It will evidently be of great {{advantage}} to me, if I can obtain private letters of introduction to Scotch traders in the city. This I cannot do, unless by mentioning the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am bound for Warsaw. Have I your permission to do so, or is it to be kept a close secret?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope I'm not so!" [...] said Miss Fosbrook, {{laughing}} heartily; [...] "but I'll {{tell you}} <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> Sam, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do {{wish you would}} leave off--and <b>that</b> is teazing. <b>I</b> don't know whether that is country manners, but I don't {{like to see a}} sensible kind fellow like you just go out of your way to say something mortifying to a younger one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should like}} very much to take lessons too, Dick; it is <b>one</b> of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have always wished to do. I suppose one can do it of an evening, or any time you like?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Anything but the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have sworn}} not to do." [...] For {{he had told}} the priest of the {{promises}} he had made both to his uncle and to his uncle's widow.|$|E

Mr. Fennick will tell you what it is. Say to yourself sometimes--perhaps when you have married some lady who is worthy of you--There was good as well as bad in poor Emma. Farewell.|$|R
5000|$|My aim of life {{then was}} to study, come home, watch TV. Watching TV was <b>one</b> of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> always rejoiced, {{watching}} all the saas-bahu serials {{with my mom}} and rounding off the day with some teen shows.|$|R
6000|$|... "You take a {{pleasure}} to torment me," [...] said I, [...] "and I make a very feckless plaything; {{but let me ask}} you to be more merciful. At this time there is but the <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> care to hear of, and that will be news of Catriona." ...|$|E
6000|$|But, after all, I do {{not know}} that a boomerang would be of much service to us even if we could use it. There is only <b>one</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can now think of that it would be good for. It would be a splendid to knock down {{chestnuts}} with! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{good of you}} not {{to forget}} me {{when you are in}} the midst of such dangers and hardships,' {{answered}} she.

6000|$|Wyllard {{spoke with}} a new tenderness. [...] "When I first saw your picture, and when I saw you afterwards, I loved your gracious quietness.

Are you fonder of Gregory than you feel you ever could be of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He, too, {{would have}} liked to hear the names, and he sighed, it must be admitted, at sight of that {{determined}} mouth, but he could say truthfully, [...] "Your refusal to break your promise is <b>one</b> of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> admire in you." ...|$|R
