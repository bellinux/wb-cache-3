The aggregation of MWCNTs floss has restricted its usage and thus, acid treatment is expected to promote the MWCNTs reaggregation. The functionalization process of MWCNTs involves oxidation reaction using mild aqueous acid mixture of HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 (1 : 3 v/v), via ultrasonication technique. The results were then confirmed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Xray Diffraction (XRD), Thermogravimetry Analysis (TGA), Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) analysis. From the FTIR spectrum, the existence of carboxyl group indicates the oxidation of MWCNTs on the outer surface wall. TEM and FE-SEM micrographs show the occurrence of surface modification on the MWCNTs structure. The method used in functionalization MWCNTs has created fragmented structure toward the functionalized MWCNTs.

Objective: This study investigated the secondary metabolites present in a Peruvian sample of Azorella compacta and the evaluation of gastroprotective activity of the isolated compounds in a gastric-induced ulcer model in mice. Material and Methods: Six secondary metabolites (diterpenoids 1 - 6) present in the dichloromethane (DCM) extract of A. compacta growing in Per were isolated {{by a combination of}} Sephadex LH- 20 permeation and silica gel chromatography and their chemical structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods (NMR) and molecular modeling.

40|$|Carbon is {{emerging}} as an important metal-free catalyst for multiple types of heterogeneous catalysis, including thermocatalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis. However, the study of mechanisms for carbon catalysis has been impeded {{at an early stage}} {{due to the lack of}} quantitative research, especially the intrinsic kinetics (e. g., intrinsic TOF). In many carbon-catalyzed reactions, the surface <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> were found to be the active sites. Recently, we have shown that these <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> could be identified and quantified via poisoning by small organic molecules; however, these small molecules were toxic. As most of the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> are acidic groups, they could also be identified and quantified with respect to the acid properties. More importantly, the method based on acid properties is very green and environmentally benign, because only inorganic bases are added. In this work, the acid properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) treated by concentrated HNO 3 were thoroughly studied by mass titration and Boehm titration. The two titration methods were also compared to the conventional methods for acidity analysis including NH 3 pulse adsorption, NH 3 -TPD, and FT-IR. Boehm titration was very effective to quantify the carboxylic acid, lactone, phenol, and carbonyl groups, and the findings were consistent with the results from XPS and NH 3 pulse adsorption. These CNTs were applied in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene, and the activity of these catalysts exhibited a good linear dependence on the number of carbonyl groups. The value of TOF for the carbonyl group obtained from Boehm titration was 3. 2 × 10 - 4 s - 1 (245 °C, atmosphere pressure, 2. 8 kPa ethylbenzene, 5. 3 kPa O 2).

Arrhenius plots of the kinetic data were used to estimate the reaction half-life at 50 C, and to reveal the effect of functional groups on reactivity. This survey showed that hydrocarbons and organic substances containing a single <b>oxygenated</b> <b>group</b> were kinetically the most stable (i. e. acetate decarboxylation half-life was l 0 (exp 18) years at 50 C); whereas, organic substances containing two oxygenated groups in which one group was a beta-positioned carbonyl group were the most reactive (i. e. acetoacetate decarboxylation half-life was l 0 (exp- 2) years at 50 C). Of all functional groups the beta-positioned carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone) was the strongest activating group, giving rates of reaction that were up to 10 (exp 24) -times faster than rates of similar molecules lacking the beta-carbonyl group. From this knowledge of organic reactivity and the inherent constraints of autocatalytic processes, we concluded that an origins-of-life process based on autocatalytic transformation of C,H,O-substrates was constrained to using the most reactive organic molecules that contain alpha- or beta-carbonyl groups, since small autocatalytic domains of plausible catalytic power that used less reactive substrates could not carry out chemical transformations fast enough to prevent catastrophic efflux (escape) of reaction intermediates.

The textural characteristics of the char were studied by means of N 2 adsorption at 77 K, whereas the oil composition was studied by infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Modification of the variables did not have any effect on the composition or textural properties of RF/coal char. However, an increase in the nitrogen flow, rotary speed and a decrease in the heating rate led to a higher oil yield with more <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> and less aromaticity.

The effect of carbon activation treatment (CO 2 or air burnoff), phosphorus additive, platinum loading, and nature of the solvent (water or water/acetic acid mixture) were studied. Cyclohexanone oxidation at 140 C yielded a mixture of C 6, C 5, and C 4 dicarboxylic acids. Air activated carbons, including those containing phosphorus or those supporting platinum, resulted in a higher yield of adipic acid. The activity and selectivity was associated with the <b>oxygenated</b> functional <b>groups,</b> essentially carbonyl/quinone groups, created during air activation of the carbon. The incorporation of phosphorus into the carbon increased slightly the selectivity to 34. 3 %, probably because this additive increased the density of <b>oxygenated</b> functional <b>groups.</b> The deposition of platinum by impregnation and liquid-phase reduction with formaldehyde increased the reaction rate and improved the selectivity to adipic acid, where the highest figure was 38. 8 %. It was suggested that platinum contributed to molecular oxygen activation. In contrast platinum deposition by cationic exchange followed by reduction under H 2 resulted often in a detrimental effect probably because the density of the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> on carbon is decreased upon H 2 reduction {{in the presence of}} platinum.

40|$|Since the coke {{deposition}} on the inorganic oxide in {{the course}} of ODEB to styrene has been considered as the true catalytically active substance, various carbonaceous materials have shown to be active and selective catalysts for this reaction. It has been confirmed that <b>oxygenated</b> surface functional <b>groups</b> of catalyst, especially carbonyl/quinoid and hydroxyl groups, are responsible for the catalytic performance. Therefore, the focus in this study is in the creation of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface of carbon nanotubes by partial oxidation using high potential oxidizing agents, including hydroxyl radicals, and ozone in gas phase followed by investigating the influences of these groups on the ODEB catalytic behavior. The effects of the oxidative treatment methods on the textural, structural and chemistry surface of MWCNTs, as well as comparative investigations on the catalysts before and after the ODEB have been conducted by using a series of analytical techniques including TGA, BET surface area, Raman spectroscopy, TEM, FTIR and XPS. It is found that as-received MWCNTs possessed a number of <b>oxygenated</b> surface <b>groups,</b> as a result of CVD method. Further oxidation treatment with highly active hydroxyl radicals generated via UV/H 2 O 2 process increased substantially the formation of <b>oxygenated</b> surface functional <b>groups</b> compared to as-received MWCNTs, particularly hydroxyl and carbonyl groups. Using hydrogen peroxide solutions with concentrations higher than 35 wt. % for the radical oxidation of MWCNTs did not enhance the surface oxygen content as expected. The effectiveness of the oxidation could be declined by the scavenging of radicals instead. As a result, the catalytic performance of UV/H 35 catalyst is better than that of UV/H 50 or UV/H 60. At 400 oC and molar ratio EB/O 2 of 1 : 1, ethylbenzene conversion and styrene selectivity of UV/H 35 catalyst achieved 47 % and 91 %, respectively, for several hours time on stream. The styrene yield of UV/H 35 is two times higher than that of as-received MWCNTs. Purification of as-received MWCNTs followed by ozone corona discharge oxidation of samples generated various <b>oxygenated</b> functional <b>groups</b> on the MWCNTs as identified by FT-IR. The surface oxygen content of the ozonated MWCNT increased significantly with increasing ozone concentration in gas flow, leading to highly stable ethylbenzene conversion and styrene selectivity reaching up to 80 and 92 %, respectively, at 450 oC, and EB/O 2 molar ratio of 1 : 2 in long-term experiments under conventional heating. That is the best result for the ODEB community {{to the best of our}} knowledge. The catalyst performance does not depend on the porosity of the MWCNTs. At the same reaction conditions (EB/O 2 molar ratio of 1 : 1, 400 °C), the catalytic activity/ selectivity of the MWCNTs treated with ozone is better than that of the MWCNTs oxidized with hydroxyl radicals. The catalytic performance is substantially affected by the supplied heating mode for the reaction. A comparative investigation on catalyst performance under conventional and microwave heating indicated that the conversion difference between both heating methods is negligible, but conventional heating results in higher styrene selectivity than the microwave-assisted process. Generally, coke deposit has been observed for all the tested catalysts after the ODEB. However, the extent of coke formation depends strongly the oxidative treatment of nanotubes. For conventional heating, an increase in coke weight incorporated with <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> has been occurred, while for microwave heating coke deposit has been observed but the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> are reduced after the ODEB. This fact could be the reason for the lower selectivity under microwave heating. In order to investigate the contribution of carboxylic groups on the nanotubes to the catalytic behavior, Boehm’s titration has been employed. By selective neutralization of carboxylic groups on the MWCNTs with NaHCO 3 solution, and by comparison of the catalytic activity/selectivity with that of untreated samples, it has been shown that the styrene yield of neutralized MWCNTs is 16 % lower than that of non-neutralized catalysts. Examining both catalysts after the reaction indicated that oxygenated coke is not deposited on carboxylic neutralized MWCNTs after the reaction test. This result demonstrates that carboxylic surface groups improve the catalytic performance indirectly. After the ODEB reaction, it is found that an enhancement of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of MWCNTs, particularly hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, have been observed, suggesting that these <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> could be able to be the main active phases in the reaction...|$|R

This observation shows that the most commonly used acid mixture is not only introducing <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> together with nitrogen- and sulfur-containing groups, but also creating structural defects in the graphitic carbon lattice. close 4...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of rapeseed oil lowered cetane {{value of the}} product through decarboxylation and decarbonylation. In this study the {{thermal decomposition}} in rapeseed oil was estimated with different temperatures (300 to 410 oC) with or without hydrogen at 1 bar partial pressure. Initially, the reactor is loaded with glass pellets and then the rapeseed oil was fed into the reactor. At hydrothermal condition of 300 to 410 oC, the formation of <b>oxygenate</b> <b>groups</b> (i. e. esters, acids and aldehydes) were 15 to 30 %, while the rest contained thermally cracked hydrocarbons with excluded un-reacted feed. In residue oil, cyclic group formation was observed. The formation of acidic and aldehyde resulted in carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide in outlet gases. The hydroprocess of higher temperatures leaded higher cracking and cyclic groups with more dense and viscous residue oil...|$|R
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{activated carbon}} (AC) was modified with a nitration or amination method, {{and the effects}} of textural and chemical properties on the ability of the AC samples to destroy oxalic acid (OA) using ozone was investigated in this work. The degradation rates of OA on the nitrated and aminated AC samples increased by 38. 5 % and 9. 6 %, respectively. The adsorption capacity of the AC sample was not enhanced after modification, but the decomposition rate of ozone in solution increased. The surface area of AC significantly decreased after nitration because the entrance of micropores and some larger pores were blocked by the modified functional groups. In addition, the surface area was recovered when the nitrated AC was further aminated. We demonstrated that the enhancement in the catalytic activity was primarily caused by the differences in surface chemistry. The pH(pzc) values and Boehm titration results showed that nitration increased the acidity of the AC, while more basic groups were grafted after amination. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) results confirmed that-NO 2 and acid <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> were simultaneously grafted onto AC during nitration. Meanwhile, the-NO 2 group was completely reduced to-NH 2 and the carboxylic groups were partially reduced during amination. The basic groups (-NH 2 and possible pyrone groups) enhanced the catalytic activity of the aminated AC sample, and the increased activity of the nitrated AC material was mainly due to the acid <b>oxygenated</b> surface <b>groups.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Paracetamol {{adsorption}} in acidic, {{neutral and}} basic media on three activated carbons with different chemistry surfaces was studied. A {{granular activated carbon}} (GAC) was prepared from coconut shell; starting from this sample, an oxidized activated carbon (GACo) was obtained by treating the GAC with a boiling solution of 6 M nitric acid, so to generate {{a greater number of}} <b>oxygenated</b> surface <b>groups.</b> In addition, a reduced activated carbon (GACr) was obtained by heating the GAC at 1173 K, to remove the <b>oxygenated</b> surface <b>groups.</b> Paracetamol adsorption was higher for GACr due to the lower presence of <b>oxygenated</b> surface functional <b>groups.</b> Moreover, adsorption was highest at neutral pH. The magnitude of the interactions between paracetamol molecules and activated carbons was studied by measuring the immersion enthalpies of activated carbons in solution of paracetamol at different concentrations and pH values and by calculating the interaction enthalpy. The highest value was obtained for GACr in a paracetamol solution of 1000 mg L− 1 at pH 7, confirming that paracetamol adsorption is favoured on basic activated carbons at pH values near to neutrality. Finally, the Gibbs energy changes confirmed the latter result, allowing explaining the different magnitudes of the interactions between paracetamol and activated carbons, as a function of solution pH...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that graphene oxide can be efficiently reduced by evaporating metal Titanium in high vacuum. A {{detailed description of}} this reaction is provided by combining in situ photoemission spectroscopy measurements and DFT calculations: the titanium atoms readily react with the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> of graphene oxide, disrupting the C–O bonds, with the consequent formation of titania and {{the recovery of the}} sp 2 hybridized carbon atoms. When all surface oxygen is consumed, titanium can react with the carbon substrate and form carbidic species. Resonant photoemission spectroscopy measurements allow identifying the presence and exact energy position in the valence band of the Ti–C and Ti–O–C states, which are supposed to control the electron and energy transfer across the TiO 2 /graphene interface. Therefore with this study we provide a versatile method and the rationale for controlling, at the atomic level, the nature of the interface of graphene/metal oxide nano composites...|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{between two}} {{endocrine}} disruptors (ED) and aquatic humic substances (AHS) from tropical rivers were studied using an ultrafiltration system {{equipped with a}} 1 kDa cut-off cellulose membrane to separate free ED from the fraction bound in the AHS. Quantification of 17 &# 945;-ethynylestradiol and bisphenol A was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The times required for establishment of equilibrium between the AHS and the ED were ca. 30 min, and complexation capacities for 17 &# 945;-ethynylestradiol and bisphenol A were 18. 53 and 2. 07 mg g- 1 TOC, respectively. The greater interaction of AHS with 17 &# 945;-ethynylestradiol, compared to bisphenol A, {{was due to the}} presence of hydrogen in the structure of 17 &# 945;-ethynylestradiol, which could interact with ionized <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups</b> of the AHS. The results indicate that AHS can strongly influence the transport and reactivity of endocrine disruptors in aquatic systems...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the impacts of}} two deposition times (30 s, 60 s) and discharge powers (20 W, 50 W) on the resultant chemical and physical properties of plasma polymers (pp) formed using heptylamine (HA) or propionaldehyde (PA) monomers. Pinhole-free pp films were formed on all surfaces at deposition rates that varied according to both the time and power employed. XPS and ToF-SIMS analysis showed that power has a more of an effect than time on the chemical properties of the pp, which {{may be attributed to}} differences in monomer fragmentation and cross-linking. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) adhesion did not vary on the four different HApp surfaces, whereas a negative correlation between cell attachment and increasing plasma energy was observed on PApp surfaces. This suggests that the presence of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>groups,</b> particularly aldehyde and carboxylic groups, may have a dominant impact on MSC adhesion to these functional polymer substrates...|$|R
