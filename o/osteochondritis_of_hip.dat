40|$|Despite {{repeated}} {{attempts to}} provide experimental data in support ofthe ischaemic theory <b>of</b> <b>osteochondritis</b> <b>of</b> the upper femoral epiphysis, decisive laboratory {{evidence on the}} etiology of the condition is still not available. It {{is possible that the}} difficulty in substantiating experimentally any of the numerous theories still in vogue is due to the rarity with which <b>osteochondritis</b> <b>of</b> the femoral head seems to occur in the animals used for experimental study, or in any other animal. It is not even clear whether the changes reported by Thomasen (1939) in the shoulder of the Danish pig are comparable with those affecting the upper femoral epiphysis of young children. Many investigators have assumed that <b>osteochondritis</b> <b>of</b> the femoral head is caused by interference with the blood flow to the secondary nucleus ofossification, and have attempted to reproduce in animals, usually the rabbit or the dog, the changes that are seen in children. Nussbaum (1923) excised the whole of the synovial membrane <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> and divided the ligamentum teres in dogs, and found changes which he thought were like those <b>of</b> <b>osteochondritis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hip.</b> Bentzon (1927) injected alcohol near the epiphysial arteries <b>of</b> the <b>hips</b> <b>of</b> rabbits and obtained in one-sixth ofthem changes which he likened to those ofjuvenile osteochondritis...|$|R

40|$|Change in {{body weight}} is an {{important}} determinant of risk <b>of</b> osteoporotic <b>hip</b> fracture in aging adults. Weight loss {{has been associated with}} an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture and weight gain has been associated with a decreased risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture.. Weight gain cannot be recommended as appropriate prevention against hip fracture, however, because it is associated with such adverse health outcomes as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and weight loss is commonly recommended in the treatment of these types of diseases. Clarification of how weight loss is related to risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture is needed to resolve this issue. An extensive review of published literature was completed to assess the relationships between hip fracture and body weight, weight change, and involuntary and voluntary weight loss. Change in body weight and weight lll loss that was either intentional or unintentional were then assessed for their effects on risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture in a population-based case-control study of risk factors for osteoporotic hip fracture in aging Utah residents. Analyses <b>of</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture by quintile of weight change since age 18 and according to weight loss intention were performed through logistic regression modeling. Weight loss after age 18 was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture in men and women, and above average weight gain after age 18 was protective against hip fracture in women. Involuntary weight loss of more than 20 pounds was associated with an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture in men and women aged 50 to 69 years, but was not related to risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture in participants aged 70 to 89.
