40|$|The paper {{studies the}} concept <b>of</b> utility <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The latter {{is defined as}} the ability to {{generate}} additional income. Utility <b>of</b> <b>money</b> is maximized by equalizing dynamic marginal utility <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and marginal cost. The subsequent differential equation links up income velocity <b>of</b> <b>money</b> acceleration and equilibrium convergence. It is proved that individuals’ utility <b>of</b> <b>money</b> maximization objectives may be aggregated at macro level and can be used for monetary policy optimization. Lagrangian multipliers technique is applied to obtain a relationship between income velocity <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and some supplementary constraints. The paper also makes distinction between short-term and long-term utility <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Conclusions about different types of monetary policies are derived.

The result shows that {{relationship between}} inflation and volatility <b>of</b> <b>money</b> with velocity <b>of</b> <b>money</b> exists in Indonesia, {{but it does}} not in Thailand.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we present the {{relation}} between Keynesian multiplier and the velocity <b>of</b> <b>money</b> circulation in a money exchange model. For this purpose we modify the original exchange model by constructing the interrelation between income and expenditure. The random exchange yields an agent’s income, which along with the amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> he processed determines his expenditure. In this interactive process, both the circulation <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and Keynesian multiplier effect can be formulated. The equilibrium values of Keynesian multiplier are demonstrated to be {{closely related to the}} velocity <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> Thus the impacts of macroeconomic policies on aggregate income can be understood by concentrating solely on the variations <b>of</b> <b>money</b> circulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{measure the}} United States capital stock <b>of</b> <b>money</b> {{implied by the}} Divisia {{monetary}} aggregate service flow, {{in a manner consistent}} with the present-value model of economic capital stock and asset pricing theory. The resulting measures differ substantially from the usual simple sum accounting monetary aggregates. We permit non-martingale expectations and time varying discount rates. Based on Barnett¡¯s (1991) definition of the economic stock <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> we compute the U. S. economic stock <b>of</b> <b>money</b> by discounting to present value the flow of expected expenditure on the services of monetary assets, where expenditure on monetary services is evaluated at the user costs of the monetary components. As a theoretically consistent measure <b>of</b> <b>money</b> stock, our economic stock <b>of</b> <b>money</b> nests Rotemberg, Driscoll, and Poterba¡¯s (1995) currency equivalent index as a special case, under the assumption of martingale expectations. To compute the economic stock <b>of</b> <b>money</b> without imposing martingale expectations, we use forecasts based on the asymmetric vector autoregressive model and the Bayesian vector autoregressive model. We find the resulting capital-stock growth-rate index to be surprisingly robust to the modeling of expectations. Accurate measurement of the economic capital stock <b>of</b> <b>money</b> is relevant to understanding the wealth effects and transmission mechanism of monetary policy.

50|$|Credit {{theories}} <b>of</b> <b>money</b> (also called debt theories <b>of</b> <b>money)</b> are theories {{concerning the}} relationship between credit and <b>money.</b> Proponents <b>of</b> these theories, such as Alfred Mitchell-Innes, sometimes emphasize that money and credit/debt are the same thing, seen from different points of view. Proponents assert that the essential nature <b>of</b> <b>money</b> is credit (debt), at least in eras where money is not backed by a commodity such as gold. Two common strands of thought within these theories are the idea that money originated as a unit of account for debt, and the position that money creation involves the simultaneous creation <b>of</b> <b>money</b> and debt. Some proponents of credit theories <b>of</b> <b>money</b> argue that money is best understood as debt even in systems often understood as using commodity money.
