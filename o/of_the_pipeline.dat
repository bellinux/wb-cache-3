5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{was built}} to withstand earthquakes, forest fires, and other natural disasters. The 2002 Denali earthquake damaged some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> sliders designed to absorb similar quakes, and it caused the pipeline to shut down for more than 66 hours as a precaution. In 2004, wildfires overran portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> {{but it was not}} damaged and did not shut down.|$|E
5|$|To {{supervise}} the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> Alyeska appointed two construction management contractors to oversee {{all the other}} subcontractors in the project. Bechtel Corporation, from San Francisco, was named the management contractor for the pipeline itself. Fluor Alaska Inc., a division of Fluor Corp., was named the management contractor for the pumping stations and Valdez Marine Terminal, which was the most complex single section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline,</b> since it involved the transfer of oil from the pipeline to seagoing oil tankers.|$|E
5|$|By law, Alaska is {{required}} to remove all traces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> after oil extraction is complete. No {{date has been set}} for this removal, but plans for it are being updated continuously.|$|E
30|$|Next, it was {{investigated}} whether <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parcels through which pipelines pass are different. A {{significant difference between}} <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> parcels was found (see Tables  7, 8, 9, 10). Because <b>the</b> average size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parcels affected by <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> is different for <b>the</b> three <b>pipelines,</b> <b>the</b> comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> in terms <b>of</b> parcel size could be also made.|$|R

50|$|On 31 January 2007, <b>the</b> Republic <b>of</b> Macedonia, Bulgaria and Albania {{signed a}} trilateral {{convention}} on <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AMBO <b>pipeline.</b> This document was ratified by <b>the</b> Parliaments <b>of</b> all three countries and governed the construction, operation, and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelines.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although Georgia has no {{significant}} oil or gas reserves, its territory hosts {{part of the}} Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline supplying Europe. Russia, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries were against the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b> The pipeline circumvents both Russia and Iran. Because it has decreased Western dependence on Middle Eastern oil, the pipeline {{has been a major}} factor in the United States' support for Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Because most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{was built}} above permafrost, {{each of the}} pipes holding up the raised {{sections}} of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below the pipeline warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|In Valdez, where Fluor had supervision, {{the work}} also was divided among several contractors. Site {{preparation}} {{work was done}} by Morrison-Knudsen. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company built the tank farms, the tanker berths were built by Kiewest (a venture of Peter Kiewit Sons and Willamette-Western Corporation), and General Electric insulated the pipes. Fluor also had supervision {{of the construction of}} the pumping stations, which were generally built by the contractors working on a specific section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of those}} two {{companies}} actually did the construction work. That job was handed off {{to a series of}} subcontractors, each of whom had responsibility on one (or two) of six sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> (seven, if the marine terminal is included). Bidding on the subcontracting jobs opened at the end of March, and the contracts were announced on June 12, 1974.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} {{has also}} inspired {{various forms of}} artwork. The most notable form of art unique to the pipeline are pipeline maps—portions of scrap pipe cut {{into the shape of}} Alaska with a piece of metal delineating the path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> through the map. Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on the pipeline, and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts. Other pipeline-inspired pieces of art include objects containing crude oil that has been transported through the pipeline.|$|E
50|$|The {{field has}} since reopened. In mid-June 2007, however, a small leak {{occurred}} in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> that connect <b>the</b> field to <b>the</b> Trans-Alaska <b>Pipeline,</b> shutting down <b>the</b> field for a week.|$|R
40|$|Pipelined Krylov solvers {{typically}} offer better scalability in {{the strong}} scaling limit compared to standard Krylov methods. The synchronization bottleneck is mitigated by overlapping time-consuming global communications with useful computations in the algorithm. However, to achieve this communication hiding strategy, pipelined methods feature multiple recurrence relations on additional auxiliary variables to update the guess for the solution. This paper aims at studying <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> rounding errors on <b>the</b> convergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelined</b> Conjugate Gradient method. It is analyzed why rounding effects have a significantly larger impact on the maximal attainable accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelined</b> CG algorithm compared to the traditional CG method. Furthermore, an algebraic model for <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> rounding errors throughout <b>the</b> (<b>pipelined)</b> CG algorithm is derived. Based on this rounding error model, we then propose an automated residual replacement strategy to reduce <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> rounding errors on the final iterative solution. <b>The</b> resulting <b>pipelined</b> CG method with automated residual replacement improves the maximal attainable accuracy of pipelined CG to a precision {{comparable to that of}} standard CG, while maintaining the efficient parallel performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelined</b> method...|$|R
5|$|By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate over <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelines.</b> <b>The</b> major oil companies, such as Standard Oil, campaigned for <b>the</b> conversion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> for <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> natural gas. Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad and coal companies, who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use <b>the</b> <b>pipelines</b> for oil in order to undermine <b>the</b> transport monopolies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger corporations.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the project}} made strides toward {{completion}} in 1976, {{it did not}} meet Moolin's goal of having all pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. The final section of main pipeline was welded in place on December 6, but not all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, the project was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent done, and the marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of the project, its full work crew continued operations through the winter and into 1977.|$|E
5|$|Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> {{caused a}} massive {{economic}} boom in towns {{up and down}} the pipeline route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> {{deformation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-distance <b>pipeline</b> often happen {{due to the}} Soil collapse, gulch and <b>the</b> settlement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> foundation etc. The large deformation is easy {{to cause}} <b>the</b> fracture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-distance <b>pipeline.</b> Hence, <b>the</b> deformation detection is of very important to <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> safety. In this paper, a method for deformation calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-distance <b>pipeline</b> is presented based on the relation expression brtween the deformation and <b>the</b> strain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long-distance pipelien.

5|$|In February 1969, {{before the}} SS Manhattan had even sailed from its East Coast {{starting}} point, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), an unincorporated joint group created by ARCO, British Petroleum, and Humble Oil in October 1968, asked for {{permission from the}} United States Department of the Interior to begin geological and engineering studies of a proposed oil pipeline route from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, across Alaska. Even before the first feasibility studies began, the oil companies had chosen the approximate route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b> Permission was given, and teams of engineers began drilling core samples and surveying in Alaska.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{prior to the}} {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the Fairbanks economy was unsteady. The News-Miner planned to expand its printing plant, but many in the company were unsure if the economy could support the added capacity. Over the objections of the News-Miner newsroom, Snedden decided to expand the Aurora Building by adding a second floor at a cost of $2 million. In 1974, as construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> got under way, demand for office space in Fairbanks was so great that Alyeska Pipeline Company rented several News-Miner offices in the newly expanded building. About this time, the News-Miner replaced its Associated Press teletypes with a satellite connection.|$|E
5|$|Laying pipe {{took several}} stages. First, {{the right of}} way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and {{scrapers}} who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> {{displacements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{gas and oil}} pipelines changed suddenly at the bends, {{which was}} caused by the deformation due to <b>the</b> flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipes and <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> supports at <b>the</b> bends. The linear and angular displacements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas <b>pipeline</b> were higher than those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil <b>pipeline.</b> Displacement control in practical engineering should put considerable emphasis on checking <b>the</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas <b>pipeline.</b>|$|R
5|$|Pumping {{stations}} {{maintain the}} momentum of the oil as it goes through the pipeline. Pump Station 1 is the northernmost of 11 pump stations spread across the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline.</b> The original design called for 12 pump stations with 4 pumps each, but Pump Station 11 was never built. Nevertheless, the pump stations retained their intended naming system. Eight stations were operating at startup, and this number increased to 11 by 1980 as throughput rose. As of December 2006, only five stations were operating, with Pump Station 5 held in reserve. Pump Stations 2 and 7 have a capacity of moving 60,000 gallons/minute (227,125 l/min), while all other stations have a capacity of 20,000 gal/min (75,708 l/min). The pumps are natural-gas or liquid-fueled turbines.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{responded by}} sending {{personnel}} {{to analyze the}} proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert {{in charge of the}} Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of permafrost along the route. In a report, Brewer said the hot oil conveyed by the pipeline would melt the underlying permafrost, causing the pipeline to fail as its support turned to mud. This report was passed along to the appropriate committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.|$|E
5|$|The welders {{who worked}} on the {{pipeline}} itself came from Pipeliners Local 798 out of Tulsa, Oklahoma, which specialize in providing welders for large-scale pipeline projects. Members of the United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing, Pipefitting and Sprinkler Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada performed all welding that was not a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipeline</b> itself, including pump stations, feeder pipelines, and work at the Valdez Marine Terminal. The welders were the highest paid of all the workers on the pipeline, with a normal rate of $18.25 per hour. To be hired on the pipeline project, welders had to go through an intensive certification process that involved a series of test welds. If a welder failed any of the test welds, he was not hired and was not allowed to try again for several weeks.|$|E
