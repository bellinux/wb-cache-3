40|$|Vortex wakes of {{aircraft}} pose a hazard to following aircraft until the energetic {{parts of their}} flow fields have decayed to a harmless level. It is suggested here that in-trail spacings between aircraft can be significantly and safely reduced by designing an individual, vortex-free flight corridor for each aircraft. Because each aircraft will then have its own flight corridor, which is free of vortex wakes while in use by the assigned aircraft, the time intervals between aircraft operations can be safely reduced {{to the order of}} seconds. The productivity of airports can then be substantially increased. How large the <b>offset</b> <b>distances</b> between operational corridors need to be to have them vortex free, and how airports need to be changed to accommodate an individual flight-corridor process for landing and takeoff operations, are explored. Estimates are then made of the productivity of an individual flight-corridor system {{as a function of the}} in-trail time interval between operations for various values of wake decay time, runway width, and the velocity of a sidewind. The results confirm the need for short time intervals between aircraft operations if smaller <b>offset</b> <b>distances</b> and increased productivity are to be achieved...|$|R

This shape gives point contact, allowing for consistent measurements as the tip moves through its arc (via consistent <b>offset</b> <b>distance</b> from ball surface to center point, regardless of ball contact angle with the measured surface). Several spherical diameters are commercially offered; 1mm, 2mm, and 3mm are the standard sizes.|$|E

30|$|The soil {{migration}} {{patterns on}} the closer side of the footprint and below the spudcan change greatly at different <b>offset</b> <b>distances.</b> With the distance increasing, the soil on the spudcan bottom basically migrates downward, {{while most of the}} soil on the closer side of the footprint moves into the footprint, and only a little moves downward with the spudcan edge. This means “stomping” (repeated raising and lowering of the jack-up leg) may be a successful solution for the jack-up installation close to a footprint.|$|R
50|$|Scaled {{subtraction}} {{works well}} for two-layer systems but more complicated examples, such as where the overlying material contains components included in the sub-layer (living tissue, for example), may require multi-variate analysis. When multi-variate techniques, such as principal component analysis are used, {{it is necessary to}} take several spectra at varied <b>offset</b> <b>distances.</b> As the spatial offset increases the ratio of the spectral contribution sub-surface/surface increases. However, the total signal also decreases with increasing offset, so the ratio cannot increase forever in a practical measurement.|$|R

Tavernier in 1666 in his travel diary wrote, “Dacca is a great town, but only extended in length because everyone desired to have a house near the side of river. The length of the town is two legues (9.6  km)” (Tavernier 1889). An offset of 9.6  km from Postgola, the east limit of the city was considered in Hazaribagh, Jafrabad direction along the riverside.|$|R

Rather than use a spot collection geometry and a circular spot for illumination the constant offset can be maintained by illuminating the sample with a ring of light centred on the collection region. This has several advantages, including lowering the total power density and allowing simple manipulation of <b>offset</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

A desaxe engine adds to {{the duration of the}} two downward strokes (intake and power), and subtracts the same amount from the two upward strokes (compression and exhaust), with the total remaining 720°. A typical desaxe engine will have strokes of 185° - 175° - 185° - 175°, etc., with the differential roughly (but not directly) proportional to the percentage of <b>offset</b> <b>distance</b> to stroke length.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{analysis}} of conservation laws {{plays an important}} role in the implementation of curve evolution equations. This paper reviews the relevant concepts in numerical analysis and the relation between curve evolution, Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations, and differential conservation laws. This close relation enables us to introduce finite difference approximations, based on the theory of conservation laws, into curve evolution. It is shown how curve evolution serves as a powerful tool for image analysis, and how these mathematical relations enable us to construct efficient and accurate numerical schemes. Some examples demonstrate the importance of the CFL condition as a necessary condition for the stability of the numerical schemes.

Under laboratory conditions the sensor array replicated the physical profile of the target surface with a 4 % error in determining the heading angle. Field tests were conducted in two types of crops; corn and alfalfa. The sensor array identified the cut-crop edge profile ahead of the tractor and replicated distinct shapes of the cut-crop edge.

50|$|There is also {{a problem}} with the shadow where the faces along the {{silhouette}} edge are relatively shallow. In this case, the shadow an object casts on itself will be sharp, revealing its polygonal facets, whereas the usual lighting model will have a gradual change in the lighting along the facet. This leaves a rough shadow artifact near the silhouette edge which is difficult to correct. Increasing the polygonal density will minimize the problem, but not eliminate it. If the front of the shadow volume is capped, the entire shadow volume may be offset slightly away from the light to remove any shadow self-intersections within the <b>offset</b> <b>distance</b> of the silhouette edge (this solution is more commonly used in shadow mapping).|$|E
50|$|Flat six engine with 180° phase offset between {{opposing}} cylinder pair, and 120° phase offset {{among the}} three pairs (these are called Boxer Six engine) is the common configuration. These 6 cylinder Boxer engines have 14. (Plane imbalance on torque generation) and 16. (Plane imbalance on compression) just like in inline six. As the strength of vibration generated by these imbalances {{are more or less}} proportional to engine length, boxer six has the advantage as flat-6 is much shorter than an inline 6 configuration. However, boxer six has additional plane imbalances on rotating mass (4.) and reciprocating mass (6.) due to its left and right banks being staggered front to back, although the <b>offset</b> <b>distance</b> tends to be much smaller in relation to the engine size than in flat-four and flat-twin.|$|E
5000|$|In plasma {{spraying}} process, {{the material to}} be deposited (feedstock) — typically as a powder, sometimes as a liquid, suspension [...] or wire — is introduced into the plasma jet, emanating from a plasma torch. In the jet, where the temperature is {{on the order of}} 10,000 K, the material is melted and propelled towards a substrate. There, the molten droplets flatten, rapidly solidify and form a deposit. Commonly, the deposits remain adherent to the substrate as coatings; free-standing parts can also be produced by removing the substrate. There are a large number of technological parameters that influence the interaction of the particles with the plasma jet and the substrate and therefore the deposit properties.

40|$|We {{explore the}} spatial {{coherence}} between earthquake source parameters by analyzing kinematic rupture models of two large strike-slip events, that is, the 1999 Izmit, Turkey, and the 1992 Landers, California, earthquakes. We investigate the coherence {{not only at}} zero offset but also at nonzero <b>offset</b> <b>distances</b> on the fault. The analysis shows that earthquake slip has a significant level of correlation with temporal source parameters such as rupture velocity, peak slip rate, and slip duration (rise time). We also show that many interesting features of earthquake source characteristics, such as directional effects of earthquake rupture, can be captured by this type of spatial coherence analysis. A coherence analysis therefore may have potential for understanding earthquake source characteristics and for generating realistic kinematic rupture models that capture the essential physics of the rupture process for strong ground motion prediction. 8 page(s...|$|R

As viewed from Earth, the spacecraft will appear to cut diagonally through the southwest quadrant of the solar corona from the South Pole to the equator.

50|$|The basic, {{open-loop}} accelerometer {{consists of}} a mass attached to a spring. The mass is constrained to move only {{in line with the}} spring. Acceleration causes deflection of the mass and the <b>offset</b> <b>distance</b> is measured. The acceleration is derived from the values of deflection distance, mass, and the spring constant. The system must also be damped to avoid oscillation.A closed-loop accelerometer achieves higher performance by using a feedback loop to cancel the deflection, thus keeping the mass nearly stationary. Whenever the mass deflects, the feedback loop causes an electric coil to apply an equally negative force on the mass, canceling the motion. Acceleration is derived from the amount of negative force applied. Because the mass barely moves, the effects of non-linearities of the spring and damping system are greatly reduced. In addition, this accelerometer provides for increased bandwidth beyond the natural frequency of the sensing element.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{main data}} {{gathering}} techniques {{are employed in}} gathering surface wave information. The two methods are spectral analysis of surface waves (SASW) and multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW). [...] These techniques use either passive or active sources. Passive sources are simply ambient noise, while active sources include traditional seismic sources such as an explosive device or a steel plate being hit with a hammer. Overall, passive energy sources usually require more time when data gathering than active energy. Ambient noise is also more useful when it comes from random directions.The spectral analysis surface wave (SASW) technique {{requires the use of}} a spectral analyzer and at least two geophones. The spectral analyzer is used to study the frequency and phase of signals being recorded by the geophones. An expanding spread array is useful in minimizing the near field effects of surface waves. An increase in <b>offset</b> <b>distance</b> will result in more time for the waves to reach each geophone, giving the longer wavelengths more time to disperse. The shot gather is modified to minimize the influence of body waves. As the data is gathered, the spectral analyzer is able to generate the dispersion curves for the survey area in real time.The multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) technique can be performed similar to a traditional seismic acquisition whereby there is a geophone spread that is acquiring seismic data. The resulting data is processed by picking out the surface wave arrivals from the acquired distance vs. time plot. Based on the distance vs. time plot, the dispersion curve is created.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{creating}} dispersion curves from raw surface wave data (distance vs. time plot) can be performed using five transformation processes. The first {{is known as the}} wave-field transformation (τ-p transformation), first performed by McMechan and Yedlin (1981). The second is a 2-dimensional wave-field transform (f-k transformation) performed by Yilmaz (1987). The third is a wave-field transform base on phase shift, performed by Park et al. (1998). The fourth is a modified wave-field transform base on frequency decomposition and slant stacking, performed by Xia et al. (2007). The fifth is a high-resolution Linear Radon transformation performed by Luo et al. (2008). In performing a wave-field transformation, a slant stack is done, followed by a Fourier transform. The way in which a Fourier transform changes x-t data into x-ω (ω is angular frequency) data shows why phase velocity dominates surface wave inversion theory. Phase velocity is the velocity of each wave with a given frequency. The modified wavefield transform is executed by doing a Fourier transform first before a slant stack. Slant stacking is a process by which x-t (where x is the <b>offset</b> <b>distance,</b> and t is the time) data is transformed into slowness versus time space. A linear move (similar to normal move out (NMO)) out is applied to the raw data. For each line on a seismic plot, there will be a move out that can be applied that will make that line horizontal. Distances are integrated for each slowness and time composition. This is known as a slant stack because each value for slowness represents a slant in x-t space and the integration stacks these values for each slowness.|$|E

The final geometry of the tube is determined by original tube diameter and wall thickness. The offset of tube walls are affected by two competing factors: volume constancy and necking.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown the {{applicability}} of vectoring rectangular jets using asymmetrically applied counterflow {{in the presence of}} a short collar. This novel concept has applications in the aerospace industry where counterflow can be used to vector the thrust of a jet's exhaust, shortening take-off and landing distances and enhancing in-flight maneuverability of the aircraft. Counterflow thrust vectoring, 'CFTV' is desirable due to its fast time response, low thrust loss, and absence of moving parts. However, implementation of a CFTV system is only possible if bistable jet attachment can be prevented. This can be achieved by properly designing the geometry of the collar. An analytical model is developed herein to predict the conditions under which a two-dimensional jet will attach to an offset curved wall.
