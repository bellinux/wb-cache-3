Critics of all camps, though, praised Grigorovich's pictures of nature, {{the result of his}} early fascination with fine arts; numerous lyrical extracts from his books have made their way into school textbooks. Both The Fishermen and The Settlers strengthened Grigorovich's reputation and Nekrasov has got him to sign a special contract making sure he (alongside Ivan Turgenev, Alexander Ostrovsky and Leo Tolstoy) would from then on write for Sovremennik exclusively.In the mid-1850s, as the rift between Socialist radicals and liberals in the Russian literature was becoming more and more pronounced, Grigorovich made a strong neutral stand and attempted to make Nekrasov see that his way of [...] "quarrelling with other journals" [...] has been causing harm to both himself and Sovremennik, as Grigorovich saw it. In keeping with this spirit of peace and compromise was his next small novel Ploughman (Pakhar, 1856), either a paean to the [...] "strength of the Russian folk spirit," [...] or a comment on a man of the land's utter endurance, depending upon a viewpoint. School of Hospitality (Shkola gostepriimstva, 1855), written under the influence of Alexander Druzhinin (and, allegedly, not without his direct participation), was in effect a swipe at Chernyshevsky, but the latter refused to be provoked and personal relations between the two men never soured, even if their ideological differences now were irreconcilable. Several years later, as Druzhinin and his fellow proponents of the 'arts for arts' sake' doctrine instigated a dispute along the lines of [...] "free-thinking Pushkin versus <b>overcritical</b> Gogol," [...] Grigorovich backed the Chernyshevsky-led Sovremennik group, despite being friends with Druzhinin.|$|E

40|$|In the {{classical}} Dirac equation with strong potentials, called <b>overcritical,</b> a bound state reaches the negative continuum. In QED {{the presence of}} a static <b>overcritical</b> external electric field leads to a charged vacuum and indicates spontaneous particle creation when the <b>overcritical</b> field is switched on. The goal of this work is to clarify whether this effect exists, i. e. if it can be uniquely defined and proved, in time-dependent physical processes. Starting from a fundamental level of the theory we check all mathematical and interpretational steps from the algebra of fields to the very effect. In the first, theoretical part of this thesis we introduce the mathematical formulation of {{the classical}} and quantized Dirac theory with their most important results. Using this language we define rigorously the notion of spontaneous particle creation in <b>overcritical</b> fields. First, we give a rigorous definition of resonances as poles of the resolvent or the Green's function and show how eigenvalues become resonances under Hamiltonian perturbations. In particular, we consider essential for <b>overcritical</b> potentials perturbation of eigenvalues {{at the edge of the}} continuous spectrum. Next, we gather various adiabatic theorems and discuss well-posedness of the scattering in the adiabatic limit. Then, we construct Fock space representations of the field algebra, study their equivalence and give a unitary implementer of all Bogoliubov transformations induced by unitary transformations of the one-particle Hilbert space as well as by the projector (or vacuum vector) changes as long as they lead to unitarily equivalent Fock representations. We implement in Fock space self-adjoint and unitary operators from the one-particle space, discussing the charge, energy, evolution and scattering operators. Then we introduce the notion of particles and several particle interpretations for time-dependent processes with a different Fock space at every instant of time. We study how the charge, energy and number of particles change in consequence of a change of representation or in implemented evolution or scattering processes, what is especially interesting in presence of <b>overcritical</b> potentials. Using this language we define rigorously the notion of spontaneous particle creation. Then we look for physical processes which show the effect of vacuum decay and spontaneous particle creation exclusively due to the overcriticality of the potential. We consider several processes with static as well as suddenly switched on (and off) static <b>overcritical</b> potentials and conclude that they are unsatisfactory for observation of the spontaneous particle creation. Next, we consider properties of general time-dependent scattering processes with continuous switch on (and off) of an <b>overcritical</b> potential and show that they also fail to produce stable signatures of the particle creation due to overcriticality. Further, we study and successfully define the spontaneous particle creation in adiabatic processes, where the spontaneous antiparticle is created as a result of a resonance (wave packet) decay in the negative continuum. Unfortunately, they lead to physically questionable pair production as the adiabatic limit is approached. Finally, we consider extension of these ideas to non-adiabatic processes involving <b>overcritical</b> potentials and argue that they are the best candidate for showing the spontaneous pair creation in physical processes. Demanding creation of the spontaneous antiparticle in the state corresponding to the <b>overcritical</b> resonance rather quick than slow processes should be considered, with a possibly long frozen <b>overcritical</b> period. In the second part of this thesis we concentrate on a class of spherically symmetric square well potentials with a time-dependent depth. First, we solve the Dirac equation and analyze the structure and behaviour of bound states and appearance of overcriticality. Then, by analytic continuation we find and discuss the behaviour of resonances in <b>overcritical</b> potentials. Next, we derive and solve numerically (introducing a non-uniform continuum discretization for a consistent treatment of narrow peaks) a system of differential equations (coupled channel equations) to calculate particle and antiparticle production spectra for various time-dependent processes including sudden, quick, slow switch on and off of a sub- and <b>overcritical</b> potentials. We discuss in detail how and under which conditions an <b>overcritical</b> resonance decays during the evolution giving rise to the spontaneous production of an antiparticle. We compare the antiparticle production spectrum with the shape of the resonance in the <b>overcritical</b> potential. We study processes, where the <b>overcritical</b> potentials are switched on at different speed and are possibly frozen in the <b>overcritical</b> phase. We prove, in agreement with conclusions of the theoretical part, that the peak (wave packet) in the negative continuum representing a dived bound state partially follows the moving resonance and partially decays at every stage of its evolution. This continuous decay is more intensive in slow processes, while in quick processes the wave packet more precisely follows the resonance. In the adiabatic limit, the whole decay occurs already at the edge of the continuum, resulting in production of antiparticles with vanishing momentum. In contrast, in quick switch on processes with delay in the <b>overcritical</b> phase, the spectrum of the created antiparticles agrees best with the shape of the resonance. Finally, we address the question how much information about the time-dependent potential can be reconstructed from the scattering data, represented by the particle production spectrum. We propose a simple approximation method (master equation) basing on an exponential, decoherent decay of time-dependent resonances for prediction of particle creation spectra and obtain a good agreement with the results of full numerical calculations. Additionally, we discuss various sources of errors introduced by the numerical discretization, find estimations for them and prove convergence of the numerical schemes. In der klassischen Dirac Gleichung mit starken, so genannten überkritischen, Potentialen, ein gebundener Zustand erreicht das negative Kontinuum. In QED die Anwesenheit der statischen überkritischen externen elektrischen Feldern führt zu einem geladenen Vakuum und weist auf eine spontane Teilchenerzeugung hin, wenn das überkritische Feld eingeschaltet wird. Das Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es zu klären, ob der Effekt existiert, d. h. ob er in zeitabhängigen physikalischen Prozessen eindeutig definiert und bewiesen werden kann. Beginnend von dem fundamentalen Niveau der Theorie prüfen wir alle mathematischen und interpretationellen Schritte von der Algebra der Felder bis zu dem studierten Effekt. In dem ersten, theoretischen Teil der Arbeit führen wir die mathematische Formulierung der klassischen und quantisierten Dirac Theorie mit ihren wichtigsten Ergebnissen ein. Mit dieser Sprache definieren wir rigorös den Begriff der spontanen Teilchenerzeugung in überkritischen Feldern. Zuerst geben wir eine rigoröse Definition der Resonanzen als Pole der Resolvente oder der Greenschen Funktion und zeigen, wie Eigenwerte in Resonanzen unter Perturbationen des Hamiltonians übergehen. Speziell betrachten wir die für die überkritische Potentiale entscheidende Pertrubationen von Eigenwerten am Rande des kontinuierlichen Spektrum. Als nächstes sammeln wir verschiedene adiabatische Theoreme und diskutieren die Wohldefinierheit von Streuung im adiabatischen Limes. Dann konstruieren wir Fock Raum Darstellungen der Feld-Algebra, studieren deren äquivalenz und geben einen unitären Implementer aller Bogoliubov Transformationen, die durch unitäre Transformationen des Ein-Teilchen Hilbert Raumes genauso wie durch Projektor (oder Vakuum Vektor) änderung induziert werden, solange die zu unitär äquivalenten Fock Darstellungen führen. Wir implementieren im Fock Raum selbstadjungierte und unitäre Operatoren aus dem Ein-Teilchen Raum und diskutieren den Ladung-, Energie-, Evolution- und Streuoperator. Dann führen wir den Begriff der Teilchen und verschiedene Teilcheninterpretationen für zeitabhängige Prozesse mit unterschiedlichen Fock Räumen zu jedem Zeitpunkt ein. Wir studieren, wie sich die Ladung, Energie und Zahl der Teilchen als Folge der änderung der Darstellung oder in implementierten Evolution- oder Streu-Prozessen ändern, was in Präsenz von überkritischen Potentialen besonders interessant ist. Mit dieser Sprache definieren wir rigorös ten Begriff der spontanen Teilchenerzeugung. Weiterhin suchen wir nach physikalischen Prozessen, die den Effekt des Vakuumzerfalls und spontaner Teilchenerzeugung ausschließlich wegen der überkritikalität des Potentials zeigen. Wir betrachten verschiedene Prozesse sowohl mit statischen als auch mit plötzlich ein- (und aus-) geschalteten überkritischen Potentialen und folgern, dass sie nicht zufrieden stellend für die Beobachtung der spontanen Teilchenerzeugung sind. Als nächstes betrachten wir Eigenschaften von allgemeinen zeitabhängigen Streuprozessen mit kontinuierlichem Ein- (und Aus-) schalten des überkritischen Potentials und zeigen, dass sie auch ungeeignet sind, um stabile Anzeichen der Teilchenerzeugung wegen überkritikalität zu produzieren. Weiter studieren und definieren wir erfolgreich die spontane Teilchenerzeugung in adiabatischen Prozessen, wo das spontane Antiteilchen als Folge des Resonanz (Wellenpacket) Zerfalls im negativen Kontinuum erzeugt wird. Leider führen sie zu physikalisch fraglicher Paarerzeugung als der adiabatische Limes erreicht wird. Endlich betrachten wir eine Ausweitung dieser Ideen auf nicht adiabatische Prozesse mit überkritischen Potentialen und argumentieren, dass sie der beste Kandidat fürs Zeigen der spontanen Paarerzeugung in physikalischen Prozessen sind. Für das Verlangen der Erzeugung des spontanen Antiteilchens im Zustand, der einem überkritischen Resonanzen entspricht, sollen eher schnelle als langsame Prozesse, mit möglichst langer Verzögerung der überkritischen Phase, betrachtet werden. In dem zweiten Teil der Arbeit konzentrieren wir uns auf der Klasse der spherisch symmetrischen Potentialtöpfen mit zeitabhängiger Tiefe. Zuerst lösen wir die Dirac Gleichung und analysieren die Struktur und Verhalten der gebundenen Zuständen und das Auftreten von überkritikalität. Dann, durch analytische Fortsetzung, finden und diskutieren wir das Verhalten der Resonanzen in überkritischen Potentialen. Als nächstes leiten wir ab und lösen numerisch (mit Einführung von nicht gleichmäßiger Kontinuum-Diskretisierung für eine konsistente Behandlung von schmalen Peaks) ein System von Differentialgleichungen (gekoppelte Kanäle). Wir bekommen die Teilchen- und Antiteilchenproduktion Spektra für verschiedene zeitabhängige Prozesse wie plötzliches, schnelles, langsames Ein- und Ausschalten von unter- und überkritischen Potentialen. Wir diskutieren, wie und unter welchen Bedingungen ein überkritischer Resonanz während der Evolution zerfällt und zur spontanen Produktion eines Antiteilchens führt. Wir vergleichen das Antiteilchen Produktion Spektrum mit der Form des Resonanzen im überkritischen Potential. Wir studieren Prozesse, wo die überkritischen Potentiale mit unterschiedlichem Tempo Eingeschaltet werden und eventuell in der überkritischen Phase gefroren werden. Wir beweisen, in übereinstimmung mit den Folgerungen aus dem theoretischen Teil, dass der Peak (Wellenpacket) im negativen Kontinuum, der den eingetauchten gebundenen Zustand darstellt, teilweise den bewegenden Resonanz folgt und teilweise in jeder Phase seiner Evolution zerfällt. Der kontinuierliche Zerfall ist intensiver in langsamen Prozessen, während in schnellen Prozessen das Wellenpacket genauer den Resonanz folgt. Im adiabatischen Limes findet der gesamte Zerfall schon am Rande des Kontinuums statt, was zur Produktion von Antiteilchen mit verschwindendem Impuls führt. Dagegen, in schnellen Einschalt-Prozessen mit einer Verzögerung in der überkritischen Phase, stimmt das Spektrum der Erzeugten Antiteilchen mit der Form des Resonanzen am besten überein. Endlich betrachten wir die Frage, wieviel Information über das zeitabhängige Potential kann von den durch die Teilchenerzeugung Spektrum dargestellten Streudaten zurück gewonnen werden. Wir schlagen eine einfache Näherungsmethode vor, die auf dem exponentiellen, dekohärenten Zerfall der zeitabhängigen Resonanzen basiert, mit der wir die Teilchenerzeugung Spektren vorausberechnen und eine gute übereinstimmung mit den Ergebnissen der vollen numerischen Rechnungen bekommen. Zusätzlich diskutieren wir verschiedene Quellen von numerischen Fehlern, finden Abschätzungen für sie und beweisen Konvergenz der benutzten numerischen Methoden...|$|E
