5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, {{progress is}} being made to provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable the remainder of the project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated <b>out</b> <b>into</b> userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will be smaller, isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E
