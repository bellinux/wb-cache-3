60|$|For {{a moment}} or two they neither of them spoke. From out of the windows of the house before which they were {{standing}} came the music of a popular waltz. <b>Olive</b> <b>turned</b> a way with a little shiver.|$|R
60|$|This casual remark {{produced}} a strange {{effect on her}} visitor, who <b>turned</b> <b>colour</b> beneath his tanned skin.|$|R

6000|$|But Mrs. Easterfield {{said in her}} heart: [...] "Poor fellow, {{how little}} you know what has come upon you! The woman who has turned her uncle from <b>Olive</b> has <b>turned</b> <b>Olive</b> from you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God forbid!" [...] he ejaculated, <b>turning</b> <b>colour.</b> And his {{suddenly}} awakened apprehensions swept {{aside the}} affectation that hitherto had marked his speech and manner.|$|R
50|$|The {{area is a}} prime tourist attraction, {{particularly}} during the October weeks when the foliage is <b>turning</b> <b>colour.</b> Photographs and paintings of the area are a popular tourist item.|$|R

60|$|James <b>turned</b> <b>colour,</b> bowed, and sat down, {{knowing that}} he was a made man, {{and that it would be}} his own fault if his future career at the Bar was not now one of almost unexampled prosperity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ask my sister--I {{think she}} will tell you," [...] said <b>Olive,</b> <b>turning</b> {{away from him and}} going to the window. She {{remained}} there, looking out; she heard the door of the house close, and saw the two cross the street together. As they passed out of sight her fingers played, softly, a little air upon the pane; {{it seemed to her that}} she had had an inspiration.|$|R
50|$|Because of this, Bantu people, {{such as the}} Ngoni, punish lizards and chameleons. For example, {{children}} may be allowed to put tobacco into a chameleon's mouth so that the nicotine poisons it and the creature dies, writhing while <b>turning</b> <b>colours.</b>|$|R

50|$|Mating and {{egg-laying}} {{is during}} {{late summer and}} into autumn in Britain (October in Germany). Eggs are laid as several 1-6 egg clutches 9-27 cm deep below the surface. Adults survive egg-laying but die shortly afterwards. Juveniles hatch after 20-22 days at 17 °C (in Germany), between October and December (in Britain). Juveniles <b>turn</b> <b>colour</b> from white to grey in May-June.|$|R

60|$|Lancaster {{came out}} and dropped fifteen cents into Olive's hand. He could not help {{regarding}} with interest the occupants of the carriage, and Mrs. Easterfield looked hard at him. Suddenly <b>Olive</b> <b>turned</b> in her seat; {{she looked at the}} house, she looked at the garden, she looked at the little piazza {{by the side of the}} tollhouse. Yes, it was really the same place. For an instant she thought she might have been mistaken, but there was her window with the Virginia creeper under the sill where she had trained it herself. Then she made a motion to her companion, who immediately drove on.|$|R
60|$|Remounting our horses we rode {{slowly up}} the winding ascent of the Mount of <b>Olives,</b> <b>turning</b> round at the brow {{of the hill}} to look back over Jerusalem. Sometimes I think that of all spots in the world this one should be the spot most {{cherished}} {{in the memory of}} Christians. It was there that He stood when He wept over the city. So much we do know, though we are ignorant, and ever shall be so, of the site of His cross and of the tomb. And then we descended on {{the eastern side of the}} hill, passing through Bethany, the town of Lazarus and his sisters, and turned our faces steadily towards the mountains of Moab.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{phenomena}} {{have been}} reported at Medjugorje, such as the sun spinning, dancing in the sky, <b>turning</b> <b>colours,</b> or being surrounded by objects such as hearts or crosses. Many {{have been able to}} look at the sun during those times without any damage to their eyes. The tall cement cross erected on Mount Križevac (which means [...] "Cross Mountain") has reportedly disappeared and reappeared or else glowed as if lit with lights, although there is no electricity on the mountain. Not everyone reports seeing the same miracles at the same time. Numerous supposedly miraculous healings have also been documented.|$|R

500|$|As <b>Olive's</b> <b>turn</b> {{to perform}} in the talent portion of the pageant draws near, Richard and Dwayne {{recognize}} that Olive is certain to be humiliated, and wanting to spare her feelings, run to the dressing room to talk her out of performing. Sheryl, however, insists that they [...] "let Olive be Olive", and Olive goes on stage. Olive's hitherto-unrevealed dance that her Grandpa Edwin had choreographed for her is performed to Rick James' song [...] "Super Freak". Olive scandalizes and horrifies most of the audience and pageant judges with a burlesque performance that she joyfully performs while oblivious to their reactions. The pageant organizers are enraged and demand Sheryl and Richard remove Olive from the stage. Instead of removing her, {{one by one the}} members of the Hoover family join Olive on stage, dancing alongside her to show their support.|$|R
5000|$|According to Le Monde, {{the chicken}} livers are blanched in one pan with the thyme until {{they start to}} <b>turn</b> <b>colour.</b> In a second pan, the cream is reduced on low heat with the mustard and infused with the flavour of the thyme flowers. The chicken livers are then finely minced and pressed through a {{strainer}} into the reduced cream. As the sauce thickens, the butter is incorporated into {{it with a little}} water, it is beaten smooth, and fresh-ground salt and pepper are added. The London newspaper The Independent, however, reports that the proprietor of Le Relais de Venise - L'Entrecôte has dismissed the Le Monde report as inaccurate.|$|R

60|$|Richard {{dismounted}} {{to gather}} some roses and jessamine for the Princess, and to collect {{some of the}} curious fossil echini, which he believed to be <b>olives</b> <b>turned</b> to stone by the Prophet Elijah, as a punishment to a churlish peasant who refused him a meal. He thought that such treasures would be a welcome addition to the store he was accumulating for the good old Grand Prior. He gave his horse to Hob Longbow, his only attendant except a young Sicilian lad. This same Longbow had stuck {{to him with a}} pertinacity that he could not shake off, and in truth had hitherto justified the Prince's prediction that he would be a brave and faithful fellow when his allegiance was no further disturbed by the proximity of the outlawed Montforts. There had been nothing to lead Richard to think he ought to indicate either him or Nick Dustifoot to the Prince as the persons who had been connected with Guy in Italy.|$|R
50|$|In Uzbekistan, {{there has}} been longstanding {{opposition}} to President Islam Karimov, from liberals and Islamists. Following protests in 2005, security forces in Uzbekistan carried out the Andijan massacre that successfully halted country-wide demonstrations. These protests otherwise could have <b>turned</b> into <b>colour</b> revolution, according to many analysts.|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} {{the observation of}} the preservation process of <b>turning</b> <b>colour</b> <b>olives</b> of Oblica cultivar (an autochthonous Croatian cultivar) processed according to the Californian type of processing has been carried out. Although the oblica cultivar is the most frequent cultivar in Croatian orchards, it is absolutely unexplored concerning the concentration of polyphenolic compounds (oleuropein and its derivatives) as well as concerning the composition of natural microflora in the fruit. It has been very important to determine {{to what extent the}} choice of preserving technology is optimal for the cultivar’s particularities. The changes of fundamental physical and chemical features of brine (total acidity, pH value, the concentration of sodium chloride, the concentration of sugar, and brine temperature) have been screened during the process of preservation. The appearance of the lactobacilli population has also been observed. The Lactobacillus plantarum species has been isolated and identified in this population on the seventh day after the fruit has been put in brine. The Lactobacillus plantarum species has been isolated and identified by means of the API 50 CHL (“bioMérieux”, France) biochemical test and the APILAB PLUS (“bioMérieux”, France) software. During further phases of the process, no appearance of the lactobacilli has been identified. On the basis of our physical and chemical examinations, we have concluded that the type of processing of <b>turning</b> <b>colour</b> <b>olives</b> of Oblica cultivar (which was applied without a complete knowledge of the Oblica’s particularities) did not give optimal and expected values (low brine temperature, exceptionally high acidity of the medium). We have also concluded that it is necessary for further research to include the examinations of the portion of polyphenolic compounds in the fruit, as well as the examinations of the composition of naturally present microflora. Both examinations represent the prerequisites for an optimal process of preservation and for reaching the best quality of the product...|$|R

2500|$|The olive tree, Olea europaea, {{has been}} {{cultivated}} for olive oil, fine wood, olive leaf, and the olive fruit.

60|$|His face <b>turned</b> the <b>colour</b> of wax. A glacial silence {{hung over}} the agonized {{witnesses}} of that royal humiliation. Then, without a word, in a vain attempt to rescue the dignity she had so cruelly mauled, he turned, his red heels clicked rapidly and unsteadily across the polished floor, and he was gone.|$|R
