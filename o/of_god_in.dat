5|$|A {{central theme}} {{throughout}} Symeon's teachings and writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual direct experience <b>of</b> <b>God</b> <b>in</b> deep contemplation, or theoria. Regarding his own mystical experiences, he presented them not as unique to himself, but as the norm for all Christians. He taught that the experience came after purification through prayer, repentance, and asceticism. He especially called on his monks {{to take on the}} traditional charismatic and prophetic role in the Church.|$|E
5|$|After 1914, the Church <b>of</b> <b>God</b> <b>in</b> Christ {{would become}} {{predominantly}} {{black and the}} Assemblies of God would remain predominantly white. However, there were African Americans involved {{in the early years}} of the Assemblies of God. The African-American pastor Garfield Thomas Haywood, for example, pastored one of the largest churches and was an influential voice within the fellowship until he withdrew from the denomination after 1916.|$|E

Laypersons are elected as a board of deacons to assist the pastor. A General Council affiliated church may withdraw from the Assemblies of God by a two-thirds vote of the church membership.|$|E

5|$|The {{architect}} Tiratur built a square-planned gavit (narthex) west of Church of Surb Astvatsatsin (Holy Mother <b>of</b> <b>God)</b> <b>in</b> 1648.

To {{the west of the}} narthex was a 17th-century three-arched open-air porch; to the north was Church of Surb Khach (Holy Cross); while to the south was the 17th-century Church of Surb Sion. Urartian cuneiform inscriptions were used as lintels on their western entrances.|$|E
5|$|The church's {{traditions of}} {{following}} the Sabbath, the Old Testament holy days, and tithing were initially retained. But some WCG ministers and members continued to express alarm over the doctrinal revisions Tkach had already made, {{and from time}} to time some would leave to create dissident branches. They included Tkach's one-time mentor, Roderick C. Meredith, who formed the Global Church <b>of</b> <b>God</b> <b>in</b> 1992. As various breakaway groups were established, additional clusters of church members followed.|$|E

5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive gaze of Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering <b>of</b> <b>God</b> <b>in</b> the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|Even so, churches {{within the}} Assemblies of God have {{experienced}} revivals {{in the last}} two decades which featured worship and practices reminiscent of early Pentecostalism. The most prominent of these was the Brownsville Revival, which occurred at the Brownsville Assembly <b>of</b> <b>God</b> <b>in</b> Pensacola, Florida, from 1995 into the early 2000s. These revivals often faced criticism from within and without the Assemblies of God for their unpredictability and the dramatic religious experiences of participants. In the case of the Brownsville Revival, the AG's national leadership gave it cautious approval and support.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{aspects of}} the representation <b>of</b> <b>gods</b> <b>in</b> the tragedies <b>of</b> the ancient Athenian playwright Euripides (5 th cent. BCE). A first section considers difficulties of method arising from the nature of Greek religion and from the special characteristics <b>of</b> <b>gods</b> as represented <b>in</b> Greek poetry containing stories {{of the age of}} heroes. The second section argues for the importance of analyzing the dialectic of hope and despair in the human characters of the drama, with detailed discussion of Iphigenia in Tauris, Ion, and Orestes. The third section studies the spectrum of possibilities regarding the inference by an audience of the operations <b>of</b> the <b>gods</b> <b>in</b> the background. The examples of Medea and Hecuba receive detailed treatment. A fourth section briefly presents some ancillary conclusions. An appendix lists examples of possible actions <b>of</b> unseen <b>gods</b> <b>in</b> the tragedies <b>of</b> Euripides...|$|R
5|$|Hensley was short, {{normally}} soft-spoken, {{and friendly}} with churchgoers. Most attendees at his services were miners or farmers from the Appalachian Mountains; congregants typically arrived at services on horseback or in a Ford Model A. Many were from Holiness Pentecostal backgrounds, but {{unfamiliar with the}} snake-handling practice. Hensley's sister Bertha, who lived in Ohio, was also a licensed minister with the Church <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> <b>In</b> 1922, he conducted services with her in Ohio. Around that time, more articles documenting his ministry {{were published in the}} denomination's newsletter, and by the early 1920s snakes were regularly handled in Church of God services.|$|E
5|$|In Goddess-oriented worship, Vimala (Bimala) is {{regarded}} as the presiding goddess of the Purushottama (Puri) Shakti Pitha. Jagannath, a form of the god Vishnu/Krishna (Krishna is generally regarded as an avatar of Vishnu), is worshipped as the Pitha's Bhairava. This is a departure from the usual tradition of Bhairava as a form of Shiva. So, in this temple complex, Vishnu–one of the Hindu trinity–is equated with Shiva, another of the trinity; this is interpreted to convey the oneness <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> <b>In</b> this regard, Vimala - generally associated with Shiva's consort - is also considered as Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Conversely, Tantrics consider Jagannath as Shiva-Bhairava, rather than a form of Vishnu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{a period of}} {{financial}} and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, {{at the center of}} many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church bwing placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took {{an active role in the}} defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church <b>of</b> <b>God.</b> <b>In</b> March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of elders, and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.|$|E
