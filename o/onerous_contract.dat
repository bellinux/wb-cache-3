"Perceiving which, {{a certain}} young fellow, Gravenitz by name, {{who had come}} to him from the Mecklenbnrg regions, by way of pushing fortune, and had got some pageship or the like here in Wurtemberg, recollected that he had a young Sister at home; pretty and artful, who perhaps might do a stroke of work here. He sends for the young Sister; very pretty indeed, and a gentlewoman by birth, though penniless. He borrows clothes for her (by <b>onerous</b> <b>contract</b> with the haberdashers, it is said, being poor to a degree); he easily gets her {{introduced}} to the Ducal Soirees; bids her--She knows what to do? Right well she knows what; catches, with her piquant face, the dull eye of Eberhard Ludwig, kindles Eberhard Ludwig, and will not for something quench him. Not she at all: How can SHE; your Serene Highness, ask her not! A virtuous young lady, she, and come of a stainless Family!--In brief, she hooks, she of all the fishes in the pool, this lumber of a Duke; enchants him, keeps him hooked; and has made such a pennyworth of him, for the last twenty years and more, as Germany cannot match. [Michaelis, iii. 440.] Her brother Gravenitz the page has become Count Gravenitz the prime minister, or chief of the Governing Cabal; she Countess Gravenitz and Autocrat of Wurtemberg. Loaded with wealth, with so-called honors, she and hers, there go they, flaunting sky-high; none else admitted to more than the liberty of breathing in silence in this Duchy;--the poor Duke Eberhard Ludwig making no complaint; obedient as a child to the bidding of his Gravenitz. He is become a mere enchanted simulacrum of a Duke; bewitched under worse than Thessalian spells; without faculty of willing, except as she wills; his People and he the plaything of this Circe or Hecate, that has got hold of him. So it has lasted for above twenty years. Gravenitz has become the wonder of Germany; and requires, on these bad grounds, a slight mention in Human History for some time to come. Certainly it is by the Gravenitz alone that Eberhard Ludwig is remembered; and yet, down since Ulrich with the Thumb, [Ulricus POLLEX (right thumb bigger than left); died A.D. 1265 (Michaelis, iii. 262).] which of those serene abstruse Beutelsbachers, always an abstruse obstinate set, has so fixed himself in your memory?-- ...|$|E

As a result, on 1 April 2003, Air Canada filed for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act; they emerged from this protection on 30 September 2004, 18 months later. During the period of bankruptcy protection, the company was subject to two competing bids from Cerberus Capital Management and Victor Li. The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus' international advisory board chair Dan Quayle, the former Vice-President of the United States. Cerberus was rejected because they had a reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the CAW. At first, Air Canada selected Victor Li's Trinity Time Investments, which initially asked for a board veto and the chairmanship in return for investing $650 million in the airline. Li, who holds dual citizenship from Canada and Hong Kong, later demanded changes to the pension plan (which was not in his original takeover bid), but since the unions refused to budge, the bid was withdrawn.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} that operating lease capitalisation has on key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators of listed South African companies operating within five sectors (namely General Industrials, Industrial Transportation, Food & Drug Retailers, General Retailers and Travel & Leisure), as well as whether the impact thereof is substantially {{the same as the}} new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases in terms of ED/ 2013 / 6 (IASB, 2013). Furthermore, the extent of lease usage in South Africa and whether the size of a company has a bearing on its extent of leasing is examined. Additional analysis is also performed investigating the materiality of straight-lining and <b>onerous</b> <b>contract</b> provisions relating to operating leases, as well as the impact of operating lease capitalisation on disclosed loan covenants. Based predominantly on the constructive operating lease capitalisation method developed by Imhoff, Lipe and Wright (1991 & 1997), a refined constructive lease capitalisation model is developed in this study which incorporates aspects of current lease accounting rules not previously considered, namely provisions recognised in respect of the straight-lining of operating leases as well as onerous operating lease contracts. This model also incorporates the new proposed lease accounting rules which require the capitalisation of all leases (Type A and Type B). The results indicate that the capitalisation of future non-cancellable operating lease commitments {{have a significant impact on}} key financial statement ratios and failure prediction indicators, most notably leverage and other debt-related ratios. Furthermore, of the five sectors analysed, retailers were the most affected. When considering the new proposed accounting treatment for Type A and Type B leases, the results indicate that operating lease capitalisation has substantially the same impact on key financial statement ratios and Altman‟s failure prediction models as the conventional operating lease capitalisation method, except for certain debt-related and profitability ratios. Further results indicate that operating leases are used extensively and substantially more than finance leases within South Africa. It was also found that operating lease usage was positively related to company size, while finance lease usage decreased as company size increased. Curvilinear relationships were also noted between a company‟s size and its extent of leasing. Further analysis revealed that recognised straight-lining lease provisions are substantially more material than recognised onerous lease contract provisions and are capable of distorting the analysis of operating lease capitalisation if ignored. When scrutinising loan covenants disclosed, it was established that none of the loan covenants were breached when capitalising operating leases; however, in each instance operating lease capitalisation negatively impacted all covenant related ratios...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{theoretical}} implications of the marketing liability rule, section 9. 1 in the Finnish Insurance Contract Act (543 / 1994), for general contract law. The analysis is applied to the situation where marketing or sales information gives a wrong impression about subsequent detailed contract terms. Specifically the questions are 1) how can indefinite marketing promises become the content of a contract and 2) what can be learned from the historical attempts to legislate this issue. The analysis draws from literature and historical primary sources, and legal praxis is mostly referred to through these sources. The chosen method can be characterized as a pronounced self-awareness of the power, actions, logic and preconditions of law. In Nordic contract law, unspecified or unaddressed marketing information is treated mainly as an invitation to buy, not an offer. In the sale of goods, defective marketing is sanctioned by non-conformity, when marketing information relates to the properties or use of a product. According to the trailer-principle, identified in Nordic consumer law, the impression given by marketing information concerning all kinds of contract terms or their performance can be legally protected. This can be the case for example when there are only a few of certain advertised items actually in stock, or when marketing implies that certain limitations do not apply. Good business practice is the benchmark of the trailer-principle, but the appropriate private law sanctions are an open questions in Nordic legal literature. The Finnish insurance rule mandates that if the insurer or its representative has failed to provide the necessary information or has given incorrect or misleading information to the policyholder when marketing the insurance, the insurance contract is considered to be in force to the effect understood by the policyholder on the basis of the information received. The rule thus sanctions violations through a binding effect, instead of merely administrative sanctions or negative interest. My study suggests that a historical and theoretical approach can be used to discover the points of tension between this rule and established contract law, and to present a critique of the dogma of contracts as enforceable agreements. The analysis taps into the legal and philosophical discussion on the interaction between legal rules, social norms and economic behavior. Contract law exists between societal powers far greater than that of the legislator. The history of the insurance rule exemplifies particularly well the technique of normalization, where the law and legal practice define and describes what is normal and expose deviance, while hiding their own power. In contract economics, an efficient contract has been the primary benchmark for legal rules, but this standard is imperfect, as complete contracts are also consistent with social norms. The conclusion is that a balanced content for contract law rules is needed. This kind of a balance can be seen in the Finnish insurance rule. In the past, there have been authoritative attempts to marketing liability into Finnish contract law (in 1990) and Nordic consumer law (in 2001), but the Finnish insurance rule is the only one that was enacted. This rule was crafted during an inter-Nordic reform of insurance contract law in the 1970 ’s and 80 ’s. The protocols of the Nordic insurance law committees show that the Finnish legislator attempted to persuade the other Nordic states to adopt a similar rule. Nordic insurance contract law diverged on this issue because of different needs. Finland wanted to protect policyholders from misleading statements by part-time insurance agents that lacked the authority to change policy terms. Sweden however opted for a limited rule whereby <b>onerous</b> <b>contract</b> terms could be made ineffective. This was because Sweden was concerned that insurers would be negatively affected by vexatious claims, if a general private law liability for marketing information was codified into law. The Nordic Contract Acts have proven quite resistant to reform. This study proposes, de lege ferenda, that the immutable insurance rule could be adapted as a general default rule, and that the Contracts Act is the right place for this rule. The Finnish experience shows that marketing liability works, when it is combined with balanced rules on proving a buyers wrong impression...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} the French Civil Code on the effective Serbian Law on Obligations from 1978 in respect of the cause of contract. This is an institution in respect of which the Law conspicuously departs from the Swiss Law on Obligations, which served as its prime legislative model, and follows the path designated in the French code. The author concludes that the Serbian law transcripts almost verbatim the rules of law in the French code pertaining to the cause of contract. However, its provisions are somewhat more detailed than those of the French counterpart, since it explicitly governs the impact of motives on the validity of a contract as well. Analyzing the Serbian case-law, the author concludes that motives gain legal relevance in Serbian contract law in two different ways. On the one hand, courts confirm the proposition adopted in the doctrine that in gratuitous contracts (permitted) motives pertain to the notion of cause. On the other hand, illicit, non-permitted motives make gratuitous contracts void regardless whether the other party acted in good faith or not, while they render <b>onerous</b> <b>contracts</b> void only if the other party acted in bad faith, that is, he or she knew or should have known that the first party was guided by illicit motives to conclude the contract...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the current Australian courts’ definitions of employee and independent contractor. It highlights where the franchisee fits, being indistinguishable at times from an employee {{and at other}} times from an independent contractor. The paper examines the policy behind insolvency legislation in Australia and queries whether it would be appropriate to accord franchisees specific status in the franchisor’s insolvency; like that enjoyed by employees. In most situations, the definition is relatively unimportant. The Franchise Agreement, ancillary contracts and the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) regulate the franchisor/ franchisee relationship. If the franchisor becomes insolvent, the failure of the law {{to keep pace with the}} franchise business model is bought into sharp focus. Whereas the employee and the independent contractor have clearly understood rights, enshrined in statute, the franchisee has no specific rights. Unless the franchisee is a creditor of the franchisor, it does not have a right to attend creditors meetings. At its most vulnerable, the franchisee is categorized as an asset or a liability in the insolvent estate. The franchisor – franchisee relationship, however, has many features that make the franchisee more vulnerable than an employer whose employer becomes insolvent. If the franchisor becomes insolvent, the franchisee may loose the value of sunk investments, the right to occupy premises, and may not be able to free itself from <b>onerous</b> <b>contracts</b> that were only entered into because of its position as a franchisee...|$|R

2500|$|In {{three main}} situations, English law allows people who lack legal {{capacity}} to contract to escape from enforcement of agreements and recover property that was conveyed, to reverse unjust enrichment. First, a person may be {{too young to be}} bound by large or <b>onerous</b> <b>contracts.</b> Minors, under 18 years, can bind themselves to contracts for [...] "necessaries" [...] to pay a reasonable price, but only unusual contracts, such as for eleven luxury waistcoats will not be deemed [...] "necessaries". While the adult contracting party is bound, the minor has the option to rescind the contract, so long as one of the four equitable bars (lapse of time, affirmation, third party rights, counter-restitution possible) is not present. Second, people who are mentally incapacitated, for instance because they are sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 or they are completely , are in principle bound to agreements when the other person could not or did not know they lacked mental capacity. But if the other person did know or should have known, then the mentally incapacitated individual may no longer have agreements for non-necessaries enforced upon them. Third, companies can generally bind themselves to any agreement, even though many (particularly older) companies have a limited range of objects that their members (in most companies this means shareholders) have consented that the business is for. Under the Companies Act 2006 sections 39 and 40, if a third party contracting with the company in bad faith takes advantage of a director or officer to procure an agreement, that contract will be wholly void. This is a high threshold, and in practice no longer relevant, particularly since 2006 companies may elect to have unrestricted objects. It is more likely that a contract ceases to be enforceable because, as a matter of the law of agency the third party should have reasonably known that the person contracting lacked authority to enter an agreement. In this situation a contract is voidable at the instance of the company, and could only be enforced against the (probably less solvent) employee.|$|R

40|$|Technology {{has led to}} the {{development}} of new payment devices and processing systems, and a complicated body of public and private payments law has been established in response. In this environment, consumers have little control over how their payment instruments will be processed. They are subject to <b>onerous</b> adhesion <b>contracts.</b> It is difficult for consumers to understand the legal consequences of using one payment device over another. In light of these developments, many are questioning how much responsibility the law should impose on consumers when errors occur and how much protection they deserve. Some experts favor legal rules that take maximum advantage of the efficiencies technology can achieve and retention of the present legal rules which vary from one payment device and processing system to another. The better approach, however, is to recognize that consumers have common objectives, regardless of the type of payment device they use or how it is processed. These objectives can be achieved through uniform laws that apply to all types of payment instruments and systems. Those laws should guarantee the right to an error resolution procedure, adjudication of disputes before a judicial forum, and a sixty day deadline for reporting erroneous payments...|$|R
