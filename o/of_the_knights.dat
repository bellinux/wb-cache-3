5|$|Among the crusaders in the Crusade of 1101 were Stephen II, Count of Blois and Hugh of Vermandois, both of {{whom had}} {{returned}} home before reaching Jerusalem. This crusade was almost annihilated in Asia Minor by the Seljuqs, but the survivors helped to reinforce the kingdom upon their arrival in Jerusalem. In the following years, assistance was also provided by Italian merchants who established themselves in Syrian ports, and from the religious and military orders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Templar and the Knights Hospitaller, which were created during Baldwin I's reign.|$|E

5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knights.</b> Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E
5|$|Charity is the {{foremost}} principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> of Columbus.

Finally in 2015, Knights of Columbus, on an average per member basis, contributed 38 hours of community service.|$|E
5|$|Due to his wartime experiences, Frederick William was {{convinced}} that Brandenburg-Prussia would only prevail with a standing army. Traditionally, raising and financing army reserves was a privilege of the estates, yet Frederick William envisioned a standing army financed independently of the estates. He succeeded in getting the consent and necessary financial contributions of the estates in a landtag decree of 26 July 1653. In turn, he confirmed several privileges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knights,</b> including tax exemption, assertion of jurisdiction and police powers on their estates (Patrimonialgerichtsbarkeit) and the upholding of serfdom (Leibeigenschaft, Bauernlegen).|$|E

5|$|In late 1401, the new {{war against}} the Order {{overstretched}} {{the resources of the}} Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces.

On 31 January 1402, he presented himself in Marienburg, where he won the backing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> with concessions similar to those made by Jogaila and Vytautas during earlier leadership contests in the Grand Duchy.|$|E
5|$|Malta has a {{long and}} rich history, and this is {{reflected}} in the island's cultural attractions. The Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans and the Byzantines have all occupied Malta at some point in history, leaving a mix of many different architectural styles and artifacts to explore. The sovereignty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Hospitaller over Malta from 1530 to 1798 resulted in a legacy of elaborate artistry and architecture throughout Malta. The country's modern museums and art galleries feature relics from Malta's history for tourists and Maltese residents alike to enjoy.|$|E

Bohemond's relationship with Armenian Cilicia remained tense, which prevented him from pursuing an active foreign policy until Mleh was dethroned in 1175.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{church in}} Bristol is St James' Priory in Horsefair, Whitson Street. It {{was founded in}} 1129, as a Benedictine priory, by Robert Rufus. The 12th century also saw the founding of All Saints and St Philip and Jacob churches. Temple Church, now in ruins, {{was built on the}} site of the oval church <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Templar, a Christian military order forcibly disbanded in 1312. Either just before or just after the disappearance of the Templars, the church was rebuilt on a rectangular plan and served as a parish church.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} crusading order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Knights</b> Templar {{also held}} extensive property in England, bringing in around £2,200 per annum {{by the time}} of their fall.

Following the dissolution of the Templar order in France by Philip IV of France, Edward II ordered their properties to be seized and passed to the Hospitaller order in 1313, but in practice many properties were taken by local landowners and the Hospital was still attempting to reclaim them twenty-five years later.|$|E
