25|$|Colonies of P. gallicus {{have one}} queen that mates and {{produces}} offspring. All females, both workers and queens, {{are capable of}} producing male offspring, and have a genetic incentive to do so; mother-to-son relatedness is 1/2, while the relatedness of a worker to her brothers is 1/4. If the queen has only been mated <b>once,</b> <b>then</b> worker's relatedness to the male offspring of other workers is 3/8, meaning workers should favor male production by themselves and their sisters over production by the queen. However, in {{the case that the}} queen mates more than once, workers are actually more related to their brothers than compared to the offspring of other workers (a mixture of full and half sisters).|$|E

25|$|The McFlurry is a soft-serve {{ice cream}} dessert that has pieces of candy or cookies mixed into it. The McFlurry was first {{integrated}} into the menu at a Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada franchisee in 1995 and in the United States in 1998. The flavors are crushed Oreo, M's Minis, Reese's, or Mars, Incorporated candy bars like Snickers, Twix, Galaxy, etc., Cadbury's candy bars like Twirl, Wispa, Creme Egg, Crunchie etc., Nestlé candy bars like Yorkie, Smarties, Drifter, Rolo, Butterfinger, etc. McDonald's also does limited time only flavors, e.g. for Shrek the Third it released the Ogre-Load flavor. In Australia, they had a special range for their 40 years in Australia celebration. The flavors were double choc fudge, bubblegum squash, strawberry crumble and caramel cookie. Also in Malaysia, a unique flavor called FuseofmyLife is offered to customers. The mixing blade for the dessert is actually a specially designed spoon with a hollow handle that attaches to the mixer spindle (except in Australia and New Zealand where the staff mix it by hand). The blade is used <b>once</b> <b>then</b> given to the customer to use as an eating utensil. Originally test marketed in Hawaii in 1997, it is now available in most of its markets.|$|E
25|$|Nivi drape {{starts with}} {{one end of}} the sari tucked into the {{waistband}} of the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body <b>once,</b> <b>then</b> hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the waistband of the petticoat. They create a graceful, decorative effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder. The loose end is called the pallu, pallav, seragu, or paita depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff. The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the pallu, depending on the social setting. The long end of the pallu hanging {{from the back of the}} shoulder is often intricately decorated. The pallu may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the pallu draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of Raja Ravi Varma. In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari. The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the waist chains. They are considered to be a part of bridal jewellery.|$|E

500|$|H to He {{continued}} to be recorded sporadically throughout 1970, and featured Robert Fripp of King Crimson contributing guitar on [...] "The Emperor in His War-Room". Producer John Anthony knew Fripp socially and invited him to a session as a guest, something Fripp had never done before at that point. According to Jackson, Fripp [...] "put headphones on and started searing away", listening to the track <b>once,</b> <b>then</b> performing two takes. [...] "Killer", later to become a live favourite, recycled a middle eight from an old Heebalob song, and Smith received a co-composition credit on the track. Reviewing the album, Sounds particularly praised Jackson's saxophone work.|$|E
500|$|The project {{manifested}} as a poem {{written by}} Gibson incorporated into an artist's book created by Ashbaugh; {{as such it}} {{was as much a}} work of collaborative conceptual art as poetry. Gibson stated that Ashbaugh's design [...] "eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only <b>once,</b> <b>then</b> eat itself." [...] Ashbaugh was gleeful at the dilemma this would pose to librarians: in order to register the copyright of the book, he had to send two copies to the United States Library of Congress, who, in order to classify it had to read it, and in the process, necessarily had to destroy it. The creators had initially intended to infect the disks with a computer virus, but declined to after considering the potential damage to the computer systems of innocents.|$|E

500|$|A {{particularly}} well-received work by Gibson was Agrippa (a {{book of the}} dead) (1992), a 300-line semi-autobiographical electronic {{poem that}} was his contribution to a collaborative project with artist Dennis Ashbaugh and publisher Kevin Begos, Jr. Gibson's text focused on the ethereal nature of memories (the title refers to a photo album) and was originally published on a 3.5" [...] floppy disk embedded {{in the back of}} an artist's book containing etchings by Ashbaugh (intended to fade from view once the book was opened and exposed to light — they never did, however). Gibson commented that Ashbaugh's design [...] "eventually included a supposedly self-devouring floppy-disk intended to display the text only <b>once,</b> <b>then</b> eat itself." [...] Contrary to numerous colorful reports, the diskettes were never actually [...] "hacked"; instead the poem was manually transcribed from a surreptitious videotape of a public showing in Manhattan in December 1992, and released on the MindVox bulletin board the next day; this is the text that circulated widely on the Internet.|$|E
500|$|Following the touring cycle for Cross Purposes, bassist Geezer Butler {{quit the}} band {{for the second}} time. [...] "I finally got totally disillusioned with the last Sabbath album, and I much {{preferred}} the stuff I was writing to the stuff Sabbath were doing". Butler formed a solo project called GZR, and released Plastic Planet in 1995. The album contained the song [...] "Giving Up the Ghost", which was critical of Tony Iommi for carrying on with the Black Sabbath name, with the lyrics: You plagiarised and parodied / the magic of our meaning / a legend in your own mind / left all your friends behind / you can't admit that you're wrong / the spirit is dead and gone ("I heard it's something about me..." [...] said Iommi. [...] "I had the album given to me a while back. I played it <b>once,</b> <b>then</b> somebody else had it, so I haven't really {{paid any attention to}} the lyrics... It's nice to see him doing his own thing – getting things off his chest. I don't want to get into a rift with Geezer. He's still a friend." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it <b>once,</b> <b>then</b> started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E
