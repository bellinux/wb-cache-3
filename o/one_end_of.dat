5|$|At around 22:10 Madeleine's father sent Matthew Oldfield {{to ask the}} resort's {{reception}} desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol. Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off.

5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the {{foreground}} is a figure modelled on Caius Gabriel Cibber's Raving Madness, which at the time was one of two monumental sculptures above the entrance to Bethlem Hospital ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity. The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls on <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.|$|E

Kenilworth Road hosted football in the Southern League until 1920, then in the Football League until 2009, when Luton were relegated to the Conference Premier.

5|$|The RFC 6520 Heartbeat Extension tests TLS/DTLS secure {{communication}} links by allowing a computer at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{a connection to}} send a Heartbeat Request message, consisting of a payload, typically a text string, along with the payload's length as a 16-bit integer. The receiving computer then must send exactly the same payload back to the sender.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{director}} to align along an external field {{is caused by the}} electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.|$|E

5|$|The spores are 4–7 by 2–3µm, oblong-elliptical, smooth, and {{embedded}} in the gleba. A 1982 study revealed that spores of species in the Phallaceae family, including Mutinus elegans, have a hilar scar (0.2–0.3µm diameter) that is observable with scanning electron microscopy. The hilar scar is a circular indentation at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the spore, and it most likely results during {{the separation of the}} attachment of the spore to the sterigma of the basidium.|$|E

5|$|A more {{traditional}} Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighborhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade {{gathered in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. At <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded {{in the first half}} of the 19th century.

5|$|Beat 'em up games usually employ vigilante crime {{fighting}} and revenge plots with the action {{taking place on}} city streets, though historical and fantasy themed games also exist. Players must walk from <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the game world to the other, and thus each game level will usually scroll horizontally. Some later beat 'em ups dispense with 2D-based scrolling levels, instead allowing the player to roam around larger 3D environments, though they retain the same simple gameplay and control systems. Throughout the level, players may acquire weapons {{that they can use}} as well as power-ups that replenish the player's health.|$|E
5|$|Budd built 361 Amfleet I coaches; 90 were {{configured}} for long-distance use (60 seats) and 271 for short-distance use (84 seats). All 125 Amfleet II {{coaches were}} designed for long-distance service and contained 59 seats. In all standard Amfleet coaches seating is 2×2; in the Amfleet II a single accessible seat accounted for the odd number. Amfleet seats have swing-down tray-tables for at-seat food service, as well as overhead and underseat luggage storage. There are two restrooms at <b>one</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the car.

5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. <b>One</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
