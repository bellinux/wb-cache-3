50|$|Estrone (E1), also spelled <b>oestrone,</b> is a steroid, a weak estrogen, and a minor female sex hormone. It is one {{of three}} major {{endogenous}} estrogens, the others being estradiol and estriol. Estrone, {{as well as the other}} estrogens, are synthesized from cholesterol and secreted mainly from the gonads, though they can also be formed from adrenal androgens in adipose tissue. Relative to estradiol, both estrone and estriol have far weaker activity as estrogens. Previously, estrone was available as an injected estrogen for medical use, but it is now no longer marketed.|$|E

5000|$|Because the {{fathead minnow}} is fairly {{tolerant}} of harsh conditions, {{it can be}} found in bodies of water that may be uninhabitable to other fish, such as waste drainage sites. It has also been studied to investigate the effects of these waste materials on the aquatic life. [...] Natural and synthetic oestrogens, such as oestradiol and <b>oestrone,</b> are present in sewage treatment works effluents. In male fathead minnows, exposure to these steroidal compounds leads to an increase in plasma vitellogenin levels exceeding that of even mature female fathead minnows. Vitellogenin blood plasma levels are an indicator for determining if chemicals have an oestrogenic activity to fish. This is also accompanied by an inhibition of testicular growth, even if the exposure is in low concentrations or {{for a short period of}} time. These studies showed that the presence of natural oestrogens, likely originating from humans, represents a new ecotoxicological issue.|$|E
50|$|Bisphenol A is a {{chemical}} {{used to make}} polycarbonate plastic, epoxy resin, and other chemicals. It is also weakly estrogenic, {{and many of the}} same effects of oestradiol and <b>oestrone</b> can be seen with this compound. In the male fathead minnows, reduced somatic growth is seen. With females, egg production and hatchability are reduced. The effects take place more quickly in females than in males, though. The effect of low pH on the fathead minnow has also been studied. Though survival was minimally affected by extended exposure to low pH, the minnow behavior was abnormal. They showed stress behaviors, such as surface swimming and hyperactivity. In addition, some deformities also were brought about by long exposure to low pH. In both males and females, their heads became smaller than normal. Males lose some of the brightness of their color. Females become heavy with eggs but may not spawn, and the number of eggs per female is reduced. The eggs themselves come out abnormal, fragile and lacking turgidity, and the lower the pH, the less likely the eggs are to eventually hatch. In fathead minnows exposed to cattle feedlot effluent, the males are feminized and the females are defeminized. The male fathead minnows have reduced testicular testosterone synthesis, altered head morphometrics, and smaller testis size, while the females have a decreased estrogen:androgen ratio, which is defeminized sex hormone ratio.|$|E

Three additional patients had the {{production rate}} of <b>oestrone</b> sulphate investigated. Plasma <b>oestrone</b> and <b>oestrone</b> sulphate levels were reduced by a mean of 46 % (P less than 0. 05) and 71 % (P less than 0. 005) respectively. These alterations were due to a combined action of aminoglutethimide inhibiting oestrogen production but also increasing oestrogen metabolism. While <b>oestrone</b> and <b>oestrone</b> sulphate production rate was reduced by a mean of 31 % (P less than 0. 05) and 41 % (P less than 0. 005) respectively, the plasma clearance rate of <b>oestrone</b> {{was found to be}} increased by a mean of 30 % (P less than 0. 05), and the plasma clearance rate of <b>oestrone</b> sulphate was increased by a mean of 112 % during aminoglutethimide treatment.

The findings in this investigation show that aminoglutethimide treatment influences oestrogen disposition by mechanisms unrelated to aromatase inhibition. The possibility that such effects might be partly responsible for the mechanism of action of aminoglutethimide in advanced breast cancer should be considered...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Urine was {{collected}} from 6 female cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus o. oedipus) and urinary <b>oestrone</b> and oestradiol concentrations were measured by radioimmuno-assay. <b>Oestrone</b> was excreted at 50 -fold higher concentrations than oestradiol.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of [4 - 14 C]oestrone and of [6, 7 - 3 H 2]oestrone sulphate was studied during cyclic perfusion and once-through perfusion of {{the isolated}} rat liver. The following results were obtained. 1. As shown by once-through perfusion, the two steroids are metabolized differently {{during the first}} passage through the organ. [4 - 14 C]Oestrone was {{taken up by the}} liver and partly delivered as oestradiol- 17 β and oestriol into the medium. After uptake of [6, 7 - 3 H 2]oestrone sulphate, only <b>oestrone,</b> liberated by hydrolysis, was delivered into the medium; no oestradiol- 17 β or oestriol could be detected in the medium after one passage through the organ. This indicates that intracellular <b>oestrone,</b> which was taken up as such, and <b>oestrone,</b> which derived from intracellular hydrolysis, may be metabolized in different compartments of the liver cell. 2. The results of the cyclic perfusion showed that intracellular <b>oestrone</b> is preferentially conjugated with glucuronic acid, and subsequently excreted into the bile. Intracellular <b>oestrone</b> sulphate is preferably reduced to oestradiol sulphate, thus indicating that <b>oestrone</b> sulphate is a better substrate for the 17 β-hydroxy steroid oxidoreductase than is <b>oestrone.</b> 3. Albumin-bound <b>oestrone</b> sulphate acts as a large reservoir, and in contrast with free <b>oestrone</b> is protected from enzyme attack by its strong binding to albumin. 4. <b>Oestrone</b> sulphate is partly converted into the hormonally active <b>oestrone</b> by liver tissue. This suggests that liver not only inactivates oestrogens, but also provides the organism with <b>oestrone,</b> which is subsequently readily taken up by other organs...|$|E

Treatment of HL 60 cells with retinoids or 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 increased steroid sulphatase mRNA and activity in parallel with the induction of CD 11 b, an early marker of myeloid differentiation that is expressed before the differentiating cells stop proliferating. Use of agonists and antagonists against retinoid receptor-alpha and retinoid receptor-X revealed that both classes of retinoid receptor can drive steroid sulphatase up-regulation. Steroid sulphatase activity fluctuates during the cell cycle, being highest around the transition from G 1 to S phase. During the differentiation of HL 60 cells induced by all-trans-retinoic acid or 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3, there is increased conversion of 17 beta-oestradiol into <b>oestrone</b> by an oxidative 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

In a 2 nd group of cattle, a milk sample was taken from all cows in 7 herds between 133 and 181 days after mating, <b>oestrone</b> sulfate content measured, {{and a list of}} pregnancy status obtained for each animal based on farmer&# 39;s observations. Complete results were obtained for 975 animals, of which 877 (89. 9 %) were pregnant and 98 (10. 1 %) non-pregnant. Sensitivity and specificity values were 85. 2 and 79. 6 %, respectively, for <b>oestrone</b> sulfate and 95. 9 and 54. 1 %, respectively, for farmer&# 39;s observation. ...|$|E

40|$|INCIDENCES of mammary {{carcinoma}} and adenoma in C 3 Hf virgin females, {{in those}} ovariectomised only or given 5,ug. <b>oestrone</b> weekly {{have been reported}} (Pullinger, 1959). The present paper records increa,ses in carcinoma and adenoma after ovariectomy and treatment with 10 jug. weekly of <b>oestrone</b> alone and with 10,ug. weekly of a mixture of <b>oestrone,</b> oestradiol- 17 / 8 and oestriol. Treatment with 10,ug. oestriol alone gave the same yield of mammary carcinoma as 5,ag. <b>oestrone,</b> namely 2 - 9 per cent. Tumours that arose in other sites, effects in adrenal glands, results of grafts and the site and age distribution of the mammary carcinomas are incluided. METHODS AND MATERIALS Surplus females of the C 3 Hf pure line colony bred for experiment were separated from males and collected in groups at weaning. The origin of the strain, management, methods of treatment and examination have been described (Pullinger and Iversen, 1960; Pullinger, 1960 a, 1960 b, 1961). Bilateral ovariectomies were done at 52 to 98 days of age in Experiment I and at 96 to 111 days in Experiment II. The second group was begun with older mice because deaths from urinary calculi and their consequences had been high in the first group in comparison with older and bigger breeding females (Pullinger, 1961). After ovariectomy, weekly treatment with 10,ug. <b>oestrone</b> dissolved in acetone was begun and continued for 60 weeks. A further test which had already been started treating virgin females with 20 jag. <b>oestrone</b> was abandoned on aJccount of their poor condition and high death rate due to urinary calculi. This tendency to calculi in C 3 H mice given oestradiol benzoate by subcutaneous injcction was reported earlier by Schenken...|$|E

The {{concentration}} of unconjugated <b>oestrone,</b> oestradiol- 17 a and oestradiol- 17 /? has been {{measured in the}} maternal jugular venous plasma of pregnant sheep every 6 hr over the period 108 hr before to 72 hr after parturition. Measurable levels of each oestrogen were present 108 hr before parturition and by about 40 hr, the concentration began to increase markedly. Levels of 200 to 350 pg/ml for <b>oestrone</b> and 100 to 150 pg/ml for oestradiol- 17 a and for oestradiol- 17 /? were foundjust before parturition.
