50|$|Many {{people with}} WAM fetishes {{are drawn to}} the tactile sensations of wet <b>or</b> <b>messy</b> {{substances}} against their skin. Other individuals simply prefer the sight of others getting messy or wet. A subject will often be pelted with cream pies (sometimes using shaving foam rather than real cream pie filling), have slime dumped on them, or sit on cakes. Another common theme is the pouring of substances inside clothing while it is being worn; clothing chosen for this can vary from swimsuits or underwear to full outfits. Normal street clothes, either casual or office wear, are commonly featured in WAM productions, but many other types of outfits, from wedding attire to industrial overalls or more specialist fetishwear such as PVC, latex, or leather items may be used. White items are particularly popular with some fans of this fetish.|$|E
50|$|After the war Gray and Sugawara {{returned}} to Paris. There Gray {{was given the}} job of decorating {{an apartment in the}} rue de Lota for a milliner, Madame Mathieu Lévy, who was a successful boutique owner. The re-design was hoped to be new and original, with innovative designs. The process took four years from 1917 to 1921. Gray designed most of its furniture (including her famous Bibendum chair), carpets and lamps, and installed lacquered panels on the walls. Gray made a point of using plain coverings for the furniture she designed which included, along with the Bibendum Chair, the Serpent Chair and the Pirogue Boat Bed. Her intent was that the apartment would not look too cluttered <b>or</b> <b>messy</b> and that the eye would be drawn, first of all, to the tribal art on display. The result was favourably reviewed by several art critics who saw it as innovative. Given a boost from the success of the apartment, Gray opened up a small shop in Paris, Jean Desert, to exhibit and sell her work and that of her artist friends.|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{computers}} and related technologies {{have an important}} role in enabling visualisations of the workings of various scientific concepts, natural phenomena and mechanisms by creating technology-rich environments (TRE). TRE offer opportunities to science teachers in cases of natural phenomena that might be difficult or impossible to view, dangerous to conduct experiments about, impractical or too expensive to bring into the classroom, <b>or</b> too <b>messy</b> <b>or</b> time consuming to prepare in a school laboratory. However, science teaching cannot and should not be undertaken entirely by TRE. Science teachers {{need to know how to}} integrate technology into science classrooms. Measuring science teachers’ confidence in technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK) and identifying their views about using TRE in science instruction is an important issue. The present study aims to address challenges faced by in-service science teachers when creating TRE and gives suggestions for successful technology integration into science teaching. The data were gathered through a TPCK confidence survey and subsequent interviews. The results show that in-service science teachers have a low level of confidence in using technology during science teaching. The teachers surveyed stressed their need for professional development activities regarding the effective and meaningful use of TRE in science teaching. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) {{which is}} based on systems approach and its associated ideas which are set out by Checkland. SSM has been developed for use in ill structured <b>or</b> <b>messy</b> problem contexts where there is no clear view on what constitutes the difficulties being experienced. There is a fundamental difference between these kind of problems (ill-structured, messy) and hard problems because in the latter the end or what should be achieved is already known. SSM is based on building a conceptual model following certain guide-lines. The conceptual model or the guide-lines can then be compared with the real-world or the current situation. The variance between the two, the conceptual model and the real- world, may then highlight the problems areas in which the solutions of these problems can be discussed or debated with the people in problem situation. SSM prevents decision makers from rushing into poorly thought-out solutions Ixised on preconceived ideas about an assumed problem. In the present paper the importance of avoding preconceived solutions and reaching real problems is also pointed out...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Springer via [URL] explanations are relatively abstract: they abstract away from the idiosyncratic <b>or</b> <b>messy</b> details of the case in hand. The received wisdom in philosophy {{is that this is}} a virtue for any explanation to possess. I argue that the apparent consensus on this point is illusory. When philosophers make this claim, they differ on which of four alternative varieties of abstractness they have in mind. What's more, for each variety of abstractness there are several alternative reasons to think that the variety of abstractness in question is a virtue. I identify the most promising reasons, and dismiss some others. The paper concludes by relating this discussion to the idea that explanations in biology, psychology and social science cannot be replaced by relatively micro explanations without loss of understanding.

40|$|Abstract: From {{interviews}} with prisoners and ex-prisoners in Israel, it emerges that their delinquency was {{an outcome of}} what is called in many languages, including Hebrew, balagan (a chaotic <b>or</b> <b>messy</b> life). The balagan is caused by a lack of moral and behavioral centers, and it is characterized by confusing and contradictory norms of criminal and noncriminal behav-ior. This conclusion is inconsistent with theories that explain criminality in terms of cultural perspective, but it fits the center theory and the theories of social control. The balagan was mainly expressed by contradictions between their attitudes and behavior, as well as between their positive images and criminal acts. None of the convicts and ex-convicts justified breaking the law, but they attempted to minimize their responsibility by means of justifications and excuses. This study is based on phenomenological interviews conducted with 25 prisoners and 50 former prisoners who underwent programs of rehabilitation in kibbutzim and in yeshivot in Israel.
