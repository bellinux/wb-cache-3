40|$|The central {{holding of}} Crawford v. Washington is fairly straightforward: The Confrontation Clause bars the {{admission}} of out-of-court testimonial statements unless the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Crawford, however, has an often overlooked caveat. In renouncing numerous exceptions to the confrontation right, the Court rejected only those that purport to test the reliability of testimonial statements. It left equitable exceptions undisturbed. As the Court pointed out, 2 ̆ 2 [T]he rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept) extinguishes confrontation claims <b>on</b> essentially <b>equitable</b> <b>grounds.</b> 2 ̆ 2 The parameters {{of the rule of}} forfeiture are a matter of some dispute. As opposed to a waiver, which requires a knowing and intelligent relinquishment of a right, forfeiture occurs when an individual commits an act inconsistent with maintaining a right. It has traditionally applied in witness tampering cases, where a defendant intimidates, bribes or kills a witness just before she is scheduled to testify. In those situations, forfeiture should bar the defendant from successfully objecting to {{the admission of}} the witness 2 ̆ 7 s prior unconfronted testimony...|$|R

50|$|After war ended, Burkholder {{remained}} in Lynchburg, and was elected {{as one of}} Campbell County's three delegates to the first session of the Virginia General Assembly after Congressional Reconstruction ended. The other delegates were Conservative Democrats John W. Daniel and his father-in-law Rufus Murrell. Daniel also represented creditors of Crumpton who sued Burkholder and other Crumpton relatives because Crumpton had died with debts but without finishing real estate transfer paperwork (prominent ex-Confederate and Republican John Singleton Mosby and his law partner represented Burkholder). Nonetheless, Burkholder finished the Y-shaped house by 1875, and it remains a historic structure in the Daniel's Hill Historic District today. The Virginia Supreme Court in 1872 threw out {{the case against the}} husband of Crumpton's daughter Una, and in 1878 decided that the Cabell Street house belonged to Burkholder, <b>on</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>grounds</b> because he had so improved the property.|$|E

40|$|The Great War {{presented}} {{a great challenge}} to Italian private law. Not only did wartime legislation give the government increasing power {{to intervene in the}} traditional domain of private law, but the experience of war also helped to precipitate longer term changes in Italian private law. The war itself saw the autonomy and purity of private law undermined in various respects: in the operation of special tribunals deciding cases <b>on</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>grounds</b> which favoured the weaker party; in regulatory interference in matters of contract and property; and in the labour market. Wartime problems also precipitated the rethinking of rules of law in a number of areas, where the roots of reform ran deeper—such as the law relating to orphans, married women and missing persons. At the end of the war, a royal commission was appointed to consider what reforms were needed in the post-war period, and how the Italian Civil Code could be redrafted in light of legislative lessons learned in the war...|$|E
40|$|Directors owe {{fiduciary}} duties {{of care and}} loyalty to their corporations, and by extension to their shareholders. When a corporation approaches or enters insolvency, however, courts have recently found that the fiduciary duty calculus may change. Recognizing that creditors have financial interests {{similar to those of}} shareholders at or near insolvency, courts in several countries have extended fiduciary duty protection to creditors <b>on</b> <b>equitable</b> <b>grounds.</b> This trend has led to a state of flux and uncertainty in corporate law. Consequently, courts and commentators are battling to fully comprehend the controversial subject of director {{fiduciary duties}} to creditors in various jurisdictions. Due to this jurisprudential flux, unresolved issues include, for example, the core notion that the duty arises when the company enters into an “ill-defined sphere” known as the “zone” or “vicinity” of insolvency. The law is remarkably short of specific judicial guidance as to how directors who engage in commercial risk-taking with a view to corporate rescue should discharge their duties without harming the interests of creditors. Indeed, the debate continues even on the critical doctrinal question of whether such a duty is even needed. This Article uses corporate law in both the United States and Australia as emblematic of the real practical concerns inherent in the expansion of fiduciary duties. Consequently, the Article argues that the judicial recognition of directors’ fiduciary duties to creditors when at or near insolvency is objectionable, both from a policy and a doctrinal standpoint, and that any further attempt to develop the common law in this regard should be jettisoned in favor of reliance upon the existing, or modified, statutory regime aimed at creditor protection during times of financial distress...|$|E
