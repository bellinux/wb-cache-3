40|$|The {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>value</b> {{and value}} creation {{for the success}} of business	activity has been increasingly recognised theoretically	 and practically. The concept <b>of</b> <b>value</b> has been defined on the basis of various foundations and from different perspectives. Despite the extant	 conceptualisations <b>of</b>	<b>value</b> in business literature, social representations <b>of</b> <b>value</b> (i. e. common sense knowledge about value) are yet to be	fully	understood. Thus, this paper investigated these social representations	as well as the relationship	between extant representations <b>of</b> <b>value</b> by employing the structural social representation theory and its related	methodology strategy as proposed	by Doise et al (1993), as well as	 the ontology engineering method (Ma,	et al,	 2014). The analysis revealed that economy-based	concepts constitute the core	elements <b>of</b> <b>value</b> representation in the overall value network, while	exchange- and	experience- based concepts form the sub-networks (clusters) for value. Exchange-centricity, with economy-based concepts as its foundation, is the dominant representation	<b>of</b> <b>value,</b>	while experience-centred concepts constitute the peripheral elements	in	the overall	 network <b>of</b> <b>value.</b> Despite the different positions of these	sub-networks (clusters) <b>of</b>	<b>value</b> in the value network, they share common core elements, i. e. economy-related concepts.

In terms of the extant representations	<b>of</b> <b>value</b> in business literature, the exchange-based notion <b>of</b> <b>value</b> (Goods-Dominant Logic) is more	representative than	the experienced-based notion <b>of</b> <b>value</b> (Service-Dominant Logic) for its common understanding in the public sphere.

5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. One of the reasons the SI unit system will be changed is that determination <b>of</b> <b>values</b> can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E

Markov was interested in studying an extension of independent random sequences. In his first paper on Markov chains, published in 1906, Markov showed that under certain conditions the average outcomes of the Markov chain would converge to a fixed vector <b>of</b> <b>values,</b> so proving a weak law of large numbers without the independence assumption, which had been commonly regarded as a requirement for such mathematical laws to hold. Markov later used Markov chains to study the distribution of vowels in Eugene Onegin, written by Alexander Pushkin, and proved a central limit theorem for such chains.|$|E

Each of these could be written {{as many times as}} necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively. Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions. For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth. Standard tables <b>of</b> <b>values</b> facilitated this. Some common fractions, however, were written with a special glyph—the equivalent of the modern two-thirds is shown on the right.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary across a range <b>of</b> <b>values,</b> such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, {{which is a}} shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E
