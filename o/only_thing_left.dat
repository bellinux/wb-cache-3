5|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} on the 11th, wily Saltykov realized that Frederick was not advancing on him from Frankfurt, and changed his plans. He inverted his flanks: instead of having the left wing at the shtetl and the right at Mühlberge, he reversed his flank with the right at the shtetl. Then the Russians set fire to Kunersdorf. Within hours, the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>left</b> was the stone church and some walls. While Frederick developed his plan to outflank Saltykov by maneuvering behind him, Saltykov outfoxed him.|$|E

500|$|Prohibition {{had been}} {{introduced}} in Alberta following a 1916 referendum, during which the UFA had advocated for the prohibitionist side. [...] The Liberal version of prohibition was weak, and Greenfield came into office intending to strengthen the legislation. [...] Even by 1920, however, it was becoming apparent that the policy was not working (or, as the Medicine Hat News noted, [...] "Prohibition is now working smoothly. [...] The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>left</b> is to stop the sale of liquor!"). [...] Greenfield's own MLAs began to grumble about the policy—Archibald Matheson expressed in 1923 the view that [...] "This government has acted as philosopher, guide, and God to the people long enough." [...] Public opinion, too, began to shift against the policy, more rapidly after 1922 when three police officers {{were killed in the}} line of duty by bootleggers. [...] The last and most dramatic of these was the murder of Steve Lawson in front of the barracks where he and his family lived, by Emil [...] "Pic" [...] Picariello and Florence Lassandra. [...] Public opinion ran high both for and against the pair, and their 1923 hangings only served to unite both factions against prohibition.|$|E

Millonarios came out with their full attack, but América de Cali played with tranquility and soon enough the first goal came As they kept a close watch on the other games being played that day, América de Cali withstood the constant attack of Millonarios. Time took an important role and as it ran down, it only benefited América de Cali. Deportes Tolima had won their match, Deportivo Pereira were tying their match, and Nacional had scored their second goal. Everything was going their way and the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>left</b> to do was win the game against Millonarios.
