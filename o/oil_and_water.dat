5|$|Repco racing engines were {{designed}} by the leading motorcycle engine designer, Phil Irving, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in Maidstone, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a normally aspirated unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American engine blocks obtained from Oldsmobile's aluminium alloy 215 engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the F-85 Cutlass compact car between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by General Motors after production problems. Repco fitted their own cast iron cylinder liners into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco magnesium alloy castings and feature Repco-designed cylinder heads with chain-driven single overhead camshafts. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall crankshaft, Daimler or Chevrolet connecting rods and specially cast pistons. The cylinder head design means that the engine's exhaust pipes exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is water-cooled, with <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> radiators mounted in the nose.|$|E
5|$|The {{group of}} artists {{connected}} with Edinburgh, {{most of whom}} had studied at Edinburgh College of Art during or soon after the First World War, {{became known as the}} Edinburgh School. They were influenced by French painters and the St. Ives School and their art was characterised by use of vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and the use of bold technique above form. Members included William Gillies (1898–1973), who focused on landscapes and still life, John Maxwell (1905–62) who created both landscapes and studies of imaginative subjects, Adam Bruce Thomson (1885–1976) best known for his <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> colour landscape paintings, particularly of the Highlands and Edinburgh, William Crozier (1893–1930), whose landscapes were created with glowing colours, William Geissler (1894-1963), watercolourist of landscapes in Perthshire, East Lothian and Hampshire, William MacTaggart (1903–81), noted for his landscapes of East Lothian, France and Norway and Anne Redpath (1895–1965), best known for her two dimensional depictions of everyday objects.|$|E

25|$|Emulsifying agent (lecithin) used in {{mayonnaise}} {{are able}} to suspend oil droplets in water because it lowers the interfacial tension γ between <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> When emulsifying agent, lecithin, {{is added to the}} <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> emulsion, they form a layer between the two different liquids, with their hydrophobic tail point toward the non-polar oil droplet, and their hydrophilic end facing the polar water molecules. This reduces the interfacial tension γ because the water molecules are no longer in contact with hydrocarbon molecules. Hence, a large increase of surface area (ΔA) is made possible because energy cost to arrive at the food state is now favorable.|$|E
25|$|In {{cosmetic}} {{and skin}} care products, titanium dioxide {{is used as}} a pigment, sunscreen and a thickener. It is also used as a tattoo pigment and in styptic pencils.

25|$|Organofluorine {{chemistry}} {{describes the}} chemistry of the organofluorines, organic compounds that contain the carbon–fluorine bond. Organofluorine compounds find diverse applications ranging from <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> repellents to pharmaceuticals, refrigerants, and reagents in catalysis. In addition to these applications, some organofluorine compounds are pollutants because of their contributions to ozone depletion, global warming, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. The area of organofluorine chemistry often requires special techniques associated with the handling of fluorinating agents.|$|E

25|$|Egg {{emulsion}} sauces include mayonnaise, Hollandaise and Béarnaise. For hollandaise sauce, {{egg yolks}} and water, lemon juice or vinegar are emulsified. Unlike custard, the egg does not coagulate. An emulsion {{is a mixture}} of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Droplets of the butter become suspended in the water and lemon juice once emulsion occurs. While emulsions can be either stable or unstable, hollandaise is made stable by the addition of eggs which contain lecithin, combining with the <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> holding it together.|$|E
25|$|Steam Elephant is {{a replica}} of an {{original}} locomotive built in 1814/14, the existence of which was not known of in modern times until 1931. Originally {{thought to be a}} design by George Stephenson, through research by the museum it was later determined to have been designed by William Chapman' for use in John Buddle's Wallsend Colliery, before moving on to Washington and then Hetton collieries, with records of its service appearing to end in the 1840s. Working from a contemporaneous <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> colour paintings, which were also the source of the name, the museum designed and built the replica from 1999 to 2002.|$|E
25|$|According to the International Maritime Organisation {{oil spills}} can have serious effects on marine life. The OILPOL Convention {{recognized}} that most oil pollution resulted from routine shipboard operations {{such as the}} cleaning of cargo tanks. In the 1950s, the normal practice was simply to wash the tanks out with water and then pump the resulting mixture of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> into the sea. OILPOL 54 prohibited the dumping of oily wastes within a certain distance from land and in 'special areas' where the danger to the environment was especially acute. In 1962 the limits were extended {{by means of an}} amendment adopted at a conference organized by IMO. Meanwhile, IMO in 1965 set up a Subcommittee on Oil Pollution, under the auspices of its Maritime Safety committee, to address oil pollution issues.|$|E

25|$|The {{modified}} aircraft {{known as}} the Douglas World Cruiser (DWC), powered by a 420hp Liberty L-12 engine, also {{was the first major}} project at Douglas for Jack Northrop. Northrop designed the fuel system for the series. The conversion involved incorporating a total of six fuel tanks in wings and fuselage. For greater range, the total fuel capacity went from 115 gallons (435 liters) to 644 gallons (2,438 liters). Other changes from the DT involved having increased cooling capacity, as well as adding two separate tanks for <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> To ensure a more robust structure, a tubular steel fuselage, strengthened bracing, a modified wing of 49ft (15 m) wingspan and larger rudder were required. The dual cockpits for the pilot and copilot/crewman were also located more closely together with a cutout in the upper wing to increase visibility.|$|E
25|$|In 1816, François Magendie {{discovered}} that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive <b>oil),</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein {{as an essential}} dietary component. William Prout in 1827 {{was the first person}} to divide foods into carbohydrates, fat, and protein. During the 19th century, Jean-Baptiste Dumas and Justus von Liebig quarrelled over their shared belief that animals get their protein directly from plants (animal and plant protein are the same and that humans do not create organic compounds). With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology, Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value. In the 1860s, Claude Bernard {{discovered that}} body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood glucose can be stored as fat or as glycogen.|$|E
25|$|On 31 May 1958 Henry Blogg {{took part}} in an unusual rescue when she was called to aid the Sheringham {{lifeboat}} Forester's Centenary. This service began with a call at 9.50am to the Sheringham honorary secretary from the Trinity House Superintendent of Great Yarmouth requesting that a sick man {{be taken off the}} Dudgeon Light-vessel. At 10.15am the Sheringham lifeboat Forester's Centenary was launched with a doctor on board and she reached the light-vessel by 1.10pm. The doctor went aboard the light-vessel and dispensed a sedative to the sick man and he was then strapped to a stretcher and transferred to the Forester's Centenary. The lifeboat then set off on the return journey to her station. Nine miles north east from home at around 4.40pm the Forester's Centenary was in trouble when her skew gear which drives the lifeboat's <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> pumps broke down. Henry Blogg was called out and had to take the Sheringham lifeboat in to tow. Both boats arrived back at the Sheringham station at 7.00pm and the sick man was taken to hospital.|$|E

25|$|For {{industrial}} areas, {{fires and}} lighting were simulated. It {{was decided to}} recreate normal residential street lighting, and in non-essential areas, lighting to recreate heavy industrial targets. In those sites, carbon arc lamps were used to simulate the flash of tram cables. Red lamps were used to simulate blast furnaces and locomotive fireboxes. Reflections made by factory skylights were created by placing lights under angled wooden panels. The use of diversionary techniques such as fires {{had to be made}} carefully. The fake fires could only begin when the bombing started over an adjacent target and its effects were brought under control. Too early and the chances of success receded; too late and the real conflagration at the target would exceed the diversionary fires. Another innovation was the boiler fire. These units were fed from two adjacent tanks containing <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> The oil-fed fires were then injected with water from time to time; the flashes produced were {{similar to those of the}} German C-250 and C-500 Flammbomben. The hope was that, if it could deceive German bombardiers, it would draw more bombers away from the real target.|$|E
