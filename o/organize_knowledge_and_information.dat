25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} {{is the assumption}} that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that <b>organize</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> guide <b>information</b> processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|R

40|$|Integrated {{environmental}} modeling (IEM) {{is inspired}} by modern environmental problems, decisions, and policies and enabled by transdisciplinary science and computer capabilities that allow the environment {{to be considered in}} a holistic way. The problems are characterized by the extent of the environmental system involved, dynamic and interdependent nature of stressors and their impacts, diversity of stakeholders, and integration of social, economic, and environmental considerations. IEM provides a science-based structure to develop <b>and</b> <b>organize</b> relevant <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> apply it to explain, explore, and predict the behavior of environmental systems in response to human and natural sources of stress. During the past several years a number of workshops were held that brought IEM practitioners together to share experiences and discuss future needs and directions. In this paper we organize and present the results of these discussions. IEM is presented as a landscape containing four interdependent elements: applications, science, technology, and community. The elements are described from the perspective of their role in the landscape, current practices, and challenges that must be addressed. Workshop participants envision a global scale IEM community that leverages modern technologies to streamline the movement of science-based knowledge from its sources in research, through its organization into databases and models, to its integration and application for problem solving purposes. Achieving this vision will require that the global community of IEM stakeholders transcend social, and organizational boundaries and pursue greater levels of collaboration. Among the highest priorities for community action are the development of standards for publishing IEM data and models in forms suitable for automated discovery, access, and integration; education of the next generation of environmental stakeholders, with a focus on transdisciplinary research, development, and decision making; and providing a web-based platform for community interactions (e. g., continuous virtual workshops). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{realities of}} the present era of {{globalization}} <b>and</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> communication technologies (ICT) culminating in the African Virtual Library <b>and</b> <b>Information</b> Network (AVLIN) have made it expedient that African information professionals {{should be able to}} develop, showcase and make accessible African indigenous information to the knowledge world. This literature-based opinion paper has tried to identify with the view of the conference organizers that “Major digital initiatives involving African content are currently being undertaken by non-African organization without widely accepted protocols and agreement”. The paper argues that there is a serious need for a theoretical and policy framework necessary to provide a basis for systematic training of library <b>and</b> <b>information</b> science professionals to place African knowledge on a pedestal that will make it accessible to the world of knowledge. It was found that the library schools in most African universities are ill-equipped to train professionals to handle information in the new digital era. This is exacerbated by the fact that professional associations are not doing enough to retool the existing workforce for the task ahead. The paper recommends, among other things, that much emphasis should be placed on the training of cataloguers and indexers in African research institutions and universities to be able to <b>organize</b> African <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> produce <b>information</b> surrogates that will help researchers locate them on the internet...|$|R
40|$|With {{the high}} speed {{networking}} capabilities, multiple media options, and {{massive amounts of}} information that exist in electronic format today, {{the concept of a}} 'virtual' library or 'library without walls' is becoming viable. In virtual library environment, the information processed goes beyond the traditional definition of documents to include the results of scientific and technical research and development (reports, software, data) recorded in any format or media: electronic, audio, video, or scanned images. Network access to information must include tools to help locate <b>information</b> sources <b>and</b> navigate the networks to connect to the sources, as well as methods to extract the relevant information. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI's) that are intuitive and navigational tools such as Intelligent Gateway Processors (IGP) will provide users with seamless and transparent use of high speed networks to access, organize, <b>and</b> manage <b>information.</b> Traditional libraries will become points of electronic access to information on multiple medias. The emphasis will be towards unique collections of information at each library rather than entire collections at every library. It is no longer a question of whether there is enough information available; it is more a question of how to manage the vast volumes of information. The future equation will involve being able to <b>organize</b> <b>knowledge,</b> manage <b>information,</b> <b>and</b> provide access at the point of origin...|$|R
40|$|Abnormal Situation Management (ASM) {{involves}} the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal process conditions. Industrial statistics estimate {{the economic impact}} due to abnormal situations to be about 20 billion/year in the U. S. petrochemical industries alone. Process fault diagnosis, which forms {{the first step in}} ASM, deals with detection and analysis of the root causes of abnormal behaviors. Although modern control systems achieve a high degree of automation, the process operator still has the overall responsibility for the safe and economic operation of the process, including process fault diagnosis. Diagnostic problem solving forms a major part of an operator 2 ̆ 7 s activities in complex chemical processes. It cannot be overemphasized that training operators on fault diagnosis and ASM will help minimize process upsets, and thereby improve the reliability and safety of the plant. However, current practices in operator training for ASM, in general, are quite inadequate in a number of aspects, thus necessitating the development for more effective alternative approaches. ^ Towards that goal, a novel Process Operator Intelligent Training System (POINTS) framework has been presented in this thesis. This intelligent tutoring environment is composed of an interactive, dynamic simulation of a chemical process plant, a computer model of expert operators, an intelligent computer-based tutor and trainee model that allow for automatic evaluation and coaching of the trainees in order to improve their diagnostic skills, and suitable graphical user interfaces. Causal models of the process are represented as diagraph models. To make the training system more effective, the process-related information/explanations including digraph-based symptom-cause relationships are supplied through intelligent hypermedia interface. It helps operators to <b>organize</b> system <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> operational <b>information</b> including causal relationships. ^ Specific training applications were developed for a CSTR case study and the AMOCO Model IV FCCU plant. These establish the feasibility of implementing integrated intelligent training programs as POINTS applications. This demonstrates the possibility of using general-purpose toolkit modules to design and configure flexible systems which are relatively easy to use and support. Possibilities of using this system as an on-line assistant of process operators and for the training of remedial actions are also discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess access to and use of {{agricultural}} <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> in the rural areas of Tanzania. Design/methodology/approach – Mixed quantitative, qualitative and participatory methods were deployed. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative and quantitative data from 181 farmers in six districts of Tanzania. Focus groups and participatory techniques (i. e. <b>information</b> mapping <b>and</b> linkage diagrams) were also used to collect qualitative data from 128 farmers in the same districts. Findings – The results showed that deep, rich and complete data can be collected through the mixed quantitative, qualitative and participatory techniques. The findings demonstrated that the <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> needs, <b>and</b> <b>information</b> seeking patterns of farmers were location specific. The major sources of information for farmers were predominantly local (neighbours, friends and family), followed by public extension services. Apart from radio and cell phones, advanced technologies (i. e. internet and email) and printed materials were used at a low rate despite their existence in the communities. Research limitations/implications - The study necessitates a need to conduct regular studies on information needs, map communities’ <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> sources, create awareness of <b>information</b> sources, <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> culture, use participatory methods in design and development of technologies, and use multiple sources of <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> (such as print and technologies) to deliver relevant information to farmers. Originality/value – Provides a deep understanding of access to and use of agricultural <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> in the rural areas, which necessitates a need for demand led <b>and</b> client based <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> services in order to meet the disparate farmers’ needs.
