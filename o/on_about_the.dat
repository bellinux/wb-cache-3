5|$|Spiny {{scallops}} are dioecious, individuals being either male or female. They become mature {{at about}} 2 {{years old and}} usually live for about 4 years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} summer. Gametes are released into the water column and fertilisation is external. Veliger larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days, growing to a maximum valve length of 240μ (0.01 inch). The larvae have a tuft of broad, compound cilia near the mouth. The velum, the locomotory and feeding organ, has bands of cilia running down it. The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 25th day. The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the propodium (the projecting front end of the foot) develops <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 28th. By the 34rd day, the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia. Metamorphosis takes place <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 40th day. Over the course of 48 hours, the internal organs undergo a 90° rotation, the valves, hinge and ligament appear and the gills lengthen. A swimming veliger larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop.|$|E
5|$|Complications of {{smallpox}} arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia. Respiratory complications tend to develop <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> eighth {{day of the}} illness and can be either viral or bacterial in origin. Secondary bacterial infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication {{of smallpox}}. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the only}} other {{scenario}} writer on the project was Yūto Tonokawa of Key, who previously contributed on Key's sixth game Little Busters!. Tanaka was tasked with drawing up the entire scenario framework, and during this time, Takahiro Baba suggested that one more heroine route {{be added to the}} story to bring the total to six, but to do that they had to hire another writer. Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion, the creators of the Higurashi no Naku Koro ni and Umineko no Naku Koro ni game franchises, was brought in as the third scenario writer after Baba suggested in late 2007 that Key ask him to join the staff for Rewrite. Ultimately, Tanaka wrote the story leading up to the heroine's routes, Kotori's and Akane's scanarios, the Moon and Terra routes, and the bonus Oppai route. Tonokawa wrote Chihaya's and Sizuru's routes, and Ryukishi07 wrote Lucia's story. Tanaka initially planned on the length of Rewrites story to be <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> same scale as Key's second game Air, but as it increased in size, he later attempted to keep it close to the scale of Little Busters!.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{few things}} that both the Greco-Roman and the vernacular Irish sources agree <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> druids is that they played an {{important}} part in pagan Celtic society. In his description, Julius Caesar claimed that they were one of the two most important social groups in the region (alongside the equites, or nobles) and were responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure in Gaulish, British and Irish society. He also claimed that they were exempt from military service and from the payment of taxes, and had the power to excommunicate people from religious festivals, making them social outcasts. Two other classical writers, Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, also wrote about the role of druids in Gallic society, claiming that the druids were held in such respect that if they intervened between two armies they could stop the battle.|$|E
500|$|Copsey {{stated that}} [...] "Tyndall {{may have been}} a rousing speaker, but his {{tactical}} intelligence and vision left much to be desired". The East London BNP activist Eddy Butler noted that at a 1986 party rally in Dewsbury, Tyndall [...] "lost them completely. He knew how to talk to a small room of nationalists, but he didn't know how to talk to a thousand Yorkshire young geezers. He hadn't got a clue about normal people or normal politics.

[...] They already knew the ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter what you have to do to the story, do it.

500|$|Edward {{was rarely}} {{interested}} in politics, although {{his views on}} some issues were notably liberal for the time. During his reign he said {{use of the word}} nigger was [...] "disgraceful" [...] despite it then being in common parlance. In 1904, during an Anglo-German summit in Kiel between Wilhelm II and Edward, Wilhelm with the Russo-Japanese War in mind started to go <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Yellow Peril", which he called [...] "the greatest peril menacing... Christendom and European civilisation. If the Russians went on giving ground, the yellow race would, in twenty years time, be in Moscow and Posen". Wilhelm went on to attack his British guests for supporting Japan against Russia, suggesting that the British were committing [...] "race treason". In response, Edward stated that he [...] "could not see it. The Japanese were an intelligent, brave and chivalrous nation, quite as civilised as the Europeans, from whom they only differed by the pigmentation of their skin".|$|E
500|$|Michael Rosen, {{a novelist}} and poet, {{advocated}} {{the books were}} not suited for children, who {{would be unable to}} grasp the complex themes. Rosen also stated that [...] "J. K. Rowling is more of an adult writer." [...] The critic Anthony Holden wrote in The Observer on his experience of judging Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban for the 1999 Whitbread Awards. His overall view of the series was negative – [...] "the Potter saga was essentially patronising, conservative, highly derivative, dispiritingly nostalgic for a bygone Britain", and he speaks of [...] "a pedestrian, ungrammatical prose style". Ursula K. Le Guin said, [...] "I have no great opinion of it. When so many adult critics were carrying <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> 'incredible originality' of the first Harry Potter book, I read it {{to find out what the}} fuss was about, and remained somewhat puzzled; it seemed a lively kid's fantasy crossed with a [...] "school novel", good fare for its age group, but stylistically ordinary, imaginatively derivative, and ethically rather mean-spirited." ...|$|E
500|$|Later in 1993, McKellen {{appeared}} in the television film And the Band Played <b>On,</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> discovery of the AIDS virus, for which McKellen won a CableACE Award for Supporting Actor in a Movie or Miniseries and was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie. In 1995, he played the title role in Richard III, which transported the setting into an alternative 1930s in which England is ruled by fascists. The film was a critical success. McKellen co-produced and co-wrote the film, adapting the play for the screen based on a stage production of Shakespeare's play directed by Richard Eyre for the Royal National Theatre, in which McKellen had appeared. As executive producer he returned his £50,000 fee to complete the filming of the final battle. In his review of the film, Washington Post film critic Hal Hinson, called McKellen's performance a [...] "lethally flamboyant incarnation", and said his [...] "florid mastery ... dominates everything". His performance {{in the title role}} garnered BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor, and won the European Film Award for Best Actor. His screenplay was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.|$|E

500|$|Feminist scholar Maria Lauret {{states that}} the {{formation}} of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as [...] "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to [...] "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou begins this technique in her first book, and continues it in Gather Together, especially her demonstration of the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. [...] Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with {{what it means to}} be Black and female in America, but she now describes [...] "a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and [...] "tell the truth as a writer". [...] Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem [...] "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird, because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where [...] "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs... The children need to know you can stumble and fumble and fall, see where you are and get up, forgive yourself, and go <b>on</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> business of living your life".|$|E

30|$|First, authors with {{addresses}} in Norway {{were never}} listed <b>on</b> papers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between MSTN and athletic performance (Table  4). Consequently, they were disproportionately found listed <b>on</b> papers <b>about</b> MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  4). However, {{the sample size}} of authors with addresses in Norway was small (n[*]=[*] 10). Second, authors with addresses in the United Kingdom were equally likely as those with addresses in the USA to be found <b>on</b> papers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between DR and athletic performance (Table  6). However, probably because of small sample sizes, {{the difference was not}} statistically significant (Table  6). Third, authors that listed addresses in Germany were never found <b>on</b> papers <b>about</b> MSTN independent of athletic performance (Table  3). As a consequence, authors with addresses in Germany were less likely than authors with USA addresses to be found <b>on</b> papers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between MSTN and athletic performance (Table  5). This was the only instance of authors with USA addresses having a significantly greater proportional representation <b>on</b> papers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between an innate factor and athletic performance. Last, authors with Japanese addresses were about twice as likely to be found <b>on</b> papers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> innate factors independent of athletic performance than <b>on</b> papers <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the innate factors and athletic performance (Table  4). Nevertheless, authors with Japanese addresses were more likely than those with USA addresses to be found on the pooled sample of papers that examined the relationship between the innate factors and athletic performance (Table  6). Taken together, these patterns suggest that authors based in these countries were more likely than authors with USA addresses to publish papers that examined questions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> roles of these innate factors in athletic performance.|$|R
