50|$|Inhibition {{of return}} (IOR) {{refers to an}} <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that briefly enhances (for {{approximately}} 100-300 milliseconds (ms)) the speed and accuracy with which an object is detected after the object is attended, but then impairs detection speed and accuracy (for approximately 500-3000 milliseconds). IOR is usually measured with a cue-response paradigm, {{in which a person}} presses a button when he or she detects a target stimulus following the presentation of a cue that indicates the location in which the target will appear. The cue can be exogenous (or peripheral), or endogenous. Inhibition of return results from oculomotor activation, regardless of whether it was produced by exogenous signals or endougenously. Although IOR occurs for both visual and auditory stimuli, IOR is greater for visual stimuli, and is studied more often than auditory stimuli.|$|E

Inhibition of return is an <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism</b> which refers to the “relative suppression of stimuli that had recently been the focus of attention”.10 An eccentricity effect can also bee seen in IOR i.e. there is a stronger IOR effect in the periphery, and Bao et al wanted to see if cortical magnification was responsible for this. They tested their participants with different sized stimulus at two peripheral locations (scaling for the size of the location) to account for cortical magnification. Their results indicated that scaling of the stimulus size did not change the eccentricity effect of IOR and therefore cortical magnification is not responsible for this.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStimuli {{moving in}} {{slightly}} different directions trace trajectories that differ slightly in orientation. These different ‘speed lines’, in principle, could generate responses in <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and such responses could determine {{how well we}} judge subtle direction differences. Alternatively, the ability to judge subtle direction differences could be determined by direction mechanisms rather than by <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> To distinguish between these possibilities we exploited the fact that opposite directions of motion share an orientation: Across trials, participants judged a constant orientation difference between trajectories having either the same or opposite motion signs. The probabilities of the motion signs were also manipulated.

40|$|Background—To date, the {{surgical}} {{approach is the}} only option to replace the aortic valve. Percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement has recently opened new perspectives on transcatheter replacement of cardiac valves. We report our experience of aortic valve replacement through a percutaneous technique in lambs. Methods and Results—A bovine jugular vein containing a valve was dissected and sutured into a stent. Twelve lambs were divided into 3 groups. In the first, a valved stent was implanted in the descending aorta after creation of an aortic insufficiency. In the second, the valve was implanted in the native position. In the third, we inserted a valved stent in the native position using an <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> All valves were successfully delivered and functioned perfectly in short-term evaluation. All experiments in group 2 failed: 1 valve obstructed the coronary artery orifices, 1 stent was responsible for a major mitral valve insufficiency, and the third implant migrated prematurely. A paraprosthetic leak occurred in the last animal in this group. Animals in group 3 had successful implantation of the valved stent. The <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism</b> allowed perfect alignment of the device without any damage to the coronary circulation or to mitral valve function. Conclusions—Nonsurgical implantation of an aortic valve is possible in lambs in the descending aorta and in the native position. An <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism</b> is obviously needed to avoid obstruction of the coronary orifices. With further improvements, this technique should be feasible in humans.

40|$|Locusts are {{long-range}} migratory insects. At high population density, immature animals form marching hopper bands while adults {{take off}} and form huge swarms of millions of animals. At low population densities animals are solitarious, but likewise migrate, mostly during the night.

The electrooptical properties of this enzyme in solution were studied as functions of pH, protein concentration, and applied electric field. The F 1 -ATPase exhibits a surprising negative electric birefringence with a specific Kerr constant of - 1. 5 X 10 (- 3) esu cgs. The field-independent relaxation time {{was found to be}} 0. 65 +/- 0. 05 microseconds, corresponding to a rotational diffusion constant of 2. 55 X 10 (5) s- 1. The overall size and shape of F 1 -ATPase have been calculated from both translational and rotational diffusion constants. The enzyme may be assumed to be an oblate ellipsoid of revolution with dimensions of about 170 X 170 X 70 A. The <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism</b> of F 1 -ATPase was analyzed by fitting experimental birefringence rising curves with theoretical rising functions. The ratio of the permanent to induced dipole moment is found to be very high; therefore, the birefringence of F 1 -ATPase is due to a strong permanent dipole moment in a direction perpendicular to the long axes of the particle.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} the orientation distribution function for rigid particles of arbitrary shape is formulated in a general stochastic approach to consider the influence of any acting <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism,</b> stochastic or deterministic. The effect of the various orientation mechanisms on the partial differential equation of the problem, an equation of the Fokker-Planck type, is analyzed. The question of linearity or non-linearity of the superposition of the effects due to different orientation mechanisms is examined. The orientation of rigid ellipsoidal particles in uniform shear flow is studied in detail, for different cases of acting orientation mechanisms. When only the viscous stresses act on the particles, {{the problem for the}} orientation distribution function becomes a deterministic first-order initial value problem, and its solution displays periodic behavior. In the case of macromolecules, when the Brownian influence is predominant, we examine the effect of a third <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism</b> acting on the macromolecules in addition to the viscous stresses and the Brownian impulses. In Couette flow between concentric cylinders, the third <b>orientation</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is considered to be a}} deterministic force field in the radial direction x, varying linearly with x. The steady state orientation distribution function is then determined to the third order, and the theory of streaming birefringence of a dilute suspension of rigid ellipsoidal macromolecules in Couette flow is generalized to include the effect of the additional influence. The direction of the isocline and the amount of birefringence are calculated to the second order. When spherical macromolecules are added to the suspension in increasing concentration, the effect of hydrodynamic interactions between the two species on the orientation of the ellipsoidal particles is examined in Couette flow. It is shown that an effect of the presence of the spheres is to decrease the drift velocity of the ellipsoids [...] and thus decrease the amount of birefringence [...] and that the effect can be described as a decrease in the effective velocity gradient. The theoretical result for this decrease is in good agreement with experimental results for sphere concentrations comparable to the concentration of ellipsoids. On the other hand, as the concentration of spheres increases, the effect of their presence on the rotational diffusion constant of the asymmetrical particles can be large enough to reverse the trend and lead to a positive variation of the amount of birefringence with sphere concentration...|$|E

We show that beyond 35 % in weight, montmorillonite is responsible for the global behaviour of the mixture. At the global level, the influence of montmorillonite becomes apparent through the fact that one-dimensional compressibility path, in the (log sigma(v) -e) plane, loses its linearity. At the local level, MIP results show that the compressibility, for any of the studied mixtures, results in variations in inter-aggregate porosity. The qualitative analysis of SEM images explains the macroscopic behaviour, showing that the more flexible particles of montmorillonite form a structured network surrounding the kaolinite particles.
