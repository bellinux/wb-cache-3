5|$|The {{characters}} in the novel are integral to its understanding. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> highlight the temporal and political context of voodoo and other forces, but they also allow Carpentier to surpass temporal and spatial limitations to reach the ultimate reality of life: the universal essence that lies in every human being.|$|E
5|$|Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> affect injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} {{are particularly}} harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, {{particularly if the}} injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{present a}} very {{challenging}} environment for animals. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> require {{food and water}} but {{they also need to}} keep their body temperature at a tolerable level. In many ways birds are the most able to do this of the higher animals. They can move to areas of greater food availability as the desert blooms after local rainfall and can fly to faraway waterholes. In hot deserts, gliding birds can remove themselves from the over-heated desert floor by using thermals to soar in the cooler air at great heights. In order to conserve energy, other desert birds run rather than fly. The cream-colored courser flits gracefully across the ground on its long legs, stopping periodically to snatch up insects. Like other desert birds it is well-camouflaged by its coloring and can merge into the landscape when stationary. The sandgrouse is an expert at this and nests on the open desert floor dozens of kilometers (miles) away from the waterhole it needs to visit daily. Some small diurnal birds are found in very restricted localities where their plumage matches the color of the underlying surface. The desert lark takes frequent dust baths which ensures that it matches its environment.|$|E

"Concisely then, my lord," [...] {{said the}} Major, [...] "not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> disdain to profit by a {{handsome}} reward which Argyle did me the honour to place upon this poor head of mine, and not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> abstain from pillaging my personal property, whilk was to an amount {{that would have}} tempted regular soldiers in any service of Europe; and not <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> restore me my horse, whilk your Excellency knows to be of value, but I could not prevail on them to accept one stiver, doit, or maravedi, for the trouble and expenses of my sick bed. They actually refused my coined money when freely offered,--a tale seldom to be told in a Christian land." ...|$|R

Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> act as observers, or in an interpositional role, but they also participate in more multidimensional tasks—such as electoral supervision, police and security forces reform, institution building, economic development and more. Examples include UNTAG in Namibia, ONUSAL in El Salvador, and ONUMOZ in Mozambique.|$|E
25|$|The Syrian {{cultural}} caravan {{reaches out}} to very different artists to create this multi-format exhibition. It brings together painters, photographers, as well as actors, film-makers, writers, poets, and musicians. The artists are very versatile: not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> create, {{but they are the}} technical staff of the exhibition and set up the exhibition themselves. They also manage the contact with the media and are present during the whole day of the exhibition to explain and answer the public’s questions.|$|E

25|$|Barbiturates in {{overdose}} {{with other}} CNS (central nervous system) depressants (e.g. alcohol, opiates, benzodiazepines) {{are even more}} dangerous due to additive CNS and respiratory depressant effects. In the case of benzodiazepines, not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> have additive effects, barbiturates also increase the binding affinity of the benzodiazepine binding site, leading to exaggerated benzodiazepine effects. (ex. If a benzodiazepine increases the frequency of channel opening by 300%, and a barbiturate increases the duration of their opening by 300%, then the combined effects of the drugs increase the channels overall function by 900%, not 600%).|$|E
25|$|Other {{species of}} {{jellyfish}} {{are among the}} most common and important jellyfish predators, some of which specialize in jellies. Sea anemones may eat jellyfish that drift into their range. Other predators include tunas, sharks, swordfish, sea turtles, penguins, and at least one species of Pacific salmon. In general however, there are few predators preying on jellyfish and they can be considered top predators in the food chain. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> eat fish eggs and juvenile fish, but they also compete for food resources, leading to jellyfish having a difficult-to-reverse dominant position in the ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> {{thrive in}} urban areas, red {{imported}} fire ants can damage {{equipment and infrastructure}} and impact business, land, and property values. They are also attracted to electricity; electrically stimulated workers release venom alkaloids, alarm pheromones, and recruitment pheromones, which in return attracts more workers to the site. As a result, red imported fire ants can destroy electrical equipment. This is known as magnetism, where scientists have identified internal magnetic materials which {{may play a role}} in orientation behaviours. They are known to chew through electrical insulation which causes damage to electric motors, irrigation lines, pumps, signal boxes, transformers, telephone exchanges, and other equipment. Colonies aggregate near electrical fields and are capable of causing short circuits or interfering with switches and equipment such as air conditioners, computers, and water pumps. They are also known to infest airport landing areas and traffic lights.|$|E

25|$|The map to {{the right}} shows the 2000 U.S. Census {{representation}} {{of the percentage of}} Spanish-speaking people in the United States by county. It clearly illustrates that the majority of Spanish speakers are in the Southwestern region of the country. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> speak Spanish, but their English language skills are less than adequate. Many of those states were acquired by the United States from Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo over 160 years ago. Despite constant pressure for Mexican Americans to learn English by advocates of the English-only movement, the map shows that many Mexican Americans along the border are still not fluent in English. The map exemplifies this separation of cultures and lack of Mexican American acculturation to the U.S. by the contrast from dark blue to white or lighter shades. Though the physical border encompasses all citizens of the United States, the cultural border is very divisive.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{psychological}} injuries {{may include}} depression, anxiety disorders (including post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS)), multiple somatic symptoms, flashbacks, on-going trauma, chronic insomnia, self-hate, nightmares, paranoia, difficulty re-establishing intimate relationships, shame, disgust, anger, and persistent fears. They could have trouble sleeping, experience {{changes in their}} appetite, or develop full-blown emotional problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, substance abuse, or dependence. Individuals who have experienced sexual assault {{are at risk for}} other day-to-day problems, including arguing with family members and having problems at work. Lack of medical psychological support resources also puts victims of war rape at further disadvantage. Refugee women are also at a disadvantage of receiving adequate assistance to deal with the psychological consequences of war rape - not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> lack legal representation, they also may lack protection from the perpetrators of the violent act. Furthermore, there is an increase in dislike of refugees and asylum seekers which is another obstacle in the psychological healing process of victims seeking assistance outside of their countries that may still be under civil strife. Psychological support and counseling sessions given by individuals not part of the ethnic, linguistic, and/or community may incite difficulties in communication between patient and care giver. As a result, adequate emotional and psychological support to the victims is not fully developed, affecting the long-term healing potential for the patient.|$|E

So you are kind of trying to teach us something else." [...] Many European fans saw the split as an attempt to increase profits by forcing audiences to pay twice for what was shown as a single film in the United States.|$|E

500|$|One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the Rights of Woman {{is against}} false and {{excessive}} sensibility, particularly in women. She argues {{that women who}} succumb to sensibility are [...] "blown about by every momentary gust of feeling"; because these women are [...] "the prey of their senses", they cannot think rationally. In fact, not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> do harm to themselves but they also do harm to all of civilization: these are not women who can refine civilization – these are women who will destroy it. But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other. For Wollstonecraft, as for the important 18th-century philosopher David Hume, the passions underpin all reason. This was a theme that she would return to throughout her career, but particularly in her novels [...] (1788) and [...]|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club graded the episode with a B-, explaining that [...] "after four solid weeks of good-to-great episodes, Fringe delivered its first semi-dud of season three" [...] because the case-of-the-week was [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "twistless", and the dialogue was [...] "too flat and too earnest". Despite this, Murray thought the episode was [...] "essential viewing" [...] for Fringe fans due to certain revelations, {{such as how}} people are actually alive in the amber, and also because it moved the plot closer to an Olivia-Altlivia confrontation. Conversely, the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson {{thought it was a}} good episode, writing [...] "This is what I love about Fringe. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> have the cool science, they also have the moral questions that go along". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly thought the episode was [...] "enthralling," [...] and he enjoyed the brothers' [...] "nice emotional story," [...] and praised Anna Torv's acting. TV Squad reviewer Jason Hughes enjoyed the parallel universe, and in particular the character of Lincoln Lee, believing he was [...] "too rich a character to just abandon" [...] once the series stopped alternating between universes.|$|E
500|$|Seattle Weeklys Joe Williams {{enjoyed the}} song, writing [...] "even with the slow, {{bubbling}} beat and energetic keyboards, topped with top-notch delivery by Jay and Kay, it's Redding {{in the background}} that gives the single its true life and flair." [...] Josiah Hughes of Exclaim! magazine commented that [...] "if the over-the-top aggression of [...] "H•A•M" [...] had you worried {{that this would be}} a Waka Flocka ripoff, fear not, as [...] "Otis" [...] makes the most of its Otis Redding sample with some soulful feel-good boom-bap." [...] Sam Gould The Independent remarked [...] "having seen oddball rap collective Odd Future become the talking point of the blogosphere, Eminem and old partner-in-crime Royce da 5'9" [...] start work on their own bruising , and hazy vibe rappers Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y take steps in the same direction, Jay and Ye have recognised the throne is far from unchallenged, and have come together in the most remarkable dual alliance since André 3000 and Big Boi became Outkast." [...] The New York Observer writer Foster Kamer mused, [...] "remember early Kanye? These guys finally do. 'Otis' is the perfect anti-single for this album, because it's a reminder that what we always loved about these two collaborating is still very much there. Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> not need hooks, neither of them need to remind us that they don't. There was that first line of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, 'I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago,' and then, the relief after it, where you didn't have to worry about the rest of that album", and Billboard claimed [...] "Otis gets better with each play".|$|E

There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season.

Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces.
