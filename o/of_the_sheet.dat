5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheet</b> consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. The ripples are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{aging and}} {{protection}} are of crucial interest for improving <b>the</b> preservations <b>of</b> library collections and archives. Highly aging-resistant cellulose fiber sheets {{were obtained by}} treatment with magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles (Mg(OH) 2). The procedure was tested on <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> made <b>of</b> bleached (B) and refined unbleached (UB) pine cellulose fibers {{as well as their}} 50 %/ 50 % mixture (M). The morphological and structural properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> obtained <b>sheets</b> were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) methods. Stress-strain, smoothness and pH measurements were employed to determine the changes in physical-chemical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> after mixing two types <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fibers and subsequent treatment with Mg(OH) 2. It has been shown that <b>the</b> <b>sheets</b> made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fiber mixture show higher tensile index and smoothness.

40|$|International audienceIn ophiolites and {{in present-day}} oceanic crust formed at fast {{spreading}} ridges, oceanic plagiogranites are commonly observed at, {{or close to}} <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheeted</b> dike complex. They can be produced either by differentiation of mafic melts, or by hydrous partial melting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrothermally altered <b>sheeted</b> dikes. In addition, the hydrothermally altered base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheeted</b> dike complex, which is often infiltrated by plagiogranitic veins, is usually recrystallized into granoblastic dikes that are commonly interpreted {{as a result of}} prograde granulitic metamorphism. To test <b>the</b> anatectic origin <b>of</b> oceanic plagiogranites, we performed melting experiments on a natural hydrothermally altered dike, under conditions that match those prevailing at <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheeted</b> dike complex. All generated melts are water saturated, transitional between tholeiitic and calc-alkaline, and match <b>the</b> compositions <b>of</b> oceanic plagiogranites observed close to <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheeted</b> dike complex. Newly crystallized clinopyroxene and plagioclase have compositions that are characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same minerals in granoblastic dikes. Published silicic melt compositions obtained in classical MORB fractionation experiments also broadly match <b>the</b> compositions <b>of</b> oceanic plagiogranites; however, <b>the</b> compositions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coexisting experimental minerals significantly deviate from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> granoblastic dikes. Our results demonstrate that hydrous partial melting is a likely common process in <b>the</b> root zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheeted</b> dike complex, starting at temperatures exceeding 850 A degrees C. The newly formed melt can either crystallize to form oceanic plagiogranites or may be recycled within the melt lens resulting in hybridized and contaminated MORB melts. It represents the main MORB crustal contamination process. The residue after the partial melting event is represented by the granoblastic dikes. Our results support a model with a dynamic melt lens that has the potential to trigger hydrous partial melting reactions in the previously hydrothermally altered sheeted dikes.
