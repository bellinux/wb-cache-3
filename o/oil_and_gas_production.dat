The Chevron Corporation expected the number of people working in the Gulf to reduce from 1,700on September16 to 450the next day. Gordon also forced the cruise liner Carnival Sensation, consisting of 2,200passengers and 900crew members, to remain at sea for one day.

5|$|There {{are large}} {{deposits}} of petroleum (as {{oil and natural}} gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>production</b> can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E
5|$|Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence {{coordinated the}} country's {{preparations}} for Phet, utilizing a national disaster plan that organized the various ministries, and providing early warnings. Storm warnings were broadcast in seven languages, {{a response to}} there being only English and Arabic warnings during Cyclone Gonu, which struck Oman in 2007. Residents were advised to remain away from the rough seas during the storm. Businesses and schools were shut down in the areas the storm affected, with schools operating as emergency shelters near Muscat. About 85% of the isolated Masirah Island was evacuated; the passage of Phet and subsequent storms affecting the Arabian Peninsula influenced the Omani government's decision to build a fixed link with the island 40km (25mi) offshore. Nationwide, 12,870people evacuated, utilizing 91 government-opened shelters. Omani officials shut down the country's <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>production</b> facilities during the storm.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe use a price-based {{methodology}} {{to assess}} the global energy-return-on-investment (EROI) of coal, <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> gas,fromthe beginning of their reported production (respectively 1800, 1860, and 1890) to 2012. It appears that theEROI of global <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>productions</b> reached their maximumvalues in the 1930 s– 40 s, respectively around 50 : 1 and 150 : 1, and have declined subsequently. Furthermore, we suggest that the EROI of global coal production hasnot yet reached its maximumvalue. Based on the originalwork of Dale et al.

Modifications of the originalmodelwere {{needed in order to}} performcalibrationson each of our price-based historical estimates of coal, <b>oil,</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> global EROI. Theoretical modelsreplicate the fact that maximum EROIs of global <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>productions</b> have both already been reached whilethis is not the case for coal. In a prospective exercise, the models show the pace of the expected EROIs decreasefor <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> in the coming century.
