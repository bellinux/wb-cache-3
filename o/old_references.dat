30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  3, the ELCD scores worst on the TiR category, {{specifically}} for the chosen dataset.

Those available in Ecoinvent refer to the same timescale, but the declared year of reference (i.e. the time slot referred to) of the dataset is closer to the reference years considered (i.e. the time reference of the data collection), which makes the TiR more consistent even if slightly outdated. As regards the M criterion, the better score of Ecoinvent also highlights the need to improve the end-of-life analysis for background processes and sub processes.|$|E

Experimental: So to get this information, we use semi-structured interviews. This research was conducted in the summer and spring of 2016. During this period around 150 individuals (75 men, 75 women; in an age group between 20 and 95 years) were interviewed in 6 villages. Number of questions in this survey was 15 questions. Ethno botanical data were analyzed by use-reports. In addition important indices like Informant Agreement Ratio (IAR), Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC) and Cultural Importance (CI) were calculated. Furthermore, a traditional null hypothesis testing was adopted. These are the most popular indices in quantitative ethno botany.

40|$|Applicability of Rydberg atoms to quantum {{computers}} {{is examined}} from experimental point of view. In many theoretical proposals appeared recently, excitation of atoms into highly excited Rydberg states was {{considered as a}} way to achieve quantum entanglement in cold atomic ensembles via dipole-dipole interaction that could be strong for Rydberg atoms. Appropriate conditions to realize a conditional quantum phase gate have been analyzed. We also present the results of modeling experiments on microwave spectroscopy of single- and multi-atom excitations at the one-photon 37 S- 37 P and two-photon 37 S- 38 S transitions in an ensemble of a few sodium Rydberg atoms. The microwave spectra were investigated for various final states of the ensemble initially prepared in its ground state. The quantum NOT operation with single atoms was found to be affected by the Doppler effect and fluctuations of the microwave field. The spectrum of full excitation of several Rydberg atoms was much narrower than that of a single atom. This effect might be useful for the high-resolution spectroscopy. The results may be also applied to the studies on collective laser excitation of ground-state atoms aiming to realize quantum gates.

40|$|The genus Alnus has {{two species}} in <b>old</b> <b>references</b> of the flora of Iran {{in which two}} {{varieties}} and one subspecies have been recorded. However, recently, five new taxa have been described and recorded for the flora of Iran. In this study, the herbarium samples were obtained during a widespread sampling from 25 stands, ranged from the most eastern limit of alder dispersion in Golestan {{to the west of}} Talish, across the plains and highlands of Hyrcanian forests. After sampling, 28 leaf and female cone morphological traits belonging to 140 alder individuals were measured and analyzed. The results of discriminant analysis showed 11 most important traits in differentiation of the taxa such as leaf angle in apex, blade shape at the base, type of serration, villosity intensity, presence of hairs on the upper surface of leaf and cone shape. In this analysis, 84. 3 % of recognized individuals were correctly grouped in the related taxon. The maximum disagreement between predicted and recognized groups corresponded to allocation of A. subcordata varieties to villosa and visc versa. Generally, the morphological traits of the two new species including A. dolichocarpa and A. djavanshirii were very similar to that of A. subcordata var. subcordata. While, three sub-species of A. glutinosa were distinguished by the same traits. Finally, the use of DNA barcoding techniques is suggested in order to verify the presence of new taxa in Iran...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} the scientific journals asked by users, {{not available in}} Spanish libraries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed article applications processed during the years 2012 and 2013 (a period of important budget cuts in many libraries) by the interlending services of four hospitals of the Spanish region Castilla-La Mancha, two of them university hospitals. We identified those article {{that could not be}} served through national interlibrary loan, excluding from the sample those that were not served for the following reasons: Erroneous citation or not enough data, user cancellations because of cost or journal being binded at the time of request. RESULTS: Out of a total of 19. 159 requests received from our users, we identified 1. 033 requests that could not be served, corresponding to 665 journal titles. Problems encountered include: • <b>Old</b> <b>references</b> not covered by current collections • References in rare languages ​​(Chinese, Japanese [...] .), Only a small core of journals had a certain demand level (there were only 2 with with more that 10 requests). Among them, some titles have been identified that have been rejected by some library and obtained otherwise, usually using the lists of searches. CONCLUSIONS • We believe that the method could be extended to other libraries and would serve to identify certain gaps in our collections that could be solved cooperatively. • Given the dispersion of the titles requested, it could be more advantageous to purchase articles on demand than to subscribe to journals, but we do not have administrative mechanisms that assure us a speedy purchase. • Further updating of collective catalogs is required. • We detected some degree of "variation in practice" that influences the results. • Some requests indicated that users need some training...|$|E
40|$|In {{the area}} of {{northern}} Poitou studied Taramelliceratinae are present at every level except in the Schilli Subzone, itself possibly absent, and the Stenocycloides Subzone in which only Perisphinctidae and Trimarginites sp. occur. Although some species are known and cited in the literature often, they are figured infrequently or not at all: Taramelliceras (Taramelliceras) dentostriatum (Quenstedt), T. (T.) callicerum (Oppel), T. (Proscaphites) anar (Oppel). Here, the ranges of these species in the stratigraphic succession were determined through their association with other faunas in the same collections, using {{the presence or absence}} of known precise stratigraphic markers (for example: Neomorphoceras chapuisi (Oppel) = Transversarium Zone, Luciaeformis Subzone; Taramelliceras (? Taramelliceras) colleti (Lee) = Rotoides Subzone; "Epipeltoceras semimammatum" (Quenstedt) = Bimammatum Zone, "Berrense" Subzone, Semimammatum horizon) and/or the disappearance of species with longer ranges (for example: the disappearance of Neoprionoceras lautlingensis (Rollier) which is present in the Parandieri Subzone, but absent in the overlying Luciaeformis Subzone). The ranges of certain species that had been incorrectly located stratigraphically : T. (T.) dentostriatum (Quenstedt), T. (T.) callicerum (Oppel), T. (T.) externnodosum Dorn, have been restored to their true location as determined from their occurrences in the author's collections and in those of other collectors who had noted their stratigraphic relationships to other taxa. It is recommended that the date of creation of the Luciaeformis Subzone and the Nectobrigensis, Luciaeformis and Subschilli horizons (Middle Oxfordian, Transversarium Zone) should be rectified. Currently, these are indicated as having been created in 1984. However, if the author's name, G. Melendez, is correct the date of their creation cannot have been 1984, the year in which the G. Melendez thesis was defended, for the manuscript was published only in 1989. It is also proposed that the Duongi horizon Melendez, 1989, be renamed as the Duongae horizon Melendez, 1989, because the index form, Perisphinctes (Dichotomoceras) duongi Melendez, 1989, is an ammonite species named to honor of A. N. Duong, a woman. The study involved more than fifteen hundred individuals, all collected in the zone investigated. Only the most representative are figured here. The poor state of preservation of the ammonites (encrusted, often worn on one face, with the umbilicus not accessible) did not permit measurement (hence no table) except that of the diameter and sometimes the thickness. Previous studies of this subfamily or these species (Oppel, 1863; Quenstedt, 1887; Loriol, 1902; Lee, 1905; Dorn, 1931; Hölder, 1955) are <b>old.</b> <b>References</b> to this subfamily or its representatives in more recent works are only incidental and rarely include descriptions, drawing or photographs. The existence of many ammonites comprising homogeneous groups but without characteristics in common with known species justifies the creation of new species. Some microconchs have been definitely associated with a macroconch species. For others, a lack of material did not permit the establishment of such a direct link so they have been attached to the supposedly related species with the mention, "aff. " (for "affinis"). Nevertheless, although described and figured, these forms remain in open nomenclature. There are some "groups" of ammonites with new characteristics that are here associated with a known species because the differences were not sufficient to create new ones; they are distinguished by "var. " (for "variety"). There are also some that are referred to a previously known species because they were based only on a fragment (polymorphism?). In addition, in the zone studied the several taxa of this subfamily permit a relatively detailed stratigraphic breakdown because their existence is limited at a maximum to a subzone. However, an exception is the species Taramelliceras (Proscaphites) anar (Oppel, 1863) which ranges from the Antecedens Subzone through the Rotoides Subzone...|$|E
