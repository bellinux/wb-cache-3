The United States Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators.

About 76,000litres (20,000gallons) of water were sent to the island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief supplies.
