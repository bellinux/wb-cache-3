5|$|All five {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> differ widely {{from one}} another in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society {{and the necessity of}} maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech,</b> the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> do not include this detail.|$|E

Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though {{he enjoyed the}} acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> was {{that the spirit of}} liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>speeches</b> in Thucydides {{have long}} {{been a source of}} lively {{historical}} controversy. Many scholars have discounted their historical veracity in differing degrees. This has been true even <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> Pericles, particularly his famous Funeral Oration, although scholarly objections to the content and tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Periclean <b>speeches</b> have largely been of a purely subjective nature. However, an examination <b>of</b> how <b>the</b> Homeric h&d 5;,qov, with its stringent demand for the studied cultivation and possession of timh&d 12; and a,r 3 t h&d 12;, functions within <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> Pericles as a key motivating force for <b>the</b> steadfast pursuance <b>of</b> a highly aggressive foreign policy, sheds an interesting light on <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> and <b>the</b> outbreak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Athenian-Peloponnesian War. In conjunction with this "Homeric reading" to <b>the</b> <b>speeches,</b> a further consideration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more realistic analyses of modern manifestations <b>of</b> Realpolitik in <b>the</b> sphere <b>of</b> international politics and diplomacy, adduces additional support for <b>the</b> acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> Pericles as important forms of historical evidence for <b>the</b> basic workings <b>of</b> Machtpolitik...|$|R

5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing the tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama {{was critical of}} former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about the tone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech,</b> saying that the speech veered {{from that of a}} ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speech.</b> He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} find <b>the</b> common traits <b>of</b> great speeches. It does so by closely examining <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most well-known <b>speeches</b> in world. These speeches are presented in <b>the</b> book <b>Speeches</b> that Changed <b>the</b> World (2006) by Simon Sebag Montefiore. The dissertation specifically looks at four variables: The beginnings and endings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches,</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> passive voice, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> personal pronouns and <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> language. These four variables {{are based on the}} advice given by speechwriter Richard Dowis in his book <b>the</b> Lost Art <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great <b>Speech</b> (2000). <b>The</b> variables are analysed and the results prove a number <b>of</b> things, <b>the</b> most interesting being, first, that there are patterns in <b>the</b> way <b>speeches</b> are begun and ended. Secondly that passive voice is quite common in speeches despite Dowis’ advice. Thirdly, that the subjective pronouns are significantly more represented in speeches compared to other genres and fourthly, that <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> should be neither too simple nor too difficult...|$|R
50|$|Others have objected that <b>the</b> {{language}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> is too Lukan {{in style}} to reflect anyone else's words. Moreover, {{some have argued}} that <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> <b>of</b> Peter and Paul are too much alike, and that especially Paul's are too distinct from his letters to reflect a true Pauline source. Despite these suspicions, historian-attorney Christopher Price concludes that Luke's style in Acts is representative of those ancient historians known for accurately recording speeches in their works. Examination <b>of</b> several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major <b>speeches</b> in Acts reveals that while the author smoothed out the Greek in some cases, he clearly relied on preexisting material to reconstruct his speeches. He did not believe himself at liberty to invent material, but attempted to accurately record <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>speeches</b> in Acts.|$|R
