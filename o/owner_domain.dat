This paper proposes a novel solution for binding a domain to a single <b>owner.</b> <b>Domain</b> owners are authenticated using two-factor authentication, which involves “something the domain owner has”, i. e. a Master Control device that controls and manages consumers domains, and binds devices joining a domain to itself, and “something the domain owner is or knows”, i. e. a biometric or password/PIN authentication mechanism that is implemented by the Master Control device. These measures establish a one-to-many relationship between the Master Control device and domain devices, and a one-to-one relationship between domain owners and their Master Control Devices, ensuring that a single consumer owns each domain. This stops illicit content proliferation. Finally, {{the pros and cons of}} two possible approaches to user authentication, i. e. the use of a password/PIN and biometric authentication mechanisms, and possible countermeasures to the identified vulnerabilities are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Ontology {{construction}} is a labour-intensive and costly process. Even though many formal and semi-formal vocabularies are available, creating an ontology {{for a specific}} application is hindered {{in a number of}} ways. Firstly, the process of elicitating concepts is a time consuming and strenuous process. Secondly, it is difficult to keep focus. Thirdly, technical modelling constructs are hard to understand for the uninitiated. We propose ROC as a method to cope with these problems. ROC builds on well-known approaches for ontology construction. However, we reuse existing sources to generate a repository of proposed associations. ROC assists in efficiently putting forward all relevant concepts and relations by providing a large set of potential candidate associations. Secondly, rather than using intermediate representations of formal constructs we confront the domain expert with `natural-language-like¿ statements generated from RDF-based triples. Moreover, we strictly separate the roles of problem <b>owner,</b> <b>domain</b> expert and knowledge engineer, each having his own responsibilities and skills. The domain expert and problem owner keep focus by monitoring a well-defined application purpose. We have implemented an initial set of tools to support ROC. This paper describes the ROC method and two application cases in which we evaluate the overall approach...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the problem of {{preventing}} illegal copying of digital assets without jeopardising the right of legitimate licence holders to transfer content between their own devices, which make up a domain. Our novel idea involves the use of a domain-specific mobile phone and the mobile phone network operator to authenticate the <b>domain</b> <b>owner</b> before devices can join a domain. This binds devices in a domain to a single owner, that, in turn, enables the binding of domain licences to the <b>domain</b> <b>owner.</b> In addition, {{the way in which we}} control domain membership, and the use of the domain-specific mobile phone that enables a <b>domain</b> <b>owner</b> to add devices wherever he/she is physically present, ensures that devices joining the domain are in physical proximity to the mobile phone, preventing illicit content proliferation...|$|R

More precisely, we detect and analyze cyber-threat infrastructures {{for the purpose of}} unveiling key players (<b>owners,</b> <b>domains,</b> IPs, organizations, malware families, etc.) and the relationships between these players. To this end, we propose metrics to measure the badness of different infrastructure elements using graph theoretic concepts such as centrality concepts and Google PageRank. In addition, we quantify the sharing of infrastructure elements among different malware samples and families to unveil potential groups that are behind specific attacks. Moreover, we study the evolution of cyber-threat infrastructures over time to infer patterns of cyber-criminal activities. The proposed study provides the capability to derive insights and intelligence about cyber-threat infrastructures. Using one year dataset, we generate notable results regarding emerging threats and campaigns, important players behind threats, linkages between cyber-threat infrastructure elements, patterns of cyber-crimes, etc...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{creating}} a secure domain consisting of all devices {{owned by a}} single <b>owner.</b> This <b>domain</b> allows secure content sharing between devices in each domain and prevents the illegal copying of content to devices outside the domain. This paper proposes a novel solution for binding a domain to a single owner, ensuring that only a single consumer owns and manages each domain. This enables binding of domain licences to a <b>domain</b> <b>owner,</b> thereby limiting illicit content proliferation. Our novel idea {{involves the use of}} location based services, ensuring that devices, when joining a consumer domain, are located in physical proximity to the domain registered addresses. This restricts domain membership to devices in predefined geographical locations, helping to ensure that a single consumer owns and manages each domain. In addition, the proposed scheme helps to protect consumer privacy; location-based service is only required for managing domain membership, and it is not required for creating, downloading or exchanging content; in addition, the proposed scheme uses the Geographic location/privacy protocol (Geopriv), which enables <b>domain</b> <b>owners</b> to control the precision or resolution of location data, and when, in which location, and by whom their location can be retrieved...|$|R
40|$|Content {{delivery}} networks (CDNs) are {{an essential}} component of modern website infrastructures: edge servers located closer to users cache content, increasing robustness and capacity while decreasing latency. However, this situation becomes complicated for HTTPS content that is to be delivered using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol: the edge server must be able to carry out TLS handshakes for the cached domain. Most commercial CDNs require that the <b>domain</b> <b>owner</b> give their certificate's private key to the CDN's edge server or abandon caching of HTTPS content entirely. We examine the security and performance of a recently commercialized delegation technique in which the <b>domain</b> <b>owner</b> retains possession of their private key and splits the TLS state machine geographically with the edge server using a private key proxy service. This allows the <b>domain</b> <b>owner</b> to limit the amount of trust given to the edge server while maintaining the benefits of CDN caching. On the performance front, we find that latency is slightly worse compared to the insecure approach, but still significantly better than the <b>domain</b> <b>owner</b> serving the content directly. On the security front, we enumerate the security goals for TLS handshake proxying and identify a subtle difference between the security of RSA key transport and signed-Diffie [...] Hellman in TLS handshake proxying; we also discuss timing side channel resistance of the key server and the effect of TLS session resumption...|$|R
