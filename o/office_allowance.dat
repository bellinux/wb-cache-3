This article shows how controversies in 2008 over the level of <b>office</b> <b>allowances,</b> {{as well as the}} wording of the code of conduct, demonstrate that Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) held differing views on the constituency role of MSPs, and that the partisan animosity between the Scottish National Party (SNP) and Scottish Labour has been exacerbated by the competition at the constituency level facilitated by MMP. This deeply partisan outcome, while reflecting the successful operation of rational choice logic on the part of individual politicians, worked against the larger attempt to engineer a less adversarial post-devolution politics in Scotland...|$|R
5000|$|In early 2009, a major {{political}} scandal was triggered by the leaking and subsequent publication of expense claims made {{by members of the}} United Kingdom Parliament. On 16 July 2010, Taylor resigned the Tory Whip after being charged with offences connected with claims totalling £11,277. Several hundred members of the House of Commons and House of Lords were involved in the expenses scandal but only six members of the House of Commons and two, including Taylor, of the Lords, were charged and convicted. Taylor's defence in the Crown Court was that on appointment to the House of Lords he had asked other peers for advice on expenses and allowances and that he was told that the overnight subsistence allowance, the <b>office</b> <b>allowance,</b> and the travel expenses were provided in lieu of a salary, as well as the daily attendance allowance. As a result of claiming for the cost of journeys he had not made, and the cost of accommodation he had not occupied, Taylor was convicted of six counts of false accounting. In his summing up to the jury, Mr Justice Saunders observed that Taylor was a man of good character who had devoted {{a lot of time to}} helping others. The judge imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment, relating to £11,277 in falsely claimed expenses. He said that the expenses scandal had [...] "left an indelible stain on Parliament". About 15 members of the House of Lords had refused to give evidence to support Taylor's defence.|$|E
40|$|While {{a growing}} {{literature}} confirms that applications to Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) increase when {{conditions in the}} labor market worsen, less is known about how such conditions interact with characteristics of the screening process. Similarly, {{little is known about the}} effect of labor market conditions on the screening process itself. This project analyzes the effect of predicted changes in county employment rates on the application pattern and adjudication process of DI. The findings suggest that while employment declines raise DI application rates and lower labor force participation rates, the effect is smaller in the early 2000 s than in the early 1990 s. It also appears that the fraction of applications allowed at the level of Disability Determination Service (DDS) <b>office</b> <b>allowance</b> rates experience a substantial decline when applications rise due to a decline in employment. At the same time, the duration of screening of DI applications at the DDS-level rises somewhat. This implies that part of the applicants induced to apply by economic shocks are screened out during the initial stages of the adjudication process, and ensuing congestion appears weak. There is also some evidence that DDS offices with higher average screening duration receive fewer applications when local employment drops. Yet, potential applicants so dissuaded from applying after an employment decline do not appear to return to the labor force...|$|E

Why {{did you have to}} have it?" [...] In response to his rhetorical question, he explained salary and <b>office</b> <b>allowances</b> for senators. He went through different ways that political expenses could be met. One way was to be rich, but the senator stated that he was not rich. Another way was to put one's spouse on the Congressional office payroll, as, he stated, his Democratic rival, Senator John Sparkman, had done. Nixon did not feel comfortable doing that himself with so many deserving stenographers in Washington needing work, though Pat Nixon was a [...] "wonderful stenographer" [...] and sometimes helped out in the office as a volunteer. At this point, the camera turned from Nixon {{for the first time to}} reveal Pat Nixon sitting alongside the desk. The senator indicated he could not continue his law practice, as some Congressmen did, due to the distance to California, and in any event he felt that practicing law while a lawmaker was a conflict of interest. Thus, he indicated, he had found that the best way to pay for political expenses not within his means was to allow contributors to do so. Nixon proffered the legal and accounting opinions as proof of his statements.|$|R

At GS-13 they are eligible to start the [...] partial signatory authority program, a testing phase to see if an examiner can apply patent concepts (e.g. obviousness and novelty) laws (35 USC). Upon passing the 'Partial Signatory Program' a Patent Examiner is given signatory authority to sign all of their own non-final rejections and other non-final communications to applicants. After a waiting period a Patent examiner may take part in an additional testing phase known as the 'Full Signatory Authority' (FSA) program. When a patent examiner has passed the FSA program they are given full signatory authority and can sign all of their own <b>office</b> actions (e.g. <b>allowances,</b> rejections) without review and approval by a supervisor. Such examiners are also able to review and sign actions of junior examiners (patent examiners without signatory authority). Upon completion of the 'Full Signatory Authority program' an examiner is advanced from GS-13 to GS-14 and is referred to as a 'primary examiner'.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we use MIMOSIS, a Microsimulation model for Social Security and {{personal}} income taxes in Belgium (Decoster et al., 2007), {{to simulate the}} redistributive impact of potential reforms in the family allowances system. The aim of these hypothetical reforms is to adapt the amount of social family allowances and to extend their coverage to other groups at-risk of poverty. Up to now, only single-parent families and specific categories of social security beneficiaries (i. e. unemployed, disabled and pensioners) were concerned. The simulated reforms extend these social family allowances supplements to other children, mainly those living in working poor households, on a means tested base. As is often the case, the concepts {{used to evaluate the}} simulated reforms are different from the ones used to implement them. Nonetheless all suggested measures result in a considerable increase of the number of children below the poverty line that receive an additional supplement. Some of the suggested reforms even reach almost all children below the poverty line and much less those above, which illustrates that the measures are targeted well on those who have a high risk of being poor. 1 This study was prepared to be presented at the Conference on Child Poverty organized in the framework of the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union (Marche-en-Famenne, 2 - 3 September 2010).
