He was commemorated by two stone tablets in the church, one by either Richard Westmacott or his son, erected after his death and one, the only example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> John Flaxman in Manchester, to celebrate his 50th anniversary as rector. Clowes preached the first Sunday school sermon in the Manchester area, introduced Swedenborgianism there and was prominent in championing Whit Walks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{psychodrama}} is {{not widely}} practiced, {{the work done}} by practitioners of psychodrama has opened the doors to research possibilities for other psychological concepts such as group therapy and expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Sigmund Freud.

The methods of psychodrama are also used by group therapy organizations and also find a place in other types of therapy, such as post-divorce counseling for children.|$|E

5|$|Burne-Jones's first sketch in oils {{dates from}} this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College {{the first of}} what was to be an immense series of {{cartoons}} for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the Prioress's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, his first direct illustration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with endless subjects. Thus early, therefore, we see the artist busy in all the various fields in which he was to labour.|$|E

5|$|Established by Standing Order 18 of the Senate, the {{privileges}} committee {{is responsible for}} reporting on matters of parliamentary privilege referred to it by the Senate. The protections afforded by parliamentary privilege are essential to parliament and its committees {{to be able to}} operate effectively. The bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> {{the privileges}} committee's work is associated with facilitating a 'right of reply' for people adversely named in the Senate, as well as involving investigations of unauthorised disclosures of Senate committee proceedings, complaints from witnesses in connection with evidence given to committees, and allegedly misleading evidence given to committees.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, {{simulations of}} evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life {{started in the}} 1960s and were extended with simulation of artificial selection. Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s. He used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Henry Holland. Practical applications also include automatic evolution of computer programmes. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers and also to optimise the design of systems.|$|E

5|$|Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish Parliament {{is done in}} committee. The role of {{committees}} {{is stronger}} in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly {{as a means of}} strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for {{the fact that there is}} no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.|$|E
