She develops a close friendship with 5-Nova Luis. At {{the age of seven}} Hsing and the other children of similar age are allowed to put on clothes for the first time; Hsing greatly looks forward to this ceremony, a rite of passage aboard the Discovery. As the children grow older Luis begins to develop an interest in the virtual reality programs that allow people on the ship to explore the planet they have left behind. Disagreements with her friend Rosie, a member of Bliss, lead Hsing to explore the philosophy of the angels. Although she questions in her own mind the purpose of the voyage, she disagrees with the angels' thinking, which eventually damages her friendship with Rosie. Luis also investigates this group, by participating in some of their practices.|$|E

40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>realities</b> {{form a new}} {{technical}} platform, raising scientific {{questions about}} the human mind, communication and identity. There is hardly any scientific research on the influence <b>of</b> a <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> on the identity perception and the personality of a user <b>of</b> these <b>virtual</b> <b>realities.</b> The present study attempts to contribute to filling this gap by assessing the potential difference between real-life personality and the ‘virtual’ avatar personality using the online <b>virtual</b> world <b>of</b> Second Life. Dutch participants (N = 34) were asked {{to use their own}} avatar or create a new avatar within this online <b>virtual</b> <b>reality,</b> to communicate with other avatars and finally to fill in a Big Five personality questionnaire (5 Persoonlijkheids Factoren Test - 5 PFT) via a virtual interactive testing screen within Second Life. The virtual 5 PFT scores were compared to pencil and paper scores of the same questionnaire, which had been filled in by all 34 participants during a first-year undergraduate test battery, seven months prior to the virtual testing. Results showed no difference for any of the five subscales (extraversion, friendliness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, development) between the pencil and paper and the virtual version, suggesting that users <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>realities</b> do not create a ‘virtual’ personality for their avatar. Furthermore, high scores of internal consistency and high test-retest correlations between the two versions were found, which are very similar to the original test-retest scores of the 5 PFT. These findings show the potential <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>realities</b> as new platforms for reliable (psychological) testing and future clinical applications...|$|R

50|$|VR in the Schools is a {{peer-reviewed journal}} <b>of</b> the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Reality</b> and Education Laboratory (VREL), {{published}} by East Carolina University. VR in the Schools addresses issues <b>of</b> incorporating <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> into the education system. The journal {{started out as}} a printed quarterly, but changed to an online-only publishing format starting with volume 3 and was described by its editors in 2011 as an occasional publication.|$|R
25|$|By 2002, the {{laboratory}} had expanded {{to the point}} that it received subsidies from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), which gave added impetus to the work in progress, including projects involving the use of videoconferencing in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia, and the use <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> in the treatment of anxiety disorders.|$|E
25|$|The {{preference}} <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> exposure therapy over in-vivo exposure {{therapy is}} often debated, {{but there are}} many obvious advantages <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> exposure therapy that make it more desirable. For example, the proximity between the client and therapist can cause problems when in-vivo therapy is used and transportation is not reliable for the client or it is impractical for them to travel as far as needed. However, virtual reality exposure therapy can be done from anywhere in the world if given the necessary tools. Going along with the idea of unavailable transportation and proximity, there are many individuals who require therapy but due to various forms of immobilizations (paralysis, extreme obesity, etc..) they can not physically be moved to where the therapy is conducted. Again, because virtual reality exposure therapy can be conducted anywhere in the world, those with mobility issues will no longer be discriminated against. Another major advantage is fewer ethical concerns than in-vivo exposure therapy. Once again, considering the idea of close proximity no longer being a requirement, this decreases the chances of inappropriate client-therapist relations taking place.|$|E
25|$|Some {{current and}} future therapy methods include the use <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> and video games for {{rehabilitation}}. These forms of rehabilitation offer potential for motivating patients to perform specific therapy tasks that many other forms do not. Many clinics and hospitals are adopting {{the use of these}} off-the-shelf devices for exercise, social interaction, and rehabilitation because they are affordable, accessible and can be used within the clinic and home.|$|E
40|$|Files {{are usually}} used for {{exchange}} of 3 D data between graphical applications, but {{this approach is}} not feasible for applications <b>of</b> shared <b>virtual</b> <b>reality.</b> Thus a network protocol is used for this purpose. Two antithetical requirements are claimed for such protocol. Protocol has to be partially or completely reliable. Neither delay jitter nor too high delay are acceptable. This paper explains and analyzes new version of protocol called Verse. This improves shortcomings found in UDP, TCP, SCTP and DCCP transport protocols. The Verse protocol was designed for sharing 3 D data between applications <b>of</b> shared <b>virtual</b> <b>reality.</b> This paper also contains results of experiments comparing suitability of network protocols for application <b>of</b> shared <b>virtual</b> <b>reality...</b>|$|R

25|$|Additionally, common effects <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> environments, such as dizziness, nausea, and disorientation, {{have also}} been found to result {{in the case of}} {{rehabilitation}} through these methodologies. As these scenarios work the same as other virtual reality scenarios, they are not exempt from the negative results that can be seen across the board from these sorts of systems, and patients have shown this to be evident. Virtual reality systems have also proven difficult to maintain and sanitize after use, which has caused some to stray away from their use and stick to regular methodologies instead.|$|E
25|$|One very {{successful}} example <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> therapy exposure therapy is the PTSD treatment system, Virtual Iraq. Using a {{head mounted display}} and a game pad, patients navigate a Humvee around virtual recreations of Iraq, Afghanistan, and the United States. By being safely exposed to the traumatic environments, patients learned to reduce their anxiety. According to {{a review of the}} history of Virtual Iraq, one study found that it reduced PTSD symptoms by an average of fifty percent, and disqualified over seventy-five percent of participants for PTSD after treatment.|$|E

25|$|Problems {{analogous}} to the trolley problem arise {{in the design of}} autonomous cars, in situations where the car's software is forced during a potential crash scenario to choose between multiple courses of action (sometimes including options which include the death of the car's occupants), all of which may cause harm. A platform called Moral Machine was created by MIT Media Lab to allow the public to express their opinions on what decisions autonomous vehicles should make in scenarios that use the trolley problem paradigm. Other approaches make use <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> to assess human behavior in experimental settings.|$|E
25|$|Another study {{examined}} the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> therapy in treating military combat personnel recently returning from the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rauch, Eftekhari and Ruzek conducted a study {{with a sample of}} 42 combat servicemen who were already diagnosed with chronic PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). These combat servicemen were pre-screened using several different diagnostic self-reports including the PTSD military checklist, a screening tool used by the military in the determination of the intensity of the diagnosis of PTSD by measuring the presence of PTSD symptoms. Although 22 of the servicemen dropped out of the study, {{the results of the study}} concerning the 20 remaining servicemen still has merit. The servicemen were given the same diagnostic tests after the study which consisted of multiple sessions <b>of</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>reality</b> exposure and virtual reality exposure therapy. The servicemen showed much improvement in the diagnostic scores, signaling a decrease of symptoms of PTSD. Likewise, a three-month follow-up diagnostic screening was also administered after the initial sessions that were undergone by the servicemen. The results of this study showed that 15 of the 20 participants no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD and improved their PTSD military checklist score by 50% for the assessment following the study. Even though only 17 of the 20 participants participated in the 3-month follow-up screening, 13 of the 17 still did not meet the criteria for PTSD and maintained their 50% improvement in the PTSD military checklist score. These results show promising effects and help to validate virtual reality therapy as an efficacious mode of therapy for the treatment of PTSD (McLay, et al., 2012).|$|E
