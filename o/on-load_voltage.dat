40|$|This study {{investigated}} the behavior of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are batteries capable of easily switching between charging and discharging modes, making them a suitable option for storing intermittent sources of alternative energies (solar, wind, etc). Since different sizes of the battery provide varying voltages, optimal parameters for a particular home are key for implementation. These parameters, specifically the cell and tank volumes of the battery {{that are capable of}} providing consistent <b>on-load</b> <b>voltage,</b> were determined using data from a 13 kW solar array and a medium-sized house. Charge/discharge current values were used to run a mathematical model that provided <b>on-load</b> <b>voltage</b> over time graphs based on parameter input values. Using this model, the optimal parameter values were found to be 11. 5 L for the cell volume and 103. 7 L for the tank volume, which maintenained the <b>on-load</b> <b>voltage</b> well above 0. 80 V (10 % of cell standard emf) ...|$|E

In this paper, the influences of connecting PV to the distribution network is firstly analyzed, An calculation model is proposed for computing the maximum penetration level of Grid-connected PV to insure every node voltage not beyond limits, taking into account on-load-changing of the transformer and the influences of PV power is completely out of operation. The experimental analysis shows that the proposed calculation model for computing the maximum capacity is feasible and effective...|$|E

In case of critical nodal <b>voltages</b> <b>on-load</b> tap-changers (OLTC) and reactive power control based on nodal voltage, Q(V), {{are regarded as}} comparably cheap solutions to delay or even to replace distribution grid reinforcement. Since both control schemes are based on nodal voltages and usually share no communication infrastructure, local oscillations between controllers are possible.

40|$|Apart {{from the}} {{classical}} cycle conversion there exist also other methods of direct frequency conversion. The paper characterizes different developments in this field. The {{first of the}} considered conversion methods {{is based on the}} approximation of the converter output voltage to the reference (standard) voltage by selection of such a two-value three-phase voltage combination that possesses the most long-lasting integral voltage deviation from the reference in a respective time interval. Here summation of different <b>on-load</b> input <b>voltages</b> is performed by a 3 - phase input voltage regulator. The second method is characterized through the formation of the direct rectified voltage without pulsations theoretical and practical capabilities overview. The third of these control methods is pulse - width modulation that can be performed in matrix structures. The aim of the work is to contribute to development of yet unknown or untapped potentialities of direct conversion. Based on these solutions, the environment-friendly conversion of the necessary electric energy parameters could be expected...|$|R
30|$|The {{increasing}} {{deployment of}} Distributed Generation (DG) technologies introduces power quality {{challenges to the}} grid, in particular steady state voltage rise at the connection point for DG units. In most distribution networks, control and monitoring of grid parameters is missing, as well as system security is at risk. Smart grid technologies {{have the capability to}} realize the real-time measurements and <b>on-load</b> <b>voltage</b> controls. With the steady implementation of smart grid technologies throughout the existing distribution networks, the online voltage control can be achieved ensuring the power quality and voltage levels within the statutory limits. This study presents a methodology for the estimation of voltage profile in a smart distribution network with DG for the online voltage control, taking into account different line X/R ratios and laterals. This method is based on maximum and minimum voltage estimation by remote terminal units (RTUs) placed only at DG connected bus and at capacitor connected bus. Voltage regulation is carried out based on RTUs estimated values. This work is tested on two radial distribution networks with/without DGs and laterals. Comparative results for voltage magnitudes estimated with different methodology are presented. The reported simulation results show that the method presented is capable of estimating the voltage profile along the distribution network with DGs for the online voltage control, considering different line X/R ratios and laterals.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Static current-compounding excitation schemes that provide an isolated synchronous generator with a field current that increases both with increasing load and with worsening power factor have been in existence for many years. Such schemes, while capable of maintaining the <b>on-load</b> terminal <b>voltage</b> substantially constant, require brushes to carry the excitation current to the generator field winding and in some practical applications these brushes may present serious maintenance problems. In a recent development, a new brushless frequency-converter type of excitation system was introduced. This system, while using only passive components, can furnish a loaded synchronous generator with a compounded excitation current such that its terminal voltage is maintained to within a reasonably close tolerance, irrespective of the load power factor. The central unit {{of the system is}} a special purpose exciter, the rather unconventional stator windings of which make the concept of an automatically-regulated and brushless generator a practical reality [...] cont'...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} of wind power into the electricity grid is growing significantly. A {{significant portion of}} this wind power is being installed in distribution systems, of which most are passively operated. Under this operating practice, wind power can only be admitted based on minimum load and maximum generation consideration. This severely limits the wind power hosting capacity of the system. Hence, the use of active-management strategies (AMSs) has been proposed to increase the hosting capacity of distribution systems. This paper incorporates AMSs into two optimization models whose objectives are to maximize the net benefit of distribution system operator and wind farm owner, respectively. The AMSs considered are wind energy curtailment, coordinated <b>on-load</b> tap changer <b>voltage</b> control, and reactive power compensation. The models development {{is based on a}} typical medium-voltage distribution system in Sweden although it can easily be adapted to other cases. The application of the model to a distribution system in Sweden shows an increase in hosting capacity of the distribution system by 78 % with mere 2. 6 % curtailed energy. That is, the hosting capacity of the distribution system has almost been doubled by using AMSs...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{more and}} more {{distributed}} generations (DGs) are being connected to local distribution networks due to the variety of advantages they offer. Without any DG, the direction of power flow is always from the power grid towards the loads. Therefore, the voltages decrease along the feeder and the voltage control has {{to compensate for the}} resultant voltage drops. When DG is connected to the network, the direction of power flow can be reversed whenever the DG output power exceeds the local load. This bi-directional power flow complicates the voltage profile along the feeder and simple compensation is no longer effective. Furthermore, the voltage profile resulting from the power in-feed from the DG may be exceed the statutory limits. In these conditions, conventional <b>on-load</b> tap-changer (OLTC) <b>voltage</b> control methods will prove to be inappropriate. This paper presents a new OLTC voltage control strategy for use on networks where DG is connected that the level of bi-directional power flowing is considered in the control scheme. The paper describes the new OLTC voltage control strategy and demonstrates its improved performance using a selection of simulation studies. In addition to providing an automatic voltage setting point change for existing OLTC transformers with AVC relays, the new voltage control strategy facilitates the maximization of the power output from the connected DG. Techniques to develop the new OLTC voltage control scheme to accommodate the potential use of Smart Grids are discussed in this paper. The challenges and benefits of Smart Grids for OLTC voltage control are investigated. Data communication systems are considered to coordinate with the OLTC voltage control as one of the approaches {{to take full advantage of}} future Smart Grids...|$|R
