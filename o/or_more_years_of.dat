25|$|Residency as an {{opportunity}} for advanced training in a medical or surgical specialty evolved in the late 19th century from brief and informal programs for extra training in a special area of interest. The first formal residency programs were established by Sir William Osler and William Stewart Halsted at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. Residencies elsewhere then became formalized and institutionalized for the principal specialties in the early 20th century. But even mid-century, residency was not seen as necessary for general practice and only a minority of primary care physicians participated. By the end of the 20th century in North America though, very few new doctors went directly from medical school into independent, unsupervised medical practice, and more state and provincial governments began requiring one <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> postgraduate training for medical licensure.|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} {{positive}} aspects of the third season's ratings however. Among adults aged 18 to 49, Fringe placed first in its Friday timeslot.

Furthermore, the average household income of Fringes adult viewers was higher than the total U.S. adult population average, and its adult viewers also had a higher index of having four <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> college. Despite its low ratings, Fringe was officially renewed for a fourth season on March24,2011 to the surprise of observers – six days before the renewal, Fringe had reached a new series ratings low.

From the beginning, the Royal Lao Army was not allegiant to either the Lao constitution, or to the RLA. Instead, Lao troops showed loyalty toward whichever senior Lao officer they already knew.

2500|$|The current Social Security formula used in {{calculating the}} benefit level (primary {{insurance}} amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone {{who worked in}} OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times inflation factor divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME. The progressive nature of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to also get a slightly higher Social Security Benefit percentage on this low average salary. Congress passed in 1983 the Windfall Elimination Provision to minimize Social Security benefits for these recipients. The basic provision {{is that the first}} salary bracket, $0–791/month (2013) has its normal benefit percentage of 90% reduced to 40–90%—see Social Security for the exact percentage. The reduction is limited to roughly 50% of what you would be eligible for if you had always worked under OASDI taxes.
