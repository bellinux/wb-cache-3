5|$|According to John Carmack, {{the lead}} {{graphics}} engine developer at id Software, {{the technology of}} Doom 3 was supported by three primary features: unified lighting and shadowing, complex animations and scripting that showed real-time with fully dynamic per-pixel lighting and stencil shadowing, and GUI surfaces that add extra interactivity to the game. The key advance of the id Tech 4 graphics engine developed for Doom 3 is the unified lighting and shadowing. Rather than computing or rendering lightmaps during map creation and saving that information in the map data, most light sources are computed in real-time. This allows lights to cast shadows even on non-static objects such as monsters and machinery, which was impossible with static non-directional lightmaps. A shortcoming <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> the engine's inability to render soft shadows and global illumination.|$|E
5|$|The {{practicality}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> questionable {{with modern}} material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun {{would have an}} overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, {{which is about the}} same mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E

50|$|This {{technique}} is fairly {{common in the}} United States and east Asian countries. The advantages <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> the further reduction of manual labour time and cost per unit area of slab and a simple and systematic building technique.

5|$|Universal supports. In a more recent, more convenient, {{and more}} widely used method, the {{synthesis}} {{starts with the}} universal support where a non-nucleosidic linker {{is attached to the}} solid support material (compounds 1 and 2). A phosphoramidite respective to the 3'-terminal nucleoside residue is coupled to the universal solid support in the first synthetic cycle of oligonucleotide chain assembly using the standard protocols. The chain assembly is then continued until the completion, after which the solid support-bound oligonucleotide is deprotected. The characteristic feature of the universal solid supports is that the release of the oligonucleotides occurs by the hydrolytic cleavage of a P-O bond that attaches the 3’-O of the 3’-terminal nucleotide residue to the universal linker as shown in Scheme 6. The critical advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> that the same solid support is used irrespectively of the sequence of the oligonucleotide to be synthesized. For the complete removal of the linker and the 3'-terminal phosphate from the assembled oligonucleotide, the solid support 1 and several similar solid supports require gaseous ammonia, aqueous ammonium hydroxide, aqueous methylamine, or their mixture and are commercially available. The solid support 2 requires a solution of ammonia in anhydrous methanol and is also commercially available.|$|E

25|$|In some {{simplest}} cases, {{the state}} of condensed particles can be described with a nonlinear Schrödinger equation, also known as Gross–Pitaevskii or Ginzburg–Landau equation.

25|$|Product-based {{planning}} is a structured approach to project management, based on identifying {{all of the}} products (project deliverables) that contribute to achieving the project objectives.

40|$|Visualization {{is often}} more an art than a science. Here a model-based <b>approach</b> to {{visualization}} <b>is</b> promoted {{in order to make}} steps forward in this respect.

Some examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>are</b> presented, with optimal zooming and panning as main example. Advantages and problems are discussed.

25|$|The L1-regularized {{formulation}} {{is useful}} in some contexts due to its tendency to prefer solutions where more parameters are zero, which gives solutions that depend on fewer variables.

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> {{the need}} {{to dispose of the}} ammonium sulfate byproduct.

In one of these processes (used by BASF) the formic acid is removed from the water by liquid-liquid extraction with an organic base.|$|E
25|$|A third {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody, such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like Staphylococcus Protein A or Streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Since other methods are safer, quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant).|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} look at {{the linguistic}} relationships between the myths of different cultures. For example, {{the similarities between the}} names of gods in different cultures.

25|$|Oxygen gas or {{ambient air}} {{can also be}} {{injected}} to promote growth of aerobic bacteria which accelerate natural attenuation of organic contaminants. One disadvantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> the possibility of decreasing anaerobic contaminant destruction natural attenuation where existing conditions enhance anaerobic bacteria which normally live in the soil prefer a reducing environment. In general though, aerobic activity is much faster than anaerobic and overall destruction rates are typically greater when aerobic activity can be successfully promoted.|$|E

25|$|Re Hobley adopts the {{unconscionability}} rationale {{such that}} {{the imposition of a}} constructive trust is only justified by unconscionability, therefore there must be detrimental reliance.

25|$|The great {{advantage}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> <b>is</b> {{the efficiency and}} low cost involved in settling large volumes of trades. The inconvenience is that the issuing corporation no longer knows who its owners are, since its transfer agent has all the immobilized shares recorded as the owner being Cede & Co. For purposes of sending proxy notices and other communications with beneficial owners, the transfer agent, acting on a request of the issuing corporation, sends an inquiry to DTCC, which in turn sends inquiries to its members and so on down the chain.|$|E
