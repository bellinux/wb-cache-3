5|$|In 1935, the {{political}} climate in Italy (under Mussolini) became unacceptable to Escher. He {{had no interest in}} politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his <b>own</b> <b>particular</b> medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E
5|$|Many {{communities}} have their <b>own</b> <b>particular</b> style of cuisines, {{such as the}} Jains, Kayasths and Muslims. There are also certain sub-regional delicacies. Awadhi cuisine is world-famous for dishes such as kebab, biryani, keema and nihari. Sweets occupy an important place in the Hindu diet and are eaten at social ceremonies. People make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including khurchan, peda, gulabjamun, petha, makkhan malai, and chamcham. The chaat in Lucknow and Banarasi Paan is known across India for its flavour and ingredients.|$|E
5|$|Submarine {{films have}} their <b>own</b> <b>particular</b> {{meanings}} and conventions, concerned specifically with giving {{the effect of}} submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957) and Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.|$|E

5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's <b>own</b> <b>particular</b> code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Alice needs a {{document}} signed by an employee in Bob’s company. That employee {{should be part}} of the IT staff and is at least a junior manager in the cryptography team or a senior manager in the biometrics team. In such a scenario we need an Attribute Based Group Signature Scheme (ABGS). In this paper we define the first ABGS scheme where verifying includes authenticating a person that belongs to a certain group and <b>owns</b> <b>particular</b> attributes. We define two security notions adopted from group signature which are: traceability and anonymity. We prove our scheme to be secure under those two notions. ...|$|R
40|$|Arguing a case {{by way of}} analogy can be perilous. Each {{problem has}} its <b>own</b> <b>particulars</b> that analogy and {{examples}} from other domains often obscure. Therefore it is with some trepidation that this paper discusses {{similarities and differences between}} the poker-machine (EGM) and the tobacco industries. The author has no special knowledge of the tobacco industry beyond that of the reasonably informed citizen. Rather it is out of concern about ethics and product safety for EGMs that the paper addresses the following question: what, if any, are the substantive ethical differences between the EGM industry and the tobacco industry...|$|R

25|$|Due to {{cultural}} differences, assuming the al-Qaeda Training Manual is authentic, eastern cell structures {{may differ from}} the Western mode.

25|$|The {{linguistic}} {{situation of}} the BP informal speech {{in relation to the}} standard language is controversial.

25|$|The Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO) is the 1990 {{codification}} of {{the common}} portions of the Canon Law for the 23 of the 24 sui iuris Churches in the Catholic Church. It is divided into 30 titles and has a total of 1540 canons, with an introductory section of preliminary canons. Pope John Paul II promulgated the CCEO on October 18, 1990, by the document Sacri Canones, and the CCEO came into force on October 1, 1991. The 23 sui iuris Churches which collectively make up the Eastern Catholic Churches have been invited by the Catholic Church to codify their <b>own</b> <b>particular</b> laws and submit them to the pope so that all canon law within Catholicism may be fully and completely codified. The Latin Church is guided by its <b>own</b> <b>particular</b> canons found in the 1983 Code of Canon Law.|$|E
5000|$|Larger {{companies}} {{compete for}} market share by acquiring smaller companies that may <b>own</b> a <b>particular</b> market sector.

5000|$|Ross also {{objects to}} Aristotle's {{criticism}} that Form Otherness {{accounts for the}} differences between Forms and purportedly leads to contradictory forms: the Not-tall, the Not-beautiful, etc. That particulars participate in a Form is for Aristotle much too vague to permit analysis. By {{one way in which}} he unpacks the concept, the Forms would cease to be of one essence due to any multiple participation. As Ross indicates, Plato didn't make that leap from [...] "A is not B" [...] to [...] "A is Not-B." [...] Otherness would only apply to its <b>own</b> <b>particulars</b> and not to those of other Forms. For example, there is no Form Not-Greek, only particulars of Form Otherness that somehow suppress Form Greek.|$|R

25|$|The Ottoman {{social system}} {{was based on}} {{religious}} affiliation. Religious insignia extended to every social function. Clothing identified citizens with their <b>own</b> <b>particular</b> religious grouping; headgear distinguished rank and profession. Turbans, fezes, bonnets, and head-dresses denoted the sex, rank, and profession — both civil and military — of the wearer. Religious insignia outside of worship areas was banned.|$|E

25|$|Fundamentalists, {{wishing to}} return to basic Islamic {{religious}} values and law, have in some instances imposed harsh sharia punishments for crimes, curtailed civil rights and violated human rights.
