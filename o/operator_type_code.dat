Process: This document describes the process for creating new BGP attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes.</b> Basic attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> are described in RFC 1771, pages 12 through 15. These, and new attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> {{that are used in}} the Internet are registered with the IANA. The actual process will involve the documentation of such attribute <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> in an RFC. There is no intention of segmenting the code space into public/private or IP/OSI or any other sectioning. As each attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> {{is in the process of}} being developed, it will use an octet value of 255, which will be reserved for this use. At the time an attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> is assigned a number by the IANA, the documetnation and code base will be updated to reflect the authorized attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> value. IANA maintained values will be published in the periodically updated Assigned Numbers RFC [6]. Requests for assignment of a new attribute <b>type</b> <b>code</b> should be sent to the IANA (IANA@IANA. ORG) with a subject that includes the phrase "BGP Attribute Type".

50|$|Beginning with System 1, Macintosh {{operating}} systems have attached <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> and creator codes {{as part of}} the file metadata. These four-character codes were designed to specify both the application that created the file (the creator code) and the specific type of the file (the <b>type</b> <b>code)</b> so that other applications could easily open and process the file data. However, while <b>type</b> and creator <b>codes</b> extended the flexibility of the system — a particular type of file was not restricted to opening in a particular application — they suffered many of the same problems as file extensions. <b>Type</b> and creator <b>codes</b> could be lost when files were transferred across non-Macintosh systems (such as Unix-based servers), and the plethora of <b>type</b> <b>codes</b> made identification problematic.|$|R
