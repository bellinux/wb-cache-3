Two amateur radio call signs, U1MIR and U2MIR, were assigned to Mir in the late 1980s, allowing amateur radio operators on Earth to communicate with the cosmonauts. The station was also equipped with a supply of books and films for the crew to read and watch.|$|E
5|$|The Irish Post Office {{has never}} publicised an <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> {{numbering}} {{system for the}} postage stamps they issued, so collectors use a stamp numbering system {{from one of the}} most popular stamp catalogues, such as Stanley Gibbons, Scott, MacDonnell Whyte, MDW (last edition 1991), Hibernian or Michel. There are differences between these numbering systems that result in a varying sequence of stamps in each listing, with some stamps included on some lists but not on others—usually varieties that the publishers think do not belong in a general catalogue. For instance, Ireland's first postage stamp, the 2d Map of Ireland, issued in 1922 is numbered 68 by Scott, 43 by Michel, D4 by Hibernian and MacDonnell Whyte and 74 by Stanley Gibbons.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} land related taxes, there were other taxes, such as Garden tax from {{compounds}} where, among others, plantain, coconut and arecanut palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well. Tree tax on trees such as palmyrah, margosa and iluppai and Poll tax equivalent to a personal tax from each. Professional tax was collected from members of each caste or guild and commercial taxes consisting of, among others, stamp duty on clothes (clothes could not be sold privately and had to have <b>official</b> <b>stamp),</b> Taraku or levy on items of food, and Port and customs duties. Columbuthurai, which connected the Peninsula with the mainland at Poonakari with its boat services, {{was one of the}} chief port, and there were customs check posts at the sand passes of Pachilaippalai. Elephants from the southern Sinhalese kingdoms and the Vanni region were brought to Jaffna to be sold to foreign buyers. They were shipped abroad from a bay called Urukathurai, which is now called Kayts—a shortened form of Portuguese Caes dos elephantess (Bay of Elephants). Perhaps a peculiarity of Jaffna was the levy of license fee for the cremation of the dead.|$|E

25|$|Recognition for the Belgian comics {{outside the}} fandom {{was slow to}} come, but in the 1970s more and more comics and authors got reviews and {{articles}} in newspapers and magazines. The first <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> picturing a comics hero was made in 1979, showing Tintin, and most famous Belgian comics followed in the next decades. Major expositions were organized from 1969 on, and finally the Belgian Centre for Comic Strip Art, commonly called the Comics Museum, was opened in Brussels in 1989 in an old warehouse designed by Victor Horta. It grew rapidly, with 160,000 visitors in 1994 and 240,000 by 2000. Different Belgian towns have mural paintings and statues of the major comics, {{and some of the}} most famous artists have been knighted.|$|E
25|$|By tradition, the Orthodox Church, {{when faced}} with issues that are larger than a single bishop can resolve, holds a local council. The bishops and such others as may attend convene (as St. Paul called the Corinthians to do) to seek {{the mind of the}} church. A council's {{declarations}} or edicts then reflect its consensus (if one can be found). An ecumencial council is only called for issues of such import or difficulty or pervasiveness that smaller councils are insufficient to address them. Ecumenical councils' declarations and canons carry binding weight by virtue of their representation across the whole church, by which the mind of the church can be readily seen. However, not all issues are so difficult as to require an ecumenical council to resolve. Some doctrines or decisions, not defined in a formal statement or proclaimed officially, nevertheless are held by the Church unshakably and unanimously without internal disturbance, and these, also reflecting the mind of the church, are just as firmly irrevocable as a formal declaration of an ecumenical council. Lack of formality does not imply lack of authority within Holy Tradition. An example of such unanimity {{can be found in the}} acceptance in the 5th century of the lists of books that comprise Holy Scripture, a true canon without <b>official</b> <b>stamp.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kodiak bear {{research}} and habitat protection is done cooperatively by the ADF and Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge. Bear hunting is {{managed by the}} ADF, and hunting regulations are established by the Alaska Board of Game. Currently, a finely tuned management system distributes hunters in 32 different areas during two seasons (spring: April 1 – May 15, and fall: October 25 – November 30). Each year, about 4,500 people apply for the 496 permits offered for Kodiak bear hunts (two-thirds to Alaska residents, one-third to nonresidents). Nonresidents are required to hire a registered guide who is authorized to hunt in a particular area, and this can cost from $10,000–$22,000. All hunters must come into the Alaska Department of Fish and Game office in Kodiak prior to going into the field for a brief orientation and must check out before they leave the island. Every bear that is legally killed on the archipelago must be inspected by an ADF wildlife biologist {{before it can be}} taken from the islands. Pelts receive a stamp from an ADF officer if the hunter and guide provide proper documentation to prove licensing. Pelts cannot be transported or legally preserved or sold without the <b>official</b> <b>stamp.</b> Hunting laws are strictly enforced by the ADF officers who often have the full support of the local community. Illegal hunting and fishing is frowned upon by the community which maintains a healthy respect for the island's environmental laws, as well. Stiff penalties accompany illegal hunting and fishing. The island's remote location makes trafficking in illegal pelts difficult for would-be poachers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the general issue of the Penny Black, a similar stamp intended for official mail was produced, with the letters [...] "V" [...] and [...] "R" [...] replacing the crosses in the top corners. Because the general public quickly accepted the postage stamps and ridiculed the Mulready stationery produced at the same time, vast supplies of Mulready letter sheets were given for official use to government departments such as the tax office {{and the idea of}} introducing an <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> was abandoned. Only a few postally used examples exist, which probably originate from the Post Office circulars sent out as advance notice of the new stamps. Four are known on covers; all were cut from their envelopes and then replaced. Most of the cancelled examples are from trials of cancellation types, inks, and experiments with their removal. Those trials led to the change from black to red stamps, and vice versa for the cancellations.|$|E
2500|$|... 60 Minutes alleged in 1997 that {{agents of}} the U.S. Customs Service ignored drug {{trafficking}} across the Mexico–United States border at San Diego. The only evidence was a memorandum apparently written by Rudy Camacho, who {{was the head of}} the San Diego branch office. Based on this memo, CBS alleged that Camacho had allowed trucks belonging to a particular firm to cross the border unimpeded. Mike Horner, a former Customs Service employee, had passed the memos on to 60 Minutes, and even provided a copy with an <b>official</b> <b>stamp.</b> Camacho was not consulted about the piece, and his career was devastated in the immediate term as his own department placed suspicion on him. In the end, it turned out that Horner had forged the documents as an act of revenge for his treatment within the Customs Service. Camacho sued CBS and settled for an undisclosed amount of money in damages. Hewitt was forced to issue an on-air retraction.|$|E

2500|$|In Germany, paintball is {{restricted}} to players over 18 years of age. Paintball markers are classified as weapons {{that do not require}} a license or permit; they are legal to buy and use, but restricted to adults. Markers are limited to a kinetic energy of 7.5 J. Tampering with the marker to increase muzzle velocity above 214 fps can lead to confiscation/destruction of the marker and a fine. All Paintball markers sold officially in Germany must be certified by the government [...] "Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt" [...] (PTB) (Federal Physical and Technical Institute) to operate within these limits and must have a registered serial number and an <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> on the firing mechanism.

2500|$|Stamp acts {{had been}} a very {{successful}} method of taxation within Great Britain; they generated over £100,000 in tax revenue with very little in collection expenses.

[...] Grenville had actually been presented with drafts of colonial stamp acts in September and October 1763, but the proposals lacked the specific knowledge of colonial affairs to adequately describe the documents subject to the stamp.

2500|$|On the {{referendum}} day, while the voting was underway, the Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey lifted {{a rule that}} required each ballot to have an <b>official</b> <b>stamp.</b> Instead, it ruled that ballots with no stamp would be considered valid, unless there was proof that they were fraudulent. It is stated that the mistake of the electoral board in the schools cannot cancel the constitutional right of voting of the citizens. The similar decisions {{have been made in}} the past, too. Because ballots have not only stamp but other security measures in place, it doesn't make them illegitimate. The Supreme Electoral Council filed a criminal complaint for the officials that caused the problem by not stamping the ballots.

CHP leader Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu said that lifting the rule violated Turkish law. According to Meral Akşener, [...] "No" [...] won by 52 percent.

2500|$|In 2012 the U.S. Department of Defense granted {{permission}} for military personnel to wear their uniforms while participating the San Diego Pride Parade. This {{was the first}} time that United States military personnel were permitted to wear their service uniforms in such a parade. The local Navy command had already approved the wearing of Navy uniforms, but the DOD decided to add their <b>official</b> <b>stamp</b> of approval [...] "since the event has garnered national media attention." [...] The Defense Department stressed that this was a one-time approval and applied only to this particular parade, based on their determination that the event was a non-political civic event. Military members are generally permitted to participate in parades if the parade is nonpolitical, patriotic in nature, and a civic event, but they need specific permission to wear their uniforms at such an event. The DOD directive stated, [...] "Based on our current knowledge of the event and existing policies, we hereby are granting approval for servicemembers in uniform to participate in this year's parade, provided servicemembers participate in their personal capacity and ensure the adherence to military service standards of appearance and wear of the military uniform." [...] Two Republican congressmen objected to the decision, saying that the parade was political in nature, but organizers said it was not political, pointing out that both of San Diego's mayoral candidates marched in the parade, even though one is a conservative Republican and the other is a liberal Democrat.|$|E
