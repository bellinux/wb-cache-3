5|$|In the 1850s, {{the process}} to distill {{kerosene}} from petroleum was invented by Abraham Gesner. The demand for the petroleum as a fuel for lighting around the world quickly grew. Petroleum exploration developed in many parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> the Russian Empire, particularly the Branobel company in Azerbaijan, taking the lead in production {{by the end of}} the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common cause of primary hypothyroidism and endemic goiter worldwide. In areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> sufficient dietary iodine, hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis). Hashimoto's may be associated with a goiter. It is characterized by infiltration of the thyroid gland with T lymphocytes and autoantibodies against specific thyroid antigens such as thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin and the TSH receptor.|$|E

5|$|There {{are about}} 2,000 species of antlion {{found in most}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>with</b> the {{greatest}} diversity being in warmer areas. The best known species are those in which the larvae dig pits to trap their prey, {{but by no means}} do all species do this. Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including open woodland floors, scrub-clad dunes, hedge bases, river banks, road verges, under raised buildings and in vacant lots.|$|E
5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that circumcision {{reduces the risk of}} men acquiring HIV infection in areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> high rates of HIV. Evidence among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa shows an absolute decrease in risk of 1.8% which is a relative decrease of between 38percent and 66percent over twoyears, and in this population studies rate it cost effective. Whether it is of benefit in developed countries is undetermined.|$|E

5|$|Crickets have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, being {{found in all}} parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South. They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity. The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations, such as in Malaysia, where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur. A greater number than {{this could have been}} present because some species are mute.|$|E

5|$|Hybridisation {{between the}} Eurasian tree sparrow {{and the house}} sparrow has been {{recorded}} in many parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> male hybrids tending to resemble the Eurasian tree sparrow while females have more similarities with the house sparrow. A breeding population in the Eastern Ghats of India, said to be introduced, may also hybridise with house sparrows. On at least one occasion a mixed pair has resulted in fertile young. A wild hybridisation with the resident sparrows of Malta, which are intermediate between the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis) and Italian sparrows (P. italiae), was recorded in Malta in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Transmission {{may occur}} via {{consumption}} of contaminated water, or when people share personal objects. In places with {{wet and dry}} seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates with the time of outbreaks. In areas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>with</b> four seasons, infections are {{more common in the}} winter. Bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, in crowded households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others may occur {{in a wide variety of}} animals (such as Giardia).|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 289,000 women (800 per day) in {{the world}} died due to pregnancy-related causes, with large {{differences}} between developed and developing countries. Maternal mortality in western nations had been steadily falling, and forms the subject of annual reports and reviews. Yet, between 1987 and 2011, maternal mortality in the United States rose from 7.2 to 17.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, this {{is reflected in the}} Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR). By contrast rates as high as 1,000 per birth are reported in the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>with</b> the highest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, which account for 86% of such deaths. These deaths are rarely investigated, yet the World Health Organization considers that 99% of these deaths, the majority of which occur within 24 hours of childbirth, are preventable if the appropriate infrastructure, training, and facilities were in place. In these resource-poor countries, maternal health is further eroded by poverty and adverse economic factors which impact the roads, health care facilities, equipment and supplies in addition to limited skilled personnel. Other problems include cultural attitudes towards sexuality, contraception, child marriage, home birth and the ability to recognise medical emergencies. The direct causes of these maternal deaths are hemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labor, sepsis and unskilled abortion. In addition malaria and AIDS complicate pregnancy. In the period 2003–2009 hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, accounting for 27% of deaths in developing countries and 16% in developed countries.|$|E

5|$|The protagonist is Rush Sykes, an 18-year-old Mitra {{boy from}} a {{peaceful}} island.
