5000|$|The Court of Appeals, in {{an opinion}} {{authored}} by Judge Thorne, affirmed the trial court's granting of summary judgement on a partition of jointly owned real property and denial of claims for [...] "owelty." [...] Two unmarried cohabitants jointly owned {{a home that}} was subject to a mortgage in both names. The woman sought to have the property sold and the man opposed. The trial court determined that because the home could not be equitably partitioned {{that it would be}} sold and the net proceeds divided equally. The man sought additional amounts for <b>owelty</b> which was dined by the trial court. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order that the property would be sold by recognizing that in a partition action one available remedy is the sale of the real property when physical division of the real property cannot be accomplished without great prejudice to the owners. The Court noted that the trial court determined that zoning restrictions would not allow actually partition and thus the oder for sale as appropriate. http://www.utcourts.gov/opinions/appopin/withers011311.pdf ...|$|E
