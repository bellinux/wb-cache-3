40|$|The {{application}} of reinforcement learning to multiagent systems has attracted recent attention. In a multi-agent environment, whether one agent's action {{is good or}} not depends on the other agents' actions. In traditional reinforcement learning methods, which assume stationary environments, {{it is hard to}} take account of the <b>other</b> <b>agent's</b> actions which may change due to learning. In this article, we consider a twoagent cooperation problem, and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method based on estimation of the <b>other</b> <b>agent's</b> actions. In our learning method, one <b>agent</b> estimates the <b>other</b> <b>agent's</b> action based on the internal model of the <b>other</b> <b>agent.</b> The internal model is acquired by the observation of the <b>other</b> <b>agent's</b> actions.

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} common {{applications}} of human intelligence is so-cial interaction, where people must make effective decisions despite uncertainty about the potential behavior of others around them. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides one method for agents to acquire knowledge about such interactions. We investigate different methods of multiagent reinforcement learning within the Sigma cognitive architecture. We leverage Sigma’s architectural mechanism for gradient descent to realize four different approaches to multiagent learning: (1) with no explicit model of the <b>other</b> <b>agent,</b> (2) with a model of the <b>other</b> <b>agent</b> as following an unknown stationary policy, (3) with prior knowledge of the <b>other</b> <b>agent’s</b> possible reward functions, and (4) through inverse reinforcement learn-ing (IRL) of the <b>other</b> <b>agent’s</b> reward function. While the first three variations re-create existing approaches from the literature, the fourth represents a novel combination of RL and IRL for social decision-making. We show how all four styles of adaptive Theory of Mind are realized through Sigma’s same gradient descent algorithm, and we illustrate their behavior within an abstract negotiation task. ...|$|R

If one agent becomes more risk averse, then the equilibrium allocation moves towards that agent’s certainty line.

If there are competing offers for the same guide in a particular region, the highest offer receives all of that region's diamonds in an all-pay auction. Competing agents can be bribed to reveal inside information regarding the competitor's decisions. Complicating matters further is the UN inspector, who moves at random between regions on each turn. The inspector blocks all diamond extraction from the region in which he is present, and can confiscate diamonds from agents within that region. Like <b>other</b> <b>agents</b> though, the inspector can be bribed and directed to regions of a player's choice.|$|E
5|$|The mirror neuron system (MNS) theory hypothesizes that {{alterations}} to {{the development}} of the MNS interfere with imitation and lead to Asperger's core feature of social impairment. For example, one study found that activation is delayed in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with AS. This theory maps well to social cognition theories like the theory of mind, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from impairments in ascribing mental states to oneself and others, or hyper-systemizing, which hypothesizes that autistic individuals can systematize internal operation to handle internal events but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by <b>other</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|E

40|$|Two mobile agents, {{starting}} at arbitrary, possibly different times from arbitrary {{locations in the}} plane, have to meet. Agents are modeled as discs of diameter 1, and meeting occurs when these discs touch. Agents have different labels which are integers from the set of 0 to L- 1. Each agent knows L and knows its own label, but not the label of the <b>other</b> <b>agent.</b> Agents are equipped with compasses and have synchronized clocks. They make a series of moves. Each move specifies the direction and the duration of moving. This includes a null move which consists in staying inert for some time, or forever. In a non-null move agents travel at the same constant speed, normalized to 1. We assume that agents have sensors enabling them to estimate {{the distance from the}} <b>other</b> <b>agent</b> (defined as the distance between centers of discs), but not the direction towards it. We consider two models of estimation. In both models an agent reads its sensor at the moment of its appearance in the plane and then {{at the end of each}} move. This reading (together with the previous ones) determines the decision concerning the next move. In both models the reading of the sensor tells the <b>agent</b> if the <b>other</b> <b>agent</b> is already present. Moreover, in the monotone model, each agent can find out, for any two readings in moments t 1 and t 2, whether the distance from the <b>other</b> <b>agent</b> at time t 1 was smaller, equal or larger than at time t 2. In the weaker binary model, each agent can find out, at any reading, whether it is at distance less than h̊o̊ or at distance at least h̊o̊ from the <b>other</b> <b>agent,</b> for some real h̊o̊ > 1 unknown to them. Such distance estimation mechanism can be implemented, e. g., using chemical sensors. Each agent emits some chemical substance (scent), and the sensor of the <b>other</b> <b>agent</b> detects it, i. e., sniffs. The intensity of the scent decreases with the distance.

Sports agents Andrew Joel and Dave Lowman claimed Vick signed a {{contract}} with their firm in 2001, nine days before he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech early and declaring himself eligible for the NFL Draft. With his mother as a witness, Vick signed a five-year marketing agreement that anticipated a wide range of endorsement activities using Vick's name, likeness, voice, and reputation. Joel's cut was 25% of all deals, excluding Vick's NFL contract, according to the agreement. Vick attempted to end the relationship with Joel Enterprises a few weeks later, and entered into another relationship with <b>other</b> <b>agents.</b> In 2005, Joel Enterprises sued Vick in Richmond Circuit Court for $45 million in compensatory and punitive damages for breach of contract. After the Virginia Supreme Court denied a Vick motion and ruled that the civil trial could proceed in December 2006, the parties agreed to submit the dispute to binding arbitration for resolution instead of a formal civil court trial. The outcome of the case was an award of $4.5 million to Joel.|$|E

40|$|Recognition of <b>other</b> <b>agent</b> {{intention}} in a multi-agent {{environment is}} a very important issue to realize social activities, for example, imita-tion learning, understanding intention, cooper-ative/competitive behavior, and so on. Con-ventional approaches to infer the <b>other</b> <b>agent</b> intention need a precise trajectory in Carte-sian or joint space that is sometimes hard to measure from the viewpoint of an observer. It is also difficult to estimate a same intention but with different realizations because they try to match just a certain trajectory during the trial. We propose a novel method of infer-ence of <b>other</b> <b>agent’s</b> intention based on state value estimation. The method does not need a precise world model or coordination transfor-mation system to deal with view dependency. This paper shows an observer can infer an in-tention of other not by precise object trajectory in Cartesian space but by estimated state value transition during the observed behavior. ...|$|R
