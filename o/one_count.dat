5|$|In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez {{pleaded guilty}} to <b>one</b> <b>count</b> of {{property}} destruction and <b>one</b> <b>count</b> of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence, thereby avoiding the charge of attempting to assassinate the President. In March 2014, {{he was sentenced to}} 25 years' imprisonment. In September 2014, The Washington Post published an investigative report detailing errors that the Secret Service made {{on the night of the}} shooting that led to the crime going undiscovered. A House of Representatives hearing followed and Julia Pierson, director of the Secret Service, resigned the following week. It was the first shooting at the White House since Francisco Martin Duran's attempted assassination of President Bill Clinton in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including <b>one</b> <b>count</b> of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only <b>one</b> <b>count</b> of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E

About MOP 252 million of his assets in Macau were seized. Ao decided not to appeal. There were concerns voiced in the Macau media that Ao was the fall-guy, as most Macanese were sceptical that corruption on such a scale could take place without anyone else knowing or being involved. During his trial, Ao hinted that contacts valued at in excess of 6 million Patacas required the approval of his superior in government, Edmond Ho.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{launched an}} investigation {{to determine if}} he had acted out of hatred for Obama. Writings by Ortega-Hernandez and testimonies from {{those who knew him}} revealed that he believed that he was Jesus, and that President Obama was the Antichrist and the devil. Ortega-Hernandez was not found to be affiliated with any extremist groups. In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez pled guilty to two of the nineteen charges against him: <b>one</b> <b>count</b> of destruction of property and <b>one</b> <b>count</b> of discharging a firearm during a crime of violence. As part of his plea bargain, the remaining charges were dropped, including the charge of attempting to assassinate the President, which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. On March 31, 2014, Ortega-Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. His lawyers had asked for a 10-year sentence, stating Ortega-Hernandez was suffering from depression and stress. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum sentence of 27½ years. He is serving his sentence at United States Penitentiary, Beaumont, with a release date of October 24, 2033.|$|E
