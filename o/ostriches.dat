5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the <b>ostriches</b> in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the <b>ostriches</b> play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The <b>ostriches</b> were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} liked animals, {{and their}} menagerie included dogs, cats, birds, raccoons, opossums, rabbits, a Shetland pony and a parrot. The children once used their animals {{to conduct a}} circus {{on the grounds of}} the Governor's Mansion. Hogg charged each visitor five cents, but was forced to return the money when her father discovered the scheme. In later years, the family added a bear, a horse, a fawn, cockatoos, and two <b>ostriches</b> named Jack and Jill to their collection of animals. In response to a challenge from her brothers, Hogg once mounted one of the <b>ostriches,</b> but was thrown from its back after one of the boys hit it with a slingshot. Ima and her <b>ostriches</b> later became the protagonists of a picture book, Ima & the Great Texas Ostrich Race, by Margaret Olivia McManis and Bruce Dupree.|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice the hawk sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild <b>ostriches</b> in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because <b>ostriches</b> are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the <b>ostriches</b> present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
50|$|The South African <b>ostrich</b> (Struthio camelus australis), {{also known}} as the black-necked <b>ostrich,</b> Cape <b>ostrich</b> or {{southern}} <b>ostrich</b> is a subspecies of the common <b>ostrich</b> endemic to Southern Africa. It is widely farmed for its meat, eggs and feathers.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, fashion {{has driven}} {{the demand for}} <b>ostrich</b> leather. Fashion houses {{successfully}} used <b>ostrich</b> leather in handbags for many years. Most designer brands {{have at least one}} purse made with <b>ostrich</b> leather. Footwear is another way in which designers showcase the material. But, by far the most widely used application is for <b>ostrich</b> leather boots. Just about every bootmaker uses <b>ostrich</b> and the demand for <b>ostrich</b> boots is higher than any other <b>ostrich</b> leather product. Belts are another major accessory that utilize <b>ostrich</b> leather (most <b>ostrich</b> boots are purchased with a matching <b>ostrich</b> belt). Of course there are other uses for <b>ostrich</b> leather notably shoes, wallets and jackets. The cost for most items is usually between $500 to $5000; handbags and jackets are highest priced due to the sheer amount of leather used.|$|R
50|$|The Masai <b>ostrich</b> (Struthio camelus massaicus), {{also known}} as the pink-necked <b>ostrich</b> or East African <b>ostrich,</b> is a large {{subspecies}} of the common <b>ostrich</b> native to East Africa. Today it is farmed for eggs, meat and feathers.|$|R
5|$|The {{park has}} a large and diverse {{wildlife}} population. Species found in the park include Cape buffaloes, baboons, eastern black rhinos, gazelles, zebras, Tanzanian cheetahs, Coke's hartebeest, hippopotami, leopards, East African lions, elands, impala, Masai giraffes, <b>ostriches,</b> vultures and waterbucks.|$|E

A comic ballet in four sections: Madame Upanova and her <b>ostriches</b> (Morning); Hyacinth Hippo and her {{servants}} (Afternoon); Elephanchine and her bubble-blowing elephant troupe (Evening); and Ben Ali Gator and his {{troop of}} alligators (Night). The finale finds {{all of the}} characters dancing together until their palace collapses.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger {{created a}} new family for the genus Didus. He named the family Inepti, and in it {{included}} only Didus ineptus, now a synonym of Raphus cucullatus. Illiger concluded that the dodo was related to <b>ostriches</b> and rheas, and so placed Inepti in the order Rasores, as the sister family to Gallinacei, Epollicati (a defunct group including Turnix and Syrrhaptes), Columbini , and Crypturi.|$|E
50|$|The North African <b>ostrich</b> or red-necked <b>ostrich</b> (Struthio camelus camelus), {{also known}} as the Barbary <b>ostrich,</b> is the {{nominate}} subspecies of the common <b>ostrich</b> from West and North Africa. It is the largest subspecies, making it the largest living bird.|$|R
5000|$|Black <b>ostrich</b> {{feathers}} {{come from}} the male <b>ostrich</b> and are very soft with feathers that are more [...] "stringy" [...] in nature. Gray <b>ostrich</b> feathers are more stark than the black feathers and are often sold at grocery stores. Floss <b>ostrich</b> feathers are the most soft and delicate feathers and come from underneath the bird's wings. Floss <b>ostrich</b> feathers are more expensive. Chick feathers are more pointed and stark than <b>ostrich</b> feathers, are usually sold at very low prices.|$|R
50|$|One adult <b>ostrich</b> {{can provide}} around 100 kilos of red meat, {{which can be}} sold for 400-500 pesos (US$8-11 as of January 2014) per kilo. <b>Ostrich</b> eggs, skin and {{feathers}} had also been sold to the market. <b>Ostrich</b> feathers are used to produce feather dusters and as decorations, while <b>ostrich</b> skin is used to produce leather. Eggs cost 500 pesos (US$11) apiece, providing to one <b>ostrich</b> farming business an annual income of 50,000 pesos (US$1,100) per adult female, because a mother <b>ostrich</b> can lay about 100 eggs annually.|$|R
5|$|Emus {{can suffer}} from both {{external}} and internal parasites, but under farmed conditions are more parasite-free than <b>ostriches</b> or rheas. External parasites include the louse Dahlemhornia asymmetrica and various other lice, ticks, mites and flies. Chicks sometimes suffer from intestinal tract infections caused by coccidian protozoa, and the nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis infects the emu {{as well as a}} wide range of other birds, causing haemorrhagic diarrhoea. Other nematodes are found in the trachea and bronchi; Syngamus trachea causing haemorrhagic tracheitis and Cyathostoma variegatum causing serious respiratory problems in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|So far, no fossil of Plateosaurus {{has been}} found with gastroliths (gizzard stones) in the stomach area. The old, widely cited idea that all large dinosaurs, implicitly also Plateosaurus, {{swallowed}} gastroliths to digest food because of their relatively limited {{ability to deal with}} food orally has been refuted by a study on gastrolith abundance, weight, and surface structure in fossils compared to alligators and <b>ostriches</b> by Oliver Wings. The use of gastroliths for digestion seems to have developed on the line from basal theropods to birds, with a parallel development in Psittacosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Dio and Martial record some of {{the animals}} that were exhibited. Dio notes a hunt {{involving}} cranes and another involving four elephants, and Martial mentions elephants, lions, leopards, at least one tiger, hares, pigs, bulls, bears, wild boar, a rhinoceros, buffalo and bison (most likely the wisent). Other exotic animals {{may have been used}} but are not mentioned; <b>ostriches,</b> camels and crocodiles were commonly used in the games. Giraffes are unlikely to have been featured; Julius Caesar had brought a single giraffe to Rome in 46 BC. Another is not recorded in Europe until the Medici giraffe in 1486, although they were first seen in Rome in 58 BC, and were impressive enough to be detailed in the games of Augustus and Commodus, {{there is no mention of}} hippopotami at Titus' games.|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{processed}} products, chopped hams (0. 15 % and 0. 30 % phosphate on final yield) and viennas (27 and 32 % fat extension) were manufactured from <b>ostrich</b> fan fillets (M. iliofibularis) {{to determine the}} suitability of <b>ostrich</b> meat for processing purposes. Cooking losses differed significantly (P 0. 10) between {{the two types of}} <b>ostrich</b> viennas. Colour evaluation (L*,a*,b*) of the fresh <b>ostrich</b> meat and processed <b>ostrich</b> products (chopped hams and viennas) indicated significant differences between the different types of viennas. Chemical composition (moisture, ash, protein and fat content) of the <b>ostrich</b> meat, processed <b>ostrich</b> products and similar types of commercially available products suggested that processed <b>ostrich</b> products can be formulated to compete successfully with similar types of products derived from other meat species. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

5000|$|The {{business}} of <b>ostrich</b> farming in the Philippines {{began in the}} Philippines in 1996. It was started by Lorenzo U. Limketkai, an engineer, and his son Heintje Limketkai. Heintje Limketkai took a month-long training course on <b>ostrich</b> farming in Australia. After that training, the Limketkais established their <b>ostrich</b> farming business and named it as the Philippine <b>Ostrich</b> and Crocodile Farms, Inc., becoming the first combined <b>ostrich</b> and crocodile farm in the country.|$|R

5|$|Gallimimus are {{featured}} in a stampede scene where {{one of them is}} devoured by the Tyrannosaurus. The Gallimimus was the first dinosaur to receive a digital version, being featured in two ILM tests, first as a herd of skeletons and then fully skinned while pursued by the T. rex. Its design was based on <b>ostriches,</b> and to emphasize the birdlike qualities, the animation focused mostly on the herd rather than individual animals. As reference for the dinosaurs' run, the animators were filmed running at the ILM parking lot, with plastic pipes standing in as the tree that the Gallimimus jump over. The footage even inspired to incorporate an animal falling in its leap as one of the artists crashed making the jump. Horse squeals became the Gallimimus sounds.|$|E
5|$|In the Quadrigae Tyrannorum (Four tyrants: The Lives of Firmus, Saturninus, Proculus and Bonosus), {{the author}} {{includes}} Firmus, {{said to have}} been a usurper in Egypt under Aurelian. There is no certainty that this person ever existed; however, there was a Corrector named Claudius Firmus stationed in Egypt in 274, about the time Zosimus states that Aurelian was dealing with some trouble in that province. Nevertheless, the History's wealth of detail about him is considered to be completely invented. For example, he would eat an ostrich a day, he had a carriage drawn by <b>ostriches,</b> he would swim among crocodiles, he built himself a house fitted with square panels of glass.|$|E
5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and <b>ostriches,</b> which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E

5000|$|Edward III {{occasionally}} used <b>ostrich</b> feather badges, as {{did other}} {{members of the royal family}} in the 14th and 15th centuries. The Black Prince's younger brother, John of Gaunt, used <b>ostrich</b> feathers in several contexts, including on a very similar coat of arms to Edward's [...] "shield for peace", although here the feathers were ermine. Edward's illegitimate son, Sir Roger de Clarendon, bore arms of Or, on a black bend, three <b>ostrich</b> feathers argent; and his legitimate son, King Richard II, used <b>ostrich</b> feather badges in several colours. Henry IV used a badge of a single <b>ostrich</b> feather with a scroll entwined around it bearing the motto [...] "Ma sovereyne" [...] or [...] "Sovereygne"; and, of Henry's sons, Henry V used <b>ostrich</b> feathers as a secondary royal badge at various times, Thomas, Duke of Clarence used an ermine <b>ostrich</b> feather labelled; John, Duke of Bedford an <b>ostrich</b> feather with the [...] "Sovereygne" [...] scroll; and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester an <b>ostrich</b> feather studded with fleurs-de-lis. Similar badges were used by other royal princes.|$|R
5|$|The Eastern Han general Ban Chao (32–102 AD), in {{a series}} of {{military}} successes which brought the Western Regions (the Tarim Basin of Xinjiang) back under Chinese control and suzerainty, defeated the Da Yuezhi in 90 AD and the Northern Xiongnu in 91 AD, forcing the submission of city-states such as Kucha and Turfan, Khotan and Kashgar (Indo-European Tocharian and Saka settlements, respectively), and finally Karasahr in 94 AD. An embassy from the Parthian Empire of Persia and Mesopotamia had earlier arrived at the Han court in 89 AD and, while Ban was stationed with his army in Khotan, another Parthian embassy came in 101 AD, this time bringing exotic gifts such as <b>ostriches.</b>|$|E
5|$|The film faced similar {{censorship}} {{problems for}} its theatrical release in the United Kingdom, {{where it was}} released as Zumbalah. In 1976, nearly 10 minutes were cut before it was passed with an X-rating by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Various scenes of animal cruelty, a race between cheetahs and <b>ostriches,</b> the lion attack, and the mercenaries' hunt of Amazonian natives were all cut from the British release. The scenes of animal cruelty were targeted by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) to be cut from the film, specifically the hunt and disembowelment of a puma. Also in 1976, the Valtion elokuvatarkastamo, the Finnish film classification board, banned the film in Finland in its entirety {{for the inclusion of}} scenes of genuine human death.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{established}} a diplomatic {{presence in the}} Tarim Basin of Central Asia during Emperor Wu of Han's reign (141–87 BC). Han envoys brought gifts of sheep, gold, and silk to the urban oasis city-states. The Chinese sometimes used gold as currency; however, silk was favored {{as a means to}} pay for food and lodging. Once the Han had subjugated the Tarim Basin and {{established a}} Protectorate there, Han envoys in these states were given free food and lodging. These envoys were required to send tributary items of furs, precious stones, and delicacies such as Central Asian raisins to the Han court. The Arsacid court sent exotic animals including lions and <b>ostriches</b> to the Han court, and a king ruling in what is now Burma sent elephants and rhinoceroses. Han diplomatic missions to royal courts across Asia were usually accompanied by trade caravans which earned substantial profits.|$|E

5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the thumb and index finger (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably <b>ostriches,</b> emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that several individuals would gather eggs in a single nest, and arrange them so they could be protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as <b>ostriches</b> and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had pygostyles on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|An {{examination}} of a hunting tradition in northern Europe follows, where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game, such as rabbits and pheasants. Further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted, {{this time with}} cheetahs. To demonstrate the cheetah's speed and effectiveness, a chase between a group of cheetahs and <b>ostriches</b> is arranged, in which the birds are hunted down and killed. The next animal collaborators are dogs, which hunt wild boar in Patagonia and a puma which has attacked a herd of sheep and a shepherd. In cities, however, stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers, which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active, but the prey has changed. Indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys, but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the Indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development. In one such instance, mercenaries retaliate against a death of a workman by hunting down a group of Indios, one of which they torture, castrate and murder. Various scenes of wildlife are then shown, after which orangutans are hunted {{to be sold to}} zoos. The film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between Erik Zimen, an ecologist, and wolves, the group of animals he wishes to save.|$|E
50|$|Aside from fashion designers, the {{automotive}} industry is a heavy user of <b>ostrich</b> leather. Car seats, dashboards, motorcycle seats, and door panels can all be covered or accented with <b>ostrich</b> leather. Most after market car and motorcycle shops can alter seats by applying <b>ostrich</b> leather as seat inserts. Many luxury car manufacturers offer <b>ostrich</b> leather seats from the factory. This practice is especially popular in European countries.|$|R
